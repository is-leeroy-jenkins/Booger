            ``(4) Forbearance.--Section 10 of the

        apply to any person or entity that exceeds the 39

    (b) The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and 
Explosives shall include in all such data releases, language 
similar to the following that would make clear that trace data 
cannot be used to draw broad conclusions about firearms-related 
crime:
            (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law 
        enforcement authorities in conducting investigations by 
        tracking the sale and possession of specific firearms. 
        Law enforcement agencies may request firearms traces 
        for any reason, and those reasons are not necessarily 
        reported to the Federal Government. Not all firearms 
        used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced 
        are used in crime.
            (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen 
        for purposes of determining which types, makes or 
        models of firearms are used for illicit purposes. The 
        firearms selected do not constitute a random sample and 
        should not be considered representative of the larger 
        universe of all firearms used by criminals, or any 
        subset of that universe. Firearms are normally traced 
        to the first retail seller, and sources reported for 
        firearms traced do not necessarily represent the 
        sources or methods by which firearms in general are 
        acquired for use in crime.
    Sec. 631. Section 503(f) of the Small Business Investment 
Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 697(f)) shall be amended by substituting

subsection.
    Sec. 632. In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated in 
this Act, the unobligated balances previously made available by

7(a) of the Small Business Act.
    Sec. 633. (a) There is established in the Treasury of the 
United States a trust fund to be known as the International 
Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue Trust Fund. The 
income from the fund shall be used for operations of the 
International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue to 
promote dialogue and scholarship in the Middle East. The fund 
may accept contributions and gifts from public and private 
sources.
    (b) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury 
to invest in full amounts made available to the fund. Such 
investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of 
the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both 
principal and interest by the United States. The interest on, 
and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any 
obligations held in the fund shall be credited to and form a 
part of the fund and shall remain available without fiscal year 
limitation.
    (c) For each fiscal year, there is authorized to be 
appropriated from the fund for the operations of the 
International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue the 
total amount of the interest and earnings credited to the fund 
under subsection (b).
    (d) There are authorized to be appropriated to the 
International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue Trust 
Fund, without fiscal year limitation, such sums as may be 
necessary to carry out the provisions of this section and to

Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue established under 
this section.
    (e) The United States, through the Department of State, 
shall retain ownership of the Palazzo Corpi building in

responsible for maintaining the International Center for Middle 
Eastern-Western Dialogue at such location.

amended by inserting after ``(58) Inmates' fund, workhouse and 
reformatory, District of Columbia.'' the following new

be used to pay expenses for any United States delegation to the 
United Nations Human Rights Commission if such commission is 
chaired or presided over by a country, the government of which 
the Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of section 
6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. 
App. 2405(j)(1)), has repeatedly provided support for acts of 
international terrorism.
    Sec. 636. None of the funds made available in this Act may 
be used in violation of section 212(a)(10)(C) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act.
    Sec. 637. (a) This section may be cited as the ``HELP 
Commission Act''.
    (b)(1) The Congress finds that, despite the long-standing 
efforts and resources of the United States dedicated to helping 
needy people around the world, despair remains and in many 
areas is growing.
    (2) Therefore, a commission should be established to bring 
together the best minds associated with development and 
humanitarian assistance to make a comprehensive review of--
            (A) policy decisions, including why certain 
        development projects are funded and others are not, 
        successes, and best practices, including their 
        applicability to other existing programs and projects;
            (B) delivery obstacles, including the roles of 
        United States agencies and other governmental and 
        nongovernmental organizations;
            (C) methodology, including whether the delivery of 
        United States development assistance always represents 
        best practices and whether it can be improved; and
            (D) results, including measuring improvements in 
        human capacity instead of in purely economic terms.
    (3) An examination of these issues should present new 
approaches and ideas to ensure that United States development 
assistance reaches and benefits its intended recipients.
    (c)(1) There is established the Helping to Enhance the 
Livelihood of People (HELP) Around the Globe Commission (in 
this section referred to as the ``Commission'').
    (2) The Commission shall--
            (A) identify the past and present objectives of 
        United States development assistance, identify cases in 
        which those objectives have been met, identify the 
        beneficiaries of such assistance, and what percentage 
        of the funds provided actually reached the intended 
        beneficiaries;
            (B) identify cases in which United States 
        development assistance has been most successful, and 
        analyze how such successes may be transferable to other 
        countries or areas;
            (C) study ways to expand educational opportunities 
        and investments in people, and assess infrastructure 
        needs;
            (D) analyze how the United States could place 
        conditions on governments in countries receiving United 
        States development assistance, in light of and 
        notwithstanding the objectives of the Millennium 
        Challenge Account;
            (E) analyze ways in which the United States can 
        coordinate its development assistance programs with 
        those of other donor countries and international 
        organizations;
            (F) analyze ways in which the safety of development 
        assistance workers can be ensured, particularly in the 
        midst of conflicts;
            (G) compare the effectiveness of increased and open 
        trade with development assistance, and analyze the 
        advantages and disadvantages of such trade and whether 
        such trade could be a more effective alternative to 
        United States development assistance;
            (H) analyze ways in which the United States can 
        strengthen the capacity of indigenous nongovernmental 
        organizations to be more effective in grassroots 
        development;
            (I) analyze ways in which decisions on providing 
        development assistance can involve more of the people 
        of the recipient countries;
            (J) analyze ways in which results can be measured 
        if United States development assistance is targeted to 
        the least developed countries;
            (K) recommend standards that should be set for 
        ``graduating'' recipient countries from United States 
        development assistance;
            (L) analyze whether United States development 
        assistance should be used as a means to achieve United 
        States foreign policy objectives;
            (M) analyze how the United States can evaluate the 
        performance of its development assistance programs not 
        only against economic indicators, but in other ways, 
        including how to measure the success of United States 
        development assistance in democratization efforts; and 
        evaluate the existing foreign assistance framework to 
        ascertain the degree of coordination, or lack thereof, 
        of the disparate foreign development programs as 
        administered by the various Federal agencies, to 
        identify and assess the redundancies of programs and 
        organizational structures engaged in foreign 
        assistance, and to recommend revisions to authorizing 
        legislation for foreign assistance that would seek to 
        reconcile competing foreign policy and foreign aid 
        goals; and
            (N) study any other areas that the Commission 
        considers necessary relating to United States 
        development assistance.
    (d)(1) The Commission shall be composed of 21 members as

Rationalization. Section 313 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), as 
amended, is further amended by adding at the end thereof the 
following:
    ``(j) Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Crab 
Rationalization.--
            ``(1) By not later than January 1, 2005, the 
        Secretary shall approve and hereafter implement by 
        regulation the Voluntary Three-Pie Cooperative Program 
        for crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian 
        Islands approved by the North Pacific Fishery 
        Management Council between June 2002 and April 2003, 
        and all trailing amendments including those reported to 
        Congress on May 6, 2003. This section shall not 
        preclude the Secretary from approving by January 1, 
        2005, and implementing any subsequent program 
        amendments approved by the Council.
            ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
        Act, in carrying out paragraph (1) the Secretary shall 
        approve all parts of the Program referred to in such 
        paragraph. Further, no part of such Program may be 
        implemented if, as approved by the North Pacific 
        Fishery Management Council, individual fishing quotas, 
        processing quotas, community development quota 
        allocation, voluntary cooperatives, binding 
        arbitration, regional landing and processing 
        requirements, community protections, economic data 
        collection, or the loan program for crab fishing vessel 
        captains and crew members, is invalidated subject to a 
        judicial determination not subject to judicial appeal. 
        If the Secretary determines that a processor has 
        leveraged its Individual Processor Quota shares to 
        acquire a harvesters open-delivery ``B shares'', the 
        processor's Individual Processor Quota shares shall be 
        forfeited.
            ``(3) Subsequent to implementation pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), the Council may submit and the Secretary 
        may implement changes to or repeal of conservation and 
        management measures, including measures authorized in 
        this section, for crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and 
        Aleutian Islands in accordance with applicable law, 
        including this Act as amended by this subsection, to 
        achieve on a continuing basis the purposes identified 
        by the Council.
            ``(4) The loan program referred to in paragraph (2)

           TITLE III--DC SCHOOL CHOICE INCENTIVE ACT OF 2003

SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``DC School Choice Incentive 
Act of 2003''.

SEC. 302. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for 
        their children, including the educational setting that 
        will best serve the interests and educational needs of 
        their child.
            (2) For many parents in the District of Columbia, 
        public school choice provided for under the No Child 
        Left Behind Act of 2001 as well as under other public 
        school choice programs, is inadequate due to capacity 
        constraints. Available educational alternatives to the 
        public schools are insufficient and more educational 
        options are needed. In particular, funds are needed to 
        assist low-income parents to exercise choice among 
        enhanced public opportunities and private educational 
        environments, whether religious or nonreligious. 
        Therefore, in keeping with the spirit of the No Child 
        Left Behind Act of 2001, school choice options, in 
        addition to those already available to parents in the 
        District of Columbia (such as magnet and charter 
        schools and open enrollment schools) should be made 
        available to those parents.
            (3) In the most recent mathematics assessment on 
        the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 
        administered in 2000, a lower percentage of 4th-grade 
        students in the District of Columbia demonstrated 
        proficiency than was the case for any State. Seventy-
        six percent of the District of Columbia fourth-graders 
        scored at the ``below basic'' level and of the 8th-
        grade students in the District of Columbia, only 6 
        percent of the students tested at the proficient or 
        advanced levels, and 77 percent were below basic. In 
        the most recent NAEP reading assessment, in 1998, only 
        10 percent of the District of Columbia fourth-graders 
        could read proficiently, while 72 percent were below 
        basic. At the 8th-grade level, 12 percent were 
        proficient or advanced and 56 percent were below basic.
            (4) A program enacted for the valid secular purpose 
        of providing educational assistance to low-income 
        children in a demonstrably failing public school system 
        is constitutional under Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 
        U.S. 639 (2002), if it is neutral with respect to 
        religion and provides assistance to a broad class of 
        citizens who direct government aid to religious and 
        secular schools solely as a result of their genuine and 
        independent private choices.
            (5) The Mayor of the District of Columbia, the 
        Chairman of the Education Committee of the City Council 
        of the District of Columbia, and the President of the 
        District of Columbia Board of Education support this 
        title.
            (6) This title provides additional money for the 
        District of Columbia public schools and therefore money 
        for scholarships is not being taken out of money that 
        would otherwise go to the District of Columbia public 
        schools.
            (7) This title creates a 5-year program tailored to 
        the current needs and particular circumstances of low-
        income children in District of Columbia schools. This 
        title does not establish parameters or requirements for 
        other school choice programs.

SEC. 303. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this title is to provide low-income parents 
residing in the District of Columbia, particularly parents of 
students who attend elementary schools or secondary schools 
identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring 
under section 1116 of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316), with expanded opportunities for 
enrolling their children in higher-performing schools in the 
District of Columbia.

        school year preceding the school year for which the 
        eligible student is seeking a scholarship, attended an 
        elementary school or secondary school identified for 
        improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under 
        section 1116 of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
        Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316);

            (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the

        in the Middle East and North Africa;
            (2) the Arab League boycott, which was regrettably 
        reinstated in 1997, should be immediately and publicly

        Israel immediately disbanded;
            (3) the three Arab League countries with diplomatic 
        and trade relations with Israel should return their 
        ambassadors to Israel, should refrain from downgrading 
        their relations with Israel, and should play a 
        constructive role in securing a peaceful resolution of 
        the Israeli-Arab conflict;
            (4) the remaining Arab League states should 
        normalize relations with their neighbor Israel;

        continue to vigorously oppose the Arab League boycott 
        of Israel and find concrete steps to demonstrate that 
        opposition by, for example, taking into consideration 
        the participation of any recipient country in the 
        boycott when determining to sell weapons to said 
        country; and
            (6) the President should report to Congress 
        annually on specific steps being taken by the United 
        States to encourage Arab League states to normalize 
        their relations with Israel to bring about the 
        termination of the Arab League boycott of Israel, 
        including those to encourage allies and trading 
        partners of the United States to enact laws prohibiting 
        businesses from complying with the boycott and 
        penalizing businesses that do comply.

more than 3 percent by any such transfer: Provided, That the 
Appropriations Committees of both Houses of Congress are

    Sec. 305. Special Study of Simplification of Need Analysis 
and Application for Title IV Aid. (a) Study Required.--The 
Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance established 
by section 491 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1098), hereafter in this section referred to as ``the Advisory 
Committee'', shall conduct a thorough study of the feasibility 
of simplifying the need analysis methodology for all Federal 
student financial assistance programs and the process of 
applying for such assistance.
    (b) Required Subjects of Study.--In performing the study, 
the Advisory Committee shall, at a minimum, examine the 
following:
            (1) whether the methodology used to calculate the 
        expected family contribution can be simplified without 
        significant adverse effects on program intent, costs, 
        integrity, delivery, and distribution of awards;
            (2) whether the number of data elements, and, 
        accordingly, the number and complexity of questions 
        asked of students and families, used to calculate the 
        expected family contribution can be reduced without 
        such adverse effects;
            (3) whether the procedures for determining such 
        data elements, including determining and updating 
        offsets and allowances, is the most efficient, 
        effective, and fair means to determine a family's 
        available income and assets;
            (4) whether the methodology used to calculate the 
        expected family contribution, specifically the 
        consideration of income earned by a dependent student 
        and its effect on Pell grant eligibility, is an 
        effective and fair means to determine a family's 
        available income and a student's need;
            (5) whether the nature and timing of the 
        application required in section 483(a)(1) of the Higher 
        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1090(a)(1)), 
        eligibility and award determination, financial aid 
        processing, and funds delivery can be streamlined 
        further for students and families, institutions, and 
        States;
            (6) whether it is feasible to allow students to 
        complete only those limited sections of the financial 
        aid application that apply to their specific 
        circumstances and the State in which they reside;
            (7) whether a widely disseminated printed form, or 
        the use of an Internet or other electronic means, can 
        be developed to notify individuals of an estimation of 
        their approximate eligibility for grant, work-study, 
        and loan assistance upon completion and verification of 
        the simplified application form;
            (8) whether information provided on other Federal 
        forms (such as the form applying for supplemental 
        security income under title XVI of the Social Security 
        Act, the form for applying for food stamps under the 
        Food Stamp Act of 1977, and the schedule for applying 
        for the earned income tax credit under section 32 of 
        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) that are designed to 
        determine eligibility for various Federal need-based 
        assistance programs could be used to qualify potential 
        students for the simplified needs test; and
            (9) whether any proposed changes to data elements 
        collected, in addition to those used to calculate 
        expected family contribution, or any proposed changes 
        to the form's design or the process of applying for 
        aid, may have adverse effects on program costs, 
        integrity, delivery, or distribution of awards, as well 
        as, application development or application processing.
    (c) Additional Considerations.--In conducting the 
feasibility study, the Advisory Committee's primary objective 
under this subsection shall be simplifying the financial aid 
application forms and process and obtaining a substantial 
reduction in the number of required data items. In carrying out 
that objective, the Advisory Committee shall pay special 
attention to the needs of low-income and moderate-income 
students and families.
    (d) Consultation.--
            (1) In general.--The Advisory Committee shall 
        consult with a broad range of interested parties in 
        higher education, including parents and students, high 
        school guidance counselors, financial aid and other 
        campus administrators, appropriate State 
        administrators, administrators of intervention and 
        outreach programs, and appropriate officials from the 
        Department of Education.
            (2) Forms design expert.--With the goal of making 
        significant changes to the form to make the questions 
        more easily understandable, the Advisory Committee 
        shall consult a forms design expert to ensure that its 
        recommendations for revision of the application form 
        would assist in making the form easily readable and 
        understood by parents, students, and other members of 
        the public.
            (3) Congressional consultation.--The Advisory 
        Committee shall consult on a regular basis with the 
        Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House 
        of Representatives and the Committee on Health, 
        Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate in 
        carrying out the feasibility study required by this 
        subsection.
            (4) Departmental consultation.--The Secretary of 
        Education shall provide such assistance to the Advisory 
        Committee as is requested and practicable in conducting 
        the study required by this subsection.
    (e) Reports.--
            (1) Interim report.--The Advisory Committee shall, 
        not later than six months after the date of enactment 
        of this Act, prepare and submit an interim report 
        containing any such legislative changes as the Advisory 
        Committee recommends to reform and simplify the needs 
        analysis under part F of title IV of the Higher 
        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087kk et seq.) and 
        forms and other requirements under such title to the 
        Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House 
        of Representatives, the Committee on Health, Education, 
        Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, and the Secretary of 
        Education.
            (2) Final report.--The Advisory Committee shall, 
        not later than one year after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, prepare and submit a full final report on the 
        study, including recommendations for regulatory and 
        administrative changes required by this section, to the 
        Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House 
        of Representatives, the Committee on Health, Education, 
        Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, and the Secretary of 
        Education.
    (f) Implementation.--The Secretary of Education shall 
consult with the Committee on Education and the Workforce of 
the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and shall 
subsequently initiate a redesign of the form required by 
section 483 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1090). Such redesign shall include the testing of alternative 
simplified versions of the free federal form. The Secretary 
shall keep the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate fully and 
currently informed on the progress of these efforts.
    (g) Postponement of Tax Table Update Pending Report and 
Implementation.--The Secretary of Education shall not implement 
or enforce for the award year 2004-2005 the annual update to 
the allowances for State and other taxes in the tables used in 
the Federal needs analysis methodology, as prescribed by the 
Secretary on May 30, 2003 (68 Fed. Reg. 32473).
    Sec. 306. The Secretary of Education shall treat as timely

    Sec. 110. (a) For fiscal year 2004, the Secretary of 
Transportation shall--
            (1) not distribute from the obligation limitation 
        for Federal-aid Highways amounts authorized for 
        administrative expenses and programs funded from the 
        administrative takedown authorized by section 
        104(a)(1)(A) of title 23, United States Code, for the 
        highway use tax evasion program, for the Bureau of 
        Transportation Statistics and for the programs, 
        projects, and activities for which funds are made 
        available under the heading ``Federal-Aid Highways, 
        Miscellaneous Highway and Highway Safety Programs'' in 
        this Act;
            (2) not distribute an amount from the obligation 
        limitation for Federal-aid Highways that is equal to 
        the unobligated balance of amounts made available from 
        the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit 
        Account) for Federal-aid highways and highway safety 
        programs for the prior fiscal years the funds for which 
        are allocated by the Secretary;
            (3) determine the ratio that--
                    (A) the obligation limitation for Federal-
                aid Highways less the aggregate of amounts not 
                distributed under paragraphs (1) and (2), bears 
                to
                    (B) the total of the sums authorized to be 
                appropriated for Federal-aid highways and 
                highway safety construction programs (other 
                than sums authorized to be appropriated for 
                sections set forth in paragraphs (1) through 
                (7) of subsection (b) and sums authorized to be 
                appropriated for section 105 of title 23, 
                United States Code, equal to the amount 
                referred to in subsection (b)(8)) for such 
                fiscal year less the aggregate of the amounts 
                not distributed under paragraph (1) of this 
                subsection;
            (4) distribute the obligation limitation for

        201 of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 
        and $2,000,000,000 for such fiscal year under section 
        105 of title 23, United States Code (relating to 
        minimum guarantee) so that the amount of obligation 
        authority available for each of such sections is equal 
        to the amount determined by multiplying the ratio 
        determined under paragraph (3) by the sums authorized 
        to be appropriated for such section (except in the case 
        of section 105, $2,000,000,000) for such fiscal year;
            (5) distribute the obligation limitation provided

        distributed under paragraphs (1) and (2) and amounts 
        distributed under paragraph (4) for each of the 
        programs that are allocated by the Secretary under 
        title 23, United States Code (other than activities to 
        which paragraph (1) applies and programs to which 
        paragraph (4) applies) by multiplying the ratio 
        determined under paragraph (3) by the sums authorized 
        to be appropriated for such program for such fiscal 
        year; and
            (6) distribute the obligation limitation provided 
        for Federal-aid Highways less the aggregate amounts not 
        distributed under paragraphs (1) and (2) and amounts 
        distributed under paragraphs (4) and (5) for Federal-
        aid highways and highway safety construction programs 
        (other than the minimum guarantee program, but only to 
        the extent that amounts apportioned for the minimum 
        guarantee program for such fiscal year exceed 
        $2,639,000,000, and the Appalachian development highway 
        system program) that are apportioned by the Secretary 
        under title 23, United States Code, in the ratio that--
                    (A) sums authorized to be appropriated for 
                such programs that are apportioned to each 
                State for such fiscal year, bear to
                    (B) the total of the sums authorized to be 
                appropriated for such programs that are 
                apportioned to all States for such fiscal year.
    (b) Exceptions From Obligation Limitation.--The obligation

obligations: (1) under section 125 of title 23, United States 
Code; (2) under section 147 of the Surface Transportation 
Assistance Act of 1978; (3) under section 9 of the Federal-Aid

the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st 
Century; (8) under section 105 of title 23, United States Code 
(but, only in an amount equal to $639,000,000 for such fiscal 
year); and for Federal-aid highway programs for which 
obligation authority was made available under the 
Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century or subsequent 
public laws for multiple years or to remain available until 
used, but only to the extent that such obligation authority has 
not lapsed or been used.
    (c) Redistribution of Unused Obligation Authority.--
Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Secretary shall after 
August 1 for such fiscal year revise a distribution of the 
obligation limitation made available under subsection (a) if a 
State will not obligate the amount distributed during that 
fiscal year and redistribute sufficient amounts to those States 
able to obligate amounts in addition to those previously 
distributed during that fiscal year giving priority to those 
States having large unobligated balances of funds apportioned 
under sections 104 and 144 of title 23, United States Code, 
section 160 (as in effect on the day before the enactment of 
the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century) of title 
23, United States Code, and under section 1015 of the 
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (105 
Stat. 1943-1945).
    (d) Applicability of Obligation Limitations to 
Transportation Research Programs.--The obligation limitation 
shall apply to transportation research programs carried out 
under chapter 5 of title 23, United States Code, except that 
obligation authority made available for such programs under 
such limitation shall remain available for a period of 3 fiscal 
years.
    (e) Redistribution of Certain Authorized Funds.--Not later 
than 30 days after the date of the distribution of obligation 
limitation under subsection (a), the Secretary shall distribute 
to the States any funds: (1) that are authorized to be 
appropriated for such fiscal year for Federal-aid highways 
programs (other than the program under section 160 of title 23, 
United States Code) and for carrying out subchapter I of 
chapter 311 of title 49, United States Code, and highway-
related programs under chapter 4 of title 23, United States 
Code; and (2) that the Secretary determines will not be 
allocated to the States, and will not be available for 
obligation, in such fiscal year due to the imposition of any 
obligation limitation for such fiscal year. Such distribution 
to the States shall be made in the same ratio as the 
distribution of obligation authority under subsection (a)(6). 
The funds so distributed shall be available for any purposes 
described in section 133(b) of title 23, United States Code.
    (f) Special Rule.--Obligation limitation distributed for a 
fiscal year under subsection (a)(4) of this section for a 
section set forth in subsection (a)(4) shall remain available

    (g) Of the obligation authority distributed to a State 
under subsection (a)(6), an mount of obligation authority equal 
to the amount for each surface transportation project in such 
State identified in section 115 of the statement of managers 
accompanying this Act shall be available for carrying out each 
project.
    (h) The obligation limitation made available for the 
programs, projects, and activities for which funds are made 
available under the heading ``Federal-Aid Highways, 
Miscellaneous Highway and Highway Safety Program'' of this Act 
shall remain available until used and shall be in addition to 
the amount of any limitation imposed on obligations for 
Federal-aid highway and highway safety construction programs 
for future fiscal years.
    Sec. 111. Notwithstanding any other provision of law:
            (1) Section 1105(c) of the Intermodal Surface 
        Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (105 Stat. 2032;

at reasonable prices, the Secretary of Transportation, working 
with affected States, shall develop and implement a procedure 
for fair competitive bidding by Amtrak and non-Amtrak operators 
for State-supported routes: Provided, That in the event a State 
desires to select or selects a non-Amtrak operator for the 
route, the State may make an agreement with Amtrak to use 
facilities and equipment of, or have services provided by, 
Amtrak under terms agreed to by the State and Amtrak to enable 
the non-Amtrak operator to provide the State-supported service: 
Provided further, That if the parties cannot agree on terms, 
the Secretary shall, as a condition of receipt of Federal grant 
funds, order that the facilities and equipment be made 
available and the services be provided by Amtrak under 
reasonable terms and compensation: Provided further, That when 
prescribing reasonable compensation to Amtrak, the Secretary 
shall consider quality of service as a major factor when 
determining whether, and the extent to which, the amount of 
compensation shall be greater than the incremental costs of 
using the facilities and providing the services: Provided 
further, That the Secretary may reprogram up to $2,500,000 from 
the Amtrak operating grant funds for costs associated with the 
implementation of the fair bid procedure and demonstration of

            (1) to each discretionary account and each item of 
        budget authority described in such subsection; and
            (2) within each such account and item, to each 
        program, project, and activity (with programs, 
        projects, and activities as delineated in the 
        appropriation Act or accompanying reports for the

       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and Senate at the 
conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2673) making 
appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and 
Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the 
fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes, 
submit the following joint statement to the House and Senate in 
explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the 
managers and recommended in the accompanying conference report.
      This conference agreement includes the Agriculture, Rural 
Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act, 2004; the Departments of Commerce, Justice, 
and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations 
Act, 2004; the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2004; 
the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 2004; the Departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act, 2004; the Transportation, Treasury, and 
Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004; the Departments 
of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and 
Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004; and the 
Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act, 2004.

       DIVISION A--AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG 
     ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004

                        Congressional Directives

      The statement of the managers remains silent on 
provisions that were in both the House and Senate bills that 
remain unchanged by this conference agreement, except as noted 
in this statement of the managers.
      The conferees agree that executive branch wishes cannot 
substitute for Congress's own statements as to the best 
evidence of congressional intentions--that is, the official 
reports of the Congress. The conferees further point out that 
funds in this Act must be used for the purposes for which 
appropriated, as required by section 1301 of title 31 of the 
United States Code, which provides: ``Appropriations shall be 
applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were 
made except as otherwise provided by law.''
      The House and Senate report language that is not changed 
by the conference is approved by the committee of conference. 
The statement of the managers, while repeating some report 
language for emphasis, does not intend to negate the language 
referred to above unless expressly provided herein.
      In cases in which the House or the Senate have directed 
the submission of a report, such report is to be submitted to 
both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
      In instances where the conference report refers to ``the 
Committees,'' it is the intent of the Managers to mean the 
Committees on Appropriations of both House and Senate.

                     TITLE I--AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS

                 Production, Processing, and Marketing

                        Office of the Secretary

      The conference agreement provides $5,092,000 for the 
Office of the Secretary instead of $3,468,000 as proposed by 
the House and $10,046,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees note that the Congress included an 
authorization in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 
2002 (Section 10802) for a food biotechnology education 
program. This program is intended to provide the public with 
science-based evidence on the safety of foods produced with 
biotechnology for human consumption. The conferees direct the 
Secretary to provide the Committees with a defined plan within 
30 days of enactment of this bill, detailing how the USDA 
intends to implement this food biotechnology education program 
and fulfill this statutory requirement.
      The conferees agree that emergency preparedness related 
to field crops, farm animals and food processing and 
distribution is of critical importance, and that the 
agriculture and food sectors are part of the critical 
infrastructure requiring heightened attention and protection. 
Given the integral roles of state and local governments and the 
private sector in detecting, deterring and responding to acts 
of agro-terrorism, the conferees expect the Department of 
Agriculture and theDepartment of Homeland Security to 
coordinate efforts in assisting states, particularly by providing 
financial and technical support to initiatives oriented toward 
interstate cooperation in joint preparedness initiatives. The conferees 
are particularly interested in those states that have developed or are 
currently developing coordinated interstate initiatives.
      The conferees note that as of September 30, 2003, 
$80,000,000 remains available to the Department from funds 
provided through the Emergency Response Fund (ERF), of which 
nearly $9,000,000 is available to the Secretary. Since these 
funds were provided, USDA has been one of the slowest Federal 
agencies to obligate its ERF funds. The conferees are aware of 
concerns about security, such as those raised by GAO and the 
USDA Inspector General in recent reports and in news reports 
regarding ``table top'' homeland security exercises. The 
conferees urge the Secretary to act promptly to address 
identified security needs and to advise the Committees on 
Appropriations of needs for which additional funds may be 
necessary. The conferees further direct the Secretary to advise 
the Committees promptly of the results of any future homeland 
security exercises.
      The conferees are concerned about the possibility of 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy entering the United States 
through the importation of live cattle. The beef industry is 
the single largest industry in American agriculture, and an 
outbreak of BSE would be devastating to the industry, and to 
the public's perception of the safety of American food. 
Accordingly, the United States has never allowed the 
importation of live cattle from a country that has been found 
to have BSE. The conferees believe that the Secretary should 
not allow the importation of live cattle from any country known 
to have BSE unless that country complies with the animal health 
guidelines established by the World Organization for Animal 
Health. The conferees also expect the Secretary to continue to 
abide by international standards for the continued health and 
safety of the United States livestock industry.
      The conferees are aware of current efforts to begin a 
study of the use of conservation cropping techniques in 
southeastern North Dakota, northeastern South Dakota and 
western Minnesota. The goal of this study would be to identify 
conservation rotations, cover crops, seeding techniques, and 
residue management practices that would make conservation 
tillage acceptable and profitable in these climate transition 
areas. The conferees encourage the Secretary to support efforts 
to begin this study, as appropriate.
      The conferees are aware that USDA was authorized to 
develop a Delmarva Conservation Corridor Demonstration Program 
in the 2002 farm bill, but has not yet done so. This program 
allows USDA to target the benefits of watershed-based 
conservation programs to farmlands that local stakeholders have 
determined to be the most ecologically and economically 
important, with the goal of maximizing the ecological and 
working lands potential of the landscape. The conferees 
encourage the Secretary to support this program, and remind 
USDA that the intent of the 2002 farm bill provision was to 
allow the Secretary and the states flexibility in using the 
resources of existing agricultural conservation and forestry 
programs.
      The conferees encourage NRCS, through the Conservation 
Technical Assistance Program, to work with the Thunder Basin 
Prairie Ecosystem Association and the U.S. Department of the 
Interior to continue work to develop a comprehensive and 
multispecies land management proposal for more than 260,000 
acres of Federal and private lands within the Thunder Basin 
National Grasslands.
      The conferees strongly encourage the Secretary to work to 
ensure that no chicken purchased for the School Lunch Program 
contains fluoroquinolones, including the initiation of a policy 
to not purchase chickens for these programs from companies that 
do not have a stated policy that they do not use 
fluoroquinolones in their chickens.
      The conferees are aware that the Farm Service Agency has 
been given new responsibilities in carrying out portions of the 
Trade Adjustment Assistance program as authorized in the Trade 
Act of 2002. The conferees direct the Secretary, within 60 days 
of enactment of this Act, to provide the Committees on 
Appropriations an assessment of the staffing needs for each 
state office to carry out these new responsibilities.
      The conferees are aware that the mission of USDA is to 
support agriculture and rural development in the U.S. and 
around the world, and this mission is supported by American tax 
dollars. Therefore, the conferees strongly encourage the 
Secretary to make every effort to ensure that purchases made by 
USDA are manufactured or produced in the United States.
      The conferees have provided a total of $3,300,000 for 
cross-cutting trade negotiations and biotechnology resources. 
Of this amount, the conferees provide $1,000,000 in the APHIS 
account, $500,000 in the FAS account, and $150,000 in the GIPSA 
account for these activities. Further, the conferees provide 
$1,650,000 to the Office of the Secretary for these activities, 
and direct that these funds shall become available for 
obligation only after the Secretary has provided to the 
Committees a detailed explanation of proposed expenditures.
      The conferees commend the Department on the success 
achieved with the Lamb Meat Adjustment Program. However, the 
conferees also recognize the ewe lamb expansion portion was 
curtailed as a result of the serious drought conditions 
throughout the United States. The conferees encourage the 
Department to continue this portion of the program for an 
additional year.
      The conferees expect the Secretary to seek the approval 
of the Committees on Appropriations before implementing a 
merger or reduction of any administrative or information 
technology functions relating to the Farm ServiceAgency, 
Natural Resources Conservation Service, Rural Development, or any other 
agency of the Department.
      The conferees are concerned that transfers of funds from 
APHIS and ARS to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may 
result in a shift in focus away from agriculture, and fully 
expect the Secretary of Agriculture to seek assurances from the 
Secretary of Homeland Security that these diagnostic and 
research activities at Plum Island will firmly remain tied to 
agricultural interests. The conferees direct the Secretary to 
report to the Committees on Appropriations by February 1, 2004, 
on the funding amounts and the agricultural diagnostic and 
research activities at Plum Island that have been agreed upon 
by USDA and DHS for fiscal year 2004.
      The conferees concur with the language and reporting 
requirement contained in the Senate report regarding 
geographically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. In preparing 
the report, the Department shall work with the Farm Service 
Agency and all other relevant departmental agencies.
      The conferees are aware that applications for the Senior 
Farmers' Market Nutrition Program are increasing and exceed the 
annual $15,000,000 provided in the farm bill. The conferees 
urge the Secretary to take maximum advantage of additional 
resources available to supplement existing funding, in order to 
meet demand for the program.
      In order to provide a safeguard against the further 
decline of the rice industry and wildlife habitat in Texas, and 
to provide information to the Congress in anticipation of and 
preparation for the 2007 farm bill, the conferees direct the 
Secretary of Agriculture to review the administration of 
section 1105(a)(1)(E) of Public Law 107-171 as it relates to 
the proper application and implementation of the conserving use 
requirements on rice base acreage in Texas. The Secretary shall 
review and evaluate the costs, benefits and effects of the 
conserving use requirements and actual plantings and production 
on rice producers, including tenant rice producers, the rice 
milling and processing industry, wildlife habitat, and the 
economies of rice farming areas in Texas, detailed by each of 
these affected interests and by the program variables involved.
      The Secretary shall post on the USDA website and also 
provide to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture of the 
House of Representatives an annual report detailing the 
progress and findings by February 1, 2004 and not later than 
October 1 of 2005 through 2007.
      The conferees are aware that Section 10502 of the Farm 
Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-171) 
requires the Secretary to investigate the problem of non-
ambulatory livestock, report the findings to Congress, and 
promulgate regulations to regulate the humane treatment, 
handling and disposition of these livestock if deemed necessary 
by the results of the study. The conferees are concerned that 
although the farm bill was signed into law on May 7, 2002, USDA 
did not publish a Notice of Request for Approval of an 
Information Collection in the Federal Register to begin 
collecting information for this study until October 28, 2003. 
The conferees direct the Secretary to work expeditiously to 
complete this study at the earliest possible time, and to 
provide copies of all interim reports as well as the final 
report to the Committees on Appropriations and the authorizing 
committees. Further, the Secretary is directed to provide to 
the Committees on Appropriations a preliminary report no later 
than March 1, 2004.

                          Executive Operations

                            CHIEF ECONOMIST

      The conference agreement provides $8,707,000 for the 
Office of the Chief Economist as proposed by the Senate instead 
of $8,716,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conferees direct the Department to submit to the 
Committees on Appropriations the biofuels report requested by 
the House by February 1, 2004.

                       NATIONAL APPEALS DIVISION

      The conference agreement provides $13,670,000 for the 
National Appeals Division as proposed by the House instead of 
$13,997,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                 Office of Budget and Program Analysis

      The conference agreement provides $7,740,000 for the 
Office of Budget and Program Analysis instead of $7,749,000 as 
proposed by the House and $7,544,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                        HOMELAND SECURITY STAFF

      The conference agreement provides $499,000 for Homeland 
Security staff instead of $910,000 as proposed by the Senate. 
The House did not provide funding for this account.

                Office of the Chief Information Officer

      The conference agreement provides $15,493,000 for the 
Office of the Chief Information Officer instead of $14,993,000 
as proposed by the House and $15,710,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.

                      COMMON COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT

      The conference agreement provides $119,289,000 for Common 
Computing Environment instead of $100,999,000 as proposed by 
the House and $118,789,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees are aware that the acquisition of 
geospatial data and Geographic Information System technologies 
is critical to the Department of Agriculture's plans to 
modernize its County Service Centers and install a common 
computing environment that optimizes information sharing, 
customer service, and staff efficiencies, and dramatically 
improves the Department's ability to track and react to natural 
disasters, plant and animal disease outbreaks and bioterrorism 
events. Within the funds provided in this Act, the conferees 
encourage the Department to provide the appropriate level of 
support for the acquisition of geospatial data and Geographic 
Information System technologies.

                 Office of the Chief Financial Officer

      The conference agreement provides $5,684,000 for the 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer instead of $5,785,000 as 
proposed by the House and $5,496,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                          WORKING CAPITAL FUND

      The conferees are concerned about issues raised by the 
Department's recent report on remote mirroring technology and 
expect the fiscal year 2005 budget request to adequately 
address these needs identified in the report, including how the 
costs of the remote data capability should be assigned and paid 
for by non-USDA users of the NFC as requested in the fiscal 
year 2003 Act.
      The conferees deem the study submitted on remote mirror 
imaging sufficient to meet the requirement set forth in the 
fiscal year 2003 Act for release of funds. The conferees direct 
that of the funds provided in the fiscal year 2003 Agriculture 
Appropriations Act, no less than $4,000,000 shall be spent for 
the immediate implementation of an interim solution to address 
data vulnerability for mission critical applications, including 
data storage hardware and software, data replication software, 
and synchronous replication of the identified mission critical 
data. The conferees direct that this interim solution be 
achieved within six months of enactment of this Act.

           Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights

      The conference agreement provides $808,000 for the Office 
of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights as proposed by the 
House instead of $794,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                         Office of Civil Rights

      The conference agreement provides $17,450,000 for the 
Office of Civil Rights instead of $15,445,000 as proposed by 
the Senate. The House provided no funding for this account.

          Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration

      The conference agreement provides $673,000 for the Office 
of the Assistant Secretary for Administration as proposed by 
the Senate instead of $678,000 as proposed by the House.

        Agriculture Buildings and Facilities and Rental Payments

      The conference agreement provides $156,469,000 for 
agriculture buildings and facilities and rental payments 
instead of $156,091,000 as proposed by the House and 
$187,022,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                     Hazardous Materials Management

      The conference agreement provides $15,611,000 for 
Hazardous Materials Management as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $15,713,000 as proposed by the House.

                      Departmental Administration

      The conference agreement provides $23,031,000 for 
Departmental Administration as proposed by the Senate instead 
of $40,597,000 as proposed by the House.

     Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations

      The conference agreement provides $3,796,000 for the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations 
as proposed by the House instead of $3,825,000 as proposed by 
the Senate.

                        Office of Communications

      The conference agreement provides $9,228,000 for the 
Office of Communications as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$9,245,000 as proposed by the House.
      The Committees directed the Office to provide them with 
copies of open source news material made available to USDA 
officials through the use of appropriated funds. The Office has 
not done so. Accordingly, the conferees direct the Office to 
begin doing so no later than 15 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act.

                    Office of the Inspector General

      The conference agreement provides $77,281,000 for the 
Office of the Inspector General instead of $78,114,000 as 
proposed by the House and $75,781,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.

                     Office of the General Counsel

      The conference agreement provides $34,700,000 for the 
Office of the General Counsel as proposed by the House instead 
of $35,343,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees note that the fiscal year 2004 funding 
level for the Office of the General Counsel does not provide 
funds to increase the number of Senior Executive Service 
employees of the Office. If the Office of the General Counsel 
determines the need to increase the number of SES employees in 
the Office, the General Counsel is directed to submit a 
reorganization plan to the Committees on Appropriations for 
approval.

  Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics

      The conference agreement provides $596,000 for the Office 
of the Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $597,000 as proposed by the 
House.
      The conferees are concerned that research budgets 
submitted by the Department reflect a continuing disregard for 
Congressional program priorities. For a number of years, there 
has been no adequate justification presented to the Committees 
to support proposed project terminations. As a result, such 
proposed terminations have been disapproved by Congress, only 
to be resubmitted in a budget proposal for a subsequent year. 
The conferees direct the Under Secretary to end the recycling 
of proposed terminations that have already been rejected by the 
Congress. Further, the conferees expect that any termination 
proposed in the fiscal year 2005 budget will include a detailed 
justification in the explanatory notes accompanying the budget 
request.

                       Economic Research Service

      The conference agreement provides $71,402,000 for the 
Economic Research Service as proposed by the House instead of 
$69,902,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees encourage ERS to coordinate with the North 
Carolina Department of Agriculture and North Carolina State 
University to collect the economic data and do the statistical 
analysis necessary to study the impact that growth in the 
horticulture industry is having on that state's economy.
      The conferees provide the requested increase of 
$1,000,000 for development of an expanded Security Analysis 
System for U.S. Agriculture (SAS-USA). This is a scenario-based 
decision system, which will aid in evaluating threats to the 
food system. Within the amount provided, the conferees 
encourage ERS to develop requirements for a system to use 
available agricultural data to circumvent an attack on the food 
supply chain.

                National Agricultural Statistics Service

      The conference agreement provides $128,922,000 for the 
National Agricultural Statistics Service as proposed by the 
Senate instead of $129,800,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conferees provide $4,800,000 for Agricultural 
estimates. The conferees encourage NASS to consider conducting 
Monthly Hogs and Pigs Inventory reporting, and Barrow and Gilt 
Slaughter reporting. The conferees also expect that both the 
potato objective yield survey and the potato size and grade 
survey will be continued.

                     Agricultural Research Service

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $1,088,892,000 for the 
Agricultural Research Service, Salaries and Expenses, instead 
of $1,014,000,000 as proposed by the House and $1,045,533,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language proposed 
by the Senate regarding a land conveyance.
      The conferees have agreed to increased funding for the 
following laboratories and areas of research:
      Budgeted increases, as follows: Babesiosis (Pullman, WA),

      The conference agreement continues the fiscal year 2003 
level of funding for all research projects proposed to be 
terminated in the President's budget.
      The conference agreement concurs with the Agricultural 
Research Service's proposal to reprogram existing resources 
into priority initiatives of emerging diseases, global climate 
change, biosecurity, and genomic sequencing.
      The conference agreement provides $13,772,000 for 
increased costs associated with Federal employees salaries and 
benefits.
      The conference agreement provides an additional $383,000 
for the Children's Nutrition Research Center at Houston, TX, 
for a cooperative research project with Baylor College of 
Medicine and the Peanut Institute to examine ways to prevent 
the onset of chronic diseases and the growing problem of 
overweight children.
      The conference agreement provides an additional $450,000 
for increased investigation of the nutritional needs of 
pregnant and nursing women, and children.
      The conference agreement provides an additional $225,000 
for ongoing cooperative research between the Flint River Water 
Planning & Policy Center and the National Peanut Research 
Laboratory at Dawson, Georgia.
      The conferees provide increased funding for the 
development of a wine grape foundation block of certified 
``clean'' rootstock at Prosser, WA and direct ARS to ensure 
that this funding is not obligated toward other research.

                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

      The conference agreement provides $63,810,000 for the 
Agricultural Research Service, Buildings and Facilities, 
instead of $35,900,000 as proposed by the House and $46,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      The following items reflect the conference agreement: 
Grape Genomics Research Center (Davis, California), $2,700,000; 
U.S. Agricultural Research Station (Salinas, California), 
$4,500,000; U.S. Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center 
(Hilo, Hawaii), $4,860,000; National Center for Agricultural 
Utilization Research (Peoria, Illinois), $2,700,000; ARS 
Sugarcane Research Laboratory (Houma, Louisiana), $1,350,000; 
Northeast Marine Cold Water Aquaculture Research Center (Orono/
Franklin, Maine), $2,700,000; Abraham Lincoln National 
Agricultural Library (Beltsville, Maryland), $900,000; 
Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (Beltsville, Maryland), 
$2,700,000; Jamie Whitten Delta States Research Center 
(Stoneville, Mississippi), $4,860,000; National Plant and 
Genetics Security Center (Columbia, Missouri), $2,430,000; 
Northern Plains Agricultural Research Laboratory (Sidney, 
Montana), $2,520,000; Center for Crop-based Health Genomics 
(Ithaca, New York), $3,870,000; Center for Grape Genetics 
(Geneva, New York), $2,430,000; Grazinglands Research 
Laboratory (Ft. Reno, Oklahoma), $2,160,000; U.S. Vegetable 
Laboratory (Charleston, South Carolina), $3,150,000; ARS 
Research Laboratory (Pullman, Washington), $3,960,000; 
Appalachian Fruit Laboratory (Kearneysville, West Virginia), 
$1,800,000; Nutrient Management Laboratory (Marshfield, 
Wisconsin), $3,690,000; and Upgrade Security at ARS 
Laboratories (Various Locations), $10,530,000.
      The conferees note that there is widespread interest in 
additional construction and renovation of ARS facilities 
throughout the country. This is not surprising when considering 
the fact that many of the existing facilities are decades old. 
However, the conferees are concerned that there does not seem 
to be a master plan for addressing these needs. Rather, 
construction projects in several parts of the country have been 
described by various ARS officials as the agency's top 
priority.
      The conferees believe that there should be a logical 
progression for determining what projects should be funded. 
Therefore, beginning with the fiscal year 2005 appropriations 
process, the Committees will not consider funding requests for 
projects for which a prospectus has not been completed and 
submitted to the Committees by March 1 of each year. Each 
prospectus shall, at a minimum, include the following 
information: the feasibility, requirements, and scope of the 
proposed project; details on building size, cost, associated 
facilities, scientific capacity, and other requirements; and 
details on existing and planned program and resource 
requirements. Further, the conferees are requesting the 
assistance of ARS in determining the merits and priority for 
these projects.
      In order to begin this orderly review process, the 
conferees direct ARS to provide a prospectus for each of the 
following projects: Aberdeen/Billingsley Creek, Idaho; Animal 
Waste Management Research in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Forage-
Animal Research Laboratory in Lexington, Kentucky; Laboratory 
and Office Facilities in Starkville, Mississippi; Animal 
Biosciences Facility at Montana State University; Red River 
Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota; 
Laboratory, Greenhouse, and Office Space at the University of 
Toledo; Dairy Forage Lab at Prairie du Sac and Madison, 
Wisconsin.
      The conference agreement provides sufficient funding to 
complete all planning and design provided by the House and 
Senate, and construction phases as described in the Senate 
report.

      Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service

                   RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES

University devoted to risk assessment, mitigation, and 
communication for genetically modified agricultural products.
      The conference agreement provides an increase of $640,000 
for the Emergency Management Systems program of which $280,000 
is to increase the number of doses in the North American Foot 
and Mouth Disease Vaccine Bank, and $270,000 is to increase 
cooperative agreements with states.
      The conference agreement provides an increase of 
$2,266,000 for Pest Detection programs of which $200,000 is to

wasting disease instead of $16,815,000 as proposed by the House 
and $20,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference 
agreement provides that $1,750,000 is for the State of 
Wisconsin; $250,000 is for the State of Utah; and $250,000 is 
for the Conservation Medicine Center of Chicago.
      The conferees expect the Secretary to continue to use the 
authority provided in this Act to transfer funds for the arrest 
and eradication of animal and plant pests and diseases that 
threaten American agriculture. The conference agreement adopts 
Senate bill language that prohibits funds from being spent to 
issue a final rule in Docket No. 02-06201 ``Cost-Sharing for 
Animal and Plant Health Emergency Programs,'' and expects 
APHIS, in submitting apportionment requests for emergencies 
that threaten American agriculture, to disregard any 
arbitrarily imposed cost-share requirements for these funds.
      The conference agreement provides an increase of 
$18,250,000 for Emerging Plant Pests of which $8,000,000 is for 
citrus canker eradication and control; $4,000,000 is for Asian 
long-horned beetle activities, of which $1,500,000 is for 
activities in the Chicago, Illinois area; $4,750,000 is for 
glassy-winged sharpshooter eradication and control; and 
$1,500,000 is for the Emerald Ash Borer Task Force for the 
removal of trees that have been affected by the emerald ash 
borer, with a priority for the removal of trees on public 
property or that threaten public safety.
       The conferees are concerned that the continued presence 
of the emerald ash borer threatens the ash tree population in 
Michigan and other states, and direct the Secretary to provide 
to the Committees on Appropriations by March 1, 2004, a plan 
for addressing this problem.
       The conferees are aware that the Asian long-horned 
beetle is extremely destructive and may spread to states where 
they do not yet exist. The conferees are also aware that this 
pest was recently found in Ontario, Canada, and are concerned 
this presents an additional threat to the introduction of the 
Asian long-horned beetle into Michigan and other states by way 
of commercial vehicles or other means. The conferees direct 
APHIS to do a comprehensive review of their procedures and 
regulations, and report to the Committees on Appropriations by 
January 1, 2004, on whether they are adequate to prevent the 
introduction of this or similar pests into the United States.
      The conference agreement provides $5,491,000 for 
grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression, of which no less 
than $1,000,000 shall be for suppression activities in Utah, 
and $150,000 for suppression activities in Nevada.
      The conference agreement provides an increase of $100,000 
for the Nez-Perce Biocontrol Center.
      The conferees do not concur with the President's request 
to reduce funding in the wildlife services operations account 
to allow cooperators to assume a larger share of the costs 
associated with preventing wildlife damage, and protecting 
human health and safety.
      The conference agreement provides an increase of 
$1,100,000 for a cooperative oral rabies vaccination program, 
and encourages the Secretary to use funds from the CCC, as 
necessary, for additional control activities in fiscal year 
2004.
      The conference agreement provides increases of $400,000 
for hazing programs to manage the growth of cormorants in 
central New York watersheds; $75,000 to assist with the Nevada 
Division of Wildlife; $100,000 for beaver control in Kentucky; 
$200,000 for non-lethal geese control in New York; $175,000 for 
blackbird control in Kansas; and $125,000 for cormorant control 
in Michigan.
      The conferees are aware of the Monkeypox outbreak in 
Wisconsin and other midwestern states. APHIS is working with 
the Centers for Disease Control to develop a comprehensive 
Federal response to the outbreak. The conferees urge APHIS to 
take all necessary steps to deal with the problem and direct it 
to provide the Committees with regular reports on the status of 
the situation.
      The conference agreement provides $2,000,000 for the 
biosecurity program. The conferees have included language under 
the Office of the Secretary to ensure that veterinary 
diagnostic work at Plum Island, New York remains focused on 
agriculture. The conferees note that should APHIS encounter a 
shortfall in that veterinary diagnostic work, the funds in this 
line item may be used for that work, subject to reprogramming 
requirements in this Act.
      The conference agreement provides an increase of 
$2,738,000 for Veterinary Diagnostics of which $1,000,000 is to 
enhance the laboratory network; $500,000 is to conduct anthrax 
diagnostics and related activities, and $750,000 is to update 
equipment needed to test certain animal samples in Colorado.
      The conference agreement provides an increase of 
$2,225,000 for Wildlife Services Methods Development of which 
$1,300,000 is for the Predator Research Station in Utah; 
$100,000 is to enhance existing research efforts at the 
National Wildlife Research Center field station in Starkville, 
Mississippi; $200,000 is to expand the program at the Jack 
Berryman Institute for addressing wildlife damage management 
issues, and $400,000 is for the National Wildlife Research 
Station located in Texas.
      The conferees are aware of the presence of chronic 
wasting disease in elk and deer in the state of New Mexico. The 
conferees encourage the Secretary to review the current 
situation and work with the state to establish, equip, and 
operate a state-run laboratory to conduct a rapid screening 
test for chronic wasting disease.
      The conferees are aware of an outbreak of avian influenza 
in the state of Rhode Island. The conferees urge the Secretary 
to provide financial assistance to Rhode Island egg producers 
who have depopulated their flocks, as a result of this 
outbreak.
      The conferees encourage the agency to support ongoing 
activities with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 
animal nuisance program.

                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

      The conference agreement provides $4,996,000 for Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service Buildings and Facilities as 
proposed by both the House and Senate.

                     Agricultural Marketing Service

                           MARKETING SERVICES

      The conference agreement provides $75,430,000 for the 
Agricultural Marketing Service instead of $75,953,000 as 
proposed by the House and $75,263,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conference agreement includes language regarding 
plant variety protection, as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees note that some of the additional funds may 
be used to improve scientific technical support of the National 
Organic Standards Board.
       The conference agreement includes $14,700,000 for the 
Pesticide Data Program and $6,209,000 for the Microbiological 
Data Program.

                 LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $62,577,000 for 
Limitation on Administration Expenses as proposed by both the 
House and Senate.

    FUNDS FOR STRENGTHENING MARKETS, INCOME, AND SUPPLY (SECTION 32)

      The conference agreement provides $15,392,000 for Funds 
for Strengthening Markets, Income, and Supply as proposed by 
both the House and Senate.

                   PAYMENTS TO STATES AND POSSESSIONS

      The conference agreement appropriates $3,338,000 for 
Payments to States and Possessions as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $1,347,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conferees direct that $2,000,000 be provided to the 
Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer 
Protection for the creation of specialty markets. The conferees 
recognize the need to expand marketing opportunities for value-
added products, and expect a report from the Wisconsin 
Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, 
through the Agricultural Marketing Service, regarding short and 
long-term objectives and plans to meet this need by March 1, 
2004.

        Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $35,890,000 for the 
Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration instead 
of $39,690,000 as proposed by the House and $35,638,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees understand that the Secretary has 
undertaken a product verification protocols pilot, in 
conjunction with the Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa corn growers 
associations, to establish controls for regulated seed 
varieties and to augment grain marketing. The conference report 
provides $500,000 to continue this pilot program with the 
growers associations for development of production protocols.
      The conferees are concerned about the management of the 
user fee program for grain export inspection and weighing 
services. The fee structure should fully fund the expenses of 
the program, as directed in the authorizing legislation. The 
funds appropriated by Congress for GIPSA's Salaries and 
Expenses account are meant to fund necessary personnel and 
operating expenses, and should not be used to fund deficiencies 
in the user fee account. In July 2003, the Secretary 
transferred $2,000,000 from the Salaries and Expenses account 
to the user fee account to avoid over-obligation in the user 
fee account. The unsustainable nature of the current fee 
structure is an ongoing problem. In a fiscal year 1998 
supplemental, the fee account received an appropriation of 
$1,500,000 to avoid a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. The 
conferees are strongly opposed to the transfer of appropriated 
funds into user fee accounts, particularly in cases such as 
this in which the user fee funding shortfall is ongoing, 
predictable, and fixable. The conferees direct the 
Administration to immediately take all necessary steps to adopt 
and implement a fee structure that fully funds the services 
provided.

        LIMITATION ON INSPECTION AND WEIGHING SERVICES EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $42,463,000 as proposed 
by both the House and Senate.

             Office of the Under Secretary for Food Safety

      The conference agreement provides $599,000 for the Office 
of the Under Secretary for Food Safety as proposed by the House 
instead of $611,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                   Food Safety and Inspection Service

      The conference agreement provides $784,511,000 for the 
Food Safety and Inspection Service, instead of $785,261,000 as 
proposed by the House and $783,761,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language relating 
to enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees provide increases of $4,250,000 for 
increased inspection staffing to accommodate industry growth; 
$5,650,000 to improve the scientific and surveillance skills of 
the workforce; $1,650,000 to establish a continuous baseline 
program for risk assessments and performance measurement; 
$4,460,000 to increase sampling for pathogens and to develop 
the laboratory capability to respond to chemical terrorism; 
$1,777,000 to increase the number of Equivalency Review trips 
and auditors to conduct the reviews; and $750,000 to design a 
mass media campaign aimed at improving the safe food handling 
habits of consumers at home.
      The conference agreement provides the agency with 
$1,650,000 solely to outsource microbiological testing, as 
requested in the President's budget, with the goal of 
establishing a continuous baseline program for risk assessment 
and performance measurement. The conferees expect the 
Department to outsource baseline testing to private American 
Association for Laboratory Accreditation. International 
Standards Organization approved laboratories. The conferees 
direct the Department to report on the progress of this 
initiative within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
      The conferees are concerned about the safety of imported 
meat. The amount of imported meat re-inspected by FSIS at our 
borders has dropped sharply in 2003. The conferees are also 
concerned that countries whose food safety systems have been 
deemed ``equivalent'' to ours (and whose producers are 
therefore allowed to export to the U.S.) may have serious 
weaknesses in their domestic food safety systems, but not be 
taken off the equivalency list.
      The conferees request FSIS to report to the Committees by 
March 1, 2004, on the equivalence and reinspection processes. 
The report should address: how the agency determines that a 
country's meat inspection system is equivalent; whether this 
determination is subject to regular review and if so, how; what 
process FSIS uses for determining that a country is no longer 
equivalent; what public review of FSIS's equivalency 
determinations exists; why the amount of meat reinspected at 
the border has declined sharply; and how the agency's new 
automated import information system has impacted inspection 
operations at the border.

      The conferees are aware that certain additional states 
have been approved for participation in the Livestock Risk 
Protection Pilots for swine and other livestock categories, but 
that this expansion was limited to ten states. The conferees 
urge the Department to expand the program during fiscal year 
2004 to the maximum extent possible, including the states of 
Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin.

                Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Fund

Conservation Operations instead of $850,004,000 as proposed by 
the House and $826,635,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes Senate bill language 
that prohibits the discretionary funds in this account from 
being used to provide technical assistance for mandatory farm 
bill programs.
      The conferees direct the Chief of the NRCS, in making the 
fiscal year 2004 Conservation Operations funding allocations to 
the states, to treat items under the heading `Conservation 
Operations' in the Statement of Managers accompanying this 
conference report, as increases to the states' funding 
allocation. The conferees direct the NRCS to provide a report 
to the Committees on Appropriations, not later than 45 days 
after the enactment of this Act, that includes the following: 
fiscal year 2003 Conservation Operations allocation by state; 
fiscal year 2004 Conservation Operations allocation by state; 
fiscal year 2004 Congressional earmarks by state; and the total 
fiscal year 2004 Conservation Operations allocation by state.

Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative. The conferees also 
provide an additional amount of $950,000 for Grazing Lands 
Conservation Initiative activities in the State of Wisconsin.
      The conferees urge NRCS to make EQIP funding available 
for public land contracts to the maximum extent permitted under 
the law. In particular, the conferees are concerned that EQIP 
funding be made available for public land ranchers in states 
such as AZ, NM, ID, UT, OR, CA, CO, and WY to help meet 
regulatory demands and to relieve utilization pressure on 
private lands in those states.

                       RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

      The conference agreement provides $584,000,000 for the 
Rental Assistance Program instead of $731,000,000 as proposed 
by the House and $721,281,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees strongly support the Section 521 rental 
assistance program which helps approximately 264,000 low and 
very-low income rural households by providing a subsidy to 
offset a portion of their rent. The conference agreement 
provides sufficient funding to meet the needs associated with 
program renewals and new construction in fiscal year 2004. 
However, the conferees are concerned that the past budget 
requests for the cost of rental assistance have been overstated 
and have resulted in substantial unliquidated balances. In 
recent years, appropriations provided for five-year rental 
assistance contracts have been sufficient to cover a period of, 
on average, six and one half years. The conference agreement 
changes the contract term from five to four years better to 
reflect the actual costs of existing contracts. The conferees 
support the continuation of multi-year contracts to provide 
stability to the multi-family program. Further, the conference 
agreement provides the Secretary with the authority to carry-
over unexpended funds at the completion of the four-year 
contract period to address future program needs for certain 
purposes.

                  MUTUAL AND SELF-HELP HOUSING GRANTS

      The conference agreement provides $34,000,000 for Mutual 
and Self-Help Housing Grants as proposed by the Senate instead 
of $34,772,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement does not adopt Senate bill 
language regarding Demonstration Housing Grants.

                    RURAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE GRANTS

      The conference agreement provides $46,222,000 for Rural 
Housing Assistance Grants as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$42,222,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conferees provide $5,000,000 for a demonstration 
housing program for processing workers in the states of Alaska, 
Mississippi, Utah and Wisconsin. The conferees encourage the 
Secretary to administer this program through non-profits, 
governmental entities and community based organizations, 
including cooperatives and to fund grants up to 75 percent of 
the total development cost for each project awarded.
      The Department should consider on-site tenant services in 
the selection criteria for projects awarded. The conferees 
encourage the Department to issue a notice of availability of 
funds within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
      The conferees are concerned that only a few states 
benefited from the Supervisory and Technical Assistance Grant 
Program in the fiscal year 2003 allocation, and encourage the 
Secretary to consider an allocation process that will not 
discriminate against other states or regions of the nation. The 
conferees encourage the Secretary to limit funding to any state 
or territory to 10 percent of available funds, and to give 
priority to entities that have experience in homeownership 
education and/or reducing delinquencies and foreclosures. The 
conferees expect the Secretary to provide not less than 
$2,000,000 for the Supervisory and Technical Assistance 
account.

                       FARM LABOR PROGRAM ACCOUNT

the Historic Barn Preservation account as proposed by the 
Senate.

by both the House and Senate.
      The conference agreement provides for a transfer of 
$4,272,000 to the Rural Development salaries and expense 
account instead of $4,283,000 as proposed by the House and the 
Senate.

            RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      The conference agreement provides a loan level of 
$15,002,000 for the Rural Economic Development Loans Program

instead of a $16,120,000 loan level with a subsidy of 
$3,000,000 as proposed by the House.

                  RURAL COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS

      The conference agreement provides $24,000,000 for Rural 
Cooperative Development Grants instead of $13,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $8,967,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement does not include bill language 
that sets aside $500,000 for cooperative research agreements.
      The conference agreement provides $15,000,000 for value-
added agricultural product market development grants.
      The conference agreement adopts language for cooperatives 
or associations of cooperatives, whose primary focus is to 
provide assistance to small, minority producers and whose 
governing board and/or membership is comprised of at least 75 
percent minority.

       RURAL EMPOWERMENT ZONES AND ENTERPRISE COMMUNITIES GRANTS

      The conference agreement provides $12,667,000 for Rural 
Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities Grants instead of 
$10,967,000 as proposed by the House and $14,370,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language providing 
that $1,000,000 shall be for third round empowerment zones.

                        RENEWABLE ENERGY PROGRAM

      The conference agreement provides $23,000,000 for the 
Renewable Energy Program as proposed by the House and the 
Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language that 
provides for guaranteed loans for this account.

                        Rural Utilities Service

   RURAL ELECTRIFICATION AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      The conference agreement provides a total subsidy of 
$185,000 for activities under the Rural Electrification and 
Telecommunications Loans Program Account. The conference

$5,605,000,000 as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$4,655,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement adopts bill language that 
provides guaranteed underwriting loans.
      The conference agreement adopts House language providing 
for a transfer of $37,853,000 to salaries and expenses instead 
of $38,166,000 as proposed by the House and $37,920,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.

      The conference agreement provides $61,116,000 for the

stored scenarios for diagnosis, medical monitoring, and 
emergency purposes. Furthermore, the conferees recognize the 
need for integration and interoperability of real-time remote 
mobile medical technology with other devices, systems, and 
services which together offer increased capabilities, 
functionality, and levels of care.

                    TITLE IV--DOMESTIC FOOD PROGRAMS

Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services

      The conference agreement provides $599,000 for the Office 
of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer 
Services, as proposed by the House, instead of $611,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.

                       Food and Nutrition Service

                        CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS

      The conference agreement provides $11,417,441,000 for 
Child Nutrition Programs, instead of $11,418,441,000, as 
proposed by both the House and Senate. The conference amount 
includes full funding of the request for program expenses, and 
$5,000,000 for a certification study, instead of $6,000,000 as 
requested.
      Included in the total is an appropriated amount of 
$6,717,780,000 and a transfer from section 32 of 
$4,699,661,000.
      The conference agreement includes a provision prohibiting 
use of funds for studies and evaluations, except as 
specifically provided.
      The conferees provide $5,000,000 in one-time funding for 
a study of over and under certification errors and the effect 
those errors have on expenditures in the National School Lunch 
and School Breakfast Programs, and an assessment of the 
feasibility of using income data matching in those programs. 
The conferees are aware that this study will provide 
information necessary to make informed policy decisions 
regarding these programs, but direct the Department to work to 
ensure that neither the design nor implementation of the study 
will discourage participation in these programs by eligible 
children.
      The conferees provide $10,025,000, the same level as 
fiscal year 2003 and the budget request, for the School Meals 
Initiative/Team Nutrition. The conferees believe it is 
important to support physical activity and healthy eating 
habits in children and strongly support the nutrition education 
activities carried out with these funds. The conferees 
encourage the Department to provide additional funding to 
support these efforts as appropriate to combat increased 
obesity and other health problems in children.
      The conference agreement provides the following for Child 
Nutrition programs:

SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN 
                                 (WIC)

      The conference agreement provides $4,639,232,000 for the 
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC), as proposed by the Senate, instead of 
$4,588,310,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement includes no less than 
$15,000,000 for a breastfeeding support initiative. In 
addition, the conference agreement provides up to $25,000,000 
for investments in management information systems, and up to 
$4,000,000 for pilot projects to combat obesity in children, if 
the Secretary determines that those funds are not needed to 
maintain caseload. The conferees provide $23,000,000 for the 
Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, instead of $25,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate, and no funding as proposed by the 
House. The House had funded this program at $20,000,000 under 
the Commodity Assistance Program account.
      The conference agreement does not provide funds to 
increase the WIC contingency fund. The conferees note that 
$125,000,000 was provided for the WIC contingency fund in 
fiscal year 2003, and the entire amount remains available to 
the Secretary to fund program costs if necessary.
      The conferees urge the Secretary to allow state and local 
WIC agencies the flexibility to use breastfeeding promotion and 
support methods and efforts that have yielded positive results, 
in the expenditure of funds provided for under Section 17 for 
the breastfeeding support initiative.
      The conference agreement includes a provision prohibiting 
use of funds for studies and evaluations.

                           FOOD STAMP PROGRAM

      The conference agreement provides $30,945,981,000 for the 
Food Stamp Program, instead of $27,745,981,000, as proposed by 
the House and $29,945,981,000 as proposed by the Senate. 
Included in this amount is a reserve of $3,000,000,000, instead 
of $2,000,000,000, as proposed in the budget request.
      In addition to the $3,000,000,000 for the reserve, the 
conference agreement includes $26,403,176,000 for program 
expenses, $1,402,805,000 for grants to Puerto Rico and Samoa, 
and $140,000,000 for commodity purchase for The Emergency Food 
Assistance Program.
      The conference agreement includes a provision allowing 
for purchase of bison meat, in an amount not to exceed 
$4,000,000, for the Food Distribution Program on Indian 
Reservations (FDPIR).
      The conference agreement includes a provision prohibiting 
use of funds for studies and evaluations.

                      COMMODITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

      The conference agreement provides $150,000,000 for the 
Commodity Assistance Program, instead of $166,072,000, as 
proposed by the House and $145,740,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Within that amount, the conference agreement provides 
$98,919,000 for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, an 
increase of $3,928,000 over the request and the House and 
Senate levels.
      The conferees have provided this increase to address the 
growing caseload in this program. USDA has indicated that, at 
the request level of $94,991,000, the total budgetary resources 
available for fiscal year 2004 for the program--including 
beginning inventory--would be sufficient to support 
participation of 520,642, and caseload of 536,744. The 
conferees expect the Department to make the full amount of 
those budgetary resources available to support participation 
and caseload. The intention of the conferees is to ensure at a 
minimum that the final caseload in September, 2003, can be 
maintained in 2004, while meeting the requirement to protect 
the caseload of states that joined the program in 2003.
      The conferees provide $50,000,000 for administration--
processing, storage, transport, and distribution--of The 
Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). The conference 
agreement includes a general provision that provides the 
Secretary with authority to transfer up to $10,000,000 from 
TEFAP commodity purchases to administration.
      Within this account, the conferees provide $1,081,000 to 
the Food Donations Program for Pacific Island Assistance.
      The conference agreement does not include funding for the 
Farmers' Market Nutrition Program in this account, as proposed 
by the House. Rather, $23,000,000 in funding for that program 
is provided in the account for The Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).
      The conference agreement includes language regarding new 
authorization for assistance to nuclear affected islands.

                   NUTRITION PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION

      The conference agreement provides $138,304,000 for 
Nutrition Programs Administration, as proposed by the Senate, 
instead of $140,512,000 as proposed by the House. Included in 
this amount is not less than $4,000,000 to improve integrity in 
the Food Stamp Program and Child Nutrition Program.
      The conferees provide the same funding level as fiscal 
year 2003 for studies and evaluations in the Nutrition Programs 
Administration account.
      The conference agreement does not include funding for the 
requested initiatives, as proposed by the House.

            TITLE V--FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND RELATED PROGRAMS

                      Foreign Agricultural Service

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $132,148,000 for the 
Foreign Agricultural Service, Salaries and Expenses instead of 
$133,924,000 as proposed by the House and $131,648,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees direct the Secretary to distinguish between 
white (food grade) sorghum and yellow (feed grade) sorghum in 
food aid programs.

     PUBLIC LAW 480 TITLE I AND TITLE II PROGRAM AND GRANT ACCOUNTS

      The conference agreement provides $103,887,000 for Title 
I loan subsidies for a loan level of $132,000,000 as proposed 
by the House instead of $131,670,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides $28,000,000 for Ocean 
Freight Differential as proposed by the House and the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides $1,192,000,000 for 
Public Law 480 Title II as proposed by the House and the 
Senate.
      The following table reflects the conference agreement for 
Public Law 480 program accounts:

Public Law 480

Title 1--Program account:
    Loan authorization, direct..........................  ($132,000,000)
    Loan subsidies......................................     103,887,000
    Ocean freight differential                                28,000,000
Title II--Commodities for disposition abroad:
    Program level....................................... (1,192,000,000)
    Appropriation.......................................   1,192,000,000
Salaries and expenses:
    Foreign Agricultural Service (transfer to FAS)......       1,059,000
    Farm Service Agency (transfer to FSA)...............       1,075,000

      The conferees direct the administration not to place 
arbitrary limits on monetization under the Public Law 480, 
Title II, program. In food-deficit, import-reliant countries, 
monetization stimulates the economy and allows needed 
commodities to be provided in the marketplace. Food aid 
proposals should be approved based on the merits of the program 
plan to promote food security and improve people's lives, not 
on the level of monetization.

  MCGOVERN-DOLE INTERNATIONAL FOOD FOR EDUCATION AND CHILD NUTRITION 
                             PROGRAM GRANTS

      The conference agreement provides $50,000,000 for the 
McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child 
Nutrition Program instead of $56,874,000 as proposed by the 
House and $25,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Although Food for Progress funds may not be used for the 
McGovern-Dole program, the conferees support the goals of that 
program and encourage the Secretary to investigate use of other 
resources, such as 416(b), to carry out activities consistent 
with the goals of the McGovern-Dole program.

       Commodity Credit Corporation Export Loans Program Account

      The conference agreement provides $4,152,000 for the 
Commodity Credit Corporation Export Loans Program Account as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $4,312,000 as proposed by the 
House.

      TITLE VI--RELATED AGENCIES AND FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

including Prescription Drug User Fee Act, Medical Device User 
Fee Act, and Animal Drug User Fee Act collections, of

Drug Administration, instead of $1,668,249,000, as proposed by 
the House and $1,663,228,000, as proposed by the Senate, and 
provides specific amounts by FDA activity as reflected in the 
following table.

      The conference agreement also makes mammography user fees 
and export certification user fees available to the agency.
      Within the total funding for the Food and Drug 
Administration, the following increases above the fiscal year 
2003 level are provided: $20,500,000 for counterterrorism and 
food safety activities; $8,000,000 to reduce review times and 
increase the number of generic drugs on the market; $4,000,000 
for activities to support the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children 
Act; $3,000,000 for activities related to patient safety; 
$650,000 to improve FDA's over the counter drug program; and 
$1,145,000 to continue implementation of the Unified Financial 
Management System. Amounts provided above the budget request 
include: $9,000,000 for increased medical device review; 
$600,000 for the Office of Women's Health; $692,000 for the 
CFSAN Adverse Events Reporting System; $150,000 for the 
Agricultural Products Food Safety Laboratory; and $500,000 for 
dietary supplements.
      The conference agreement includes language allowing for 
the collection and use of authorized user fees, and does not 
allow user fees collected in excess of the limitation to be 
credited to the various accounts and to remain available until 
expended. The conference agreement also allows for fees 
assessed prior to fiscal year 2004 but credited during fiscal 
year 2004 to be added to the account. Language is included to 
release the requirement of Section 521 of P.L. 107-188.
      The conference agreement includes $2,375,000 for 
relocation expenses related to the move of the Center for Drug 
Evaluation and Research offices to the consolidated White Oak 
campus. Carryover funds available in the Prescription Drug User 
Fee Account should fund the remaining amount needed for the 
relocation.
      The conferees are aware that language to authorize the 
Animal Drug User Fee Act has been passed by the House and 
Senate, but has not yet been signed into law. Therefore, the 
conferees have included language in the bill required for FDA 
to collect these fees, but prohibit FDA to begin collection 
until the authorization has been signed into law.
      The conference report provides funding of $21,607,000 for 
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) prevention activities.
      The conference agreement recommendation includes a total 
of $9,445,000 for the Unified Financial Management System 
(UFMS), an increase of $1,145,000. The conferees direct that, 
from this total amount, no less than $4,503,000 is to be 
invested in improvements to FDA's legacy systems and is not to 
be used for UFMS contracts or global UFMS costs.
      The conferees provide $1,900,000 for the Agricultural 
Products Food Safety Laboratory, an increase of $150,000 over 
the fiscal year 2003 level, for FDA to continue its contract 
with New Mexico State University's Physical Sciences Laboratory 
to operate the Food Technology Evaluation Laboratory, which 
conducts evaluation and development of rapid screening 
methodologies, technologies, and instrumentation; and to 
provide technology deployment modeling and data analysis for 
food safety and product safety in order to facilitate FDA's 
regulations and responsibilities in food safety, product 
safety, homeland security, bioterrorism, and other initiatives.
      The conferees direct that no less than $13,270,000 be 
available for grants and contracts awarded under section 5 of 
the Orphan Drug Act.
      The conferees request that FDA report to the Committees 
on its oversight plan regarding the adequacy of current systems 
for the tracking of blood-derived products and patient 
notification of adverse events.
      The conferees are pleased that the FDA has published a 
rule articulating a transition strategy for removing 
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propelled medicines from the U.S. 
market. The conferees are aware that several patient and 
physician organizations which represent those who suffer from 
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease submitted a 
Citizen Petition to the FDA requesting that it take measures to 
remove albuterol from the list of essential uses for CFCs. The 
conferees encourage the FDA to respond to the petition request 
in a timely manner and, if appropriate, expeditiously implement 
a transition strategy as alternative non-CFC products enter the 
U.S. market. The conferees request a report from the agency on 
its course of action regarding this issue, including plans to 
assure adequate access to necessary medications, within 90 days 
of enactment.
      The conferees direct that no less than $53,750,000 of 
total funding appropriated for FDA be provided for the generic 
drugs program.
      The conferees direct that none of the funds made 
available to the Food and Drug Administration in this Act be 
used for any assessments or charges by the Department of Health 
and Human Services (DHHS) unless identified in the FDA budget 
justification and provided in this Act, or approved by the 
Committees through the reprogramming process.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
relating to human resources consolidation, as proposed by the 
House. The directive in the preceding paragraph includes that 
function, as well as all others subject to charges and 
assessments by DHHS.
      The conference agreement includes no less than $250,000 
for research and education activities with the Interstate 
Shellfish Sanitation Commission (ISSC) to focus on efforts 
relating to Vibrio vulnificus.
      The conferees are concerned that FDA registration 
requirements for the licensed beverage industry under the 
Interim Final Rule published October 10, 2003, duplicate the 
requirements of registration at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and 
Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The 
confereesdirect FDA to report to the Committees within 60 days 
of enactment on the scope of duplication, a description of data 
required by FDA but not by TTB, the estimated cost of transferring TTB 
registration data into the FDA system, and the timeframe in which the 
transfer could be accomplished, to avoid duplication and unnecessary 
costs to the industry.
      The conferees are concerned that different Federal 
agencies have published information on the level of methyl 
mercury exposure that is considered safe for humans, which may 
be confusing to consumers. The conferees understand that in the 
last nine months, FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency 
have been working together to develop a single joint advisory 
that will contain advice about all types of fish (commercial 
and locally caught). The conferees expect FDA to provide a copy 
of the resulting draft joint advisory to the Committees by 
January 2, 2004.
      The conferees direct that no less than $250,000 be 
provided to process comments submitted in response to Docket 
No. 95N-0304 published in the Federal Register on March 5, 2003 
(68 FR 10417) and related activities.
      The conferees are aware that the Food and Drug 
Administration has issued a final rule regarding the labeling 
of dietary supplements containing ginseng (68 Fed. Reg. 167, 
August 28, 2003) and has indicated that the industry must be in 
compliance with this labeling rule. The conferees encourage FDA 
to ensure that this final rule is being fully enforced.
      The conferees are aware that on May 6, 2003, the FDA 
issued a draft guidance document on current good manufacturing 
practices for the medical gas industry, and that numerous 
comments were received on this draft prior to the deadline for 
public comments. The conferees expect the Agency to give 
consideration to each of these comments, and to respond to each 
comment accordingly. The conferees also encourage the FDA to 
undertake a risk-based and cost-benefit analysis before 
finalizing this document.
      The conferees direct that of the funding provided, no 
less than $10,900,000, an increase of $500,000 be made 
available for the regulation of dietary supplements.

                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

      The conference agreement includes $7,000,000 for the 
repair and improvement of existing buildings and facilities, 
instead of $6,000,000 as proposed by the House and $7,948,000 
as proposed by the Senate.

                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES

                  Commodity Futures Trading Commission

      The conference agreement provides $90,435,000 for the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, instead of $88,435,000 as 
proposed by both the House and Senate.

                       Farm Credit Administration

                 LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes a limitation of 
$40,900,000 on administrative expenses of the Farm Credit 
Administration (FCA), as proposed by both the House and Senate.

 DIVISION B--COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED 
                     AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS, 2004

                     TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

                         General Administration

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conferees recommend a total of $106,687,000 for 
General Administration, Salaries and Expenses, instead of 
$106,664,000 as proposed by the House and $116,171,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees note that during fiscal year 2003, the 
Justice Department announced a number of new initiatives 
without consulting Congress, including creation of the 
Terrorist Threat Integration Center, the Terrorist Screening 
Center, and the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Councils. These follow 
the proliferation of task forces, a massive and evolving 
reorganization of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 
various database initiatives in the previous fiscal year. No 
legislative proposals have been submitted to establish any of 
these entities; it is unclear what the long term funding needs 
associated with each of these will be; and most importantly, it 
is unclear what the overarching strategy is to reconcile each 
of these entities within the current structure of the Justice 
Department and blend them with other Federal law enforcement 
entities outside the Justice Department to ensure that law 
enforcement at all levels has the tools to effectively combat 
terrorism and protect citizens from traditional crimes. The 
conferees remain supportive of the Justice Department, and 
toward that end direct the Justice Department to submit with 
the fiscal year 2005 budget a rationalization of these various 
efforts with the goal of consolidating efforts to ensure that 
Federal law enforcement enhances its ability to prevent 
terrorist attacks and fight traditional crime.
      The conference agreement adopts by reference House and 
Senate language providing an increase of $7,000,000 for the 
highest priority activities of the Chief Information Officer 
(CIO), as well as House language regarding a report on all 
existing and planned information technology sharing projects, 
and review and coordination of Justice Department information 
technology initiatives. The conferees will consider a 
reprogramming for information technology projects should 
additional funds be necessary. The conferees remain concerned 
with the proliferation of database initiatives and direct the

proposed by both the House and the Senate shall be used for 
counterterrorism investigations, foreign counterintelligence, 
and other activities related to national security.
      Strategic Growth.--Since the terrorist attacks on 
September 11th, 2001, the FBI has shifted its main focus from 
investigating crimes to preventing acts of terrorism. Inherent 
in this transformation is a greater emphasis on collection, 
management, and analysis of data and intelligence, and greater 
collaboration across all levels of law enforcement. The urgency 
to prevent acts of terrorism has required the infusion of 
substantial resources, with the FBI growing by over 50 percent 
in just three years. The conferees believe the FBI should 
thoughtfully absorb this massive infusion of personnel and 
capital through strategic long-term decisions, and therefore 
direct the FBI to submit a five year plan to the Committees on 
Appropriations not later than March 15, 2004, detailing the 
FBI's plan to succeed at its terrorism prevention and law 
enforcement responsibilities, including proposed agent and 
support personnel levels for each division. This review should 
also include long term capital improvement and infrastructure 
plans, training needs, and a review of current and future 
information technology programs to ensure that the FBI can 
better leverage technology.

      The conferees remind the FBI that any changes to this

Explosives (ATF). The conferees point out that the vast 
majority of explosions (more than 95 percent) occurring in the 
United States are not related to terrorism and are usually 
investigated and prosecuted at the State and local level. 
However, the conferees are willing to accept a proposal from 
the Department of Justice to merge and rationalize overlap for 
explosives training between the ATF, the FBI, and other law 
enforcement entities in the Justice Department. Toward that 
end, the conferees direct the Justice Department to submit, as 
part of its fiscal year 2005 budget submission, a proposal to 
better blend and eliminate duplication of explosives training 
and other law enforcement programs at the Department of 
Justice.
      Organized Crime Enterprises.--The conference agreement

that additional training and safeguards are implemented to 
ensure that analysis performed at the new lab is 
unquestionable.
      Field Support for Information Management and Lead 
Management.--The conferees adopt by reference House increases 
of $4,977,000, 100 positions and 50 workyears for field

funding increases for these programs in the context of a 
regular budget submission and priorities established by the 
Director, and pending an analysis of the existing aviation 
program.
      The conferees adopt by reference House language regarding 
submission of an assessment of mobile command centers and the 
VITAL program.
      Information Technology.--The Congress has provided the 
FBI with nearly $595,000,000 for Trilogy, some $216,000,000 
more than the original cost estimate, to both speed 
implementation and enhance the overall capabilities of the 
program. The Committees on Appropriations are concerned that 
the basic software needed to operate the Virtual Case File is 
not ready to be deployed, causing another slip in schedule. The 
conferees stress the importance of deploying this program as 
expeditiously as possible, and direct the Trilogy Program 
Manager and Department of Justice CIO to continue to provide

      The conferees understand the Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention has recently recommended testing all prisoners 
with a history of injection drug use or other risk factors for 
the Hepatitis B and C viruses and that those showing signs of 
liver disease be assessed by hepatitis specialist to determine 
treatment. These recommendations reflect a concern that high 
rates of infection in the prison population lead to public 
health impacts as these prisoners are released back into the 
general population. The conferees request that the BPP report 
to the Committees on Appropriations within six months regarding 
progress in implementing its planned screening program,

      Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.--The 
conference agreement includes $7,000,000 to assist States in 
building or enhancing prescription drug monitoring systems, 
facilitating the exchange of information between States, and 
providing technical assistance and training on establishing and 
operating effective prescription drug monitoring programs.
      Prison Rape Prevention and Prosecution.--The conference 
agreement provides $37,175,000 for implementation of the Prison 
Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-79). The 
conference agreement provides up to $10,000,000 for the 
collection of statistics, data and research as authorized by 
section 4 of the Act; $5,000,000 is provided for the National 
Institute of Corrections for a national clearinghouse, training 
and education as authorized by section 5 of the Act; 
$20,000,000 is provided for grants to States to protect inmates 
and safeguard communities as authorized by section 6 of the 
Act. If the entire $10,000,000 provided for statistics, data 
and research is not utilized, the conferees expect these funds 
to be used to make additional grants to States. An additional 
$2,175,000 shall be transferred to the National Prison Rape 
Reduction Commission.
      Victims of Trafficking.--The conference agreement 
includes $10,000,000 for victim services programs to assist 
victims of trafficking as authorized by the Victims of 
Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. The conferees 
expect the Office of Victims of Crime to work with the Office 
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention on child 
exploitation issues.
      Drug Courts.--The conference agreement provides 
$38,500,000 for the Drug Courts program. The conferees note 
that funding for drug courts is an eligible expense under the 
Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program, the Byrne program, 
and Juvenile Justice Programs.
      Law Enforcement Family Support and Motor Vehicle Theft 
Prevention.--The conferees understand that sufficient funding 
is available in prior year unobligated balances to continue to 
fund these programs during fiscal year 2004.

                       WEED AND SEED PROGRAM FUND

      The conference agreement includes $58,542,000 for the 
Weed and Seed program as provided by the Senate. The conference 
agreement adopts by reference the House report language 
requiring OJP to submit a report to the Committees on 
Appropriations on the coordination of the Weed and Seed program 
with Project Safe Neighborhoods, the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction 
Initiative and other Department of Justice and Federal 
programs.

                  COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES

      The conference agreement includes $756,283,000 for 
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) programs instead of 
$682,933,000 as proposed by the House and $656,636,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement provides 
significant resources above the request to enhance the ability 
of the COPS office to accomplish their mission of advancing 
community policing practices. While the conferees appreciate 
the Administration's need to address its Federal 
counterterrorism responsibility, this need should not preclude 
the Administration from executing other law enforcement 
responsibilities such as local law enforcement programs aimed 
at ensuring community safety.
      The table below displays the funding provided in the 
conference agreement compared to the level of funds requested 
under the COPS and Justice Assistance headings for similar 
activities and compared to the levels provided in the House and 
Senate bills.

      COPS Hiring Program.--The conference agreement includes 
$120,000,000 for the hiring of law enforcement officers, of 
which $60,000,000 shall be for school resource officers. From 
within available amounts, $5,000,000 is for training and 
technical assistance. The conference agreement adopts by 
reference the House report language concerning events of 
national or regional importance and directing COPS to submit a 
report to the Committees on Appropriations on ``best 
practices'' within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
      Bulletproof Vests.--The conference agreement includes 
$25,000,000 for the Bulletproof Vests program. The conferees 
request that the Department of Justice conduct a study and 
submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations on the 
National Institute of Justice's (NIJ) voluntary testing 
protocols and minimum standards for body armor to determine the 
extent to which the efficiency of those voluntary testing 
protocols and minimum standards for body armor correlates with 
successful and improved law enforcement officer and public 
safety, and include any recommendations for improving the 
efficiency and safety of these voluntary testing protocols and 
minimum standards for body armor. The report must address, but 
is not limited to, the criteria used by the NIJ to establish 
voluntary standards of testing and evaluation to identify 
minimum performance standards for body armor critical to 
protecting officers from ballistic threats; when the NIJ last 
updated the minimum performance standards for body armor; the 
qualifications and factors used by the NIJ to determine the 
need to update minimum performance standards for body armor; 
why the NIJ testing protocols only rate body armor in the 
newest possible condition; and why the NIJ does not test the 
deterioration of body armor actually worn by officers in the 
field to determine if such materials and body armor constitutes 
to comply with the NIJ minimum performance standards during the 
warranty period of the body armor.
      Police Corps.--The conference agreement includes 
$15,000,000 for the Police Corps program. The conferees are 
disappointed that the Police Corps program did not submit a 
fiscal year 2003 financial plan as requested in the fiscal year 
2003 conference report. The conferees believe it is important 
for this program to standardize the funding provided for 
recruit training and require State matching funds for training 
costs. The conferees are also disappointed that the Police 
Corps program has not submitted the requested report describing 
OJP's efforts to incorporate terrorism prevention and response 
training into the Police Corps program and discussing the 
feasibility of establishing regional Police Corps training 
centers. The conferees expect this report to be submitted as 
soon as possible and the conference agreement again directs OJP 
to submit a Police Corps financial plan no later than 180 days 
after enactment of this Act.
      Methamphetamine Enforcement and Clean-Up.--The conference 
agreement includes $54,050,000 for State and local law 
enforcement programs to combat methamphetamine production and 
distribution, to target drug ``hot spots,'' and to remove and 
dispose of hazardous materials at clandestine methamphetamine 
labs.
      Within the amount provided, the conference agreement 
includes $20,000,000 to reimburse the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) for assistance to State and local law 
enforcement for proper removal and disposal of hazardous 
materials at clandestine methamphetamine labs. The conference 
agreement provides $5,000,000 for training, technical 
assistance and grants to localitieswith highest priority needs. 
The conference agreement adopts by reference the House report language 
concerning coordination with other Federal agencies.
      In addition, within the amount provided, the conferees 
expect the COPS Program Office, in consultation with DEA, to 
examine each of the following proposals, to provide grants if 
warranted, and to submit a report to the Committees on 
Appropriations on its intentions for each proposal:

Communications Technology Program, in consultation with the 
Office of Science and Technology (OS&T) within the NIJ, as well 
as the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). This program shall 
utilize the expertise of all three organizations to create a 
grant program that is highly responsive to the immediate needs 
of the State and local law enforcement community and that takes 
full advantage of the expertise and lessons learned from OS&T's 
and BJA's research and development in the field of 
interoperable law enforcement communications, particularly 
project AGILE.
      This program should address the critical need of law 
enforcement to improve cross-jurisdictional communication, 
intelligence and information sharing. Grants shall be 
exclusively available to law enforcement agencies. Consistent 
with the existing COPS grant programs, the COPS Interoperable 
Communications Technology Program should include a 25 percent 
local match requirement and be available to both rural and 
urban communities.

      The conferees continue to support the implementation of 
the Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System program and the 
National Water Level Operation Network, including work in the 
Great Lakes.
      The conference agreement includes funding to increase 
coastal ocean monitoring and prediction efforts for West 
Florida.
      The conferees recognize and support the work of NOAA and 
the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (CRTF) to protect and preserve 
coral reefs. Coral reefs are the most complex, species-rich and 
productive marine ecosystems. Reefs cover two percent of the 
ocean's floor, yet they support one-third of all marine fish 
species and tens of thousands of other marine species, 
providing essential fish habitat for endangered and threatened 
species, and harboring protected marine mammals and turtles. 
Coral reef fisheries yield 6 million metric tons of fish catch 
annually, with one-quarter of total worldwide fish production 
occurring in developing countries with coral reefs. NOAA and 
the CRTF are developing and implementing coordinated efforts to 
map and monitor U.S. coral reefs, research coral reef 
degradation, reduce and mitigate coral reef degradation from 
pollution and other causes, and carry out strategies to promote 
conservation and sustainable use of coral reefs 
internationally.
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, language 
proposed by the Senate under the headings of Budget Structure 
and Various. The conference agreement consolidates all NOAA 
coral reef funding under NOS. The conferees expect NOAA to 
prepare a spending plan for coral reef funding and deliver to 
the Committees on Appropriations, not later than January 15, 
2004.
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, language 
proposed by the Senate under the heading of Coastal Ocean 
Science.
      The conferees have provided a significant amount of 
funding during the past two years for the establishment of an 
integrated interagency ocean and coastal observing system. The 
conferees understand that NOAA has outlined a strategy for 
establishing a national network. The conferees expect regional 
entities to share the costs of the funding the establishment of 
an integrated interagency ocean and coastal observing system. 
Therefore, the conferees plan to require all participants 
receiving funding from the Federal government to contribute an 
equal share of funds in fiscal year 2005.
      Of the amounts available under the Aquatic Resources 
Initiative, up to $750,000 is for Bluegrass Pride, Inc.
      The conference agreement includes a new structure as 
proposed in the Senate bill for identifying and funding 
extramural research. The conferees direct NOAA to submit a 
spending plan within 30 days outlining the process for 
administering the program. The conferees do not intend for the 
new structure to restrict current participation by the external 
research community or by researchers identified with the 
National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science laboratories. The 
conferees do intend, however, that greater interaction and 
participation occur between the external research community and 
Federal researchers located at NOAA's laboratories.


                   NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE

      The conference agreement includes $639,990,000 for the 
operations of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, language 
proposed by the House under the heading of Regulatory 
Streamlining.

Enforcement, Enforcement and Surveillance, International 
Conservation of Sea Turtles, Decline Pacific Marine Mammals, 
Enforcement of International Dolphin Agreement, Gulf/Atlantic 
Turtle Excluder Devices, Fisheries Research and Management, 
Seafood Inspections, and Ecosystem Management.
      The conferees remain concerned regarding the seismic and 
erosion conditions near the Southwest Fisheries Science Center 
(SWSC). The conferees understand that economies of scale may be 
achieved by collocating the SWSC with other NOAA facilities in 
California. In 1997, the Department of Commerce Office of the 
Inspector General issued a report, which highlighted options 
for relocation of the SWSC. The Committee directs NOAA to issue 
a follow-on report on the best location for SWSC facilities by 
no later than June 30, 2004.
      The conferees expect NMFS to allocate sufficient funds to 
achieve ten percent observer coverage in the New England 
groundfish fishery, and in the non-directed fishery to the 
extent practicable, by no later than May 1, 2004.
      The conferees expect NOAA to continue to support the 
Center for Coastal Studies' efforts regarding right whale 
protection and expect the final funding allocation to be based 
on recommendations of the right whale program coordinator at 
the Center.
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, language 
proposed by the House under the headings of Chesapeake Bay, 
Habitat Conservation and Management, NMFS Facilities 
Maintenance, and Saltonstall-Kennedy.
      The conferees recognize the value of NOAA presence and 
programs in Louisiana in serving the northern Gulf of Mexico 
region. The conferees expect a report to be submitted by the 
agency on the development and installation of a Coastal 
Services Center to be established in the state and to serve the 
Northern Gulf of Mexico Region.
      The conferees understand that on February 21, 2003, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued 
new regulations to increase the dimension of Turtle Excluder 
Device (TED) openings to protect endangered sea turtles. The 
Final Rule went into effect on April 15, 2003 in the South 
Atlantic and August 21, 2003, in the Gulf of Mexico. Industry 
representatives in Louisiana and South Texas have voiced 
concern about the impact of TEDs on shrimp catch and loss of 
income for the industry. Conservation groups and scientists, on 
the other hand, have expressed serious concern over the status 
of these turtle populations and have threatened litigation to 
ensure sea turtle protection. The conferees direct NOAA to work 
with the National Academy of Sciences on a multi-year, 
comprehensive in-water study designed to accurately measure 
shrimp fishery effort and the impacts of such effort on sea 
turtle mortality, including measuring turtle-shrimp trawl 
interaction in the inshore, nearshore and offshore waters of 
the Gulf of Mexico and similar geographical locations in the 
South Atlantic. The conferees expect observers to be placed on 
the commercial shrimp fishing vessels for the purposes of the 
study.
      The study shall evaluate innovative technologies to 
increase shrimp retention in TEDs but also ensure the 
protection of endangered and threatened sea turtles. The 
National Academy of Sciences shall provide an interim report to 
the committee every six months summarizing preliminary 
findings.
      The conference agreement includes language transferring 
funding to the Marine Mammal Commission.
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, language 
proposed by the Senate regarding the Gulf and South Atlantic 
Fisheries Development Foundation.

House, instead of $59,414,000 as provided by the Senate. The 
conferees are supportive of the funding increases and report 
language included in the Senate report concerning data systems, 
additional personnel, and the Metrocheck transit subsidy 
program. Within the funding level provided, the conferees ask 
the Court to fund these programs to the maximum extent possible 
based the Court's priorities. The Court's financial plan is 
expected to outline the Court's allocation of funding among 
these priorities. As described in the Senate report, the Court 
is also expected to report to the Committees on Appropriations 
on the savings associated with hiring systems accountants to 
replace contractors.
      The conferees adopt by reference the House report 
language concerning minority hiring and diversity among law 
clerks.

                    CARE OF THE BUILDING AND GROUNDS

      The conference agreement includes $10,591,000 for the 
Supreme Court ``Care of the Building and Grounds'' account, as 
provided by the House, instead of $4,658,000 as provided by the 
Senate. The conference agreement adopts by reference the House 
report language concerning the submission of a study, within 90 
days of enactment of this Act, on the feasibility of 
establishing a visitor screening site outside of the Supreme 
Court building.

         united States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $20,662,000 for the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, as 
provided by the Senate, instead of $20,665,000 as provided by 
the House. The conference agreement provides no funding to 
establish a Deputy Circuit Executive, as described in the 
Senate report.

               United States Court of International Trade

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $14,068,000 for the 
U.S. Court of International Trade, as provided by the House, 
instead of $13,210,000 as provided by the Senate.

    Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $3,994,176,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Courts of Appeals, District Courts 
and Other Judicial Services instead of $4,004,176,000 as 
provided by the House and $3,894,021,000 as provided by the 
Senate.
      The conferees would like to see greater emphasis on 
automation in local courts. The conferees understand that the 
time required to hear Court cases can be reduced by as much as 
15 percent through the use of technologies in the courtroom. 
The Conferees direct the Judiciary to continue to implement 
these new technologies in courtrooms.
      The conferees adopt by reference the Senate report 
language requiring a report on the savings generated by the CM/
ECF program and requiring a report on the Court Operations 
Support Center. The conferees adopt by reference the House 
report language concerning Electronic Public Access fees.
      The conferees are concerned with the methodology used to 
prepare and the presentation of the Judiciary's information 
technology budget and long-range plan. The conferees expect the 
Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO) to work 
with the Committees on Appropriations on the presentation of 
funding requests for this program. The conferees are concerned 
with the presentation of new initiatives in the O&M budget, and 
as well as the large amount of O&M funding required in 
proportion to the total information technology budget request.
      The conferees understand that the Judiciary's staffing, 
operations and maintenance, and information technology 
resources are allocated to the courts according to formulas 
intended to equitably distribute resources based on the actual 
workload of each district. The conferees direct the Judiciary 
to update the formulas to improve their accuracy. The updates 
should incorporate changes in the courts' resource needs to 
reflect the implementation of technology enhancements such as 
the CM/ECF project and the unique situations that occur in 
districts with large geographic divisions. The conferees direct 
the Judiciary to report within 180 days of enactment of this 
Act on the Judiciary's efforts to update these formulas.
      The Edwin L. Nelson Local Initiative Program.--The 
conferees have learned that many courts are developing 
significant IT solutions to meet local needs. The entire 
Judiciary receives greatbenefit from the development of 
automation initiatives at the local court level and the sharing of this 
technology with other courts will realize precious savings throughout 
the Judiciary. The conferees noted the inclusion of an Information 
Technology Grant program in the ``Long Range Plan for Information 
Technology in the Federal Judiciary'', specifically goal 7, initiative 
1. The conferees fully support this program. However the conferees 
understand that even though funding was included in previous years' 
financial plans, no grants for this program have been awarded in fiscal 
years 2002 or 2003. To accelerate the pace of this program, the 
conferees direct that no less than $2,000,000 shall be made available 
for the Edwin L. Nelson Local Initiatives Program. These funds shall be 
used to establish and operate a National Clearing House, facilitate 
local court collaboration, expand training opportunities at the circuit 
level, and provide Information Technology Grants. The conferees direct 
the development and execution of this new Edwin L. Nelson Local 
Initiatives Program shall be coordinated with United States Judicial 
Conference Committee on Information Technology. The conferees direct 
the AO to report to the Committees on Appropriations, within 90 days of 
enactment of this Act, on the proposed process and structure to operate 
the Clearing House, evaluate initiatives, distribute grants, conduct 
training and execute the Local Initiatives Program, as approved by the 
Judicial Conference. In addition, the AO shall report the status of 
this program no later than April 1 and September 1, 2004. The status 
reports shall contain, at a minimum, an activity report from the 
Clearing House, a list of courts receiving grants including the purpose 
and amount of each grant and any training conducted.

                 VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION TRUST FUND

      The conference agreement provides $3,193,000 from the 
Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund instead of $3,293,000 as 
provided by the House and the Senate.

                           DEFENDER SERVICES

      The conference agreement includes $604,477,000 for the 
Federal Judiciary's Defender Services account, instead of 
$613,948,000 as provided by the House and $595,006,000 as 
provided by the Senate.
      The conference agreement does not provide any increases 
in panel attorney hourly pay rates above the current rates. The 
conference agreement adopts by reference the House and Senate 
report language concerning future budget requests for panel 
attorney pay rate increases. Conferees expect the Judiciary to 
address these concerns before requesting panel attorney rate 
increases above the rate of inflation.

                    FEES OF JURORS AND COMMISSIONERS

      The conference agreement includes $57,822,000 for Fees of 
Jurors and Commissioners, instead of $53,181,000 as provided by 
the House and Senate. The conferees understand the Judiciary's 
``First Day'' statistics show that the percentage of petit 
jurors called that are not selected, serving or challenged on 
their first day has increased from 33 percent in fiscal year 
1997 to 39 percent in fiscal year 2002. The conferees are 
concerned with the decline in juror utilization rates and the 
associated increase in costs. The conferees direct the Judicial 
Conference of the United States to report to the Committees on 
Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this Act on (1) 
the reasons for the decline in juror utilization, (2) the 
impact the implementation of the Jury Modernization System has 
had on juror utilization, and (3) recommendations on how the 
Judiciary can improve the efficiency with which it calls petit 
jurors.

                             COURT SECURITY

      The conference agreement includes $277,500,000 for the 
Federal Judiciary's Court Security account, instead of 
$288,941,000 as provided by the House and $266,058,000 as 
provided by the Senate.
      The conferees adopt by reference the House report 
language requiring a monthly report on court security equipment 
and systems spending throughout fiscal year 2004. The Conferees 
are concerned about the delay in submitting the management 
study the United States Marshals Service (USMS) was directed to 
conduct in fiscal year 2003 and hope this study will provide 
recommendations to improve the administration of this program 
by the USMS and the Judiciary.

           Administrative Office of the United States Courts

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $66,000,000 for the 
Administrative Office of the United States Courts instead of 
$66,968,000 as provided by the House and $63,717,000 as 
provided by the Senate. The conferees adopt by reference the 
Senate report language concerning cyclical replacement of 
automation equipment and the Senate report language directing 
the AO to develop a comprehensive records management plan and 
inform the Committees on Appropriations of this plan as soon as 
possible. In addition, the conferees adopt by reference the 
Senate report language requiring the submission of semi-annual 
reports to the Committees on Appropriations on travel expenses 
associated with AO personnel by directorate.

                        Federal Judicial Center

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $21,440,000 for 
salaries and expenses of the Federal Judicial Center as 
provided by the House, instead of $22,434,000 as provided by 
the Senate. The conferees laud the Center's education and 
training program and believe it can be a model for training 
programs in the Federal government.

                       Judicial Retirement Funds

                    PAYMENT TO JUDICIARY TRUST FUNDS

      The conference agreement includes $29,000,000 for payment 
to various judicial retirement funds, as provided by the House 
and Senate.

                  United States Sentencing Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $12,354,000 for the 
U.S. Sentencing Commission, instead of $12,746,000 as provided 
by the House and $12,011,000 as provided by the Senate.

                   General Provisions--The Judiciary

      Section 301.--The conference agreement includes a 
provision included by both the House and Senate allowing 
appropriations to be used for services as authorized by 5 
U.S.C. 3109.
      Section 302.--The conference agreement includes a 
provision related to the transfer of funds.
      Section 303.--The conference agreement includes a 
provision allowing up to $11,000 to be used for official 
representation expenses of the Judicial Conference of the 
United States.

            TITLE IV--DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCY

      In total, the conference agreement includes 
$8,264,072,000 for the Department of State and the Broadcasting 
Board of Governors. Of the total amount provided, 
$8,129,093,000 is derived from general purpose discretionary 
funds and $134,979,000 is scored as mandatory spending. This 
funding level includes significant program increases to improve 
diplomatic readiness and security. The conference agreement 
includes $1,508,101,000 to continue worldwide security 
activities, including the design and construction of 
replacement facilities for the most vulnerable overseas posts.

                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE

      The conference agreement for the Department of State is 
intended to continue the Department's efforts to achieve 
diplomatic readiness, strengthen diplomatic and border 
security, and institute sweeping management reforms. In the 
past four fiscal years, the Congress has provided 
appropriations increases of over 44 percent for the 
Department's operating budget, including funding to support the 
hiring and training of more than 2,000 new employees.
      The conference agreement includes a total of 
$7,706,639,000 for fiscal year 2004 for the Department of 
State. Of the total amount provided, $7,571,660,000 is derived 
from general purpose discretionary funds and $134,979,000 is 
scored as mandatory spending. The overall funding level for 
fiscal year 2004 represents an additional 8.9 percent increase 
to the operating budget, which will support up to 603 new 
positions. The conferees expect that this funding level will 
allow the Department to meet critical embassy security and 
staffing requirements, modernize its technology and equipment, 
and continue vigorous management reform initiatives to right-
size America's overseas presence.
      The conference agreement includes a total of 
$5,969,805,000 for the discretionary appropriation accounts 
under Administration of Foreign Affairs; $1,465,305,000 for 
International Organizations; $57,795,000 for International 
Commissions; and $78,755,000 for other activities. The 
conferees' priorities for the Department of State are 
delineated in the following paragraphs.

                   Administration of Foreign Affairs

                    DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS

      The conference agreement includes $4,106,701,000 for the 
Diplomatic and Consular Programs account, instead of 
$4,099,961,000 as proposed by the House and $3,874,778,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement includes 
$646,701,000 to continue funding for worldwide security 
upgrades, $301,563,000 for public diplomacy programs, and 
$40,000,000 for worldwide OpenNet and classified connectivity 
infrastructure. The conference agreement represents an increase 
of $210,868,000 above the fiscal year 2003 appropriation.
      The conference agreement includes a program increase of 
$72,572,000 to support the hiring and training of new foreign 
service and civil service employees, including foreign service 
positions dedicated to visa adjudication as described in both 
the House and Senate reports. The conferees are concerned that 
not all of the new full-time equivalents hired by the 
Department under the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative (DRI) are 
available for worldwide deployment. One of the primary 
objectives of the DRI was to allow the Department to address 
staffing shortages at U.S. diplomatic posts overseas. The 
Department shall submit a report to the Committees, no later 
than February 1, 2004, on the number of personnel hired under 
DRI that are not available for worldwide deployment and on the 
Department's plan for ensuring that personnel yet to be hired 
under DRI are available for worldwide deployment. To the 
greatest extent possible Foreign Service Officers hired during 
the third and final year of DRI should be available for 
worldwide deployment.
      The conferees urge the Department to move forward 
expeditiously with its right-sizing plan. Right-sizing refers 
to the reconfiguration of overseas U.S. Government personnel to 
the number necessary to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals. The 
conferees recognize that, as the property manager for all U.S. 
Government properties overseas, the Department of State faces 
considerable pressure to accommodate ever-greater numbers of 
non-State Department personnel in its overseas facilities.
      For any right-sizing framework to be effective, it must 
have two main components: (1) a process for determining, 
internally, the appropriate numbers of State Department 
personnel stationed overseas, and (2) an interagency process 
for determining the appropriate numbers of non-military U.S. 
government personnel stationed overseas. To this end, the 
conference agreement includes up to $2,000,000 for the 
Department to establish and operate an Office on Right-Sizing 
the United States Overseas Presence, and adopts, by reference, 
the language on this matter in the House report. The conferees 
expect this new Office, which shall report directly to the 
Undersecretary for Management, to lead the Department's effort 
to develop internal and interagency mechanisms to better 
coordinate, rationalize, and manage the deployment of U.S. 
government personnel overseas.
      The conferees commend the Department for its recent steps 
to strengthen internal processes for determining staffing 
projections for overseas personnel needs. However, more needs 
to be done. The conferees are not aware of any right-sizing 
analysis in the past three years that has resulted in a 
proposed reduction to a country-wide staffing presence. The 
conferees are supportive of the concept of regionalization. 
Regionalization refers to the practice of basing certain 
administrative functions and personnel in regional centers, or 
``hubs'', thereby creating efficiencies. The conferees note 
that the Department has made less than notable progress towards 
developing an interagency right-sizing process. The conferees 
urge the Department, with the Office of Management and Budget, 
to take the lead in establishing an interagency process for 
developing staffing projections for U.S. government facilities 
overseas. The conferees support the Department's cost-sharing 
plan which will encourage other Federal agencies to examine 
more closely whether the personnel they send overseas are truly 
mission-critical. The conferees remind the Department that this 
interagency process should not supercede the authority of the 
Chiefs of Mission (COM) to determine the composition of their 
posts, but rather to serve as a tool and support mechanism for 
the COM's. The post must remain at the center of the right-
sizing process.
      The conference agreement includes the requirements 
stipulated in the House report regarding a report on the impact 
of new staffing analysis requirements in the Mission 
Performance Planning process, and the direction to undertake a 
review and report on the size of the largest overseas missions 
using the mission performance plan and the right-sizing 
criteria developed by the General Accounting Office.
      The conference agreement includes program increases as 
described in the House report for Trafficking in Persons, 
International Summits, International Religious Freedom, and re-
establishing a United States Mission to the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
      The conference agreement includes language specifying 
that $301,563,000 is available only for public diplomacy 
programs. The conference agreement continues support for 
special program initiatives in the Arab and Muslim world, which 
were significantly expanded in fiscal years 2002 and 2003.
      The conferees are aware of the recently completed report 
of the Advisory Panel on Public Diplomacy, and the Department's 
response to the Panel's recommendations. The amounts provided 
for public diplomacy under this heading and under ``Educational 
and Cultural Exchange Programs'', including a reallocation of 
base funding toward the Arab and Muslim World, will allow the 
Department to pursue the Panel's recommendations. The conferees 
urge the Department to act expeditiously on several items 
proposed by the Panel, including the establishment of an office 
of policy, plans and resources within the Office of the Under 
Secretary; strengthening the authority of the Under Secretary 
for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs and improving 
accountability for public diplomacy resources; improved 
interagency coordination; increased resources dedicated to 
program performance measurement and research; expansion of 
English language office, speaker and fellows programs; 
expansion of American studies programs including American 
Corners; and increased public diplomacy staff with better 
language skills. The conferees expect that significant 
resources from the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative will be 
allocated to increased Public Diplomacy staff resources and 
training.
      The conference agreement includes, by reference, language 
in the Senate report regarding the refining of public diplomacy 
strategy, including the harmonization of mission and strategy 
with the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the incorporation 
of public diplomacy into ongoing international assistance and 
volunteer programs.
      The conference agreement includes $646,701,000 for 
worldwide security upgrades as proposed by the House, instead 
of $594,373,000 as proposed by the Senate. This conference 
agreement includes $542,998,000 to provide full year costs of 
maintaining base security activities at current levels. These 
activities include perimeter security upgrades, guard services, 
physical security equipment, armored vehicles, personnel, 
training and wireless communications. The conference agreement 
includes $7,952,000 for 85 additional security professional 
staff positions and $25,300,000 for completion of the initial 
multi-year plan to enhance perimeter security at 243 posts, and 
technical upgrades at annexes and other buildings not included 
in the original program. The conferees note that funds provided 
under this category may be used for protection and security 
costs in Kabul, Afghanistan. The conference agreement also 
includes up to $3,000,000 for State Department participation in 
the TOPOFF III national counterterrorism exercise and 
$5,000,000 for the Center for Antiterrorism and Security 
Training.
      The conference agreement includes $736,013,000 for the 
Department's Border Security program, to be funded entirely 
though collection of Machine Readable Visa (MRV) fees. The 
fiscal year 2004 program level is an increase of $119,192,000, 
and includes a program increase of 125 new consular positions. 
The conference agreement does not include language proposed in 
the Senate bill regarding the automatic transfer of funding to 
the Border Security program in the event of MRV fee shortfalls. 
The Department received an appropriation of $109,500,000 in 
Public Law 108-106 to cover the estimated shortfall. However, 
the underlying problem--that a decline in visa fee revenue 
could disrupt the Border Security program--remains. The 
conferees direct the Department to submit a plan, no later than 
April 2, 2004, to ensure that visa fee revenueshortfalls do not 
disrupt the Department's critical border security operations in fiscal 
year 2004 or beyond. The conferees urge the Department to continue to 
work on an interagency basis to strengthen the visa process to make it 
an effective antiterrorism tool, while avoiding the creation of 
unnecessary barriers or delays to legitimate travel to the United 
States.
      The conference agreement includes language designating 
$40,000,000 under this account for worldwide OpenNet and 
classified connectivity infrastructure. These costs were 
requested under the Capital Investment Fund. While that account 
was the appropriate one for funding the costs of developing and 
deploying these automation initiatives, the conferees agree 
that the costs of sustaining these systems, including hardware 
replacement and refreshment, are more appropriately funded 
under this heading.
      The conference agreement includes, by reference, language 
in the House report on the Africa Policy Advisory Panel, the 
interagency task force to monitor the United Nations 
headquarters renovation project, minority hiring and 
recruiting, overseas schools, extradition, security of 
classified material, Tibet, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, 
and U.S. presence in China. The conference agreement also 
includes, by reference, language in the Senate report on 
financial operations, foreign language proficiency, and 
international trade; and language and corresponding funding 
levels pertaining to the Arctic Council and the Bering Straits 
Commission.
      The conferees expect the Department and the Bureau of 
International Organization Affairs to place top priority on 
international human rights protection and advocacy, and to 
submit a report to the Committees by December 15, 2003, 
presenting an international human rights agenda and work plan 
for the coming year. In addition, the conferees expect the 
Department to continue the effort begun last year to make funds 
available to each U.S. Embassy to translate into the official 
language of the host country the report for the host country 
from the ``Country Reports on Human Rights Practices'', the 
``Annual Report on International Religious Freedom'', and the 
``Trafficking in Persons Report'' within 30 days of issuance, 
and post those documents on the embassy website along with the 
English version. The Department shall notify the Committees by 
January 31, 2004, if there are any U.S. Embassies that do not 
comply with this requirement.
      The conference agreement includes such funds as necessary 
for costs associated with fulfilling United States 
responsibilities with regard to participation in 
interparliamentary meetings, including North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe meetings taking place during fiscal year 2004.
      The conference agreement includes language, as in the 
previous fiscal year, providing that funds under this heading 
may be used for a United States Government interagency task 
force to examine, coordinate, and oversee United States 
participation in the United Nations headquarters renovation 
project.
      The conference agreement includes up to $10,000,000 for 
continuing language education programs, as described in the 
Senate report.
      The conference agreement also includes up to $500,000 for 
a cultural antiquities task force as described in the Senate 
report. The task force will coordinate with all relevant 
Federal law enforcement and cultural agencies to prevent 
further looting and promote preservation of Iraq's historically 
and culturally significant works. The conferees urge the 
Department to create a database as described in the Senate 
report. The conferees further urge the Department to make 
changes to visa policies as they pertain to persons found to 
have looted, damaged, or trafficked historically or culturally 
significant works. The Department shall submit a report to the 
Committees no later than April 15, 2004, on the Department's 
progress towards establishing the task force. This report 
should include recommendations concerning the database and 
changes in visa policy.
      The conference agreement includes up to $2,000,000 for 
the Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation, as described 
in the Senate report.
      The conferees are concerned that the Department's policy 
of rotating Foreign Service Officers may hinder the work of the 
Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific 
Affairs (OES). The successful negotiation of effective 
international agreements often takes place over an extended 
period of time and relies heavily on historical and 
institutional knowledge of the pertinent issues. The rotation 
of officers on a three year cycle may inhibit the development 
of such knowledge. The conferees direct the Department to 
report to the Committees no later than July 1, 2004, on the 
impact of such personnel policies on the United States' ability 
to negotiate effective international environmental treaties. 
From within the amount available to the OES Bureau, the 
conferees agree that up to $1,000,000 may be available for 
international health affairs.
      The conferees remain concerned about the adequacy of the 
Department's efforts to counter the serious problem of 
international child abductions. The conferees direct that the 
Department use the authorities in existing law to prohibit the 
issuance of visas to international child abductors. The 
conferees also direct that, henceforward, the Department 
require that children over the age of one year and under the 
age of 14 be physically present at the time of application for 
a United States passport, or renewal thereof. The conference 
agreement includes up to $1,300,000 to promote international 
information sharing to combat child pornography as described in 
the Senate report.
      The conferees direct the Department to undertake a 
general survey of foreign missions operating throughout the 
United States as part of a performance measurement of the work 
of the Office of Foreign Missions. The Department shall report 
to the Committees on the findings of this survey no later than 
October 1, 2004.
      The conferees are aware of dissatisfaction with the 
Department's position regarding certain shipments of mahogany 
lumber from Brazil. It is the understanding of the conferees 
that the required export permits were obtained by the 
proprietor of theseshipments from the Government of Brazil, in 
accordance with existing law. The conferees expect the Department to 
facilitate the resolution of this matter in a way that is equitable and 
consistent with U.S. law.
      The conferees urge the Department, in consultation with 
the Department of Commerce, to ensure that U.S. conservation 
standards are applied to foreign fisheries that wish to import 
fish products to the U.S., consistent with Public Law 101-162. 
The conferees direct the Department to submit an enforcement 
plan to the Committees by April 1, 2004, as described in the 
House and Senate reports. The Secretary of State and the 
Secretary of Commerce shall establish standards and measures 
for bycatch reduction that are comparable to U.S. standards, as 
described in the Senate report.
      As in previous years, the conferees expect that there 
will be additional savings available to the Department, 
including exchange rate gains and vacancies in funded 
positions. The Department will have the ability to propose that 
savings be used for needs not funded by the recommendation 
through the normal reprogramming process. The conferees are 
concerned about the Department's practice of resubmitting 
reprogramming requests that have previously been denied by the 
Committees on Appropriations. Reprogrammings should be 
resubmitted only if the circumstances surrounding the request 
or the request itself change substantially enough to warrant a 
reevaluation by the Committees.

                        CAPITAL INVESTMENT FUND

      The conference agreement includes $80,000,000 for the 
Capital Investment Fund, instead of $142,000,000 as proposed by 
the House and $207,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. In 
addition, the conferees expect that $114,000,000 in expedited 
passport fees will be used to support the information 
technology modernization effort, for a total fiscal year 2004 
spending availability of $194,000,000.
      The entire amount available under this heading, including 
fees, will support investments in new information technologies 
to improve the efficiency of Department operations. Costs 
associated with ongoing information technology operations and 
maintenance, including $40,000,000 for equipment replacement 
requested under this account, are funded under the Diplomatic 
and Consular Programs account.
      The conferees encourage the Department to allocate 
funding under this heading to the following high priority 
projects: the SMART messaging initiative; public key 
infrastructure; and up to $8,000,000 for the wide area network/
thin client prototype.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      The conference agreement includes $31,703,000 for the 
Office of Inspector General (OIG) as proposed by the Senate, 
instead of $29,777,000 as proposed by the House. The conference 
agreement includes language, as carried in previous years, 
waiving the requirement for a five-year post inspection cycle. 
The conference agreement does not include language in the 
Senate report on conducting risk and threat assessments.

               EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS

      The conference agreement includes a total of $320,000,000 
under this heading, instead of $345,346,000 as proposed by the 
House and $255,292,000 as proposed by the Senate. The following 
chart displays the conference agreement on the distribution of 
funds by program or activity under this account, including an 
estimated $7,650,000 in prior year recoveries and unobligated 
balances:

Act.
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, language 
in the House report on the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange 
program; Fulbright exchanges with Tibet; the Leaders in 
Education Initiative; Traditional Public-Private Partnership 
grants; artistic and cultural exchanges; minimizing unnecessary 
barriers to legitimate travel of exchange program participants; 
the priority of enhanced support for engaging Arab and Muslim 
audiences through exchange programs; the allocation of funding 
under this heading for the Near East and South Asia regions; 
and the allocation of all resources under this account in 
accordance with worldwide policy priorities.
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, language 
in the Senate report regarding a program for Afghan women; the 
Fulbright program in Iraq; and a Council of American Overseas 
Research Centers program on diamond fingerprinting.
      The conference agreement includes increased funding for 
exchanges with the countries of Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union built into the base programs funded under this 
account. The conference agreement includes, by reference, 
language in the House report on funding levels for staff and 
administrative support. Funding in the preceding chart includes 
funding for the Future Leaders Exchange Program. No funding 
under this account shall be expended for programs that have 
foreign assistance or international development as the primary 
goal. The conference agreement does not include funding for 
programs, previously funded by transfers from other 
appropriations, which do not directly relate to international 
educational and cultural exchanges of persons. The amount 
provided for Graduate Fellowships is for all such programs 
worldwide.
      The conferees recognize, in particular, the notable 
success of the Fulbright Educational Exchange Program. The 
conferees commend Fulbright for developing innovative 
initiatives, such as the Fulbright Legacy Fund.
      Within funds identified in the above chart for ``Seed 
Programs'', the conferees expect the Department to consider 
supporting grants for an African career internship immersion 
program, a youth cultural festival exchange program, a program 
to promote religious tolerance and understanding through 
artistic and cultural exchanges, and the five programs listed 
in the Senate report under the heading ``Seed Programs''. 
Should additional funds become available during the course of 
the fiscal year, the conferees encourage the Department to 
provide additional funding to the Institute for Representative 
Government.
      The conferees recognize, in particular, the notable 
success of the Fulbright Educational Exchange Program. The 
conferees commend Fulbright for developing innovative 
initiatives, such as the Fulbright Legacy Fund.

                       REPRESENTATION ALLOWANCES

      The conference agreement includes $9,000,000 for 
representation allowances as proposed by the House, instead of 
$6,643,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement 
includes, by reference, language in the House report regarding 
the submission of a quarterly report on expenditures under this 
account.

              PROTECTION OF FOREIGN MISSIONS AND OFFICIALS

      The conference agreement includes $10,000,000 under this 
heading as proposed by both the House and the Senate. The 
conference agreement includes, by reference, language in the 
House report regarding the Department's treatment of 
reimbursement requests, and the submission of a report on 
budgeting for protection expenses in light of heightened 
security measures.

            EMBASSY SECURITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND MAINTENANCE

      The conference agreement includes a total appropriation 
of $1,391,400,000 for Embassy Security, Construction, and 
Maintenance. The conference agreement designates $861,400,000 
as available only for priority worldwide security upgrades, 
acquisition, and construction, the full amount requested for 
such activities. The conference agreement includes $530,000,000 
for base programs and non-security construction costs. The 
conference agreement includes full requested wage and price 
increases for the Department's Bureau of Overseas Buildings 
Operations (OBO), which will support 787 positions in fiscal 
year 2004. The conference agreement includes $20,000 for 
domestic and overseas representation, instead of $15,000 
proposed by the House and $25,000 proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $861,400,000 for 
worldwide security upgrades, including $761,400,000 to continue 
the capital security program of constructing new secure 
replacement facilities for the Department's most vulnerable 
embassies and consulates. None of the funds made available 
under the Security Capital Construction program shall be used 
for facilities that are exclusively for the use of a non-State 
Department agency. Within the funds made available under this 
category, the conferees expect the Department to undertake new 
office building projects from among the highest priority 
facilities listed in the Long Range Overseas Buildings Plan. 
Projects funded under this account must follow a rigorous 
rightsizing methodology. The conferees expect that such 
rightsizing efforts will enable the Department to support ten 
new security capital embassy or consulate construction projects 
instead of seven as proposed in the budget request.
      The conferees understand that the Department has 
evaluated options for a new embassy facility in Beirut, 
Lebanon. The conferees expect the Department to report to the 
Committees no later than 30 days after the enactment of this 
Act on the status of plansto construct such a facility, and to 
allocate funds provided under this heading, if appropriate.
      The conference agreement includes, by reference, language 
in the House report regarding capital security cost sharing, 
compound security, security capital projects fully meeting 
existing security standards, immediate notification on serious 
security risks, reprogramming, and right-sizing. The conference 
agreement includes, by reference, language in the Senate report 
on a project at U.S. Embassy Mexico and asset management funds.
      The conference agreement includes up to $15,000,000 to 
secure and protect soft targets, up to $8,000,000 for consular 
workspace improvements, and up to $20,000,000 for buyout of 
uneconomic leases, as described in the Senate report.
      The conference agreement does not include funds requested 
under this heading for a new Embassy in Berlin, Germany, and 
instead proposes that this project be funded entirely from 
funds available in the assets management account. The conferees 
agree that the total amount to be provided from proceeds of 
sale for the Berlin project is $128,300,000, and that the 
facility will be sized to correspond with this project budget. 
The conference agreement includes, by reference, language in 
the House report regarding the disposal of property at posts 
that have had funding approved for the construction of a new 
secure compound.
      The conferees direct the Department to provide a report 
no later than July 1, 2004, which justifies the continued need 
for a U.S. consulate in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which is 
located approximately 260 miles away from the U.S. Consulate in 
Sao Paulo, Brazil.
      The conferees expect the Department to submit to the 
Committees any waiver or waivers signed by the Secretary of 
State in accordance with section 606(a)(2) and section 
606(a)(3) of the Secure Embassy Construction and 
Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-113) within five 
days of the Secretary's signature of such a waiver or waivers.
      The conferees direct that the budget categories of 
``interiors and furnishings'', ``seismic programs'', and 
``energy conservation'' be funded at no less than fiscal year 
2003 levels.

           EMERGENCIES IN THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE

      The conference agreement includes $1,000,000 under this 
heading as proposed by the House, instead of $1,000 as proposed 
by the Senate. The conference agreement anticipates that 
carryover balances from fiscal year 2003 will be available for 
obligation in fiscal year 2004. Within prior year unobligated 
balances, the conferees expect that at least $4,000,000 will be 
used for the cost of hosting the 2004 Summit of the 
Industrialized Nations.

                   REPATRIATION LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      The conference agreement includes $612,000 for the 
subsidy cost of repatriation loans and $607,000 for 
administrative costs of the program as proposed by both the 
House and Senate.

              PAYMENT TO THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE IN TAIWAN

      The conference agreement includes $18,782,000 under this 
heading as proposed by the House, instead of $19,893,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement includes, by 
reference, language in the House report regarding the 
submission of a fiscal year 2004 spending plan, except that 
such plan shall be submitted by December 31, 2003.

     PAYMENT TO THE FOREIGN SERVICE RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY FUND

      The conference agreement includes $134,979,000 under this 
heading, as proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                      International Organizations

              CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

      The conference agreement includes $1,010,463,000 under 
this heading as proposed by the House, instead of $921,888,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes, by reference, language 
in the House report regarding offset of exchange rate losses, 
reprogramming to meet additional unanticipated costs of UNESCO 
membership, UNESCO reforms, reassessment of U.S. membership in 
certain international organizations, reform and budget 
discipline, the UN regular budget, and the Pan American Health 
Organization. The conference agreement includes, by reference, 
language from the Senate report regarding the provision of 
certain information to the Senate Committee on Appropriations 
regarding the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development.
      The conference agreement includes language requiring the 
Secretary to transmit the most recent biennial budget for the 
operations of the UN. The conference agreement includes 
language, as in fiscal year 2003, providing that funds within 
the Diplomatic and Consular programs account may be used for a 
United States Government interagency task force to examine, 
coordinate, and oversee United States participation in the 
United Nations headquarters renovation project. The conferees 
are concerned that the task force is not drawing upon the 
expertise of the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations 
(OBO)of the Department of State to the degree that it should be. The 
conferees direct the task force to coordinate its efforts with OBO and 
to consult with senior OBO officials in formulating its 
recommendations.
      The conferees are aware of significant potential benefits 
that could result from U.S. participation in the International 
Coffee Organization (ICO). The Department may propose to use 
funds provided under this heading, through the regular 
reprogramming process under section 605 of this Act, for costs 
associated with rejoining ICO.

        CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES

      The conference agreement includes a total funding level 
of $550,200,000 for payments for Contributions for 
International Peacekeeping Activities as proposed by the House, 
instead of $482,649,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement includes $454,842,000 in new direct 
appropriations and $95,358,000 in prior year unobligated 
balances, and will provide for the full payment of anticipated 
fiscal year 2004 assessments for United Nations peacekeeping 
missions. The conference agreement includes language making ten 
percent of the amount provided available for two fiscal years.
      The conference agreement includes, by reference, language 
in the House report regarding UN peacekeeping in the Western 
Sahara; UN peacekeeping reform; benchmarks for mission 
performance and termination; UN peacekeeping in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo; and the Office of Internal Oversight 
Services. The conference agreement includes, by reference, 
language in the Senate report regarding peacekeeping reports. 
The allocation of funds under this account to specific missions 
shall be subject to the reprogramming requirements in section 
605 of this Act.
      The conferees support the work of the Special Court for 
Sierra Leone, and expect the United Nations Mission in Sierra 
Leone to provide support, as necessary, to the Court. The 
conferees urge the Department to work with the Court and other 
nations to ensure the expeditious prosecution of indicted 
persons.
      The conferees direct the Department to provide a report 
to the Committees, no later than August 1, 2004, outlining the 
Department's views and strategies regarding United Nations 
peacekeeping missions that have been in existence for more than 
10 years. The report shall include an assessment of the 
possibilities for near-term drawdowns or terminations, and 
detailed justifications for the continuation of such missions. 
The report shall also include recommendations for U.S. policies 
regarding such missions.

                       International Commissions

 INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY AND WATER COMMISSION, UNITED STATES AND MEXICO

      The conference agreement includes a total of $29,551,000 
for the International Boundary and Water Commission, United 
States and Mexico (IBWC). The total amount provided includes 
$26,000,000 for Salaries and Expenses and $3,551,000 for 
Construction. The conference agreement includes language 
authorizing not to exceed $6,000 for representation expenses.

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement for the Salaries and Expenses 
account includes $26,000,000, instead of $25,668,000 as 
proposed by the House and $28,312,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement includes, by reference, 
language in the House report regarding the use of surplus 
operations and maintenance funding through reprogramming.

                              CONSTRUCTION

      The conference agreement includes $3,551,000 in new 
direct appropriations under this heading, instead of $5,500,000 
as proposed by the House and $8,201,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conferees agree that the Commission may use an 
additional $3,125,000 in prior year unobligated balances for 
fiscal year 2004 for a total spending level of $6,676,000.
      The conference agreement spending levels for ongoing 
projects are: $2,306,000 for Boundary-wide construction; and 
$2,305,000 for Rio Grande construction. The conference 
agreement also includes $950,000 for compliance with the 
Surfriders consent decree. Any additional obligations under 
this heading within the total spending level cited above, 
including any new project starts, shall be subject to the 
reprogramming process described in section 605 of this Act.
      The conference agreement assumes that the IBWC may carry 
out requested Western Boundary activities using prior year 
unobligated balances, and propose a distribution of such funds 
through the regular reprogramming process. The conferees 
encourage the IBWC to attempt, if possible, to achieve greater 
secondary treatment of Mexican sewage within current funding 
levels under this account. Any plan that assumes a significant 
increase in appropriations under this heading in future years 
is not feasible given resource restraints and competing 
priorities.

              AMERICAN SECTIONS, INTERNATIONAL COMMISSIONS

      The conference agreement includes a total of $8,944,000 
under this heading as proposed by the House, instead of

$5,550,000 for the International Joint Commission and 
$2,133,000 for the Border Environment Cooperation Commission.

the House report regarding funding for a study of the water 
regulation plan governing Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence 
River.

                  INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES COMMISSIONS

      The conference agreement includes $19,300,000 under this 
heading, instead of $16,989,000 as proposed by the House. The

Department of Commerce. The conference agreement includes 
$2,250,000 for the Pacific Salmon Commission, $2,100,000 for 
the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, $2,180,000 for the 
International Pacific Halibut Commission, and $12,248,000 for 
the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, of which not less than 
$700,000 is for lampricide in Lake Champlain. The conferees 
expect the Department to allocate the balance of funds in the 
conference agreement, and, through the regular reprogramming 
process, any additional funds that may become available, to 
priority commissions. In allocating the balance of funds, the 
conferees encourage the Department to particularly consider 
funding needs of the International Whaling Commission, the 
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic 
Tunas, the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission, the Inter-
American Sea Turtle Convention Commission, and the North 
Pacific Marine Science Organization. The conferees are aware 
that the Department may propose to reprogram funds to meet the 
needs of the various fisheries commissions should funding 
become available.
      The conferees expect the Department to take immediate 
action to evaluate and prioritize United States participation 
in, and funding for, international fisheries commissions. In a 
climate of limited resources the conferees continue to insist 
that the Department operate within appropriated amounts, 
prioritize as necessary among commissions according to policy 
goals, take steps as necessary to withdraw from lower priority 
commissions, and refrain from entering into new commitments.

                                 Other

permanent trust fund for the International Center for Middle 
Eastern-Western Dialogue Trust (in Section 634). The purpose of 
this fund is to provide for the operations of the Center in 
Istanbul, Turkey, on an annual basis.
      The conference agreement includes $7,000,000 under this 
heading to be deposited in the International Center for Muslim-
Western Dialogue Trust (the Center) for the perpetual 
operations of the Center. The Center is located in the historic 
Palazzo Corpi, formerly the U.S. Consulate building in 
Istanbul, Turkey. The purpose of the Center is to develop 
programs of cooperative study, training, and research for 
students and scholars to exchange views and ideas. The Center 
shall develop regional-based dialogue groups on such topics as 
post-war Iraq and the empowerment of women in Iraq's government 
and leadership, among others. The conferees encourage non-
profit organizations to play a continuing role in the 
administration of the Center and in the execution of its 
programs.
      The conference agreement also includes $250,000 for a 
steering committee, chaired by the Council of American Overseas 
Research Centers (CAORC), to establish the Center. The CAORC 
may use the funds provided under this heading for steering 
committee meetings and planning workshops to be held in 
Istanbul, Turkey, and the United States. The steering committee 
shall seek to achieve the following goals: identify potential 
partners in the U.S. and abroad; review all aspects of the 
structure of the Center and make recommendations concerning its 
governance, by-laws, internal organization, and modes of 
operation. In addition, CAORC shall be the coordinating liaison 
with concerned federal and private agencies, monitor progress 
and report to the Committees on Appropriations on an annual 
basis.

                 EISENHOWER EXCHANGE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM

      The conference agreement includes an appropriation for 
fiscal year 2004 of interest and earnings from the Eisenhower 
Exchange Fellowship Program Trust Fund, expected to total 
$500,000. The conference agreement includes, by reference, 
language in the House report regarding geographical priorities 
and the selection of fellows.

                    ISRAELI ARAB SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM

      The conference agreement includes an appropriation for 
fiscal year 2004 of interest and earnings of the Israeli Arab 
Scholarship Endowment Fund, expected to total $375,000.

                            EAST-WEST CENTER

fiscal year 2003 appropriations under this heading.

                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY

      The conference agreement includes $40,000,000 for the 
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), instead of $42,000,000

 Broadcasting Board of Governors International Broadcasting Operations

      The conference agreement includes $546,038,000 to carry 
out United States International Broadcasting Operations for 
fiscal year 2004. The conference agreement adopts, by 
reference, House language regarding communications with the 
Committees on Appropriations, and language under the headings 
of Arabic Television, Language Service Review and Research, 
Africa Broadcasting, and Anti-Jamming Efforts.
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, Senate

Worldwide Broadcasting Facilities, Middle East Television 
Network, and Jamming.
      The conferees support efforts to devote more resources to 
regions of the world that have had exposure to U.S. 
broadcasting efforts, with particular attention to the Middle 
East and to Muslim populations around the globe. The conferees 
adopt the Broadcasting Board of Governors' (BBG) proposal 
regarding funding for language services in central and eastern 
European nations that have been invited to become new member 
states of the European Union or the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, and have received a Freedom House press freedom 
ranking equal to that of the United States. The conferees 
expect the BBG to continue to monitor the press freedoms in 
these countries, and throughout the world, and advise the 
Committees on Appropriations regarding any change to language 
service priorities.
      BBG's proposal would reduce, but not eliminate, language 
services to the Ukraine and Armenia. The conferees understand 
the VOA Armenian programming would be merged with Radio Free 
Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) broadcasting efforts. The 
conferees understand the BBG would not eliminate broadcasting 
in Romanian or Croatian.
      The conference agreement adopts BBG's proposal to double 
VOA radio broadcasts and increase television broadcasts to 
Indonesia.
      The conferees continue to support RFE/RL programming 
efforts in Persian, Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Arabic, Kazakh, 
Kyrgyz, and Azeri. The conferees commend RFE/RL for developing 
programming in Avar, Chechen, and Circassian, and for expanding 
broadcasting to the Northern Caucasus. The conferees recognize 
the continuing importance of broadcasting objective, uncensored 
information to the isolated minorities of the Northern Caucasus 
in their native languages.
      The conferees continue to support Radio Free Asia's 
broadcasting efforts to China, Tibet, Burma, Vietnam, North 
Korea, Laos, and Cambodia and VOA's efforts in North Korea. The 
conference agreement includes funding to continue daily Uyghur 
broadcasts.
      The conferees expect BBG to provide up to $1,000,000 to 
administer a pilot program using Internet technologies to 
overcome jamming of broadcasts to China.
      The conference agreement adopts BBG's proposal to 
streamline and reduce costs of management and administration 
throughout the BBG, including the realignment of RFE/RL staff 
from headquarters to regional bureaus.
      The conference agreement includes the realignment of the 
CFO office as proposed in a prior reprogramming notification to 
the Committees on Appropriations.
      The conferees expect the BBG to provide a spending plan 
to the Committees on Appropriations in both the House and 
Senate by no later than February 14, 2004.
      The conference agreement includes language providing for 
radio and television broadcasting to the Middle East under the 
Middle East Television Network.
      The conference agreement includes funding for Office of 
Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) under this heading. The conferees 
commend the OCB for the successful completion of the conversion 
to digital audio and computer networking technologies. The 
conferees direct the BBG to pursue alternative means of 
transmission, including Internet transmission. The conferees 
expect BBG to provide up to $1,200,000 for this activity.
      Further, the conference agreement does not include 
funding requested for the operating costs related to 
transmission stations that are not currently in operation.
      The conferees understand the Administration has engaged 
the government of the Czech Republic regarding the relocation 
of the headquarters facility of the RFE/RL from St. Wenceslas 
Square in Prague, the Czech Republic, to a different location. 
The conferees further understand that, to date, the BBG and 
RFE/RL have not reached agreement with the Czech Republic on a 
suitable site within the Czech Republic for relocation. The 
conferees direct the Chairman of the BBG to submit no later 
than April 1, 2004, a relocation plan to the Committees on 
Appropriations. The plan shall include at least four possible 
sites, developed in consultation with the Director of the 
Department of State's Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations. 
In determining the site options, the conferees direct the BBG 
to consider sites in other countries in the region in addition 
to the Czech Republic, and include a comparison of the long-
term costs of operating in the different countries.
      The BBG is directed to submit a spending plan for funds 
provided under this heading, in accordance with section 605 of 
this Act.

                   BROADCASTING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

      The conference agreement includes $11,395,000 for 
broadcasting capital improvements, as proposed by both the 
House and Senate.
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, House 
language regarding a certain transmitting station. The 
conferees expect the Board to keep the Committees on 
Appropriations in both the House and Senate informed on the 
status of its efforts to acquire additional transmission 
capabilities in the Middle East, including Egypt.

       General Provisions--Department of State and Related Agency

      The conference agreement includes section 401, permitting 
the use of funds for allowances, differentials and 
transportation.
      The conference agreement includes section 402 dealing 
with transfer authority.
      The conference agreement includes section 403 prohibiting 
the use of funds by the Department of State or the Broadcasting 
Board of Governors to provide certain assistance to the 
Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation.
      The conference agreement includes section 404 regarding 
the recording of place of birth on certain passport 
applications.
      The conference agreement includes section 405 regarding 
certain State Department Basic Authorities.
      The conference agreement includes section 406 regarding 
the denial of visas in certain instances. Nothing in this 
section shall be construed as cutting off the need to continue 
administrative processing of visa applications after 60 days.
      The conference agreement includes section 407 waiving 
certain authorization requirements.
      The conference agreement includes section 408 regarding 
the Senior Policy Operating Group on Trafficking in Persons. 
The conference agreement includes language clarifying the 
responsibilities of the Senior Policy Operating Group on 
Trafficking in Persons. The conferees understand that the 
Operating Group has been actively meeting and performing its 
designated functions since enactment of Section 406 of division 
B of Public Law 108-7. The conferees agree that all anti-
trafficking policies, grants and grant policies shall be 
covered by the provisions of Section 406 of division B of 
Public Law 108-7. The conference agreement also includes 
language clarifying that the Senior Policy Operating Group and 
its chairman are the coordinating body (and official) 
accountable for federal anti-trafficking policies, grants and 
grant policies. The conferees are concerned by recent 
administrative efforts to subordinate and transfer the 
Operating Group's coordinating responsibilities. The language 
also makes clear that the coordinating responsibilities of the 
Operating Group are not intended to supercede the decision 
making authority of the constituent members of the Task Force 
to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, to whom Operating 
Group members continue to report. The Operating Group is, and 
was intended to serve as, the forum for interagency 
coordination of anti-trafficking policies, even as final 
decisions regarding any such policies are necessarily vested 
with the President and the senior officials who comprise the 
Task Force. The conferees agree that the Senior Operating Group 
and its chair have successfully performed the coordinating 
functions assigned to them.
      The conference agreement includes section 409 regarding 
State Department provision of certain information to the 
Committees on Appropriations.

salaries and expenses of the Commission on Civil Rights for 
fiscal year 2004, as proposed in both the House and Senate

      The conferees note that the Commission has achieved cost 
savings in fiscal year 2003 by holding its monthly meetings in 
Washington, DC, versus other locations around the country.
      The conferees urge the Commission to continue to seek 
cost savings in this manner. In addition, the conferees 
encourage the Commission to address the recommendations made by 
the October 2003 General Accounting Office report, which 
suggested establishing greater controls over contracting 
activities and meeting financial statement preparation and 
audit requirements.

             Commission on International Religious Freedom

      The conference agreement includes $328,400,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) for fiscal year 2004, as proposed by the 
House, instead of $334,754,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees recognize that the Chair and Commissioners 
have engaged EEOC stakeholders in a public forum in order to 
hear many different perspectives on the proposed restructuring 
effort. However, the conferees remain concerned about the 
impact this restructuring will have on the quality of service 
provided by the agency. The Committees on Appropriations should 
be kept apprised of any organizational changes, in accordance 
with the reprogramming requirements in Section 605 of the Act.
      The conferees are aware of the many financial management 
initiatives the EEOC has successfully undertaken over the last 
year, and the conferees commend the Commission for these 
actions. The Commission is urged to continue these cost saving 
measures and the financial management discipline it has 
instituted. The conference agreement adopts, by reference, the 
language in the House report requiring quarterly reports on 
planned and actual spending and staffing levels. The conference 
agreement also includes, by reference, the language in the 
House report on Alternative Dispute Resolution programs.

                   Federal Communications Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $273,958,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) for fiscal year 2004, instead of $278,958,000 as provided 
by the House and $277,798,000 as provided by the Senate. Of the 
amounts provided, $272,958,000 is to be derived from offsetting 
fee collections, resulting in a net direct appropriation of 
$1,000,000.
      The FCC performs four major functions: spectrum 
allocation, creating rules to promote fair competition and 
protect consumers where required by market conditions, 
authorization of service, and enforcement. The conferees direct 
the FCC to expend for enforcement in fiscal year 2004 an amount 
equal to or greater than the amount expended for enforcement in 
fiscal year 2003.
      The conference agreement includes, by reference, language 
included in the House and Senate reports on broadcast 
television standards. The conference agreement includes, by 
reference, language in the Senate report regarding Universal 
Service Fund audits and wireless portability.
      The conferees are pleased that the FCC is voluntarily 
examining the practice of Commissioners and staff receiving 
travel payments from entities it regulates in order to largely 
eliminate section 1353 travel. The FCC should inform the 
Committees on Appropriations of any resulting changes to the 
travel policy. The conference agreement includes a level of 
funding that is sufficient to accommodate mission-critical 
travel.
      The conference agreement allows the FCC to spend up to 
$85,000,000 to administer the spectrum auctions program. In 
addition, all collections retained by the FCC in accordance 
with section 309(j)(8)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934 are 
subject to the requirements of section 605 of this Act.

                        Federal Trade Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $186,041,000 for the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), instead of $183,041,000 as 
proposed by the House and $189,032,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Of the amounts provided, $112,000,000 is derived from 
Hart-Scott-Rodino premerger filing fees, $23,100,000 is derived 
from Do-Not-Call fees, and $50,941,000 is derived from 
discretionary appropriations.
      The conference agreement adopts by reference the House 
report language requiring GAO to study the implementation of 
the Do-Not-Call program and determine whether the Commission is 
achieving its goal of reducing by 80 percent the number of 
telemarketing calls received by registered consumers. To 
improve responsiveness to an individual's decision to enroll in 
the Do-Not-Call program, the conference report includes bill 
language requiring telemarketers who are subject to the 
Telemarketing Sales Rule to obtain from the Federal Trade 
Commission the list of telephone numbers on the Do-Not-Call 
registry once a month.
      The conference agreement adopts by reference the House 
report language concerning violent video games. In addition, 
the conferees direct the Commission to make the toll free 
consumer complaint line (1-877-FTC-HELP) and the Commission's 
web-site available for consumer complaints on media violence. 
The Commission should make consumers aware that the complaint 
line and web-site are available for this purpose.
      The conference agreement adopts by reference the Senate 
report language concerning child protection, the Internet, and 
commercial fleet card programs.
      Federal Deposit Insurance Act.--In the Fiscal Year 2003 
Conference Report, the conferees directed the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) to study the enforcement of section 43 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and make recommendations 
to the Committees on Appropriations on which Federal agency 
could most effectively enforce this provision. GAO Report 03-
971 recommends that the Commission is the best among the 
Federal agencies considered to enforce the consumer protection 
activities of this provision. In addition, the report also 
concludes that the most apparent impact on consumers, from the 
lack of enforcement of section 43, may result from non-
Federally insured credit unions not providing adequate 
disclosure that they are not Federally insured. Based on these 
recommendations, the conference agreement revises language 
included in the House and Senate bills requiring enforcement 
concerning disclosure and annual independent audits, but 
maintains the prohibition of enforcement of section 43(e) 
concerning the eligibility of Federal deposit insurance.
      In the enforcement of section 43, the FTC is directed to 
consult with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the 
National Credit Union Administration when determining the 
manner and content of disclosure requirements, and to 
coordinate with State supervisors of non-Federally insured 
depository institutions to assist in enforcing these 
requirements.

                            HELP Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $3,000,000 for 
necessary expenses of establishing the Helping to Enhance the 
Livelihood of People (HELP) Around the Globe Commission. The 
conference agreement also includes authorization language under 
title VI of this Act concerning the Commission and its 
activities.

                       Legal Services Corporation

               PAYMENT TO THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION

      The conference agreement includes $338,848,000 for the 
payment to the Legal Services Corporation, as proposed in both 
the House and Senate bills. The recommendation is $9,548,000 
above the budget request. Of the amounts provided, the Legal 
Services Corporation will provide $2,500,000 in grants 
equitably distributed to the ten states most negatively 
affected by recent census-based reallocations.

                        ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION

      The conference agreement includes bill language to 
continue the terms and conditions included under this section 
in previous Appropriations Acts.

                        Marine Mammal Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $1,856,000 for the 
Marine Mammal Commission, as proposed by the House, instead of 
$3,063,000 as proposed by the Senate. An additional $1,207,000 
is provided by transfer from the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, Operations, Research, and 
Facilities account. The conference agreement includes, by 
reference, the language in the Senate report on the cost 
effectiveness of current protection programs and the effects of 
rogue killer whales on the most endangered marine mammals.

           National Veterans Business Development Corporation

      The conference agreement includes $2,000,000 for the 
National Veterans Business Development Corporation as provided 
by the House and the Senate. The conferees note that the 
Corporation's authorizing legislation mandates that it 
institute a plan to raise private funds and become a self-
sustaining corporation by the end of fiscal year 2004. The 
conferees encourage efforts by the Corporation to meet this 
goal.

                   Securities and Exchange Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $811,500,000 for the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, instead of $841,500,000 as 
provided by the House and Senate.
      Staffing.--In fiscal year 2003, the Commission was 
provided with funding for 840 new positions to protect 
investors and implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The fiscal year 
2004 budget request assumed that the 840 new positions funded 
in fiscal year 2003 would be hired by the start of fiscal year 
2004. The conferees understand the Commission has had 
difficulty hiring accountants and examiners but that Public Law 
108-44 provides the Commission with greater flexibility in 
hiring these positions. The conferees understand that through 
November 1, 2004, the Commission has only been able to increase 
its staff by 309. As a result of lower than anticipated on-
board staffing levels, the conference agreement has reduced the 
level of funding provided to the Commission by $30,000,000. The 
conferees direct the Commission to continue to work to fill all 
of the 840 new positions as quickly as possible and to provide 
the Committees on Appropriations with quarterly staffing 
reports.
      The conference agreement adopts by reference the Senate 
report language concerning pay parity and enforcement. The 
conference agreement adopts by reference the Senate report 
language concerning data management and includes such sums as 
are necessary to fund these efforts. The conference agreement 
adopts by reference the Senate report language requiring a 
monthly report to the Senate Appropriations Committee listing 
the exercise of stock options by corporate officers and 
directors. The conference agreement adopts by reference the 
House report language requiring GAO to study the Commission's 
allocation of funding increases provided in fiscal years 2003 
and 2004. The conference agreement adopts by reference all of 
the House report language concerning the establishment of an 
Office of Global Security Risk within the Division of 
Corporation Finance.

                     Small Business Administration

      The conference agreement provides a total of $718,343,000 
for the four appropriations accounts of the Small Business 
Administration (SBA). Detailed guidance for the four SBA 
appropriation accounts is contained in the following 
paragraphs.

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $325,750,000 for the 
salaries and expenses account of the SBA instead of 
$326,592,000 as provided by the House and $332,413,000 as 
provided by the Senate. Of the amount provided under this 
heading, $185,000,000 is for operating expenses of the SBA. In 
addition, a total of $136,500,000 from other SBA accounts may 
be transferred to and merged with the salaries and expenses 
account for indirect operating costs. This amount consists of 
$128,000,000 from the Business Loans Program account and 
$8,500,000 from the Disaster Loans Program account for the 
administrative expenses related to those accounts.
      The conference agreement includes the full amount 
requested for Low Documentation Processing Centers and expects 
the SBA to continue to help small businesses adapt to a 
paperless procurement environment.
      The conferees adopt by reference the House report 
language concerning the submission of a long-range plan for the 
implementation of the loan monitoring system and the joint 
accounting and administrative systems project.
      Non-Credit Programs.--The conference agreement includes 
the following for the non-credit programs of the SBA:

Regulatory Fairness Boards/National Ombudsman...........        $500,000
Advocacy Research.......................................       1,100,000
Veterans Programs.......................................         750,000
7(j) Technical Assistance Programs......................       2,000,000
Small Business Development Centers......................      89,000,000
SCORE...................................................       5,000,000
Women's Business Centers................................      12,500,000
Women's Business Council................................         750,000

Drug-free Workplace Program.............................       1,000,000
Business Information Centers............................         400,000
Microloan Technical Assistance..........................      15,000,000
PRIME Technical Assistance..............................       5,000,000

SBIR--FAST..............................................       2,000,000
HUBZones................................................       2,000,000
US Export Assistance....................................       1,500,000
      Total, non-credit programs........................     140,750,000

      The SBA shall not reduce these non-credit programs to 
fund operating costs. Of the amounts provided for the Small 
Business Development Center (SBDC) program, $500,000 shall be 
available for the South Carolina Women's Business Center. In 
addition, SBA shall fund the SBDC defense transition program 
and the regulatory compliance simplification program at the 
fiscal year 2003 level. The conferees adopt by reference the 
House report language requiring SBA to submit a report to the 
Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of 
this Act describing the various programs offered by SBDCs to 
support American small businesses.
      SBA is directed to report to the Committee prior to 
closing any Business Information Centers. The report should 
include a justification for closing the particular office and a 
detailed proposal as to how services will be provided to the 
affected community in the future.
      The conferees adopt by reference the Senate report 
language concerning an electronic grant system. The conferees 
support the SBA's 8(a) business development program internet 
application program.
      The conferees adopt by reference the Senate report 
language directing that disaster loans in Alaska continue to be 
managed by SBA and not be sold for processing.
      Because of the unique legal status of Alaska Natives, 
Native Hawaiians, and residents living in the territories, the 
offices handling SBA programs on reservations often lack the 
knowledge and ability to make SBA programs work outside the 
continental United States. To address this failure, the 
conferees direct the SBA to assign a Senior Executive Service 
(SES) position to focus on these unique communities. The 
conferees expect this new SES position shall be accommodated 
within SBA's existing number of SES positions. Within 60 days 
of enactment of this Act, the conferees direct SBA to submit to 
the Committees on Appropriations a report outlining all SES 
positions within the SBA, including their titles and 
responsibilities, and a proposed reorganization of these 
positions to ensure the needs of Alaska Natives, Native 
Hawaiians, and residents living in the territories are being 
addressed.

                      Office of Inspector General

      The conference agreement includes $13,000,000 for the 
Office of Inspector General of the Small Business 
Administration as proposed by the House instead of $12,341,000 
as provided by the Senate. The conference agreement includes 
language allowing $500,000 to be transferred to this account 
from the Disaster Loans Program for oversight costs related to 
that program.

                     BUSINESS LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      The conference agreement includes $209,042,000 under this 
account, consisting of: $79,132,000 for the Business Loans 
Program account for subsidies for guaranteed business loans; 
$1,910,000 for subsidies for direct business loans; and 
$128,000,000 for administrative expenses related to business 
loan programs. The amount provided for administrative expenses 
may be transferred to and merged with the appropriation for SBA 
salaries and expenses to cover the common overhead expenses 
associated with business loans. In addition, the conference 
agreement includes a provision, also carried in previous years, 
which allows up to $45,000,000 to remain available for two 
fiscal years.
      7(a) Business Loan Program.--The conference agreement 
includes $101,228,000 for the 7(a) program. This amount 
includes $79,132,000 in appropriations, $19,773,000 in prior 
year unobligated balances, and $2,455,000 in remaining balances 
from the DELTA 7(a) program. Section 633 of this Act makes the 
remaining balances available for the DELTA 7(a) program 
available for the general 7(a) program. The conferees 
understand that there is no longer a demand for the DELTA 7(a) 
programs.
      The total level of funding provided will support a loan 
program level of $9,550,000,000, which is $250,000,000 above 
the requested program level and $612,000,000 above the level of 
7(a) business loans provided in fiscal year 2003.
      The conferees were disappointed to learn that the subsidy 
included in the Administration's budget request is inaccurate 
and that an additional $4,000,000 above the request is required 
to fund the Administration's requested program level. While the 
conferees have provided this increase to ensure sufficient 
funding is available to assist American small businesses, the 
conferees expect future budget requests to contain accurate 
subsidy rate calculations.

                     DISASTER LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      The conference agreement includes $170,551,000 for the 
Disaster Loans Program Account for loan subsidies and 
associated administrative expenses instead of $190,250,000 as 
provided by the House and Senate. The conference agreement 
includes new budget authority of $56,188,000 for the subsidy 
costs of disaster loans and $114,363,000 for administrative 
expenses associated with carrying out the program.
      The conference agreement provides for a total of 
$89,109,000 for disaster loans of which $56,188,000 is in new 
appropriations and $32,921,000 in prior year carryover 
balances, including $15,032,000 made available through Section 
628 of this Act. This fully funds the Administration's 
requested disaster loans program level of $760,316,000. The 
conferees understand that at this time the Administration 
believes that the costs associated with Hurricane Isabel and 
the fires in California can be funded within the requested 
disaster loan program level.
      Within the $114,363,000 provided for administrative 
expenses, $500,000 is available for the Office of Inspector 
General, $105,363,000 is available for direct administrative 
expenses of loan making and servicing, and $8,500,000 is 
available to be transferred to the Salaries and Expenses 
account for indirect costs of the program.

State Justice Institute (SJI), instead of $3,000,000 as

Programs on issues involving State courts and encourages SJI to 
apply for funding under OJP grant programs that support State 
court programs.

        industries;
            Various means to compensate losses of U.S. 
        intellectual property holders created by China's

        prospects for future European Union, Japanese, and 
        United States research and development shifts to China, 
        and the resulting implications to U.S capacities;
            Items on the U.S.-China Advanced Technology Trade 
        list cross-referenced to the items on the Department of 
        Defense's Critical Technology List, and what part of

        consequences to affected U.S. professions, such as 
        software engineering;
            A survey of business groups on the extent to which

      In implementing this agreement, the Departments and 
agencies should comply with the language and instructions set 
forth in House Report 108-214 and Senate Report 108-142. The 
committee of conference approves the language and instructions 
set forth in these reports, which are not changed by the 
conference agreement.
      In the case where the language and instructions 
specifically address the allocation of funds, the Departments 
and agencies are to follow the funding levels specified in the 
Congressional budget justifications accompanying the fiscal 
year 2004 budget or the underlying authorizing statute and 
should give full consideration to all items, including items 
allocating specific funding included in the House and Senate 
reports. With respect to the provisions in the House and Senate 
reports that specifically allocate funds, each has been 
reviewed and those that are jointly concurred in have been 
included in this joint statement.
      A summary chart appears later in this statement showing 
the Federal appropriations by account and the allocation of 
District funds by agency or office under each appropriation, 
the fiscal year 2004 request, the House and Senate 
recommendations, and the conference allowance.
      The District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2004, put in 
place by this bill, incorporates the following agreements of 
the managers:

                         TITLE I--FEDERAL FUNDS

              FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR RESIDENT TUITION SUPPORT

      The conference agreement includes $17,000,000 for a 
Federal payment for resident tuition support as proposed by 
both the House and Senate. The agreement also includes language 
to require the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to provide 
a quarterly financial report to the Committees on 
Appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate as 
proposed by the House. The Senate bill required the Resident 
Tuition Support Office and the Office of the Chief Financial 
Officer to provide such a report.

   FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR EMERGENCY PLANNING AND SECURITY COSTS IN THE 
                          DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

      The conference agreement includes $11,000,000 for a 
Federal payment for emergency planning and security costs in 
the District of Columbia. This amount, together with funds 
carried over from fiscal year 2003, provides a total program 
level of $15,000,000 as proposed by both the House and Senate. 
The agreement makes a technical correction describing the use 
of these funds as proposed by the House.

           FEDERAL PAYMENT TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS

      The conference agreement includes $167,765,000 for a 
Federal payment to the District of Columbia courts, instead of 
$163,819,000 as proposed by the House and $172,104,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. Included in this amount is $3,946,000 
above the President's request for fire and security system 
upgrades, Moultrie Courthouse renovation, and the Integrated 
Justice Information System. The Courts shall provide written 
notification of how this funding will be distributed to the 
Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
and Senate.
      The agreement includes a provision as proposed by the 
Senate to allow the District of Columbia courts to reallocate 
not more than $1,000,000 of the funds provided under this 
heading among items and entities funded under this heading. The 
House bill allowed funds for the Court of Appeals, Superior 
Court, and Court System to be reallocated, but such 
reallocation may increase or decrease funding for such entity 
by no more than two percent.
      The conferees understand the Courts have submitted plans 
to the National Capital Planning Commission for the restoration 
of the Old Courthouse for re-use by the District of Columbia 
Court of Appeals, but the Commission is holding up review of 
these plans pending an agreement with the Law Enforcement 
Museum on a design for the outdoor plaza area. The conferees 
expect the project will move forward as quickly as possible to 
permit efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and note that 
delaying the review and approval of the restoration plan could 
needlessly increase the cost of the project.

            DEFENDER SERVICES IN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS

      The conference agreement includes $32,000,000 for 
Defender Services in District of Columbia courts as proposed by

the courts to enter into contractual agreements to provide 
guardian ad litem representation, training, technical 
assistance, and/or other services to improve the quality of 
guardian ad litem representation. The House bill contained no 
similar provision. The Joint Committee on Judicial 
Administration of the District of Columbia shall monitor the 
guardian ad litem program and provide the necessary technical 
support to ensure superior representation of children and 
families.
      The agreement also includes two provisions as proposed by 
the House to allow District of Columbia Court funds to be used

Committee on Judicial Administration to use District of 
Columbia Court funds to make payments described under this 
heading forobligations incurred during any fiscal year. The

Senate. Included in this amount is $1,910,000 above the 
President's request to reduce supervision caseload ratios for 
sex-offenders, mental health, and domestic violence cases to 
25:1 by the end of fiscal year 2004. Current caseload ratios 
for these high-risk offenders are 36:1, 47:1, and 42:1, 
respectively.
      The agreement includes language as proposed by the Senate

Senate. The House bill contained no similar provision.
      The agreement does not include a provision proposed by 
the Senate to allow the Director of the Court Services and

space and services provided on a cost reimbursable basis. The 
House bill contained no similar provision.

      The conference agreement includes $30,000,000 for a

                              OF COLUMBIA

The agreement also makes these funds available until September

land in the District of Columbia.

      The conference agreement includes $1,300,000 for a

entities who are receiving funding under this heading. The 
conferees expect that the OCFO will report to the Committees on 
Appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate on 
the financial status of these organizations and how they have 
used Federal funds provided under this heading. The conferees 
expect all entities receiving funds to provide proper access to 
records as is necessary for the OCFO to carry out these 
reviews.
      The agreement includes a provision as proposed by the 
Senate to require each entity that receives funding under this 
heading to submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives and Senate, a report on the activities 
carried out with such funds no later than March 15, 2004. The 
House bill contained no similar provision.

         FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL CROSS TRAINING

      The conference agreement includes $500,000 for a Federal 
payment to the Emergency Management Agency for activities 
related to the cross training of police officers, firefighters, 
emergency medical technicians, and other emergency personnel. 
The agreement makes these funds contingent upon the submission 
of a detailed cross training plan for the District's public 
safety workforce. The House and Senate bills contained no 
similar provision.

                 FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT

      The conference agreement includes $40,000,000 for a 
Federal payment for a school improvement program in the 
District of Columbia, instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by the 
House and $27,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Included in 
this amount is $13,000,000 for the District of Columbia Public 
Schools to improve public school education; $13,000,000 for the 
State Education Office to expand quality charter schools in the 
District of Columbia; and $14,000,000 for the Secretary of the 
Department of Education to provide opportunity scholarships for 
students in the District of Columbia.
      The conferees expect that the $13,000,000 provided to the 
District of Columbia Public Schools for the improvement of 
public school education in the District of Columbia shall be 
used to strengthen leadership and instructional excellence 
through principal and teacher recruitment and retention, and to 
increase student achievement through supplemental services and 
public school choice.
      The $13,000,000 provided to the State Education Office to 
expand charter schools in the District of Columbia shall be 
distributed as follows: $5,000,000 for the City Build Charter 
School Initiative; $6,000,000 for the Direct Loans Fund for 
Charter School Improvement, of which not more than five percent 
shall be foradministrative expenses; and $2,000,000 as a one-
time payment to the Charter School Facilities Fund.
      The funding to develop the City Build Charter School 
Initiative will create five new charter schools in the 
District. The conferees support the concept that improving 
education is integral to securing neighborhoods and promoting 
urban development. The Mayor shall submit a plan to the 
Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
and Senate within thirty days of enactment, identifying the 
five potential City Build charter schools and detailing the 
city's plan for implementation of the Initiative.
      In identifying the schools, the Mayor shall take into 
account how a new school would contribute to and encourage 
economic development in a specific neighborhood by: attracting 
business investment; stabilizing and increasing the population; 
and encouraging community collaboration. The conferees 
recommend that the Mayor hold a public meeting to consult with 
advocacy groups and community leaders on the location of the 
five City Build pilot schools. The Mayor shall notify Congress 
at regular intervals on the progress of the Initiative.
      The $14,000,000 provided to the Secretary of the 
Department of Education is to provide opportunity scholarships 
to low-income students in the District of Columbia who are 
attending consistently under-performing public schools to 
choose to attend private schools within the District of 
Columbia. These scholarships will be for tuition, 
transportation, and fees at participating private schools 
within the District and cannot exceed $7,500 per student. If 
the funds provided are not sufficient to serve all the eligible 
applicants, scholarships will be awarded through random 
selection. The agreement intends that up to $1,000,000 of these 
funds may be used to administer and fund assessments for title 
III of this Act. The conferees expect the Secretary of 
Education to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the 
Mayor of the District of Columbia to select one or more 
grantees to administer the scholarship program through a 
competitive process.
      The conferees expect that the Memorandum of Understanding 
between the Mayor and the Secretary will include, but not be 
limited to, the following components: (1) strong accountability 
measures and program performance evaluations; (2) 
specifications for a lottery system which will provide fair and 
unbiased acceptance of students into the scholarship program, 
and allow participating schools to consider a sibling 
preference; (3) joint oversight by the Mayor of the District of 
Columbia and the Secretary of Education of the program's 
operations; (4) the evaluation and methodology for the 
selection of participating schools which have met the District 
of Columbia's current licensure requirements; (5) the 
methodology for determining the tuition and fees of 
participating schools, including the actual cost; (6) the 
development of appropriate oversight and accountability 
measures; and (7) teacher quality criteria.

        TITLE II--DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FUNDS OPERATING EXPENSES

                          DIVISION OF EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides that operating expenses 
for the District of Columbia for fiscal year 2004 shall not 
exceed $6,326,138,000, of which $3,832,734,000 is from local 
funds, including $96,248,000 from funds identified in the 
fiscal year 2002 comprehensive annual financial report as the 
District's fund balance funds, $1,568,734,000 is from Federal 
grant funds, $910,904,000 is from other funds, and $13,766,000 
is from private funds as proposed by both the House and Senate. 
In addition, the agreement includes $119,650,000 from funds 
previously appropriated in this Act as Federal payments, 
instead of $59,800,000 as proposed by the House and 
$109,500,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The agreement exempts sections 417 and 436 from the total 
appropriation provided under this heading. The House bill 
provided an exemption for section 417 and the Senate bill 
provided for the exemption of all provisions of this Act.
      The agreement does not include an earmark for intra-
District funds as proposed by the Senate. The House bill 
contained no similar provision.

                   GOVERNMENTAL DIRECTION AND SUPPORT

      The conference agreement includes $284,415,000 for 
governmental direction and support, including $206,825,000 from 
local funds, $57,440,000 from Federal grant funds, and 
$20,150,000 from other funds as proposed by both the House and 
Senate. In addition, the agreement includes $46,450,000 from 
funds previously appropriated in this Act as Federal payments, 
instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by the House and $21,100,000 
as proposed by the Senate. These Federal payment funds are 
allocated as follows:
      Office of the Mayor.--$1,100,000 for foster care 
improvements, $2,000,000 for a family literacy program, and 
$11,000,000 for emergency planning and security costs.
      Office of the Chief Financial Officer.--$32,350,000 to 
support economic development and infrastructure in the 
District, and the health, education, and job training needs of 
District residents.
      The conferees are disappointed with the slow pace in 
which the District and the Board of Education are providing 
charter schools access to surplus public school facilities and 
space in underutilized schools. There are 28 surplus schools in 
the city's inventory that could be made available to charter 
schools. Likewise, student enrollment in public schools is down 
almost 15,000 freeing up space equivalent to 20 school 
buildings. Yet 23 charter schools do not have permanent homes 
and new charter schools are being established each year. 
Theconferees believe the District should take this opportunity to 
provide strong leadership and foster a plan to develop and promote 
public schools and public charter schools, including the co-location of 
schools. The conferees direct the District government and the Board of 
Education to develop a task force to study what can be done to ensure 
the equitable and efficient use of public school buildings, both 
surplus and underutilized buildings. The conferees request a report no 
later than January 16, 2004 on the status of this task force.

from other funds, and $125,000 from private funds as proposed 
by both the House and Senate.

                       PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUSTICE

      The conference agreement includes $745,958,000 for public 
safety and justice, including $716,715,000 from local funds, 
$10,290,000 from Federal grant funds, $18,944,000 from other 
funds, and $9,000 from private funds as proposed by both the 
House and Senate. In addition, the agreement includes 
$1,800,000 from funds previously appropriated in this Act as 
Federal payments, instead of $1,300,000 as proposed by the 
House. The Senate bill contained no similar provision. These 
Federal payment funds are allocated as follows:
      Emergency Management Agency.--$500,000 for emergency 
personnel cross training.

other funds, $4,302,000 from private funds, and not to exceed 
$6,816,000 from the Medicaid and Special Education Reform Fund 
as proposed by both the House and Senate. In addition, the 
agreement includes $47,500,000 from funds previously 
appropriated in this Act as Federal payments, instead of 
$21,500,000 as proposed by the House and $43,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. These Federal payment funds are 
allocated as follows:
      District of Columbia Public Schools.--$4,500,000 for 
public school facilities and $13,000,000 for school 
improvement.
      State Education Office.--$13,000,000 for school 
improvement and $17,000,000 for resident tuition support.
      The conferees are disappointed with the slow pace in 
which the District and the Board of Education are providing 
charter schools access to surplus public school facilities and 
space in underutilized schools. There are 28 surplus schools in 
the city's inventory that could be made available to charter 
schools. Likewise, student enrollment in public schools is down 
almost 15,000 freeing up space equivalent to 20 school 
buildings. Yet 23 charter schools do not have permanent homes 
and new charter schools are being established each year. The 
conferees believe the District should take this opportunity to 
provide strong leadership and foster a plan to develop and 
promote public schools and public charter schools, including 
the co-location of schools. The conferees direct the District 
government and the Board of Education to develop a task force 
to study what can be done to ensure the equitable and efficient 
use of public school buildings, both surplus and underutilized 
buildings. The conferees request a report no later than January 
16, 2004 on the status of this task force.
      The Telecommunications Act of 1996 designated elementary 
and secondary schools and libraries as beneficiaries of 
universal service for telecommunications services. This 
specific support, in the form of discounts on 
telecommunications services, has become known as the education 
rate or E-rate. The conferees request a report no later than 
March 1, 2004 that shows, by fiscal year, the total amount of 
E-rate funding District of Columbia Public Schools received and 
a breakout of which schools received funding and how much they 
received. The report should also include further details of how 
each school spent its E-rate funding and a brief description of 
the impact this funding has had on integrating technology into 
its curriculum and programs.

           TITLE III--DC SCHOOL CHOICE INCENTIVE ACT OF 2003

      The conference agreement includes language to establish a

                      TITLE IV--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      The conference agreement changes several section numbers 
for sequential purposes and makes technical revisions to 
several provisions.
      The conference agreement retains Sec. 407(a) as proposed 
by the House to prohibit the use of any funds in the Act for 
publicity or propaganda purposes or implementation of any 
policy including boycott designed to support or defeat 
legislation pending before Congress or any State legislature. 
The Senate bill allowed the use of local funds for this 
purpose.
      The conference agreement retains Sec. 407(b) and (c) as 
proposed by the House to allow the use of local funds to carry 
out lobbying activities on any matter except the promotion or 
support of any boycott, statehood for the District or voting 
representation in Congress. The Senate bill allowed the use of 
local funds for these purposes.
      The conference agreement retains Sec. 417 as proposed by 
the House to establish criteria for the acceptance, obligation, 
and expenditure of Federal, private, and other grants by the 
District government. The Senate bill included a similar 
provision, but included different criteria.
      The conference agreement includes Sec. 421 as proposed by 
the House to prohibit the use of any funds contained in this 
Act for needle exchange programs. The Senate bill allowed the 
use of local funds for such programs.
      The conference agreement makes Sec. 429 permanent law as 
proposed by the House. The Senate bill contained no similar 
provision.
      The conference agreement makes Sec. 431 permanent law as 
proposed by the House. The Senate bill contained no similar 
provision.
      The conference agreement includes Sec. 432 as proposed by 
the Senate. The House bill contained a similar provision, but 
required that all savings be used to expand special education 
services within the District.
      The conference agreement includes Sec. 434 to amend the 
Student Loan Marketing Association Reorganization Act of 1996 
to clarify that annual administrative costs should be provided 
through the credit enhancement fund. TheHouse and Senate bills 
contained no similar provision. The administrative fee cannot exceed 5 
percent within any year, is non-cumulative, and is to be based on 
annual calculations. Any unobligated amounts at the close of the fiscal 
year shall revert back to the credit enhancement fund prior to the 
calculation of the following year's administrative cap. These funds 
will enable the Office of Charter School Financing and Support to 
expand its ability to conduct outreach to charter schools and provide 
technical assistance to attain appropriate facilities.
      The conference agreement includes Sec. 435 as proposed by 
the Senate to provide for the appointment and compensation of 
counsel in adoption cases. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.
      The conference agreement includes Sec. 436 which amends 
Senate Sec. 141 to allow the District to exceed its 
appropriation by not more than $15,000,000 from funds 
identified in comprehensive annual financial report as the 
fiscal year 2003 general fund surplus with prior approval from 
the Committees on Appropriations. The House bill contained no 
similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision as 
proposed by the House to prohibit the use of funds in the Act 
to support the action of District of Columbia, et al., v. 
Beretta U.S.A. et al. The Senate bill contained no similar 
provision.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision as 
proposed by the Senate related to the District acceptance and 
use a gift or donation. The House bill contained no similar 
provision. This provision is permanent law.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision as 
proposed by the Senate related to the procurement of goods or 
services. The House bill contained no similar provision.

provision. This provision is permanent law.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision as 
proposed by the Senate related to the Crime Victims 
Compensation Fund. The House bill contained no similar 
provision. This provision is permanent law.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision as 
proposed by the Senate related to other type funds. The House 
bill contained no similar provision.

DIVISION D--FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS, 
                                  2004

               TITLE I--EXPORT AND INVESTMENT ASSISTANCE

                Export-Import Bank of the United States

      The managers note that in fiscal year 2004, there is no 
request by the President for a subsidy appropriation for the 
Export-Import Bank of the United States. While the conference 
agreement provides no funding for the subsidy appropriation, 
the managers expect that there will be no reduction in Export-
Import Bank activity levels due to the extraordinarily high 
level of carryover balances in fiscal year 2004, which total 
approximately $575,000,000.
      The conference report includes no appropriation for the 
tied-aid ``war chest''. The estimated $260,000,000 remaining 
``war chest'' balance for tied-aid purposes may be used to 
support loans. The managers continue to expect that none of the 
funds appropriated by prior Acts for the tied-aid credits or 
grants may be used for any other purpose except through the 
regular notification procedures of the Committees on 
Appropriations.
      The conference agreement appropriates $72,895,000 for 
administrative expenses for the Export-Import Bank, instead of 
$71,395,000 as proposed by the House and $74,395,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement does not include a first-time 
appropriation for the Office of Inspector General. The Senate 
provided $1,000,000 for this office and the House did not 
address this matter. The managers note that the Export-
ImportBank already has an audit committee and other regimes in place, 
including independent auditors that provide financial oversight to its 
operations.

                Overseas Private Investment Corporation

      The managers direct the President of OPIC to continue 
current policy and consult with the Committees on 
Appropriations before any future financing for non-governmental 
organizations or private and voluntary organizations is 
approved.

                      Trade and Development Agency

      The managers commend the Trade and Development Agency 
(TDA) for its efforts to assist countries in improving their 
aviation safety and security systems, which has had a positive 
effect on enhancing United States trade for our aviation and 
aerospace industries. The managers recognize that setting 
aviation and safety standards worldwide is an important 
component for integrating a global system of trade. 
Accordingly, the managers recommend $1,500,000 for TDA to 
promote its work in this area by providing for the development 
of training materials to help prepare participating countries 
for International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) audits and 
to correct safety and security deficiencies.

                TITLE II--BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE

           United States Agency for International Development

                CHILD SURVIVAL AND HEALTH PROGRAMS FUND

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,835,000,000 for 
the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund instead of 
$2,235,830,000 as proposed by the House and $1,435,500,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. Significant funding for HIV/AIDS is in 
a new account, the ``Global HIV/AIDS Initiative'', and 
additional funding for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, 
and other health issues is provided in Assistance for Eastern 
Europe and the Baltic States, Economic Support Fund, Assistance 
for the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union, and 
Foreign Military Financing accounts. The managers welcome the 
emergence of the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator at the 
State Department, and specific direction for this office and 
its funding is included under the heading ``Global HIV/AIDS 
Initiative''.
      The conference agreement includes the list of funding 
categories as proposed by the House which makes clear that 
funding for children orphaned or otherwise made vulnerable by 
HIV/AIDS should be considered separately from that for other 
orphans and vulnerable children. The managers also include 
$250,000 for the monitoring and oversight of child survival, 
maternal and family planning/reproductive health, and 
infectious disease programs, instead of $150,000 as contained 
in the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes language allocating 
$1,835,000,000 among seven program categories in the Child 
Survival and Health Programs Fund: $330,000,000 for child 
survival and maternal health, including vaccine-preventable 
diseases such as polio; $28,000,000 for vulnerable children 
(not including children affected by HIV/AIDS); $516,500,000 for 
HIV/AIDS, including assistance for communities, including 
children orphaned by HIV/AIDS and otherwise affected by the 
disease; $185,000,000 for other infectious diseases, including 
TB and malaria; $375,500,000 for reproductive health/family 
planning; and $400,000,000 for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global ATM Fund). The managers expect 
that any change proposed subsequent to the allocation as 
directed in bill language will be subject to the requirements 
of section 515 of this Act. A definition of program categories 
and their components can be found on pages 9 through 11 of 
House Report 107-142 and under the heading ``Family Planning/
Reproductive Health'' on page 12 of Senate Report 107-58. The 
managers, for the first time in several years, include funding 
for UNICEF in ``International Organizations and Programs'' 
rather than in this account.
      The managers commend the President for his commitment to 
combat HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The conference agreement 
includes $1,646,000,000to fight these three diseases, and 
anticipates that $754,00,000 is available in the Labor, Health and 
Human Services Appropriations Act. It is anticipated that a total of 
$2,400,000,000 is provided to fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria in these 
two Acts.
      Of the amounts in this Foreign Operations Appropriations 
Act, $516,500,000, $185,000,000, and $400,000,000 are for HIV/
AIDS, TB, and malaria, and a United States contribution to the 
Global ATM Fund, respectively. An additional $491,000,000 is 
included in the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative account, and 
$53,500,000 is in Economic Support Fund, Foreign Military 
Financing, and regional accounts for Eastern Europe and the 
Baltic States and the Former Soviet Union.

                    ____________________________________________________
      Total, HIB/AIDS, TB, malaria......................   1,646,000,000

      The managers recognize that these three pandemics, 
especially HIV/AIDS and TB, are closely related, and that the 
response to them can not readily be separated. However, the 
managers have estimated how this $1,646,000,000 could be 
disaggregated by major infectious disease for tracking 
purposes. The managers also note that funding for ``other 
infectious disease'' should be allocated for activities besides 
fighting tuberculosis and malaria, such as disease 
surveillance. The TB and malaria estimates in this section 
should not be construed to indicate that these activities 
should not be undertaken.
      The conference agreement provides not less than 
$1,283,500,000 for programs for the prevention and treatment of 
HIV/AIDS, and for care and support of those infected and 
affected by the disease. $756,500,000 is funded through the 
Child Survival and Health Programs Fund, including $240,000,000 
as a conservative estimate of the amount form this Act that 
will be allocated for HIV/AIDS by the Global ATM Fund. An 
additional $491,000,000 is included in the Global HIV/AIDS 
Initiative account, and an estimated $36,000,000 is provided 
through other accounts, such as the Economic Support Fund, 
International Disaster Assistance, Foreign Military Financing, 
and regional accounts for Eastern Europe and the former Soviet 
Union. The estimate of $1,283,500,000 for HIV/AIDS does not 
include the United States share of HIV/AIDS assistance through 
the World Bank Group.
      The managers provide most HIV/AIDS funding in two 
accounts, Child Survival and Health and a new account, the 
Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, similar to the structure of the 
Senate bill and the budget request. Instructions retained from 
the House bill and relevant to the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative 
are included under that heading. The managers intend that the 
$516,500,000 allocated for HIV/AIDS in the Child Survival and 
Health Programs Fund will be used to finance on-going programs, 
and that the $491,000,000 in the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative 
account will be used for new and expanded programs in 15 focus 
countries.
      The managers recognize that the epicenter of the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic is moving from Africa and the Caribbean toward Asia, 
Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. In order to help 
prevent these epidemics from exploding, the managers once again 
direct that funds form the Child Survival and Health Programs 
Fund be made available for HIV/AIDS programs in Eastern Europe 
and the former Soviet Union. The conference report also 
includes funds under several bilateral accounts specifically to 
fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The managers also encourage 
USAID, working in coordination with the Global AIDS 
Coordinator, to make make available funds from Child Survival 
and Health Programs Fund for HIV/AIDS program in ``EST 
countries'' other than those for which funds are specifically 
mandated in this Act.
      The managers concur with the President's 2001 remarks at 
the announcement of the initial United States contribution to 
the proposed Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria that a successful approach to fighting these diseases 
must incorporate bilateral and multilateral programs and 
approaches, and that the Global ATM Fund has a crucial role to 
play in marshalling and distributing international resources.
      The conference agreement includes $400,000,000 for a 
contribution to the Global ATM Fund, as proposed by the House, 
rather than $250,000,000 as in the Senate bill or $100,000,000 
as contained in the budget request. The managers note that, of 
the awards pledged thus far by the Global ATM Fund to recipient 
countries, approximately 60 percent are for HIV/AIDS 
interventions, 23 percent are for malaria interventions, and 17 
percent are for TB or combined TB/AIDS interventions. The 
managers have used these percentages to estimate the portion of 
the United States contributions to the Global ATM Fund that is 
likely be attributed for each disease.
      The managers intend that the United States contributions 
to the Global ATM Fund be used to leverage other donors' 
contributions. The conference agreement does not include a 
provision contained in the House bill limiting the United 
States contribution to the Global ATM Fund to not more than 
one-half of all contributionsfrom other sources because a 
provision addressing the same matter is contained in section 202 of 
Public Law 108-25, the ``United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003''. The managers expect that the 
Global AIDS Coordinator will use the funds provided for a United States 
contribution to the Global ATM Fund to maximally leverage resources 
from other donors.
      However, the managers also recognize that funding cycles 
for donors vary, and that the application of the above 
provision may cause a portion of funds allocated for a United 
States contribution to the Global ATM Fund to remain unspent. 
Therefore, the conference report also includes a ``kick-out'' 
clause, as proposed by both the House and the Senate, which 
would ensure that funds are used for bilateral HIV/AIDS 
programs if other donors are unable to fully match the intended 
United States contribution to the Global ATM Fund. This 
provision is addressed in section 595. The managers expect that 
the Global AIDS Coordinator will bear in mind the managers' 
support for the Global ATM Fund and will judiciously use the 
flexibility provided by this ``kick-out'' clause to ensure that 
funds are allocated to the most effective uses.
      The conference agreement does not include a Senate 
provision regarding the percentage of the budget for prevention 
and treatment programs of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria that is made available to support 
technical assistance to ensure the quality of such programs. 
However, the managers recognize the importance of technical 
assistance and note the extensive resources and experience of 
the United States Government in providing such assistance. The 
managers urge the Global AIDS Coordinator to seek to ensure 
that an appropriate percentage of resources are utilized for 
this purpose.
      When funding through bilateral programs administered by 
USAID is considered in combination with the United States 
contribution to the Global ATM Fund, the conference agreement 
provides a total of $169,000,000 for TB assistance. Of this 
amount, $92,500,000 is funded through the ``other infectious 
diseases'' allocation in this amount, an estimated $8,500,000 
from other bilateral accounts, and $68,000,000 through the 
contribution to the Global ATM Fund.
      For malaria, the conference agreement provides a total of 
$193,500,000. Of this amount, it is expected that $92,000,000 
of the contribution to the Global ATM Fund will fund malaria 
programs, $92,500,000 is funded through the ``other infectious 
diseases'' allocation in this amount, and an estimated 
$9,000,000 is provided from other bilateral accounts.
      The managers expect USAID to allocate up to 10 percent of 
its funding for malaria programs to medicines and vaccine 
research and development, including $3,000,000 for the 
Medicines for Malaria Venture, and the same amount for the 
Malaria Vaccine Initiative.
      The conference agreement includes bill language, proposed 
by the Senate, regarding the development of microbicides as a 
means of combating HIV/AIDS.
      The conference agreement does not include up to 
$150,000,000 for mother and child HIV prevention as contained 
in the Senate bill. However, the managers expect that funds 
will be made available from the HIV/AIDS allocation in this 
account and from funds provided in the Global HIV/AIDS 
Initiative account.
      The conference account provides not less than $26,000,000 
for research on and testing of HIV/AIDS vaccines. These funds 
should be allocated by the Global AIDS Coordinator at the 
Department of State to the International AIDS Vaccine 
Initiative. The managers expect that $10,000,000 will be used 
for cooperative projects coordinated with the European Union's 
new 5-year program, the ``AIDS Vaccine Integrated Project,'' 
and in cooperation with the Partnership for AIDS Vaccine 
Evaluation (PAVE) operating under the aegis of the Department 
of Health and Human Services.
      The conference agreement also provides that not less than 
$26,000,000 should be made available as a United States 
contribution to UNAIDS, instead of $28,000,000 as proposed by 
the Senate. The House did not address this matter. The managers 
note the central role that UNAIDS plays in coordinating the 
work of eight U.N. agencies and the Global ATM Fund, and in 
providing technical support to countries as funding to combat 
HIV/AIDS rapidly increases.
      The managers urge USAID to implement programs that 
address the combination of the HIV/AIDS and hunger, including 
programs to enhance nutrition among HIV/AIDS-affected 
households and communities and that strengthen the ability of 
HIV/AIDS-affected individuals and households to meet current 
and future needs. Particular attention needs to be given to 
dealing with orphans and other vulnerable children and to 
promoting overall agriculture development and food production, 
including through school and hospital gardens as appropriate.
      The managers are aware of the efforts of Voices for 
Humanity and the other organizations cited on page 9 of Senate 
Report 108-106 and page 15 of House Report 108-222 to convey 
HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention, treatment and medical training 
among non-literate and oral communicating populations in 
developing countries. The managers expect that USAID and the 
Global AIDS Coordinator consider and, where feasible, fund 
pilot projects and other proposals submitted by such 
organizations.
      The conference agreement does not include a Senate 
provision that funds shall be made available to the HIV/AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria Cluster of the World Health 
Organization (WHO). However, the managers recognize the central 
role WHO plays in fighting HIV/AIDS and other infectious 
diseases, and expect that funds will be made available to 
support this new initiative.
      For health in West Africa, the conference agreement does 
not include section 699D of the Senate amendment providing 
$5,000,000 for the Carter Center's Guinea Worm Eradication 
Program. The managers note that the Carter Center recently 
released an action plan for guinea worm eradiction that target 
Ghana, Nigeria, and Sudan. The managers strongly support this 
program and expect that $5,000,000 will be a made available for 
this purpose. The managers alsoendorse the House report 
language on the West African Health Organization and on obstetric 
fistula and urge USAID to initiate programs in heavily effected areas, 
and to expand the programs of the International Medical Corps in Sierra 
Leone that address this problem.
      The conference agreement allocates $375,500,000 for 
family planning/reproductive health within the Child Survival 
and Health Programs Fund, as proposed by the Senate, instead of 
$368,500,000 as proposed by the House.
      The managers also direct USAID to continue to provide the 
Committees with a detailed annual report not later than March 
31, 2004, on the programs, projects, and activities undertaken 
by the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund during fiscal 
year 2003.
      Funds appropriated for the Child Survival and Health 
Programs Fund are appropriated for programs, projects and 
activities. Funds for administrative expenses to manage Fund 
activities are provided in a separate United States Agency for 
International Development Operating Expenses account, with 
three exceptions included in the conference agreement: 
authority for USAID's central and regional bureaus to use up to 
$250,000 from program funds for Operating Expense-funded 
personnel to better monitor and provide oversight of the Fund; 
in section 522, authority to use up to $13,500,000 to reimburse 
other government agencies and private institutions for 
professional services; and in section 525, authority to hire 
overseas personnel on a limited term basis.
      Any proposed obligations for Global Development Alliance 
programs, projects or activities shall be subject to the 
regular notification procedures of the Committees on 
Appropriations, as shall any proposed transfers of Child 
Survival and Health Programs funds to any other agency, 
program, or account.

                         DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,385,000,000 for 
``Development Assistance'' instead of $1,317,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $1,423,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The managers have agreed to provide $235,000,000 for 
basic education, including adult literacy programs, under the 
development assistance account, instead of $250,000,000 as 
proposed by the House bill or $220,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate amendment.
      The conference agreement includes Senate language that 
provides $100,000,000 shall be made available for drinking 
water supply projects and related activities. The managers 
expect USAID to report no later than 90 days after enactment of 
this Act on funding and implementation of its water projects, 
including the number and location of wells drilled, and the 
cost per well.
      The managers endorse language in Senate Report 108-106 
regarding Water Conservation and, in particular, the 
recommendation for $1,500,000 for Water Missions International 
(WMI). The managers intend that this funding to WMI for 
hospitals in Honduras be in addition to water project funding 
previously planned for allocation in that country.
      The managers are aware of the efforts of the Millennium 
Water Alliance to provide potable water to African communities 
that lack access to clean water, and recognize the importance 
of the Alliance's work. The managers recommend that, upon 
submission of suitable proposals to USAID, a significant part 
of the funds for potable water be provided to members of the 
Alliance to increase access to clean water and reduce rates of 
water-borne diseases and infant mortality in Africa.
      The managers encourage USAID to allocate increased 
funding for agricultural development activities, and recommend 
that USAID allocate funding for these activities in sub-Saharan 
Africa more at the village level to include projects in small-
scale irrigation, water and drainage, post-harvest storage, 
crop intensification, crop and livestock diversification, and 
rural infrastructure, such as the Special Programme for Food 
Security of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
      The managers continue to support the work of private 
voluntary organizations in the economic growth sector, 
especially the Financial Services Volunteer Corps and the 
International Executive Service Corps. The managers direct 
USAID to provide such organizations with sufficient core 
funding and fair opportunity to compete for relevant contracts 
and awards in the economic growth sector.
       The conference agreement includes language, similar to a 
Senate provision, which provides that not less than $10,000,000 
should be made available for programs and activities in rural 
Mexico to promote microfinance, small business development, 
private property ownership in rural communities, energy and 
environmental conservation, and to support small farmers who 
have been affected by adverse economic conditions, subject to 
the regular notification procedures of the Committees on 
Appropriations. The managers remain concerned with reports of 
corruption of the legal process in connection with a property 
dispute involving American citizens in Oaxaca and the 
University of the Americas, and the wrongful issuance of arrest 
warrants and imprisonment of these individuals. While the 
managers are aware that the criminal charges have been 
dismissed, the arrest warrants remain outstanding and the 
property dispute is unresolved. The managers intend to follow 
this matter until it is resolved satisfactorily.
       The managers are greatly concerned by continued reports 
of violence against women in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua, 
Mexico. The managers consider this a bi-national issue, as U.S. 
citizens are among the victims and among those accused of 
committing these acts. The managers urge the State Department 
to work with the Mexican government to set up a DNA database, 
under international auspices, which would enable the positive 
identification of the victims by collecting DNA samples from 
the victims and from the families of the disappeared women.
       The managers support projects in Central America that 
provide safe, nutritious, and affordable food to pre-school and 
school aged populations. The managers are aware of a 
nutritional drink that has achieved results in reducing 
malnutrition among Guatemalan pre-school children, and 
encourage USAID to determine the feasibility of establishing a 
long-term child nutrition program targeted toward reducing 
severe malnutrition rates among Central American children.
       The managers endorse the House language on the 
Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships, which calls 
upon USAID to fully implement and fund its new agreement with 
the Association.
       The managers endorse the House language on the Women in 
Development office urging that the office be funded at 
$11,000,000, and direct that USAID report no later than 90 days 
after the enactment of this Act on activities planned for the 
office and measures to increase staffing in order to expand its 
relevance to USAID-wide operations.
       With respect to Afghanistan, section 523 includes 
language similar to a Senate proposal, providing that not less 
then $2,000,000 should be made available for assistance for 
Afghans who suffer losses as a result of themilitary 
operations. The managers are aware that assistance for these victims 
has begun to be provided by USAID and the Department of Defense, in 
consultation with local Afghan communities, with funds previously 
appropriated. The managers believe that the capabilities of the 
Provincial Reconstruction Teams, which have access to remote, non-
permissive areas, should be utilized. The managers intend these funds 
to be used for medical and rehabilitation assistance, shelter and other 
infrastructure, and other appropriate assistance from this account.
      Although the conference agreement does not contain 
Economic Support Fund assistance for Pakistan, it does contain 
funding for education and health programs in the Development 
Assistance account and Child Survival and Health programs Fund. 
Given the enormous challenges that face Pakistan in the 
education and health sectors, the managers strongly urge the 
Administration to structure its proposed 5-year USAID package 
to address those needs. The managers expect not less than 
$2,000,000 should be made available for programs and activities 
of the Pakistan Human Development Fund and not less than 
$1,000,000 for Amanut Society. The Senate included funding for 
these organizations under the heading ``Economic Support 
Fund'', but no funds are made available for Pakistan under that 
heading in this Act as $200,000,000 was appropriated in Public 
Law 108-106.
      The managers direct that, of the funds for agriculture 
and rural development programs $25,000,000 be provided for 
USAID's Collaborative Research Support Programs (CRSPs), of 
which $2,000,000 should be used to establish a CRSP that is 
focused on water security.
      The managers support the language of the House report 
directing that USAID fund dairy development programs at not 
less than $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2004. Of this amount at 
least $7,500,000 should be made available for new projects at 
missions supplementing their existing rural development 
programs with a dairy component. The new programs should focus 
primarily on dairy development, rather than as a component of 
other cultural programs. The managers have included this 
directive in fiscal year 2004 in part because of USAID's 
failure to meet directives of previous years.
      The conference report includes language similar to a 
Senate provision which provides $155,000,000 for programs which 
directly protect biodiversity, including forests. The managers 
endorse language under the heading ``Environment Programs'' on 
page 17 in Senate Report 108-106 on these issues, including the 
importance of developing a regional strategy for biodiversity 
conservation in the Amazon Basin, amounts of assistance for 
Brazil in fiscal year 2004, and support for the Amazon 
Conservation Team. The conference agreement does not include 
Senate language relating to the use of Child Survival and 
Health and Development Assistance funds for integrated 
population-health-environment programs. However, the managers 
expect Child Survival and Health funds to be used to fund child 
survival, health, and family planning activities of integrated 
population-health-environment programs, including in areas 
where biodiversity and endangered species are threatened and 
Development Assistance funds should be used to fund 
environment, conservation, natural resource management, and 
sustainable agriculture activities in such integrated programs.
      The managers support programs that conserve energy and 
promote efficient energy production and distribution in 
developing countries. The conference agreement provides in 
section 555 that $180,000,000 should be made available for 
these programs. The managers urge that energytechnology program 
offices at USAID, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private 
Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency and other 
federal agencies involved in foreign assistance and export promotion 
activities that participate in the Clean Energy Technology Exports 
Initiative, contribute to this nine-agency effort.
      The managers endorse language on page 15 of Senate Report 
108-106 regarding, among other things, the importance of 
preserving the viability of leading micro-finance NGO networks 
so these organizations may increase the number of people they 
serve.
      The managers direct that not less than $1,000,000 be made 
available for the United States Telecommunications Training 
Institute, a long-standing and successful program that provides 
communications and broadcasting training to professionals 
around the world. The Senate amendment included bill language 
mandating that such funds be made available for this purpose. 
The House bill did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement provides that $19,000,000 should 
be made available for the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad 
program. The Senate amendment included bill language stating 
that $20,000,000 should be made available for this purpose.
      The managers strongly support the fertilizer-related 
research and development being conducted by the International 
Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) and urge USAID to make at 
least $4,000,000 available to IFDC, including not less than 
$2,300,000 for its core grant, as provided under the Senate 
amendment.
      The conference agreement does not include language, as 
proposed by the Senate, providing up to $3,000,000 for the 
International Real Property Foundation. The managers direct 
USAID to provide funding to this organization.
      The managers support the budget request for programs and 
activities conducted by USAID's Bureau of Democracy, Conflict 
and Humanitarian Assistance. The managers expect sufficient 
funding to be provided for democracy building activities that, 
if properly implemented, can serve as a bulwark against 
terrorism.
      The managers endorse language in Senate Report 108-106 
regarding Faith Based Organizations.
      The managers note that a proposal by the University of 
South Dakota to develop international mental health programs 
was inadvertently omitted from the list of university proposals 
on pages 20 to 23 of the Senate report.
      The managers continue to be supportive of efforts to form 
public-private partnerships, through the Global Development 
Alliance or other appropriate USAID mechanisms, to build and 
support schools and other educational institutions, which 
promote tolerant, secular educational curricula.
      The conference agreement includes a general provision 
(section 586), similar to Senate language, which provides that 
not less than $35,000,000 in ``Development Assistance'' funds 
should be made available for Nicaragua, which is $4,000,000 
above the amount requested. The managers commend President 
Bolanos for his efforts to combat the endemic corruption that 
has impeded Nicaragua's development. The managers recommend 
that these additional funds be used to assist subsistence 
farmers and to support judicial reform efforts.
      The managers support the request for Development 
Assistance for Nepal, but are aware of the deteriorating 
climate for security and private investment. In particular, the 
Department of State is asked to continue to work with the 
Government of Nepal to promote broad-based economic development 
and to secure property rights for Nepalese and foreign-owned 
infrastructure, including private power generation facilities.

              International Disaster and Famine Assistance

      The conference agreement appropriates $255,500,000 for 
``International Disaster and Famine Assistance'', instead of 
$315,500,000 as proposed by the House and $235,500,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Of this amount, $20,000,000 is made available 
specifically for assistance for famine prevention and relief, 
instead of $80,000,000 asproposed by the House and $100,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate under a separate heading, ``Famine Fund''. 
The conference agreement requires consultation with the Committees on 
Appropriations prior to the commitment or obligation of these funds.
      The remaining $235,500,000 is appropriated to USAID for 
traditional international disaster relief, rehabilitation, and 
reconstruction assistance, especially to mitigate the impact of 
unforeseen natural disasters.

                      Development Credit Authority

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement includes authority for USAID to 
use funds made available by this Act for the cost of modifying 
loans guaranteed under this or prior Acts, as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill did not address this matter. The 
conference agreement requires that the appropriate Committees 
be notified prior to the use of funds for loan restructuring.

   Operating Expenses of the United States Agency for International 
                              Development

      Out of the $604,100,000 appropriated for Operating 
Expenses of the United States Agency for International 
Development, the conference agreement provided $25,000,000 to 
be available until September 30, 2005 instead of $30,000,000 as 
proposed by the House. In addition, contracts or agreements 
entered into with funds made available under this heading may 
entail commitments for the expenditure of such funds through 
September 30, 2005.
      The managers have also included a new provision 
prohibiting the use of funds to open a new USAID overseas 
mission without prior written notification. In addition, 
several other provisions give the Agency greater flexibility in 
hiring personnel to meet expanding or unanticipated missions. 
The managers also support the intent of the language regarding 
USAIDLINK on page 30 of House Report 107-683, and expect that 
this activity will be carried out over the next two years.
      The conference agreement includes language that would 
prohibit reducing the number of foreign service employees at 
each mission in Latin America expect as provided through 
notification to the Committees on Appropriations. The managers 
understand that the assistance and staffing levels for all 
Central American missions have been under pressure due to 
demands elsewhere in the world, but Guatemala, Honduras and 
Nicaragua are slated for substantial staffing reductions 
relative to other countries in this hemisphere. The managers do 
not believe that this strategy reflects the priorities of 
United States economic, trade, humanitarian and immigration 
policies with these countries. Guatemala specifically is 
struggling in a state of post-conflict polarization, and with 
the new January 2004 government, the managers strongly believe 
that reducing assistance and staffing would limit the ability 
of the United States to be responsive at this critical juncture 
in Guatemala's history.

                        Capital Investment Fund

      The conference agreement appropriates $82,200,000 for 
USAID's Capital Investment Fund, instead of $49,300,000 as 
proposed by the House or $100,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conference agreement includes House language that 
authorizes the Administrator of USAID to assess fair and 
reasonable rental payments for the use of space by employees of 
other government agencies; provides that the rental payments 
shall be deposited into this account as offsetting collections; 
requires notification for the use of such offsetting 
collections, as well as for funds appropriated under this 
heading; and provides that the assignment of United States 
Government employees and contractors to space in buildings 
shall be subject to the concurrence of the Administrator of 
USAID.
      The conference agreement includes $62,200,000 for new 
USAID buildings in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Kampala, Uganda, and 
Conakry, Guinea or Bamako, Mali, as requested by the President. 
The managers note that in the past USAID has abruptly modified 
its prioritization of major overseas building projects and, 
therefore, request to be consulted immediately should this 
occur again. The managers strongly support the provisions of 
funds, when available, for a new USAID building in Yerevan, 
Armenia.

                  Other Bilateral Economic Assistance

                         ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement appropriates $2,132,500,000 for 
the Economic Support Fund instead of $2,240,500,000 as proposed 
by the House and $2,415,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Funds in this account are allocated in the following 
table and, as stipulated in bill language, any change to these 
allocations is subject to the regular reprogramming procedures 
of the Committees on Appropriations:

Economic Support Fund

      Total, ESF........................................       2,132,500

      The conference agreement provides $480,000,000 for Israel 
and language requiring disbursement of funds within 30 days of 
enactment of this Act. The conference agreement provides not 
less than $575,000,000 for Egypt as proposed by both the House 
and Senate, of which not less than $200,000,000 is for the 
Commodity Import Program assistance as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement also includes language that 
provides that not less than $250,000,000 should be made 
available for assistance for Jordan, as proposed by the House. 
The Senate language would have mandated this level of support.
      The managers endorse the House report language regarding 
support for the International Arid Lands Consortium. The 
managers also direct that not less than $1,000,000 be made 
available from ESF funds or from ``Development Assistance'' for 
the Blaustein Institute for Desert Research to investigate the 
flow and transport of pollutants in groundwater.
      The conference agreement provides that up to $1,000,000 
of funds should be used to further legal reforms in the West 
Bank and Gaza, including judicial training on commercial 
disputes and ethics.
      The conference agreement does not include funds for 
Pakistan under this heading. The Senate provided $200,000,000 
for Pakistan, as requested by the President. The House included 
$67,000,000 for Pakistan, specifically for debt relief for 
Pakistan. The Senate did not address the matter of debt relief. 
Congress provided $200,000,000 in subsidy appropriations for 
Pakistan in P.L. 108-106, the Fiscal Year 2004 Emergency 
Supplemental for Defense and Reconstruction of Iraq and 
Afghanistan.
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that proposed by the Senate providing that not less than 
$13,500,000 shall be available for assistance for Cyprus. The 
House bill provided that $12,000,000 should be made available, 
and the Senate bill provided $15,000,000 for Cyprus.
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that in the Senate amendment that provides not less than 
$35,000,000 for assistance for Lebanon. In addition, funding 
provided in this account for the Central Government of Lebanon 
is subject to Congressional notification. The managers permit 
that $4,000,000 should be made available for American 
educational institutions in Lebanon from the bilateral 
assistance program.
      The conference agreement does not include a Senate 
provision concerning the abduction of American children in 
Lebanon. However, the managers note that Lebanese officials 
have failed to enforce the custody and international pickup 
orders of Lebanon's civil courts despite repeated assurances. 
The managers condemn the Lebanese and Syrian authorities who 
have failed to uphold their laws and execute arrest warrants 
against parents who have abducted American children.
      The conference agreement includes a general provision, 
similar to a Senate provision, which provides $8,000,000 for 
reconciliation programs and activities that bring together 
individuals of different ethnic, religious, and political 
backgrounds from areas of civil conflict and war. The managers 
note the bipartisan support for such activities that promote 
understanding and reconciliation particularly in the Middle 
East, and expect the State Department and USAID to establish an 
efficient and effective mechanism for evaluating and funding 
proposals for the use of these funds. The managers believe that 
the following organizations are among those deserving 
consideration and support: Seeds of Peace; the Jerusalem 
International YMCA, the Arava Institute for Environmental 
Studies, the International Crisis Group, the Middle East 
Children's Association, Partners for Democratic Change, and 
Interns for Peace.
      The conference agreement provides $22,500,000 in 
``Economic Support Fund'' assistance for East Timor (Timor-
Leste) instead of $25,000,000 as proposed by the Senate and 
$13,500,000 (and $4,000,000 in Development Assistance) as 
proposed in the House. The managers recommend that funds be 
made available to, among other things, enhance economic 
programs to revitalize and for educational and vocational 
training especially for unemployed youth, promote good 
governance, meet basic human needs, and improve physical 
infrastructure. The conference agreement provides that of the 
funds for East Timor, $1,000,000 may be available for 
administrative expenses of the United States Agency for 
International Development.
      The managers have included language, similar to the 
Senate bill, which provides $1,500,000 for technical assistance 
to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. The 
managers endorse the Senate report language on this issue and 
urge the Administration to request funds for this purpose in 
fiscal year 2005.
      The managers have included a provision, similar to Senate 
language, regarding programs to develop justice and 
reconciliation mechanisms in Central Africa and expect the 
Administration to provide the amount of funding requested for 
these programs. The managers are concerned about human rights 
abuses in Central Africa, including rape committed on a massive 
scale in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. The managers urge the Administration to initiate 
programs aimed at ending the impunity thatprevails in the 
region, preventing future abuses, and providing medical and counseling 
services to victims.
      The conference agreement includes language in section 558 
similar to a Senate provision which earmarks not less than 
$4,000,000 in ``Economic Support Fund'' assistance for Tibet 
through nongovernmental organizations located outside the 
People's Republic of China to support activities that preserve 
cultural traditions and promote sustainable development and 
environmental conservation in Tibetan communities in the 
Tibetan Autonomous Region and in Tibetan communities in China. 
The managers are aware that the migration of Han Chinese into 
these areas threatens the survival of Tibetan culture and that 
nongovernmental organizations are involved in small scale 
projects to empower Tibetan communities and preserve Tibetan 
culture, and address basic human needs. The managers support 
the unique role of The Bridge Fund, and expect not less than 
$1,700,000 to be provided for the Bridge Fund in fiscal year 
2003 funds, and not less than $2,000,000 to be provided for The 
Bridge Fund in fiscal year 2004 funds. The managers intend that 
the balance of the funds will be made available on a fully 
competitive basis to organizations with a history of working 
with Tibetan communities.
      The managers endorse language similar to that contained 
in the House report, that recommends $250,000 be made available 
through a nongovernmental organization, such as the National 
Endowment for Democracy, for the purpose of providing training 
and education of Tibetans in democracy activities, and 
monitoring the human rights situation in Tibet. The managers 
intend these funds to be made available through section 526(d) 
of this Act.
      The conference agreement does not include a Senate 
provision earmarking $250,000 for the Commission to Investigate 
Illegal Groups and Clandestine Security Apparatus in Guatemala. 
However, the managers strongly support this effort to 
investigate those responsible for the political violence and 
organized criminal activity that continues to hamper 
Guatemala's development, and recommend that at least $250,000 
be provided to the Commission in fiscal year 2004.
      The managers are concerned with reports that the 
Government of Ecuador has failed to adequately safeguard 
foreign investments in that country. The managers direct the 
Secretary of State to report to the Committees on the extent of 
United States investments in Ecuador, and an analysis of the 
political, legal and economic challenges posed to such 
investments. The managers request the report to include 
recommendations for addressing and resolving these challenges.
      The conference agreement provides that Economic Support 
Fund resources shall be made available for administrative costs 
of the United States Agency for International Development to 
implement regional programs in Asia and the Near East, 
including the Middle East Partnership Initiative, in addition 
to amounts otherwise available for such purposes.
      The conference agreement provides that funds appropriated 
under the Economic Support Fund for a Middle East Financing 
Facility, Middle East Enterprise Fund, or any other similar 
entity in the Middle East shall be subject to the regular 
notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations.
      The conference agreement provides that not less than 
$1,750,000 should be made available for East Asia and Pacific 
Environment Initiatives. The Senate bill provided $3,500,000 
for this program and the House bill did not address this issue. 
The conferees have included $18,000,000 for the Treaty on 
Fisheries between the United States and the governments of 
certain Pacific Island states, popularly known as the South 
Pacific RegionalFisheries Treaty. The conferees endorse the 
discussion of this issue in the House report.
      The managers provide $3,000,000 for the Foundation for 
Security and Sustainability.
      Of the $4,000,000 included in the conference agreement 
for the initiatives of the State Department Bureau of Oceans 
and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, 
$2,000,000 is for supporting a bilateral science and technology 
agreement with Pakistan for which Development Assistance funds 
were denied in fiscal year 2003.
      The conference agreement provides language not in either 
the House or the Senate bill that allows transfers to the 
Economic Support Fund from funds appropriated in P.L. 108-106 
for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The conferees have 
included language that allows up to $100,000,000 for transfer 
to support programs for Turkey, and $30,000,000 for transfer to 
support the Middle East Partnership Initiative.

                     INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR IRELAND

      The conference agreement appropriates $18,500,000 instead 
of $19,600,000 as proposed by the House. The Senate did not 
address this matter.
      The conferees encourage the International Fund for 
Ireland to continue progress for direct reconciliation 
assistance and programs, particularly in helping to develop a 
fully supported, accountable and modern police service that 
serves all communities.

                       GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE

      The conference report includes $491,000,000 for the 
Global HIV/AIDS Initiative instead of $989,000,000 as proposed 
by the Senate or $450,000,000 as contained in the budget 
request. The House addressed this matter within the Child 
Survival and Health Programs fund and did not include funding 
for initiatives in a limited number of focus countries in a 
separate appropriations account.
      The managers welcome the creation at the State Department 
of the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, and anticipate 
that the powers and responsibilities delegated to the 
Coordinator by this Act and Public Law 108-25 will enable the 
Coordinator to finally coalesce the HIV/AIDS programs run by 
disparate agencies into an effective, coordinated approach. The 
managers have not included language included by the Senate that 
would have allowed the Coordinator authority to reach into 
other appropriations accounts and transfer funds into this 
account. The transfer authorities in section 509 of the 
conference agreement enable the Coordinator to fulfill his 
mandate. Any reprogramming or transfers of funds into or out of 
the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative account is subject to the 
regular notification procedures of the Committees on 
Appropriations and section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act.
      The conference report does not include language contained 
in the House bill limiting the value of grants and contracts 
that may be let directly from the Coordinator's office at 
$50,000,000. The Coordinator has informed the Committees that 
his office will rely primarily upon the procurement and 
contracting capacity existent in United States agencies. The 
managers expect the Coordinator to consult with the Committees 
on Appropriations prior to exercising his contracting and 
grant-making authority to directly implement overseas programs.
      The managers have included $8,000,000, as proposed by the 
Senate, for the administrative expenses of the Office of the 
Global AIDS Coordinator. The managers request the Global AIDS 
Coordinator, not later than 90 days following enactment of this 
Act, to submit to the Committees on Appropriations a report 
which details by object class the proposed uses of the Office's 
administrative expense allowance.
      The conference agreement includes language, similar to 
Senate provisions, which provides up to $75,000,000 should be 
provided for the safe and appropriate use of injections and 
other forms of infection control and prevention, and for blood 
safety programs. With respect to the safe and appropriate use 
of injections and other forms of infection control and 
prevention, the managers intend these funds to be used for 
programs and activities including national assessments and 
planning; the provision of syringes with the re-use prevention 
and safety feature(s) that will effectively reduce exposure to 
contaminated syringes and needles, and safety disposal boxes; 
gloves, masks, and other supplies required to implement 
universal precautions; logistical support to ensure a reliable 
supply of and proper use of these items; public education on 
the safe and appropriate use of injections; training of health 
providers; post exposure prophylaxis programs for health and 
laboratory workers; and waste management.
      With respect to blood safety programs, the managers 
intend these funds to be used for programs and activities 
including the establishment and support of national blood 
services; formulation/reform of national transfusion protocols 
to reduce the number of low priority transfusions; the 
provision of rapid HIV test kits; screening for other 
transfusion-transmitted infections; staff training, including 
in the appropriate clinical use of blood; the recruitment of 
voluntary, non-remunerated blood donors; and quality assurance 
programs.
      The managers note that the United States Global 
Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria Act of 2003 (P.L. 
108-25) provides that in fiscal year 2004 it is the ``sense of 
Congress'' that 55 percent of all global HIV/AIDS funds should 
go for treatment, 20 percent for prevention, of which no less 
than 33 percent be reserved for ``abstinence until marriage'' 
programs, 15 percent for palliative care, and 10 percent for 
orphans and vulnerable children.
      The managers continue to request a satisfactory 
explanation of how the Administration selected its Global HIV/
AIDS Initiative focus countries, including selection criteria 
that takes into account the need to preemptively stem the tide 
of the disease in other parts of the world at high risk of 
developing full-blown pandemics. The conference agreement 
includes language urging the Global AIDS Coordinator to select 
one additional focus country not in Africa or the Caribbean 
region. The managers understand that the Global AIDS 
Coordinator will consult with the Committees as he selects this 
fifteenth country, and will keep them informed on the selection 
criteria as they are developed.
      The leading indicator of success for the Global AIDS 
Initiative is treating 2 million people living with HIV/AIDS, 
preventing 7 million new infections, and providing care and 
support to 10 million of those infected and otherwise affected 
by the disease. One of the responsibilities of the Global AIDS 
Coordinator is to determine the proper allocation categories 
for programs and projects under his oversight in order to meet 
these objectives, but categorization may be difficult for some 
activities. The costs of mother and child transmission 
programs, for instance, are substantial. If these costs are 
included within the 20 percent target for prevention programs, 
funding for crucial behavioral change prevention programs may 
well be crowded out. The costs of mother and child transmission 
might also be considered part of the 55 percent target for 
treatment programs, since breaking the cycle of mother-to-child 
transmission often relies on the use of drug treatments.
      The managers support the goals for HIV/AIDS 
antiretroviral treatment established through section 402 of 
Public Law 108-25, including that by the end of fiscal year 
2004 at least 500,000 individuals with HIV/AIDS will be 
receiving antiretroviral treatment through United States 
assistance programs. The managers encourage the Global AIDS 
Coordinator to solicit and fund proposals for the delivery of 
antiretroviral treatment in targeted countries in an 
expeditious manner.
      The managers recognize that United States funding in the 
fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria will not, in 
itself, roll back these pandemics. Sustaining the advances made 
by the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative and other programs will be a 
growing challenge as more people begin drug therapy. The 
managers encourage the Global AIDS Coordinator to consider 
pilot programs and innovative approaches, including public-
private partnerships and faith based organizations, aimed at 
increasing sustainability and access to high-quality, 
affordable drugs while respecting intellectual property rights.
      The managers request the Global AIDS Coordinator to 
submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations, and the House Committee on 
International Relations not later than 60 days after enactment 
describing (1) the estimated proportion of all global HIV/AIDS 
funding in fiscal year 2004 that will be spent on prevention 
activities, and the estimated amount in dollars; (2) the amount 
estimated to be spent on ``abstinence until marriage'' programs 
in fiscal year 2004; and (3) a description of the criteria for 
determining which programs are included under treatment; 
prevention, with the criteria for ``abstinence until marriage'' 
programs specifically outlined; palliative care; and orphans 
and vulnerable children.
      The managers also request the Global AIDS Coordinator to 
submit brief reports to the Committees on Appropriations, the 
House Committee on International Relations, and the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations not later than 90 days following 
the enactment of this Act and updated every 90 days thereafter, 
describing the obligation and transfers between accounts during 
the previous quarter of all funds overseen by the Global AIDS 
Coordinator. The managers note the reports mandated by P.L. 
108-25, and direct the Global AIDS Coordinator to also submit 
these reports to the Committees on Appropriations.

          ASSISTANCE FOR EASTERN EUROPE AND THE BALTIC STATES

      The conference agreement appropriates $445,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate, instead of $452,000,000 as proposed by 
the House.
      Funds in this account are allocated in the following 
table and, as stipulated in bill language any change to these 
allocations is subject to the regular reprogramming procedures 
of the Committees on Appropriations:

Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States

      Total AEEB........................................         445,000

      The conference agreement contains language that provides 
that $2,000,000 should be made available to enhance safety at 
nuclear power plants. It is intended that this nuclear safety 
program will include the provision of full scope simulators.
      The managers have provided $35,000,000 for assistance 
programs in Montenegro as recommended in the House report. The 
conference agreement includes language providing that not less 
than $12,000,000 of this amount shall be for economic 
development and environmental programs in Montenegro's coastal 
region. This language was not included in either theHouse or 
Senate bills, but is similar to direction contained in the House 
report.
      The conference agreement includes Senate language 
providing not less than $1,000,000 should be made available for 
a program to promote greater understanding and interaction 
among youth in Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Macedonia under 
this heading, and not ``Economic Support Fund, as proposed by 
the Senate. This program also was discussed in the House report 
under the Assistance for Eastern Europe and Baltic States 
account. The managers expect the National Albanian American 
Council to conduct this program.
      The managers strongly recommend that the Russian, 
Eurasian, and East European Research and Training Program 
(Title VIII) be funded at the 2003 level. The managers endorse 
the House report language on the East Central European 
Scholarship Program (ECESP) and recognize the Administration's 
continued support for the program. The managers further 
recognize that expansion of this program into Central Asia 
would benefit the people of this region.
      The conference agreement includes not less than 
$53,500,000 for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria from this 
heading, Assistance for the Independent States of the Former 
Soviet Union, Economic Support Fund, and Foreign Military 
Financing, instead of $50,000,000 from these accounts, (except 
Foreign Military Financing) as contained in the Senate 
amendment. The managers are increasingly concerned about the 
increase of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, especially multi-drug 
resistant tuberculosis, in Eastern Europe, central Asia, and 
Russia.

    ASSISTANCE FOR THE INDEPENDENT STATES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION

      The conference agreement appropriates $587,000,000, 
instead of $576,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$596,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes not less than 
$57,000,000 for child survival, environmental and other health 
activities, and programs to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases, including not less 
than $15,000,000 for reproductive health/family planning.
      The managers reiterate language in the Statement of the 
Managers from prior years with regard to other limitations on 
assistance, ``that assistance to combat infectious diseases, . 
. . support for regional and municipal governments, and 
partnerships between United States hospitals, universities, 
judicial training institutions and environmental organizations 
and counterparts in Russia should not be affected by this 
section.''
      The conference agreement provides not less than 
$19,000,000 should be made available for nuclear reactor safety 
initiatives in Ukraine. The managers expect that of this 
amount, $14,000,000 shall be provided for simulator-related 
projects. The conference agreement also includes language 
similar to that proposed by the Senate providing not less than 
$1,500,000 for coal mine safety programs.
      The conference agreement provides that $94,000,000 shall 
be made available for assistance for Russia, including 
$4,000,000, as proposed by the Senate, to promote freedom of 
the media and independent media in that country. This amount is 
$21,000,000 above the budget request.
      The managers remain gravely concerned with the 
deterioration and systematic dismantling of democracy and the 
rule of law in the Russian Federation. The managers condemn the 
Russian Government's crackdown on the media and political 
opposition groups and individuals, and call upon senior Russian 
officials to immediately cease the harassment of American 
citizens involved in foreign assistance programs in Russia by 
that country's security services.
      The managers expect the State Department to proactively 
and publicly engage the Russian Government to immediately 
terminate forced returns of displaced Chechens to Chechnya, 
provide additional assistance to those Chechens impacted by 
Russian efforts to force or coerce returns, and secure 
accountability for gross human rights violations committed by 
Russian forces against Chechen civilians. The managers request 
the State Department to consult with the Committees on this 
matter.
      The managers expect a significant portion of these funds 
to be used to support democracy and rule of law programs in 
Russia.
      The managers support the Russian American Judicial 
Partnership, the Russian American Rule of Law Consortium, and 
the American Bar Association's Central and East European Law 
Initiative, which are involved in activities to strengthen the 
rule of law and protect civil liberties, which are essential to 
democratic and economic development in Russia. The mangers also 
support efforts, such as those of the Institute for Sustainable 
Communities, to mitigate the effects of environmental pollution 
on human health in the Central Asian region.
      The conference agreement includes language providing not 
less than $17,500,000 for the Russian Far East, instead of 
$20,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The managers endorse 
language in Senate Report 108-106 regarding the Russian Far 
East.
      The managers endorse Senate Report 108-106 language 
regarding orphans, and strongly support the work of Kidsave 
International and other organizations working in the Former 
Soviet Union.
      The conference agreement provides $75,000,000 under the 
heading Assistance for the Independent States of the Former 
Soviet Union for assistance for Armenia, as proposed by the 
Senate. This amount is $25,500,000 above the budget request. 
The managers direct that $2,500,000 in Foreign Military 
Financing and not less than $900,000 in International Military 
Education and Training funds be provided to Armenia, as 
containedin the budget request. The managers support Senate 
report language on the use of military assistance to enhance 
communication capabilities.
      The managers support the provision of assistance to the 
American University of Armenia (AUA), and recognize the 
important contribution of AUA to the development of Armenia's 
future leaders.
      The managers endorse House report language regarding 
proposals to establish and develop in Armenia a central 
diagnostic laboratory for the Caucasus region to address health 
and food safety.
      The managers continue to follow political developments in 
the region, particularly efforts to secure a peaceful 
resolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The managers 
endorse confidence-building measures among all parties to the 
conflict.
      The managers have not included a specific amount for 
Georgia in the conference agreement, but continue to closely 
follow political developments in Georgia. The managers are 
troubled by recent events, including political turmoil 
following flawed elections earlier this month. The managers 
condemn all acts of violence and intimidation against the 
opposition and encourage all parties to engage in dialogue to 
resolve the current political crisis.
      The managers note that corruption and the absence of 
political will to implement much needed reforms hinder the 
political, economic, and legal development of Georgia. The 
managers expect the State Department to continue to press the 
Government of Georgia to be far more transparent and 
accountable.
      The managers appreciate the threats to Georgia and the 
region from terrorists in the Pankisi Gorge, and encourage the 
State Department to continue to fund those programs and 
activities that further the national security interests of both 
the United States and Georgia.
      The managers expect to be consulted by the Department of 
State prior to any obligation of funds, should that country's 
political situation continue to deteriorate and funding 
priorities change.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate language 
expressing concern with the flawed October presidential 
elections in Azerbaijan but retains language in section 592 
requiring the Secretary of State to report to Congress on the 
ongoing investigation into the murder of United States 
democracy worker John Alvis.
      The managers condemn the manipulation of the electoral 
process by Azeri officials and deplore the post-election 
crackdown on demonstrators that killed at least one individual 
and injured more than 300. The managers note that Azerbaijan 
has yet to hold national polls that meet internationally 
recognized standards of free and fair elections.
      The managers expect the State Department, the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation and the Azeri Government to 
reinvigorate efforts to investigate and prosecute those 
responsible for the murder of John Alvis in December, 2000.
      The managers are concerned with reports that the 
Government of Moldova has failed to adequately safeguard 
foreign investments in that country. The managers request the 
Secretary of State to report to the Committees not later than 
180 days after enactment of this Act on the extent and status 
of United States direct foreign investment in Moldova, and an 
analysis of the political, legal and economic challenges to 
such investments, particularly with regard to a cognac factory.

                          Independent Agencies

                       INTER-AMERICAN FOUNDATION

      The conference agreement appropriates $16,334,000 as 
proposed by the Senate, instead of $15,185,000 as proposed by 
the House.

                     AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION

      The conference agreement appropriates $18,689,000 as 
proposed by the Senate, instead of $17,689,000 as proposed by 
the House.

                              PEACE CORPS

      The conference agreement provides $310,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $314,000,000 as proposed by 
the House. Under the heading Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, the 
conference agreement provides a permissive transfer of 
$15,000,000 to the Peace Corps for HIV/AIDS activities, instead 
of $20,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The House did not 
address this matter.
      The managers have included House language permanently 
waiving the so-called ``five-year rule'' of employment in the 
case of employees whose appointment involves the safety of 
Peace Corps volunteers, such as regional safety security 
officers and employees within the Office of Inspector General.
      The managers continue to support expansion of the Peace 
Corps, however, the managers are concerned about recent attacks 
on volunteers, especially on female volunteers. The managers 
recommend that the Peace Corps continue consulting with the 
Committees on Appropriations toexamine the current security 
issues to ensure that increasing the number of volunteers occurs 
simultaneously with better security and emergency procedures.

                    MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION

      The conference agreement includes $650,000,000 for the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) instead of $800,000,000 
as proposed by the House and 1,000,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The managers strongly support this initiative and provide 
the maximum level of funding possible to the MCC within the 
constraints of the budget allocation, which is $1,653,729,000 
below the President's request.
      The managers believe that additional assistance is 
critical to support development on a global basis. Title VI, 
the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 is included to provide 
such assistance in a manner that promotes economic growth and 
the elimination of extreme poverty and strengthens good 
governance, economic freedom, and investments in people.
      The managers reserve the right to amend this language in 
the fiscal year 2005 Act.
      The managers appreciate the input and efforts of the 
House International Relations Committee and the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee in drafting the authorizing language 
contained in this Act.
      The managers note that funding provided for the MCC in 
title II is subject to section 515, ``Notification 
Requirements''. The managers direct the Corporation to consult 
within 30 days on the modalities for implementing section 515 
in a manner acceptable to the Committees on Appropriations.

                          Department of State

          INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

      The conference agreement appropriates $241,700,000 for 
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement as proposed 
by the House, instead of $284,550,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The managers note that the conference report does not 
include funding for Afghanistan since $50,000,000 was provided 
above the request in P.L. 108-106 for Afghanistan.
      The managers note that the following amounts were 
provided specifically for counternarcotics and law enforcement 
in Afghanistan: $243,000,000 in the 2004 emergency supplemental 
(includes $73,000,000 for the Department of Defense); 
$25,000,000 in the 2003 emergency supplemental; and $80,000,000 
in the 2002 emergency supplemental. Even given these 
significant levels of funding, the United Nations reports that 
Afghan farmers are replanting poppy at greater rates each year 
since the fall of the Taliban. The managers strongly support 
the United States participation in attacking the Afghan drug 
problem, which generates funds for terrorists and extremists 
not only in Afghanistan but also throughout the region. 
Concurrently, the managers are concerned that while 90 percent 
of the heroin exported from Afghanistan is destined for Europe, 
the majority of funds to counter this crop are from the United 
States. Therefore, the managers direct the Department of State 
to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations not 
later than 45 days after enactment of this Act that outlines 
the objectives of this program, including participation by the 
Department of Defense; a detailed analysis of the purposes for 
which fiscal year 2004 appropriated funds are to be used and a 
detailed accounting of how fiscal year 2002 and 2003 
appropriated funds have been used; and the levels of actual or 
estimated funding over the 2001-2004 period by other donors 
listed by amount and by country.
      The conference agreement provides that $12,000,000 should 
be made available for anti-trafficking in persons programs. The 
Senate amendment provided $20,000,000 for this purpose, and the 
House did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement provides that $7,105,000 should 
be made available for the International Law Enforcement Academy 
in Roswell, New Mexico, of which $2,105,000 should be made 
available for the construction and completion of a new 
facility. The managers note this one-time language is intended 
to fully resolve this outstanding matter. The House did not 
address this matter.
      The conference report does not include Senate language 
that provides $5,000,000 to combat piracy of United States 
intellectual property. However, the managers support this 
initiative and expect the State Department to provide 
$2,500,000 for this purpose. The State Department, in close 
consultation with the United States Trade Representative, the 
Department of Commerce, and the Committees on Appropriations, 
should formulate a detailed strategy for the use of these funds 
before they are obligated. The managers also urge the State 
Department to utilize theexpertise of other agencies of the 
federal government when implementing these programs.
      The conference agreement makes available $26,117,000 for 
administrative expenses instead of $24,180,000 as proposed by 
the House and $25,117,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
managers have provided $1,000,000 in additional administrative 
expenses to allow and encourage the Department of State to 
provide office space to the Bureau of International Narcotics 
Control and Law Enforcement in the Harry S. Truman Building 
(Main State) to bring together all of the Bureau's program 
offices.

                     ANDEAN COUNTERDRUG INITIATIVE

      The conference agreement appropriates $ 731,000,000 for 
the Andean Counterdrug Initiative as proposed by the House 
instead of $660,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The managers 
emphasize that there are other funds for Andean nations in this 
Act.
      The conference agreement provides that not less than 
$257,000,000 shall be made available for alternative 
development and institution building activities by USAID, the 
Department of Justice, and the Department of State and that 
$229,500,000 shall be directly apportioned to USAID. The 
managers note that funds for the Bureau of Population, Refugee, 
and Migration are included in the $257,000,000 earmark and 
expect the entire amount requested be provided for programs to 
assist refugees and displaced persons.
      Again in fiscal year 2004, the managers have extended the 
availability of funds provided for assistance for Colombia to 
support a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking, 
against activities by organizations designated as terrorist 
organizations, and to take actions to protect health and human 
welfare. This provision is identical to that in the House bill 
and Senate amendment. The managers are supportive of the 
Colombian Government in its attempts to provide security for 
the Colombian people and have continued these expanded 
authorities in recognition that the narcotics industry is 
linked to the terrorist groups, including the paramilitary 
organizations, in Colombia. The managers expect 
counternarcotics, alternative development, and judicial reform 
to remain the principal focus of United States policy in 
Colombia. The managers reiterate that the expanded authority is 
not a signal from the managers for the United States to become 
more deeply involved in assisting the Colombian Armed Forces in 
fighting the terrorist groups, especially not at the expense of 
the counternarcotics programs, but to provide the means for 
more effective intelligence gathering and fusion, and to 
provide the flexibility to the Department of State when the 
distinction between counternarcotics and counterterrorism are 
not clear cut.
      The conference report does not include certain earmarks 
for organizations and programs that protect human rights in 
Colombia, as proposed by the Senate. However, the conference 
agreement provides that not less than $13,000,000 should be 
made available for such organizations and programs. The 
managers intend these funds to be allocated as follows: not 
less than $2,500,000 for protecting human rights defenders in 
Colombia; not less than $2,500,000 for the United Nations 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia; 
not less than $6,500,000 for the Colombian Attorney General's 
Human Rights Unit; and not less than $1,500,000 for the human 
rights unit of the Colombian Procuraduria.
      The managers remain concerned about the annual cost to 
the United States of operating and maintaining the fleet of 
helicopters used by the Colombian military for counternarcotics 
and counterterrorism purposes. While these helicopters are a 
key tool in the fight against coca and poppy, the managers 
believe the Department of State should begin to turn over the 
maintenance costs to the Colombian government. In fiscal year 
2004, over one-quarter of all assistance to Colombia is devoted 
to these costs, and the managers believe that other important 
programs in Colombia need to be prioritized through the 
allocation of United States assistance. Therefore, the managers 
expect to see the start of this transition reflected in the 
fiscal year 2005 budget request, and if it is not, the managers 
expect this matter to be addressed in the fiscal year 2005 
appropriations process.
      The conference agreement continues current caps on the 
number of United States military personnel and United States 
civilian contractors in Colombia, as well as the current 
prohibition on participation by such persons in combat 
operations in connection with assistance made available by this 
Act.
      The conference agreement again includes existing 
conditions on the aerial spraying of herbicide, similar to the 
Senate amendment, to ensure that any use of such chemicals is 
consistent with the Colombian Environmental Management Plan, 
with Environmental Protection Agency regulations, and to ensure 
that chemicals used in the aerial fumigation of coca do not 
pose unreasonable health or safety risks to humans or the 
environment. Additionally, not more than 20 percent of funds 
made available for the purchase of chemicals used in aerial 
spraying are available for obligation until the Secretary of 
State, in consultation with the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, certifies to the Committees 
onAppropriations that a number of conditions and concerns regarding the 
safety of spraying are addressed. This is similar to current law and 
the Senate amendment. The House did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include a Senate 
prohibition on aerial fumigation in Colombia's national parks. 
The managers are concerned with reports that coca growers are 
moving into Colombia's national parks and reserves, cutting 
trees and causing other environmental damage. The managers 
support efforts to address this problem, but agree that aerial 
fumigation in the parks and reserves should be used as a last 
resort. Other alternatives should be pursued, including manual 
eradication, training and equipping police to protect the 
parks, and relocating families that have moved into these 
areas. Accordingly, the conference agreement includes language 
that before aerial fumigation is conducted, the Secretary of 
State must determine that it is in accordance with Colombian 
law and that there are no practicable alternatives to reduce 
drug cultivation in these areas. The managers request to be 
consulted prior to any such determination.
      The conference agreement provides that not less than 
$2,500,000 should be made available for continued assistance 
for the Colombian National Park Service. This language is 
identical to the provision in the Senate amendment. The House 
did not address this matter.
      The managers endorse the House report language on the 
Naval Postgraduate School and United States contractors in 
Colombia.
      The conference agreement includes the House language 
prohibiting funds for the resumption of flights in support of a 
Peruvian air interdiction program until a system of enhanced 
safeguards are in place. The Senate did not address this 
matter.
      The conference agreement includes language similar to a 
Senate provision, which provides that assistance should be made 
available to the Bolivian military and police subject to a 
determination and report by the Secretary of State that the 
Bolivian military and police are respecting human rights and 
cooperating with investigations and prosecutions of alleged 
violations of human rights. The managers note that despite 
repeated assurances by successive Bolivian governments that 
human rights cases would be properly investigated and the 
individuals responsible appropriately punished, little has been 
done and impunity remains the norm for members of Bolivian 
security forces who commit violations. The managers urge the 
Secretary to give higher priority to these justice issues.
      The conference report includes changes to two reports for 
Plan Colombia from the fiscal year 2000 emergency supplemental. 
This issue is addressed in the general provisions.
      The conference agreement makes available $16,285,000 for 
administrative expenses of the Department of State as proposed 
by the Senate instead of $15,680,000 as proposed by the House.

                    MIGRATION AND REFUGEE ASSISTANCE

      The conference agreement makes available $21,000,000, for 
administrative expenses as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$18,500,000 as proposed by the House. The managers expect the 
additional administrative funds to be used for refugee 
admissions and emergency situations.
      The conference agreement also includes Senate language 
providing not less than $50,000,000 for refugees from the 
former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and other refugees 
resettling in Israel. The House addressed this matter in its 
report.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate language 
providing that funds be made available for international 
organizations for assistance for refugees from North Korea. The 
managers strongly support the provision of funds for such 
purposes, and expect the State Department to provide sufficient 
assistance to safeguard the human rights and dignity of North 
Korean refugees.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate language 
providing that funds should be made available for assistance 
for persons in Thailand from Burma. The managers remain deeply 
concerned with the plight of these individuals and are troubled 
by reports that Thai authorities are harassing Burmese in 
Thailand and hindering the provision of assistance to such 
needy persons. The managers address this issue in the general 
provisions of this Act.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate language 
that limits assistance to the central Government of Nepal until 
the Secretary of State certifies that the Nepalese authorities 
are cooperating with the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees and other international organizations on issues 
concerning the protection of refugees from Tibet. The managers 
endorse language in Senate Report 108-106 on this issue, and 
expect the Government of Nepal to cease this deplorable 
behavior and to cooperate fully with international 
organizations to ensure the safety of Tibetan refugees. If the 
Government of Nepal continues to forcibly repatriate Tibetan 
refugees, the managers will consider an appropriate response.
      The managers note that recent GAO findings show the State 
Department has taken actions to implement Section 301(c) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act to improve monitoring of the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) by requiring that they 
take all possible measures to assure that U.S. funds do not 
benefit terrorists and those receiving military training from 
guerilla groups. However, UNRWA's implementation of these 
procedures is constrained by many factors including safety of 
its staff and legitimate and necessary Israeli securtiy 
procedures.
      The managers urge UNRWA to implement the State 
Department's recommendations to:
      Issue explicit guidelines to staff to report compromises 
of UNRWA staff or facilities;
      Sever connections with Gaza Youth Activity Centers 
because of ties to Palestinian radicals
      Make the Operations Support Officer program a permanent 
part of UNRWA's monitoring program by including it in the 
regular budget, and
      Continue to make all efforts to meet Israeli authorities.
      The managers strongly urge the State Department to 
provide necessary funding to enable UNRWA to make the 
Operations Support Officer Program permanent.
      The managers direct the Secretary of State to submit a 
report to the Committees on Appropriations by no later than 
June 20, 2004 describing steps taken to ensure the 
implementation of these recommendations.
      Language included in the House bill regarding 
organizations adopting the Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Code 
of Conduct is addressed in section 594. The Senate addressed 
this matter in the general provisions.

     UNITED STATES EMERGENCY MIGRATION AND REFUGEE ASSISTANCE FUND

      The conference agreement appropriates $30,000,000 for the 
United States Emergency Migration and Refugee Assistance Fund 
(ERMA), instead of $15,831,000 as proposed by the House and 
$40,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes language from the 
Senate amendment that provides the funds notwithstanding 
section 2(c)(2) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 
1962. Section 2(c)(2) would limit appropriated funds to this 
fund if, when added, would cause the balance of the fund to 
exceed $100,000,000.

    NONPROLIFERATION, ANTI-TERRORISM, DEMINING AND RELATED PROGRAMS

      The conference agreement appropriates $353,500,000 for 
Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related 
Programs, instead of $385,200,000 as proposed by the Senate and 
$335,200,000 as proposed by the House.
      Funds in this account are allocated in the following 
table and, as stipulated in bill language any change to these 
allocations is subject to the regular reprogramming procedures 
of the Committees on Appropriations:

NonProliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs

               [Budget authority in thousands of dollars]

                                                    Conference Agreement
Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund...................         $30,000
Export Control and Border Security assistance...........          36,000

International Trust Fund for Demining...................          10,000
Small Arms/Light Weapons Destruction....................           3,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      NADR Total........................................         353,500

      The conference agreement contains language similar to 
that included in the Senate amendment that authorizes not to 
exceed $250,000 for the support of public-private partnerships 
for mine action by grant, cooperative agreement, or contract. 
The managers direct that the State Department provide a 
financial plan for the use of these funds to the Committees on 
Appropriations prior to the use of this authority. The House 
bill did not address this matter.
      The managers endorse the Senate report language regarding 
demining and the House and Senate report language regarding the 
Anti-terrorism Assistance program. With respect to Anti-
terrorism Assistance, the managers note that an additional 
$10,400,000 was provided for this program in the Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and the 
Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan (P.L. 108-106). The 
conferees strongly support the anti-terrorism program and the 
conference level of $97,000,000 represents an increase of 48 
percent above the level provided in fiscal year 2003.
      The managers recognize the central role of financing in 
the operation of terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and 
commend the Administration for initial actions taken in the 
wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 to block 
the flow of money to these organizations. Given the wide range 
of formal and informal financial mechanisms to secure funding 
and to move it around the globe, the managers acknowledge the 
need for an increasingly forceful approach to this problem.
      The managers note the importance of an interagency effort 
by the Terrorist Financial Working Group to curb the funding to 
terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda. The effort by the 
Departments of State, Treasury, and Justice, working with other 
agencies, is a key element in the fight against international 
terrorism.
      The managers direct the Department of State, in 
consultation with the Department of the Treasury, to provide a 
report on the spending of funds provided for counter-terrorist 
financing in fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, and a list of 
planned spending in 2004. In addition, the report shall contain 
a list of countries the Administration considers to be the 
major source and/or transit points for terror financing, a list 
of the interagency priority countries with which federal 
agencies are currently working and the activities taking place 
in those countries, and a list of other countries the 
interagency working group has identified as needing such 
assistance in the future and the types ofactivities that will 
be required in those countries. The report shall be provided no later 
than 120 days after enactment of this Act and the list of countries may 
be classified if the Secretary of State determines that this is 
necessary.

                       Department of the Treasury

               INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

      The conference agreement provides $19,000,000 for the 
International Affairs Technical Assistance program of the 
Department of the Treasury as proposed by the House instead of 
$12,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The managers support the efforts of the Department of the 
Treasury, International Affairs Technical Assistance, to assist 
nations in their efforts to reduce financial crimes and 
corruption by strengthening those governmental systems. The 
Department of the Treasury has been providing technical 
assistance for over a decade to nations facing economic 
disruption due to systemic weaknesses, post conflict crises, 
terrorist influences, or criminal practices. The managers urge 
the Department of the Treasury to continue its current 
technical assistance program and to strengthen its law 
enforcement program with additional resident and intermittent 
advisors. The managers further direct the Department of the 
Treasury to manage its technical assistance program in 
accordance with its own policies and to report to the 
Committees on Appropriations on the status of its efforts.
      The conference agreement provides an additional 
$5,000,000 above the President's request, and the managers 
direct the additional funds be used for terrorist financing 
activities and to expand programs providing economic advisors 
to assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
      The managers endorse the language of the House report 
with respect to the International Affairs Technical Assistance 
program.

                           DEBT RESTRUCTURING

      The conference agreement provides $95,000,000 for Debt 
Restructuring, the same level as proposed by the House bill 
instead of $195,000,000 in the Senate amendment. The managers 
expect the funds to be allocated as follows: $20,000,000 for 
the Tropical Forest Conservation Act Programs and $75,000,000 
for the first of two contributions to the Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries Trust Fund.
      Prior to obligating any funds for the HIPC Trust fund, 
the managers direct the Department of the Treasury to submit in 
writing to the Committees on Appropriations: a list of donors 
to the HIPC Trust Fund, each donor's pledge and actual 
contribution, the date of contributions, detailed disbursement 
data of the Fund including the level of funds transferred to 
each financial institution and the date of transfer, the 
current and expected future balance of the HIPC Trust Fund, an 
explanation of the current HIPC Trust Fund shortfall of funds, 
and an estimate of future United States contributions to the 
HIPC Trust Fund beyond fiscal year 2005.
      The conference report does not include funds for 
bilateral debt relief for the Democratic Republic of Congo 
(DROC). Given the greater humanitarian and emergency needs in 
the DROC, the conference agreement has dedicated funding to the 
Development Assistance, Child Survival and Health Programs 
Fund, International Disaster Assistance, Office of Transition 
Initiatives, and the Economic Support Fund in the expectation 
that this assistance will address and benefit more immediately 
the most pressing needs in DROC and Africa.

                     TITLE III--MILITARY ASSISTANCE

              International Military Education and Training

      The conference agreement provides $91,700,000 for the 
International Military Education and Training program as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $91,100,000 as proposed by 
the House.
      The conference agreement provides that funding for 
Algeria and Cambodia shall be subject to the regular 
notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations. 
The House bill did not include these nations, but both the 
House bill and the Senate amendment provided that funding for 
Nigeria and Guatemala is subject to notification.
      As evidenced by the conference agreement, the managers 
continue to strongly support the International Military 
Education and Training (IMET) program.
      The managers endorse the Senate report language 
concerning performance evaluation procedures of the IMET 
program. The managers believe that more needs to be done to 
improve output measures for the IMET program. The managers 
believe that simply counting the number of trainees is not 
sufficient to measure the IMET program and its results. The 
managers expect not later than 90 days after enactment of this 
Act, that the Secretary of State, after consultation with the 
Secretary of Defense, shall report to theCommittees on 
Appropriations on other factors that will be used to measure and 
evaluate the success of the IMET program.
      The managers endorse Senate report language on the 
Informational Program. In section 554, the managers have agreed 
to the provision in the House bill that requires the 
Secretaries of Defense and State to submit the annual foreign 
military training report required by section 656 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act to the Committees on Appropriations. This 
provision eliminates the requirement for separate reports to be 
prepared and transmitted to Congress.

                   FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCING PROGRAM

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement appropriates $4,294,000,000 
instead of $4,314,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$4,384,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The managers have included language providing 
$2,160,000,000 for Israel and $1,300,000,000 for Egypt as 
proposed in both the House and Senate bills. The conference 
agreement includes language similar to that proposed in the 
Senate bill which provides that $206,000,000 should be made 
available for assistance for Jordan.
      The managers note that in a previous continuing 
resolution, P.L. 108-84, the Congress authorized a $550,000,000 
Foreign Military Financing loan to the Czech Republic for the 
acquisition, logistics and training support of U.S. F-16 
aircraft. The Administration request stated that this action 
would have no budgetary impact, but the Congressional Budget 
Office did not concur and estimated the subsidy cost of this 
assistance under section 502 of the Budget Act to be 
$20,000,000. As this cost must be accommodated within the 
budget allocation for this bill, the managers have made the 
necessary reductions to absorb this credit subsidy within the 
amounts provided under this heading.
      The conference agreement includes $50,000,000 for FMF 
assistance for Afghanistan. The conference agreement includes 
$20,000,000 for the Philippines as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement includes $2,000,000 in FMF assistance for 
counter-terrorism efforts by Uganda as proposed by the House.
      The managers have not included the earmark of $27,000,000 
for assistance to Poland as proposed by the Senate. The 
managers strongly support expansion of United States foreign 
military assistance to Poland, and increased assistance for all 
nations that are contributing coalition forces in Iraq. The 
managers expect the Administration to propose increased FMF 
support for nations such as Poland, Bulgaria, Latvia and 
Lithuania in the fiscal year 2005 budget request.
      The managers note that in its efforts to obtain Article 
98 agreements, the State Department inadvertently allowed the 
signature of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as 
simply ``Macedonia.'' In the future the Department should 
adhere to current policy using the formal name for this Balkan 
nation.
      The managers have included language similar to that in 
the Senate bill allowing transfer of $17,000,000 to the 
``Andean Counterdrug Initiative'' account for aircraft and 
related assistance for the Colombian National Police. The 
managers have included language proposed by the Senate that 
prohibits the use of funds for activities relating to the 
clearance of unexploded ordnance from United States Armed 
Forces testing or training exercises, except on San Jose 
Island, Republic of Panama, where such activities already are 
underway.

                        PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS

      The conference agreement appropriates $74,900,000 for 
``Peacekeeping Operations'' (PKO) instead of $84,900,000 as 
proposed by the Senate and $85,000,000 as proposed by the 
House.
      The managers have fully funded every program in this 
account, except for a request for additional financial support 
for the Afghan National Army. While recognizing the importance 
of this initiative, the managers believe that this request can 
be fulfilled by using PKO funds provided in prior Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Acts for Iraq and Afghanistan (P.L. 
108-106 and P.L. 108-11).

               TITLE IV--MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE

                  International Financial Institutions

                      GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY

      The conference agreement appropriates $139,240,000 for 
the Global Environment Facility (GEF) instead of $107,500,000 
as proposed by the House and $170,997,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The managers intend that $107,500,000 of this amount is 
for the scheduled United States contribution to the third 
replenishment of the GEF, and $31,740,000 for past payments 
due.

       CONTRIBUTION TO THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION

      The conference agreement appropriates $913,200,000 for 
the International Development Association (IDA), the 
concessional lending facility of the World Bank, instead of 
$850,000,000 as proposed by the House and $976,825,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The managers intend that the 
appropriation be made available to fully provide for the first 
scheduled payment under the United States commitment to the 
thirteenth replenishment of IDA and to provide $63,200,000 of 
the $100,000,000 incentive contribution.
      The Secretary of the Treasury certified on April 12, 2003 
that the World Bank had met the conditions, specifically the 
setting up of performance benchmarks for World Bank programs, 
which would have allowed for an additional contribution of 
$100,000,000. However, the Committees on Appropriations were 
not consulted regarding this commitment of an additional 
$100,000,000 in appropriated funds. Therefore, the managers 
have included language that would require an independent audit 
to determine if the World Bank is meeting its performance 
targets in the spring of 2004 before the Secretary of the 
Treasury can further commit appropriated funds to the IDA-13 
agreement. If an independent audit is not conducted, the 
managers do not plan to include any incentive contribution in 
fiscal year 2005.

      CONTRIBUTION TO THE MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,124,000 for 
paid-in capital for the Multilateral Investment Guarantee 
Agency (MIGA), the amount provided in the Senate amendment, 
instead of $4,001,672 as proposed by the House bill. The 
managers intend for the appropriation to be provided for past 
payments due by the United States to MIGA. Approval for a 
subscription to the appropriate amount of callable capital is 
also included in the conference agreement.

       CONTRIBUTION TO THE INTER-AMERICAN INVESTMENT CORPORATION

      The conference agreement includes no appropriation for 
past payments due to the Inter-American Investment Corporation, 
as proposed by the House. The Senate proposed funding at a 
level of $898,000.
      The managers endorse House report language regarding the 
Inter-American Development Bank.

CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENTERPRISE FOR THE AMERICAS MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT 
                                  FUND

      The conference agreement appropriates $25,000,000 for 
past due payments by the United States to the Multilateral 
Investment Fund as proposed by the House, instead of 
$30,614,000 as proposed by the Senate.

               CONTRIBUTION TO THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

      The conference agreement provides $144,421,000 for the 
United States contribution to the Asian Development Fund, 
instead of $151,921,405 as proposed by the House and 
$136,921,000 as proposed by the Senate. The managers intend 
that the appropriation be made available to fully provide for 
the $103,000,000 scheduled payment under the United States 
commitment to the seventh replenishment of the Asian 
Development Fund and $41,421,000 for past payments due.
      The managers endorse House report language regarding the 
Asian Development Bank.

              CONTRIBUTION TO THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

      The conference agreement appropriates $5,104,930 for the 
African Development Bank as proposed by the House instead of 
$5,105,000 as proposed by the Senate.

              CONTRIBUTION TO THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

      The conference agreement appropriates $112,725,000 for 
the African Development Fund instead of $107,370,856 as 
proposed by the House and $118,081,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.

  CONTRIBUTION TO THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT

      The conference agreement provides $35,431,111 for the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as proposed by 
the House instead of $35,431,100 as proposed by the Senate.

            INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT

      The conference agreement includes $15,004,042 for a 
United States contribution to the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development (IFAD), as provided by the House. The 
Senate amendment provided $15,004,000. While IFAD is the 
seventh largest multilateral contributor to the enhanced 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative (HIPC), it, however, 
still does not have access to the core resources of the 
companion HIPC Trust Fund. Currently, IFAD has to absorb 87 
percent of the cost for participating in HIPC, while other 
multilateral development banks with full access absorb much 
smaller percentages. The managers urge the Administration to 
work with other donors so IFAD will gain access to the core 
resources of the HIPC Trust Fund.

                INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS

      The conference agreement provides $321,650,000 for 
voluntary contributions to International Organizations and 
Programs instead of $194,550,000 as proposed by the House and 
$322,550,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference 
agreement provides $120,000,000 for a contribution to UNICEF 
under this heading, as proposed by the Senate. The House 
provided these funds under the heading ``Child Survival and 
Health Activities''.
      The managers continue to support the work of the World 
Food Program (WFP) and have provided $6,000,000 for a voluntary 
contribution under section 534 of this Act similar to the 
Senate amendment. The House included a $6,000,000 contribution 
to the WFP under this heading.
      The managers have included $750,000 for a voluntary 
contribution for the United Nations Human Settlements Program 
(UNHABITAT), which works to improve the lives of slum dwellers 
around the world. The managers note that in prior fiscal years 
the Administration has supported the work of UNHABITAT and 
reprogrammed funds to this organization. The managers recognize 
the Administration's efforts on this issue and urge that funds 
are requested for UNHABITAT in fiscal year 2005.
      The managers are concerned that in fiscal year 2003, the 
Department of State disproportionately applied the 0.65 percent 
across-the-board cut mandated by P.L. 108-7 instead of reducing 
every program in this account by the same amount. As a result, 
certain organizations and programs under this heading bore the 
brunt of the rescission while others were not reduced. The 
conference agreement does not contain Senate earmarks under 
this heading, but the managers intend that the State Department 
will allocate funds according to the chart below. Should any 
across the board rescission be mandated that impacts this Act, 
such rescission is to be applied equitably for each 
organization and program indicated in the chart.
      The managers have provided $2,500,000 for the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to support its 
activities including human rights training for peacekeepers, 
activities to address trafficking in persons, monitoring and 
field activities.
      Funds in this account are allocated in the following 
table and, as stipulated in bill language any change to these 
allocations is subject to the regular reprogramming procedures 
of the Committees on Appropriations:

                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      (NOTE: If House and Senate language is identical except 
for a different section number or minor technical differences, 
the section is not discussed in the Statement of Managers.)
Sec. 502. Private and Voluntary Organizations
      The conference agreement includes language identical to 
that included in the House bill that requires receiving 
development assistance to obtain more than 20 percent of its 
total annual funding from other sources. The section does not 
include Senate language requiring that funds must be made 
available to PVOs in title II at the level they were provided 
in fiscal year 1995.
Sec. 506. Prohibition on Taxation of United States Assistance
      The conference agreement contains a provision prohibiting 
taxation of United States assistance that is a modification of 
a similar provision contained in section 579 of the fiscal year 
2003 foreign operations appropriations Act. The managers intend 
that section 579 be applied in accordance with the changes made 
to that section by this Act. In addition, in order not to 
create an undue reporting burden on contractors, grantees and 
other entities implementing that section, and in recognition 
that the reimbursement process is often not completed by the 
time it is necessary to determine what amounts are to be 
withheld, the managers agree that in determining amounts to be 
withheld agencies may use estimates and statistical sampling to 
determine the amount of assessed taxes and the amount of 
reimbursements that will be paid over a reasonable period of 
time. The Senate did not address this matter.
Sec. 507. Prohibition Against Direct Funding for Certain Countries
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that included in the House bill regarding prohibiting 
assistance to certain countries, but does not include Senate 
language adding Sudan to the list of countries.
      The conference agreement includes language clarifying 
terminology in P.L. 106-570 regarding Sudan as proposed by the 
Senate, but it is included in section 534, ``Special 
Authorities''. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 509. Transfers
      The conference report includes House language on this 
matter. The new provisions of this section would prohibit 
transfers to any department, agency, or instrumentality of the 
United States unless specifically authorized in this Act, 
except for certain transfers authorized by provisions of the 
Foreign Assistance Act. The Senate did not address this matter.
Sec. 515. Notification Requirements
      The conference agreement reflects a technical change to 
include ``Global HIV/AIDS Initiative'' and ``Millennium 
Challenge Corporation'' to the list of accounts that are 
subject to notification pursuant to this section. The House 
bill had similar language, and the Senate did not address these 
matters.
Sec. 517. Independent States of the Former Soviet Union
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that proposed in the House bill regarding Enterprise Funds. The 
provision does not include Senate language regarding the 
ability to deposit funds in an interest bearing account and the 
spending of such interest. This language is in permanent law 
and does not need to be included.
Sec. 520. Special Notification Requirements
      The conference agreement adds ``Cambodia'' to the list of 
countries subject to special notification procedures of this 
section as proposed by the Senate but deletes ``Colombia'' as 
proposed by the House. This section does not delete ``Serbia'' 
and ``Pakistan'' as recommended by the House.
Sec. 522. Child Survival and Health Activities
      The conference agreement authorizes USAID to use up to 
$13,500,000 from the ``Child Survival and Health Programs 
Fund'' and $3,500,000 from ``Development Assistance'' for 
technical experts from other government agencies, universities, 
and other institutions.
      The conference agreement includes language 
notwithstanding any other provision of law, except for those 
provisions under ``Child Survival and Health Programs'' and 
P.L. 108-25 (the ``United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003''), for funds 
appropriated by titles II and III of this Act for bilateral 
child survival or disease programs.
      The conference agreement also deletes authority allowing 
funds from titles II and III (in the House bill) or title III 
(in the Senate bill) to be used for activities authorized under 
section 301 of the Foreign Assistance Act.This authority is no 
longer needed, since funding for UNICEF has been moved to the 
International Organizations and Programs section.
      The conference agreement provides that not less than 
$432,000,000 shall be made available for reproductive health/
family planning activities from funds appropriated by this Act.
Sec. 523. Afghanistan
      The conference agreement provides that not less than 
$405,000,000 of the funds appropriated by titles II and III 
shall be made available for humanitarian and reconstruction 
assistance for Afghanistan. The House and Senate proposed a 
level of not less than $600,000,000. With the enactment of the 
fiscal year 2004 emergency supplemental (P.L. 108-106), an 
additional $1,200,000,000 has been provided for Afghanistan in 
fiscal year 2004.
      The managers intend that funds provided under this 
section be allocated as follows:

                            [$ in thousands]

Child Survival and Health Programs Fund.................         $21,000
Development Assistance..................................         150,000
International Disaster Assistance.......................          35,000
Economic Support Fund...................................          75,000
Migration and Refugee Assistance........................          72,000
Foreign Military Financing..............................          50,000
Other...................................................           2,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Total.............................................         405,000

      The managers intend that not less than $2,000,000 be 
provided for a reforestation program in Afghanistan, not less 
than $2,000,000 for the Afghan Judicial Reform Commission, not 
less than $5,000,000 for the Afghan women's programs, and not 
less than $2,000,000 for assistance for Afghans that suffer 
losses from military operations.
      The managers urge the Department of State and USAID in 
Afghanistan to work together to ensure that United States and 
international officials, contractors, and grantees are more 
adequately protected from insurgent attacks as they manage and 
implement reconstruction projects. In particular, the Embassy 
is requested to use the authorities and funds made available 
for Afghanistan in this Act and in P.L. 108-106 to equitably 
allocate diplomatic security and contract security so that 
USAID and other assistance managers can more safely oversee and 
assess programs outside of Kabul.
      The managers welcome the new mandate to expand the 
presence of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) 
outside Kabul. However, without additional resources and 
military personnel, ISAF expansion may not effectively 
contribute to creating a security environment for political 
development and reconstruction in Afghanistan, particularly in 
the south and southeast. The managers urge the Administration 
to provide resources to support ISAF expansion and to seek 
additional NATO partners in this effort.
      The managers also urge the Administration to work with 
NATO partners to reconcile ISAF expansion with any plans to 
create additional Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). The 
managers support the PRTs and believe their primary focus 
should continue to be enhancing security throughout 
Afghanistan.
      The managers note that women in Afghanistan continue to 
struggle to achieve the most basic rights despite the efforts 
of the new government. The managers urge that women be 
carefully integrated into activities related to development and 
reconstruction, and also believe that there should be a 
specific focus on strengthening women-led institutions and 
organizations.
      Therefore the managers provide $5,000,000 for programs 
aimed at addressing the needs of Afghan women through training 
and equipment to improve the capacity of women-led Afghan 
nongovernmental organizations, and to support the activities of 
such organizations. The managers urge USAID to establish a 
contracting mechanism for the disbursal and monitoring of small 
grants to women-led nongovernmental organizations to accomplish 
this goal.
Sec. 525. USAID Overseas Program
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the House that provides funds in this and subsequent 
appropriations Acts to carry out Part I of the Foreign 
Assistance Act may be used to employ individuals overseas on a 
limited appointment basis, and limits the number of employees 
hired under this provision to not more than 85. The Senate did 
not address this matter.
Sec. 526. Democracy Programs
      The conference agreement includes $13,500,000 for 
democracy, human rights and rule of law programs in the 
People's Republic of China and Hong Kong, instead of 
$35,000,000 as proposed by the Senate, and provides that funds 
appropriated under the heading ``Economic Support Fund'' should 
be made available for assistance for Taiwan for the purposes of 
furthering political and legal reforms, subject to a matching 
requirement.
      The conference agreement includes $11,500,000 for 
programs and activities to foster democracy, human rights, 
civic education, women's development, press freedom, and the 
rule of law in countries with a significant Muslim population, 
and where such programs and activities would be important to 
United States efforts to respond to, deter, or prevent acts of 
international terrorism. The Senate proposed $25,000,000 for 
these activities; the House did not address this matter. The 
conference agreement provides $3,000,000 of such funds shall be 
made available for programs and activities that provide 
professional training for journalists. The conference agreement 
includes language similar to a Senate proposal, which provides 
that ``Economic Support Fund'' assistance shall be made 
available to support civil society organizations working for 
democracy in Egypt. The managers intend that not less than 
$1,000,000 be made available for such organizations, including 
the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development, and that these funds 
are to be in addition to other amounts made available for Egypt 
in the Act.
      The managers provide that not to exceed $1,500,000 of 
such funds may be used for making grants to educational, 
humanitarian and nongovernmental organizations and individuals 
inside Iran to support the advancement of democracy and human 
rights in Iran. The managers expect the Bureau for Democracy 
and Human Rights to provide $1,000,000 for such activities, the 
National Endowment for Democracy to provide $500,000, and to 
consult with the Committees on Appropriations prior to 
obligating any funds for these programs.
      The conference agreement provides not less than 
$3,000,000 shall be made available for programs and activities 
of the National Endowment for Democracy to foster democracy, 
human rights, civic education, women's development, press 
freedom, and the rule of law in countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa.
      The conference agreement provides a total of $17,500,000 
for activities of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and 
Labor, Department of State under this section, and not less 
than $34,500,000 from funds made available by this Act. The 
agreement provides a total of $9,500,000 for activities of the 
National Endowment for Democracy under this section.
      The managers expect that funds made available under this 
section will be made available to the Alliance for Reform and 
Democracy in Asia.
      The managers endorse language in Senate Report 108-106 
regarding democracy programs, and direct USAID to consult with 
the Committees prior to making any changes in the framework or 
operation of its Consortium for Elections Political Process 
Strengthening (CEPPS) funding mechanism. The managers endorse 
the reporting requirement contained in the Senate report on 
anticipated contributions to the CEPPS funding mechanism from 
all accounts.
Sec. 528. Debt for Development
      The conference agreement includes House language on this 
matter. The Senate amendment would have authorized the use of 
appropriated funds for endowments. The managers are concerned 
about the desire of the Administration to create endowments 
without the consent of the Committees on Appropriations, 
therefore the managers expect that any endowments proposed by 
the Administration in fiscal year 2005 will be proposed in the 
President's budget request for fiscal year 2005.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate language 
expanding the authorities of the provision to allow non-
governmental organizations to deposit any funds made available 
in this Act or in prior Acts into interest bearing accounts. 
The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 531. Burma
      The conference agreement includes a modified version of 
the Senate's provision on the use of the Economic Support Fund 
in Burma and along the Burma-Thailand border, and, in addition, 
a House provision, similar to language in prior year Acts, 
regarding independent media activities promoting democracy 
inside Burma.
      The managers continue to strongly support the struggle 
for freedom in Burma, and call for the immediate and 
unconditional release of Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San 
Suu Kyi and all other prisoners of conscience. The managers 
expect the State Department to use every opportunity to press 
regional neighbors and the community of democracies to support 
political reconciliation in Burma that includes the full 
consultation and participation of the National League for 
Democracy and ethnic nationalities.
      The managers are concerned with reports of growing 
military ties between Burma and North Korea, and the purchase 
of weapons from North Korea through shipments of heroin. The 
managers request that, not later than 90 days after enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of State report to the Committees on 
the nature and extent of military ties between these two rogue 
nations.
      The conference agreement provides $13,000,000 to support 
democracy programs in Burma, along the Burma-Thailand border, 
for activities of Burmese student groups and other 
organizations located outside Burma, and for the purpose of 
supporting the provision of humanitarian assistance to 
displaced Burmese along Burma's borders. The agreement provides 
that $5,000,000 shall be allocated to the United States Agency 
for International Development for humanitarian assistance for 
displaced Burmese and host communities in Thailand, and that 
$500,000 should be made available to support newspapers, 
publications, and other media activities promoting democracy 
inside Burma. The managers request to be consulted prior to the 
provision of any assistance to Irrawaddy Publishing Group.
      The managers again expect that $1,000,000 will be 
provided to support efforts to combat HIV/AIDS inside of Burma, 
and that not less than $1,000,000 will be provided to support 
efforts to limit malaria and infectious diseases among Burmese 
along the Burma-Thailand border. These funds are to be made 
available under the heading Child Survival and Health Programs 
Fund in this Act, and are in addition to the amounts provided 
under this section.
      The conference agreement includes a reporting requirement 
by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the 
Administrator of USAID, describing the estimated amount and 
rate of disbursement of fiscal year 2002 and 2003 funding for 
HIV/AIDS programs and activities in Burma, the amount of funds 
expended by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) on 
HIV/AIDS programs and activities in calendar years 2001, 2002, 
and 2003, and the extent to which international nongovernmental 
organizations are able to conduct HIV/AIDS programs throughout 
Burma, including the ability of expatriate staff to freely 
travel through the country and to conduct programmatic 
oversight independent of SPDC handling and monitoring.
Sec. 534. Special Authorities
      The conference agreement includes House language 
providing certain authority for assistance for Lebanon and 
Montenegro and Pakistan, assistance to victims of war, 
displaced Burmese, and assistance to combat trafficking.
      The managers have continued current authority for certain 
bureaus and offices in USAID to hire personal service 
contractors, expanded existing authority for USAID to provide 
support for administrative costs of a program to provide 
information regarding available donated space on commercial 
ships to organizations shipping humanitarian assistance, and 
provides for expanded authorities under section 660(b)(6) of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.
      The conference agreement includes Senate language giving 
authority notwithstanding any other provision of law for the 
National Endowment for Democracy as proposed by the House and 
Senate.
      The conference report also includes language that 
provides $6,000,000 for the World Food Program from USAID's 
Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance as 
proposed by the Senate. The House provided these funds under 
the heading ``International Organizations and Programs''.
Sec. 539. Ceilings and Earmarks
      The conference agreement includes House language that 
allows for funds provided in this Act to be made available 
notwithstanding earmarks in any other Act, similar to language 
proposed in the Senate.
Sec. 544. Withholding of Assistance for Parking Fines Owed by Foreign 
        Countries
      The conference agreement allows 110 percent of the total 
amount of unpaid parking fines determined to be owed by foreign 
countries to the District of Columbia and New York City, New 
York, to be withheld from obligation for assistance to such 
country, as proposed by the Senate. The language is similar to 
that proposed by the House.
      The managers are concerned that nations receiving foreign 
assistance under this Act owe at least $16,600,000 to the City 
of New York in unpaid parking tickets and penalties. Noting the 
longstanding efforts of the City to work with the State 
Department to collect these outstanding balances, themanagers 
have included language to enhance the penalties associated with this 
provision. This is similar to Senate language.
      The managers urge the State Department to work 
cooperatively with the City of New York and the District of 
Columbia to find a workable solution to collect the unpaid 
balances from 1997 to 2002 that satisfies all sides and 
resolves the situation once and for all.
Sec. 546. War Crimes Tribunals Drawdown
      The conference agreement includes House and Senate 
language authorizing up to $30,000,000 in drawdowns of 
commodities or services for war crimes tribunals. The 
conference agreement includes Senate language adding the 
Special Court for Sierra Leone to the list of tribunals 
exempted from notification. The House did not address this 
matter.
Sec. 550. Restrictions on Voluntary Contributions to United Nations 
        Agencies
      The conference agreement includes language in the House 
bill prohibiting voluntary contributions to the United Nations 
if the United Nations implements or imposes any taxation on 
people in the United States. The Senate did not address this 
matter.
Sec. 552. Limitation on Assistance to the Palestinian Authority
      The conference report includes language similar to the 
House bill that prohibits funding to the Palestinian Authority 
to carry our chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act 
and includes a waiver if the President certifies in writing to 
the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the 
Senate that waiving such a provision is important to the 
national security interests of the United States. The 
conference report includes Senate language requiring a report 
on, among other issues, a description of how the funds will be 
spent and the accounting provisions used to monitor their 
expenditure, should the waiver be exercised. The House did not 
address this matter.
Sec. 554. Foreign Military Training Report
      The conference agreement includes House language 
requiring the Secretaries of Defense and State to submit the 
annual foreign military training report required by section 656 
of the Foreign Assistance Act to the Committees on 
Appropriations by the date specified in that section. The 
Senate amendment would have continued the requirement of a 
similar but separate report to the Committees on 
Appropriations.
Sec. 555. Environment Programs
      The conference report includes language similar to a 
Senate provision for programs that protect biodiversity and 
energy conservation, energy efficiency and clean energy 
programs, in developing countries. This matter is addressed 
under the heading ``Development Assistance''.
Sec. 556. Regional Programs for East Asia and the Pacific
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that proposed by the Senate requiring that funds appropriated 
under the heading ``Economic Support Fund'' that are requested 
for ``Regional Democracy'' assistance for the State 
Department's Bureau of East Asia and the Pacific shall be made 
available for the Human Rights and Democracy Fund of the State 
Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.
Sec. 557. Zimbabwe
      The conference agreement is the same as current law and 
is identical to the Senate amendment. The House did not address 
this matter.
Sec. 558. Tibet
      The conference agreement includes language similar to a 
Senate provision regarding Tibet, but the matter is addressed 
under the heading ``Economic Support Fund''.
Sec. 559. Authorization Requirement
      The conference agreement includes language that provides 
that funds appropriated by this Act may be obligated and 
expended notwithstanding section 10 of Public Law 91-672 and 
section 15 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 
1956, similar to language provided in the Senate amendment.
Sec. 560. Nigeria
      The conference agreement includes a provision identical 
to current law and the Senate amendment that restricts the use 
of IMET and FMF for Nigeria until a Presidential certification 
regarding actions taken against whom there is credible evidence 
of gross violations of human rights inBenue State in October 
2001, and the Government of Nigeria and the Nigerian Armed Forces are 
taking effective measures to bring such individuals to justice. The 
conference agreement includes a Presidential waiver. The House did not 
address this matter.
Sec. 561. Cambodia
      The conference agreement includes language similar to the 
Senate provision continuing restrictions on assistance to the 
central Government of Cambodia, with a few exceptions, and 
provides up to $4,000,000 for assistance for democracy programs 
in that country. The managers endorse the budget request for 
Cambodia, but recommend $17,000,000, instead of $15,000,000, in 
assistance under the heading ``Economic Support Fund''.
      The managers permit IMET assistance to Cambodia should 
the Secretary of State provide a list of those individuals 
credibly alleged to be responsible for gross human rights 
violations in Cambodia, including, among other tragic events, 
the 1997 grenade attack against the Khmer Nation Party that 
killed and injured scores of Cambodians and American democracy 
worker Ron Abney. The managers expect a broad range of official 
and nongovernmental organizations to be consulted in creating 
this list. The managers also request the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to renew efforts to investigate this act of 
terrorism.
      The conference agreement prohibits the use of funds in 
this Act to support any Khmer Rouge tribunal established by the 
Government of Cambodia. The managers strongly support justice 
for genocide and crimes against humanity committed by the Pol 
Pot regime, but remain concerned that the proposed tribunal--in 
its current formation--is open to manipulation and interference 
by the Cambodian People's Party and falls short of meeting 
international standards of justice. The managers expect 
sufficient funding to be provided to the Documentation Center 
of Cambodia.
      The managers remain concerned with the political 
situation in Cambodia, and commend the Alliance of Democrats 
for their commitment to democracy and the rule of law. The 
managers recommend that the State Department continue to 
publicly support the legal rights of the Alliance to negotiate 
a new Cambodian government and to press the Government of 
Cambodia for justice for crimes and human rights abuses 
committed with impunity, including the murder of former 
parliamentarian Om Radsady earlier this year.
      The managers recommend sufficient funding be provided to 
Global Witness, the only effective watchdog organization on 
Cambodia deforestation issues.
Section 562. Palestinian Statehood
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that proposed by the House that prohibits funding to support a 
Palestinian state unless the Secretary of State makes certain 
determinations. The Senate had similar language.
Section 563. Colombia
      The conference agreement includes a modified version of 
the Senate language on conditioning funds for Colombian Armed 
Forces through a two-time human rights certification process. 
Additionally, these funds are made available only upon 
notification to the Committees on Appropriations, and the 
conference report includes language requiring the Department of 
State to consult with the human rights non-governmental 
organizations every 90 days instead of prior to the 
certification. The House addressed this matter but only 
required a one-time certification.
Sec. 567. Contributions to United Nations Population Fund
      The conference report provides $34,000,000 for the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which is subject to the 
``Kemp-Kasten'' provision. Of this amount, $25,000,000 is to be 
made available from the ``International Organizations and 
Programs'' account and the balance from the ``Child Survival 
and Health Programs Fund''. The managers are aware that UNFPA 
has stated its opposition to the Chinese Government's one child 
policy and its social compensation fee. The managers condemn 
all forms of coercion in China's family planning policy and 
practice. The managers request the Department of State to 
report to the Committees not later than July 15, 2004, on the 
steps it and UNFPA have taken to urge the Government of China 
to end its birth limitation policy, including the social 
compensation fee, and the results of those efforts, nationally, 
and particularly in the counties in which UNFPA operates.
Sec. 568. Central Asia
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that included in the Senate amendment that conditions the 
assistance to the Governments of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The 
House did not address this matter.
Sec. 569. Discrimination Against Minority Religious Faiths in the 
        Russian Federation
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that in the Senate bill and the fiscal year 2002 Act that 
withholds funds for the Government of the Russian Federation 
until the President certifies that the Russian Central 
Government is not acting to discriminate against minority 
religious faiths. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 572. Funding for Serbia
      The conference agreement contains language similar to 
that proposed by the Senate, except that the provisions of this 
section affect assistance for Serbia after March 31, 2004. In 
addition, language is included that specifies Radko Mladic as 
an indictee whose surrender and transfer, if practicable, would 
signify cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal 
for the former Yugoslavia. The House bill included current law 
only.
Sec. 573. Community-Based Police Assistance
      The conference agreement includes language similar to the 
House language authorizing use of certain USAID-administered 
funds in title II of this Act for support for civilian police 
in Jamaica and El Salvador, notwithstanding section 660 of the 
Foreign Assistance Act, and any funds for this purpose are 
subject to notification. The Senate bill included a general, 
world-wide waiver of this authority.
Sec. 576. Disaster Surge Capacity
      The conference report includes language proposed by the 
House that allows funds in this Act to carry out part I of the 
FAA to be used to pay for detailees to or employees of USAID 
who carry out programs to address disasters, or programs under 
the heading ``Transition Initiatives''.
Sec. 577. IFAD Authorization
      The conference report includes language proposed by the 
House that authorizes $45,000,000 without fiscal year 
limitation for payment by Treasury for the International Fund 
for Agricultural Development. The Senate did not address this 
matter.
Sec. 578. Philippine Education and Health Infrastructure
      The conference agreement includes language as proposed by 
the House bill that requires that $600,000 of funds under the 
heading ``Economic Support Fund'' provided in P.L. 108-11 shall 
be available only for upgrading education and health 
infrastructure in the Sulu Archipelago.
Sec. 579. Basic Education
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that proposed by the House that provides not less than 
$326,500,000 for basic education from title II and requires the 
Secretary of State shall submit a report not less than 120 days 
after enactment of this Act laying out the strategy for the use 
of basic education funds. The Senate did not address this 
matter.
Sec. 580. Participation in the Thirteenth Replenishment of the 
        Resources of the International Development Association
      The conference report includes language identical to that 
proposed by the House that would authorize a further United 
States contribution to IDA, including making the contribution 
subject to prior appropriations. The Senate did not address 
this matter.
Sec. 581. Administrative Provisions Related to the Multilateral 
        Development Institutions
      The conference report includes language similar to 
section 578 of the House bill and section 679 of the Senate 
amendment, regarding transparency and accountability at the 
multilateral development institutions. The managers are 
concerned that these institutions are not moving fast enough to 
strengthen oversight of internal controls and procedures, 
protect whistle blowers from retaliation, and broaden public 
access to information about lending proposals, strategies and 
policies. The conference agreement provides that the Secretary 
of the Treasury should instruct the U.S. Executive Director at 
each of these institutions to inform the institution of a 
number of important policy goals, and to use the voice and vote 
of the United States to achieve these goals before June 30, 
2005. The Secretary is to report on progress not later than 
September 1, 2004, and six months thereafter.
Sec. 582. Participation in the Seventh Replenishment of the Resources 
        of the Asian Development Fund
      The conference report includes language identical to that 
proposed by the House that would authorize a further United 
States contribution to the Asian Development Fund, including 
making the contribution subject to prior appropriations. The 
Senate did not address this matter.
Sec. 583. Participation in the Ninth Replenishment of the Resources of 
        the African Development Fund
      The conference report includes language identical to that 
proposed by the House that would authorize a further United 
States contribution to African Development Fund, including 
making the contribution subject to prior appropriations. The 
Senate did not address this matter.
Sec. 584. Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Export-Import 
        Bank Restrictions
      The conference agreement includes a provision identical 
to the Senate amendment and current law that prohibits the use 
of funds by OPIC and the Export-Import Bank to finance 
investments in connection with a project involving diamonds in 
a country that is not implementing the requirements developed 
by the Kimberley Process, or is not undertaking other measures 
that the Secretary of State determines to contribute to the 
elimination of the trade in conflict diamonds.
Sec. 585. Reconciliation Programs
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that proposed by the Senate that would provide $8,000,000 from 
within the Economic Support Fund account for conflict 
resolution programs and activities. The House did not address 
this matter.
Sec. 586. Nicaragua
      The conference agreement includes a general provision, 
similar to Senate language, which provides that not less than 
$35,000,000 in Child Survival and ``Development Assistance'' 
funds should be made available for Nicaragua, which is 
$4,000,000 above the amount requested. The House addressed this 
matter in the report.
Sec. 587. Disability Access
      The conference report includes language similar to the 
Senate bill that requires the Administrator of USAID to develop 
and implement standards for access for people with disabilities 
for construction projects funded by USAID. The House did not 
address this matter.
Sec. 588. Trade Capacity Building
      The conference agreement includes language providing not 
less than $503,000,000 for trade capacity building assistance 
from the Trade and Development Agency, Development Assistance, 
Transition Initiatives, ESF, International Affairs Technical 
Assistance, and International Organizations and Programs 
accounts. The House had similar language, and the Senate did 
not address this matter.
Sec. 589. War Crimes in Africa
      The conference agreement includes a modified Senate 
provision that would make assistance available to the central 
government of a country in which individuals indicted by the 
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the 
Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) are credibly alleged to 
be living, if the Secretary of State certifies that such 
government is cooperating with ICTR and SCSL. The provision 
contains a national security waiver. The managers believe that 
peace and reconciliation efforts in West and Central Africa 
will be severely undermined if those most responsible for 
genocide in Rwanda and the atrocities in Sierra Leone are not 
brought to justice.
      The managers commend the democratically-elected 
Government of Nigeria for reaching an agreement with the 
Government of Liberia which helped to give the international 
community an important opportunity to provide desperately 
needed relief to that nation. Nigeria is a key ally in the 
region and the managers have recognized its role in this 
provision. However, the managers also note that efforts to 
address the humanitarian crisis and rebuild Liberia, as well as 
other parts of West Africa, will be severely limited if 
individuals indicted by SCSL are not handed over to the Court. 
The managers note that the United Nations Special 
Representative for Liberia, senior members of the Nigerian 
military, and important Nigerian civic organizations have 
called for the transfer of indicted war criminals to SCSL.
      The managers have also included language in this 
provision to provide $5,000,000 to the SCSL from unobligated 
balances of fiscal year 2003 ``Economic Support Fund'' (ESF) 
assistance. This language is similar to aSenate provision under 
the ESF heading, which would have provided $2,500,000 to the SCSL in 
fiscal year 2004. The managers have included this provision because a 
Congressional directive in P.L. 108-7 to provide these funds was 
ignored by the State Department. The managers continue to strongly 
support SCSL. The managers endorse the Senate report language on this 
issue.
      The managers continue to be concerned with the situation 
in Ivory Coast, where there are serious questions concerning 
the peace process and the country is in danger of becoming 
permanently divided between the rebel-controlled territory in 
the north and the government-controlled south. The managers 
note, however, that elections are currently expected to occur 
in 2005, the number of armed combatants remains relatively low, 
and damage to the economic infrastructure is light, and, 
therefore, believe that the situation could turn around if 
there is a breakthrough in the peace process. The managers 
request the State Department to consult with the Committees on 
the situation in Ivory Coast, concerning a range of issues 
including the progress of the peace process, the possibility of 
a United Nations peacekeeping mission, and section 508 
sanctions.
Sec. 590. Report on Admission of Refugees
      The conference agreement provides language similar to the 
Senate bill that advises the Secretary of State to use private 
voluntary organizations with the relevant expertise in the 
processing, identification, and referral of refugees and 
advises the Secretary of State to develop a system for 
accepting referrals from local private, voluntary 
organizations, and outlines categories of special consideration 
for admission. The provision also mandates a report, not later 
than 120 days after enactment, on the progress made to 
implement this section. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 591. Post Differentials and Danger Pay Allowances
      The conference report includes language that amends 
sections 5925 (a) and 5928 of title 5, USC, to increase post 
differentials and danger pay allowances for USAID employees, 
subject to the provision of similar pay allowances to the 
employees of the Department of State. The pay increase would be 
available immediately for personnel deployed to Afghanistan and 
Iraq. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 592. Report on Azerbaijan
       The conference report includes language similar to that 
proposed by the Senate that requires the Secretary of State to 
submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees on 
the investigation of the murder of United States democracy 
worker John Alvis. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 593. Designation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
        and Malaria under the International Organizations Immunities 
        Act
      The conference agreement includes a provision that amends 
the International Organizations Immunities Act by adding a new 
section that extends the provisions of the Act to the Global 
Fund the same as they are extended to a public international 
organization in which the United States participates pursuant 
to any treaty or under the authority of any Act authorizing 
participation. This provision is identical to the Senate bill, 
and the House did not address this matter.
Sec. 594. Code of Conduct
      The conference agreement includes a new section, ``Code 
of Conduct'' that prohibits refugee and humanitarian assistance 
funding under the headings ``Migration and Refugee Assistance'' 
and ``Transition Initiatives'' to an organization that has not 
adopted a code of conduct consistent with the Inter-Agency 
Standing Committee Task Force on Protection From Sexual 
Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises six core 
principles. Additionally the provision advises the Secretary of 
State and the Administrator of USAID to incorporate policies 
and programs to identify the needs of, and threats to, women 
and children at the various stages of a humanitarian emergency. 
The provision is similar to the Senate bill. The House 
addressed this matter under the heading ``Migration and Refugee 
Assistance''.
Sec. 595. Assistance for HIV/AIDS
      The conference agreement contains Senate language 
amending Public Law 108-25, the ``U.S. Leadership Against HIV/
AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003'' in order to set 
the baseline for calculating contributions from other donors to 
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria 
(Global ATM Fund) at 2004, for the purposes of calculating 
matching contributions, and to allow funds withheld due to 
certain provisions of Public Law 108-25 to be used for HIV/
AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs.
      The managers have exempted the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria, the World Health Organization, the 
International AIDS Vaccine Fund, and United Nations agencies, 
from section 301(f) of United States Leadership Against HIV/
AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. The managers 
intend that for purposes of this provision, the World Health 
Organization includes its six regional offices: The Americas 
(PAHO); South-East Asia (SEARO); Africa (AFRO); Eastern 
Mediterranean (EMRO); Europe (Euro); and Western Pacific 
(WPRO).
Sec. 596. Technical Correction Relating to the Enhanced HIPC Initiative
      The conference agreement includes a Senate provision that 
makes a technical correction relating to the enhanced HIPC 
initiative. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 597. Indonesia
      The conference agreement includes language, similar to a 
Senate provision, which provides that International Military 
Education and Training (IMET) assistance may be made available 
for Indonesia if the Secretary of State determines and reports 
that the Indonesian Government and Armed Forces (TNI) are 
cooperating with the FBI's investigation of the August 31, 
2002, murders of two American citizens and one Indonesian 
citizen in Timika, Indonesia. The managers are aware that, in 
the past, the TNI has not adequately cooperated with the FBI or 
with other investigations of this crime. However, the managers 
note that, during President Bush's trip to Indonesia in October 
2003, the President and Indonesian President Megawati 
Sukarnoputri jointly ``reaffirmed their shared commitment to 
find the murderers and bring them to justice.'' The managers 
intend that, prior to the Secretary making a determination, the 
TNI will have unequivocally demonstrated its commitment to 
cooperate with the FBI. The managers note that expanded IMET 
assistance is already available for Indonesia without 
restriction, which may include English language training.
      The managers endorse language in Senate Report 108-106 
regarding Indonesia.
      The managers remain troubled by the situation in Aceh and 
the ongoing conflict that has killed, injured and displaced 
thousands of innocent civilians. The managers note that the 
Indonesian Government has extended martial law for an 
additional six months, but continue to believe that this 
conflict will only be resolved through a political process.
      The managers strongly support democracy and political 
party building programs in Indonesia, and recognize that these 
efforts are long-term endeavors. The managers expect sufficient 
funding to be provided for democracy and political party 
building activities, and request that USAID consult with the 
Committees on the development of its 5-year strategy document 
for that archipelago.
Sec. 598. Religious Freedom Report
       The conference report includes language similar to that 
proposed by the Senate providing that the assessment and 
description of violations of religious freedom contained in the 
report required by section 102(b)(1)(B) of the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412 (b)(1)(B)) shall 
include a description of persecution targeted at religions, 
including acts of anti-Semitism, by individuals or 
organizations designated as terrorist organizations by the 
Secretary of State under section 219 of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act, as amended. The House did not address this 
matter.
Sec. 599A. Delivery of Assistance by Air
      The conference report includes language similar to that 
proposed by the Senate that the Secretary of State and the 
Administrator of USAID are directed to provide charter air 
service in regions where scheduled air service is grossly 
inadequate. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 599B. Modification on Reporting Requirements
      The conference report includes a modification of 
reporting requirements in existing law including: sections (f) 
of P.L. 106-246 (the Emergency Supplemental Act, 2000) to 
change the monthly reporting requirement on Plan Colombia into 
a quarterly report, and by specifying that this report should 
be submitted to ``the appropriate congressional committees'', 
not ``Congress''; section 3204(e) of P.L. 106-246 to specify 
that this report should be submitted to ``the appropriate 
congressional committees'', not ``Congress''; and deletes the 
requirement for a report from GAO pursuant to subsection (a) of 
section 803 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and 
Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2001, Appendix A of Public 
Law 106-429 (as enacted by section 101(a) of such Public Law). 
The House partly addressed this matter under the heading 
``Andean Counterdrug Initiative'', and the Senate addressed it 
in a general provision.
Sec. 599C. CPA Detailees
      The conference agreement includes a provision requiring 
the Office of Personnel Management to provide a report of the 
number of individuals detailed from each executive agency to 
the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq on the date of 
enactment of this Act no later than February 1, 2004. The 
report shall identify by agency the number of non-reimbursable 
and reimbursable detailees and shall be updated on a quarterly 
basis until May, 2005.

                 PROVISIONS NOT ADOPTED BY THE MANAGERS

      The conference report does not include section 555 of the 
House bill regarding ``Korean Peninsula Energy Development 
Organization''. The Senate did not include this provision.

``Cuba''.
      The conference report does not include section 572 of the 
House bill regarding ``Competition in Contracting''. This issue 
was addressed in P.L. 108-106, the Fiscal Year 2004 Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for the 
Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate amendment 
did not address this matter.
      The conference report does not include section 581 of the 
House bill regarding ``Efforts by North Korea Relating to the 
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons''. The Senate amendment did 
not address this matter.
      The conference report does not include section 582 of the 
House bill regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
of 1978. The Senate amendment did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include section 601 of 
the Senate amendment regarding ``Obligations During the Last 
Month of Availability.'' The House did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include section 606 of 
the Senate amendment regarding ``Prohibition on Financing 
Nuclear Goods.'' The House did not address this matter. 
Although no longer carried in the Act, the managers do not 
expect any funds in this Act from being used to finance the 
export of nuclear equipment, fuel or technology. If funds are 
used for such purposes, the managers expect these funds to be 
subject to the regular notification procedures of the 
Committees on Appropriations.
      The conference agreement does not include section 610 of 
the Senate amendment regarding ``Deobligation/Reobligation 
Authority.'' The House did not address this matter.
      The conference report does not include section 662 of the 
Senate amendment regarding ``Enterprise Funds in the Middle 
East Region''. The House did not address this matter. The 
managers include a proviso under the heading ``Economic Support 
Fund'' requiring that a Middle East Financing Facility or 
Enterprise Fund shall be subject to the regular notification 
procedures of the Committees on Appropriations. The managers 
expect that, should such a Facility or Fund be established, the 
Secretary of State shall certify and report to the Committees 
on Appropriations prior to the obligation of any funds that: 
(1) all appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that 
assistance is not provided to any individual or entity that the 
management of the Facility or Fund has reason to believe 
advocates, plans, sponsors, or engages in, or has engaged in, 
terrorist activities; (2) the Facility or Fund furthers United 
States commercial interests in the region; and (3) the Facility 
or Fund is managed in a fiscally responsible manner.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate section 
683 regarding ``American Churchwomen and Other Citizens in El 
Salvador and Guatemala'' relating to the December 2, 1980 
murders of four American churchwomen in El Salvador, and the 
May 5, 2001 murder of Sister Barbara Ann Ford and the murders 
of other American citizens in Guatemala, listed in the Senate 
report, since December 1999. The managers are aware that in 
amemorandum dated April 4, 2003, the U.S. Attorney General ordered the 
heads of all departments and agencies to report in writing on whether 
such government entity possesses information relevant to these murders, 
and, if so, to set forth a written plan for expeditious review of the 
information for possible release to the victims' families. Each plan is 
to include an estimate of the date by which the review and possible 
release of information is expected to be completed. The managers direct 
the Attorney General to provide to the Committees on Appropriations, 
not later than 60 days after enactment, copies of the written plans for 
each such government entity and a description of progress made in 
implementing such plans. The House did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate section 
686 requiring the Secretary of State to report on the status of 
the Administration's strategy to address the international 
coffee crisis. The managers are troubled that this strategy has 
been delayed for several months and expect it to be released in 
the near future. The managers note the serious impact that the 
coffee crisis is having on many nations that receive U.S. 
foreign assistance and endorse the Senate report language on 
this issue. The House did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate section 
687 prohibiting assistance to the central Government of 
Venezuela if the Secretary of State certifies that the central 
Government of Venezuela is assisting, harboring or providing 
sanctuary for Colombian terrorist organizations. The managers 
request the Secretary of State to provide to the Committees, in 
a classified form if necessary, not later than 90 days after 
the enactment of this Act, (1) a description of specific 
actions taken by the Government of Venezuela to cooperate with 
the Government of Colombia on counter drug matters, and (2) a 
description of the extent to which, if any, the Government of 
Venezuela has supported or assisted groups designated as 
terrorist organizations in Colombia.
      The conference agreement does not include section 689 of 
the Senate amendment that provides that funds appropriated by 
this Act that are available for the central Government of 
Thailand may be made available if the Secretary of State 
determines and reports to the Committees that, among other 
actions, the Thai Government supports the advancement of 
democracy in Burma and is not hampering the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance to people in Thailand who have fled 
Burma. The managers provide $5,000,000 to USAID to address the 
plight of Burmese in Thailand. The managers remain concerned by 
Thailand's continued engagement with the repressive Burmese 
junta, including recent pledges to set aside differences to 
promote economic cooperation. The managers view such actions as 
contrary to furthering the struggle of democracy inside Burma.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate section 
692 regarding ``Prohibition on Funding to Countries That Trade 
in Certain Weapons with North Korea''. The House bill did not 
address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include section 693 as 
proposed by the Senate regarding religious tolerance in 
Malaysia. However, the managers remain deeply concerned that 
the inaccurate and anti-Semitic comments of the former 
Malaysian Prime Minister may fuel religious intolerance 
throughout the region and provide credibility to the hateful 
messages of religious extremists in Malaysia, Indonesia and 
elsewhere. The managers understand that the views of the former 
Prime Minister, who retired on October 31, 2003 do not reflect 
those of all Malaysians, including the country's new 
leadership. The House bill did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate section 
699A regarding a ``Report on Sierra Leone''. The House did not 
address this matter. The managers intend that the Administrator 
of USAID submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, 
no later than 6 months after enactment, on the feasibility of 
establishing a United States mission in Sierra Leone.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate section 
699B regarding a ``Report on Somalia''. However, the managers 
expect that not later than 6 months after enactment the 
Secretary of State will submit a report to the Committees on 
Appropriations, describing a strategy for engaging with 
competent and responsible authorities and organizations within 
Somalia, including those in Somaliland, to strengthen local 
capacity and establish incentives for communities to seek 
stability. The report is also to include a multi-year strategy 
for: increasing access to basic education and health care 
services; supporting efforts to establish systems for effective 
regulation and monitoring of Somali hawala or informal banking 
establishments; and supporting initiatives to rehabilitate the 
livestock export sector in Somalia. The House did not address 
this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate section 
699D regarding a ``Guinea Worm Eradication Program''. This 
matter is addressed under the heading ``Child Survival and 
Health Programs Fund''. The House did not address this matter.
      While the conference agreement does not include Senate 
section 699E expressing the sense of Congress on certain issues 
relating to Iran, themanagers support this language and remain 
gravely concerned with the Government of Iran's authoritarian and 
repressive rule, its development of nuclear weapons and their delivery 
systems, and support for terrorists and other undesirable elements that 
may undermine reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The House did not address 
this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate section 
699G that earmarked $7,000,000 in ``Transition Initiatives'' 
funds for democracy-building efforts in Cuba. However, the 
managers recommend $7,000,000 under ``Economic Support Fund'' 
for democracy-building efforts for Cuba supported by USAID 
including through published and informational material, 
assistance to victims of political repression and their 
families, support for democratic and human rights groups in 
Cuba, and support for independent international human rights 
monitors in Cuba. The conferees expect that, to the maximum 
extent possible, organizations implementing these programs for 
Cuba will be selected on a competitive basis.
      The conference report does not include Senate section 
699H concerning the development of justice and reconciliation 
mechanisms in Central Africa. This issue is addressed under the 
``Economic Support Fund'' heading.
      The conference agreement does not include section 699I of 
the Senate amendment calling for the Global AIDS Coordinator to 
make publicly available prices paid to purchase HIV/AIDS 
pharmaceuticals, antiviral therapies, diagnostic and monitoring 
tests, and other appropriate medicines, including medicines to 
treat opportunistic infections, for the treatment of people 
with HIV/AIDS and the prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission of HIV/AIDS in developing countries, through the 
use of funds appropriated under this Act and, to the extent 
available, by the World Health Organization and the Global Fund 
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. However, the managers 
direct the AIDS Coordinator to make this information publicly 
available, including through posting on Internet web sites 
maintained by the Coordinator, beginning not later than 60 days 
after enactment of the Act.
      The conference agreement does not include section 699K of 
the Senate amendment adding an additional $289,000,000 to the 
Global AIDS Initiative account. Additional funding for HIV/
AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria is contained under the heading 
``Child Survival and Health Programs Fund'' and ``Global HIV/
AIDS Initiative''.
      The conference agreement does not include section 699L of 
the Senate amendment regarding ``International Military 
Training Assistance For Indonesia''. This matter is addressed 
in section 597 of the conference report. The House did not 
address this matter.

   DIVISION E--DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND 
          EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS 2004

      In implementing this agreement, the Departments and 
agencies should be guided by the language and instructions set 
forth in House Report 108-188 and Senate Report 108-81 
accompanying the bill, H.R. 2660.
      In the cases where the language and instructions in 
either report specifically address the allocation of funds, 
each has been reviewed by the conferees and those that are 
jointly concurred in have been endorsed in this joint 
statement.
      The conferees direct that the Departments and agencies 
funded through this Division make a written request to the 
chairmen of the Committees prior to the reprogramming of funds 
in excess of 10 percent, or $500,000, whichever is less, 
between programs, activities, or elements unless an alternate 
amount for the agency in question is specified elsewhere in 
Division E of this Statement. The conferees further agree that 
a reprogramming request is required for actions involving less 
than the above-mentioned amounts if such actions would have the 
effect of changing an agency's funding requirements in future 
years or if the action can be construed to be the initiation of 
a new program.
      The conferees reiterate that the Committees be notified 
regarding reorganization of offices, programs, or activities 
prior to the planned implementation of such reorganizations.
      Finally, the conferees request that statements on the 
effect of this appropriation Act be submitted to the Committees 
within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
      The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and 
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004, put 
in place by this resolution, incorporates the following 
agreements of the managers:

                      TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

                 Employment and Training Administration

                    TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES

      The conference agreement includes $5,160,654,000 for 
training and employment services instead of $5,077,039,000 as 
proposed by the House and $5,140,588,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Of the amount appropriated, $2,463,000,000 is an 
advance appropriation for fiscal year 2004, as proposed by the 
House and the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $1,456,760,000 for the 
Dislocated Worker program as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$1,461,760,000 as proposed by the House. The conferees override 
the formula that provides that 80 percent of the funds provided 
will be used for State formula grants and 20 percent for 
National Emergency Grants, providing $1,180,152,000 for the 
States and $276,608,000 for the National Reserve.
      The conference agreement includes bill language giving 
the Secretary of Labor authority to use dislocated worker 
national reserve funds to provide assistance to a State for 
statewide or local use in order to address cases where there 
have been worker dislocations across multiple sectors or across 
multiple local areas. The conferees urge the Secretary, when 
determining competitive awards under this authority, to give 
favorable consideration to the applications of assistance to 
States that have sustained worker dislocation in such a manner 
and can demonstrate the capacity to respond effectively in a 
coordinated fashion across multiple sectors or local areas.
      The conference agreement includes $55,000,000 for Native 
Americans as proposed by the House instead of $55,636,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $77,330,000 for 
activities authorized under Section 167 of the Workforce 
Investment Act, reflected in two separate line items on the 
table accompanying the Conference Report: `Migrant and Seasonal 
Farmworkers' and `National Activities/Other'. Under the Migrant 
and Seasonal Farmworkers line item, the agreement provides 
$76,823,000. The conference agreement includes bill language 
directing that $4,610,000 of this amount be used for migrant 
and seasonal farmworker housing grants; the conference 
agreement includes language further directing that not less 
than 70 percent of this amount be used for permanent housing 
grants.
      Within the National Activities/Other line item, the 
conference agreement includes $507,000 to be used for Section 
167 training, technical assistance and related activities, 
including continuing funding for migrant rest center activities 
at the current level.
      The conference agreement includes $1,546,216,000 for Job 
Corps. Within the total, $1,416,000,000 is provided for 
continuing operations of the program and $130,216,000 is for 
renovation and construction of Job Corps centers.
      The conferees recognize that New Hampshire is one of only 
two States in the Nation without a Job Corps Center and that it 
desires to open a center in the State. The conferees intend to 
begin providing funding for at least one new Job Corps Center 
in fiscal year 2005 and expect the Department of Labor to give 
priority consideration to applications fromStates currently 
without a Job Corps Center. Further, the conferees direct the 
Department of Labor to provide technical assistance to the State of New 
Hampshire to identify one or more sites that would be suitable for 
consideration for future expansion of Job Corps.
      The conferees also note that the Job Corps network 
currently includes at least 5 existing satellite centers. The 
conferees are aware of entities in Iowa and other States 
working with local Job Corps sites to replicate this model. The 
conferees believe this is a low-cost option to expand the 
existing network and urge the Secretary to assist in the 
planning of new satellite centers. The Secretary shall issue a 
report no later than August 31, 2004 identifying the barriers 
experienced by the existing Centers and a comprehensive plan 
for expanding the satellite concept.
      The conferees commend Job Corps for its recent efforts to 
increase opportunities for participants to earn a high school 
diploma through the establishment of its High School Diploma 
Initiative (HSDI). While Job Corps' success rate to date is 
encouraging, significant obstacles at the State and local 
levels make it extremely difficult for the program to ensure 
that all participants, regardless of center location, have 
access to the opportunity to obtain a high school diploma. The 
conferees urge the Department of Labor, in consultation with 
the Department of Education, States, and local educational 
agencies to examine obstacles to Job Corps' participants' 
ability to earn and receive high school diplomas from a local 
educational agency.
      As expressed in the 2003 statement of the managers, the 
conferees remain concerned with the lack of information 
provided regarding the performance and operation of the 
Workforce Investment Act. Further, the conferees remain 
concerned that States and local workforce investment areas lack 
the technology to comply with the basic performance reporting 
and operational requirements of WIA. Therefore, the conferees 
recommend that the Secretary provide States and local workforce 
investment areas funding to develop technology and determine 
its benefit to the WIA system.
      The conferees take note of the recent plant closure 
announcements in Lorain, Ohio and direct the Secretary of Labor 
to give favorable consideration to the application to continue 
and expand support for job training, workforce and economic 
development initiatives implemented and delivered by Lorain 
County Community College at the same commitment level 
established in the original agreement entered into in 2000.
      The conferees are impressed with the Labor Department's 
partnership with the Council for Adult and Experiential 
Learning to creatively address the Nation's shortage of nurses. 
The Employment and Training Administration pilot program will 
allow CAEL and health care partners in five cities to increase 
the number of Certified Nurses Aides, Licensed Practical Nurses 
and Registered Nurses.
      With respect to the projects listed below for pilots and 
demonstrations, the conferees encourage the Department to 
ensure that these projects are coordinated with local Workforce 
Investment Boards. The conferees also encourage the Department 
to ensure that project performance is adequately documented and 
evaluated. The conference agreement includes the following 
amounts for the following projects and activities:

            Community Service Employment for Older Americans

      The conference agreement appropriates $441,253,000 for 
Community Service Employment for Older Americans, instead of 
$440,200,000 as proposed by the House and $442,306,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.

              Federal Unemployment and Benefits Allowances

      The conference agreement includes a technical correction 
to both House and Senate Trade Act language to clarify that 
amounts needed to pay benefits under the Alternative Trade 
Adjustment Assistance program are included in the 
appropriation. The conference agreement includes $7,000,000 for 
the State of Alaska for training of displaced workers who can 
no longer earn a living in industries adversely affected by 
foreign trade.

    State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services Operations

      The conference agreement appropriates $3,609,381,000 for 
State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations, 
instead of $3,615,381,000 as proposed by the House and 
$3,620,552,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees expect the Department of Labor to continue 
to allocate fiscal year 2004 funds for the Workforce 
Information Core Products and Services through formula grants 
to the States.
      The conferees urge the Department of Labor to study the 
impact of using alternate criteria for the allotment of grants 
to States for the administration of Federal and State 
unemployment compensation laws. The criteria used in this study 
shall include the relative proportion of unemployed individuals 
in each State and the relative proportion of the total civilian 
labor force in each State. The Department shall be prepared to 
submit the results of this study to the Congress at the fiscal 
year 2005 budget hearings. The conferees are requesting this 
study in order to assess the need for a new formula so that 
States are not penalized for keeping administrative costs at a 
minimum through the use of technology and other innovations.

                         Program Administration

      The conference agreement appropriates $173,644,000 for 
Program Administration, instead of $172,327,000 as proposed by 
the House and $178,961,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
detailed table at the end of this joint statement reflects the 
activity distribution agreed to by the conferees.

               Employee Benefits Security Administration

      The conference agreement appropriates $124,962,000 for 
the Employee Benefits Security Administration, instead of 
$128,605,000 as proposed by the House and $121,316,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The detailed table at the end of this 
joint statement reflects the activity distribution agreed to by 
the conferees.

                  Employment Standards Administration

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement appropriates $394,908,000 for 
the Employment Standards Administration, salaries and expenses, 
instead of $397,753,000 as proposed by the House and 
$392,061,000 as proposed by the Senate. The detailed table at 
the end of this joint statement reflects the activity 
distribution agreed to by the conferees.
      On October 3, 2003, the Department of Labor published a 
final rule on union reporting and disclosure under the Labor 
Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). The conferees 
are concerned that the Department has not yet produced the 
electronic LM-2 software that it will require unions to use and 
has not yet produced to unions the software necessary for 
unions to export data from their newly revised accounting and 
record-keeping systems to the new electronic LM-2 forms. The 
conferees therefore urge that the Department make available 
this software as expeditiously as possible to determine whether 
this software, together with union accounting and record-
keeping systems, will actually work as is intended and 
designed.

             Occupational Safety and Health Administration

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $460,786,000 for the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration instead of 
$450,008,000 as proposed by the House bill and $463,324,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The detailed table at the end of this 
joint statement reflects the activity distribution agreed to by 
the conferees.
      Within the total, $3,200,000 is to be used to extend 
funding for Institutional Competency training grants provided 
that the grantee has demonstrated satisfactory performance.

                 Mine Safety and Health Administration

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $270,826,000 for the 
Mine Safety and Health Administration instead of $266,767,000 
as proposed by the House bill and $270,711,000 as proposed by 
the Senate. The detailed table at the end of this joint 
statement reflects the activity distribution agreed to by the 
conferees.
      Within the total, the conference agreement includes 
$2,000,000 to be available for mine rescue and recovery 
activities on a non-contingency basis as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conferees are concerned about recent GAO findings 
that raise serious questions about the quality of enforcement 
of the Mine Act by MSHA. Specifically, the conferees are 
concerned that MSHA is experiencing staffing and informational 
systems problems that hinder its ability to fulfill its 
inspection and investigation obligations. The conferees expect 
MSHA to develop an agency-wide human capital plan to address 
current and future inspector shortages, including recruiting 
and training needs. The conferees also expect the agency to 
develop a comprehensive plan to address information technology 
needs regarding injury rates, accident investigations, and 
timely inspections, including the collection of contractor 
data.
      The conference agreement includes the following amounts 
for the following projects and activities:

National Technology Transfer Center for a coal slurry 
    impoundment pilot project in Southern West Virginia.      $1,000,000
Stolar Research Corporation to further develop and 
    demonstrate electromagnetic wave detection 
    technology associated with drill string radar to 
    prevent mine flooding incidents.....................         100,000

                       Bureau of Labor Statistics

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $522,198,000 for the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics instead of $512,262,000 as provided 
by the House bill and $520,223,000 by the Senate. The detailed 
table at the end of this joint statement reflects the activity 
distribution agreed to by the conferees.
      Within the total for the Employment and Unemployment 
Statistics activity, $5,000,000 is for the Mass Layoff 
Statistics program. Similar language was included in the Senate 
bill.

                 Office of Disability Employment Policy

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conferees have included $2,500,000 within the Office 
of Disability Employment Policy to continue the telework 
efforts already initiated by ODEP. This can include expansion 
of pilot programs already underway and/or initiation of new 
telework pilots. ODEP should proceed in an expeditious manner 
to create telework positions in cooperation with Federal and 
State agencies. Priority should be given to strategies judged 
likely to yield the largest numbers of telework positions for 
people with disabilities.
      The conferees have included sufficient funds to continue 
the structured internship program for undergraduate college 
students with disabilities.

                        Departmental Management

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $352,830,000 for 
Departmental Management, salaries and expenses, instead of 
$253,018,000 as proposed by the House bill and $351,609,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The detailed table at the end of this 
joint statement reflects the activity distribution agreed to by 
the conferees.
      The conference agreement includes $110,650,000 for the 
Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB). Within the total 
provided, $82,000,000 is to assist developing countries with 
the elimination of child labor. Of this amount, $45,000,000 is 
for the International Labor Organization's International 
Programme for the Elimination of Child Labor. In addition, 
$37,000,000 is provided for bilateral assistance, made 
available through September 30, 2004, to improve access to 
basic education in international areas with a high rate of 
abusive and exploitative child labor. The conference agreement 
further includes $2,500,000 for bilateral and multilateral 
technical assistance, to be used to promote the International 
Labor Organization's Declaration of Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work. Given the increasing focus on the social impact 
of globalization, the U.S. Government has an interest in 
assisting nations who want to develop and/or implement core 
labor standards, including the right of free association. The 
conference agreement includes $5,000,000 for ILAB to build its 
own permanent capacity to monitor and report regularly and in-
depth to the Congress on the extent to which foreign countries 
with trade and investment agreements with the United States 
respect internationally-recognized worker rights and 
effectively promote core labor standards. The conference 
agreement also includes $11,000,000 for Federal administration 
and other ILAB programs.
      The conference agreement includes $10,000,000 for the 
purpose of assisting the International Labor Organization in 
implementing a program to confront HIV/AIDS in the workplace. 
The primary purpose of this program shall be to promote 
workplace policies which combat HIV-related stigma and 
discrimination, and promote prevention on the basis of 
tripartite partnerships among workers, employers and 
governments around the world. The conferees direct that the 
Secretary shall designate a full-time coordinator to oversee 
these efforts and coordinate with the various agencies 
conducting international HIV/AIDS programs. The conferees 
further direct that the Secretary submit a report to the 
Committees by August 31, 2004detailing the challenges faced and 
progress made in implementing anti-discrimination policies in each of 
the countries that are engaged by this effort.
      The conference agreement includes the following amount 
for the following project:

International Center on Child Labor and Education.......        $150,000

      The conferees strongly support the Buy American Act, 
which was enacted in 1933 to ensure that the Federal government 
supports domestic companies and domestic workers by buying 
American-made goods. The Act includes a number of waiver 
provisions that allow Federal agencies to buy foreign goods in 
some circumstances, but there is little disclosure or 
accountability in the waiver process. The conferees, therefore, 
direct the Secretary to issue a report not later than 60 days 
after the last day of fiscal year 2004 on the amount of 
acquisitions made by the Department during such fiscal year of 
articles, materials, or supplies that were manufactured outside 
the United States. Such report shall separately indicate the 
dollar value of any articles, materials, or supplies purchased 
by the department that were manufactured outside the United 
States, an itemized list of all waivers under the Buy American 
Act (41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.) that were granted with respect to 
such articles, materials, or supplies, and a summary of total 
procurement funds spent on goods manufactured in the United 
States versus funds spent on goods manufactured outside of the 
United States.

                    Veterans Employment and Training

      The detailed table at the end of this joint statement 
reflects the activity distribution agreed to by the conferees. 
Within the total, the conferees have provided $162,415,000 for 
State administration as proposed by the House instead of 
breaking this funding between Disabled Veterans Outreach and 
Local Veterans Employment as proposed by the Senate.

                          Working Capital Fund

      The conference agreement includes $13,850,000 for the 
Working Capital Fund, instead of $18,000,000 as proposed by the 
House bill and $9,700,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS

                         Executive Order 13126

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate that none of the funds appropriated in this Act 
shall be obligated or expended for the procurement of goods 
produced by forced or indentured child labor. The House bill 
contained no similar provision.

                           Denali Commission

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate that authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may 
be necessary to the Denali Commission to conduct job training 
where Denali Commission projects will be constructed. The House 
bill contained no similar provision.

                            Welfare-to-Work

      The conference agreement modifies a provision proposed by 
the Senate that rescinds funds appropriated for fiscal year 
1999 for the welfare-to-work program. The conference agreement 
rescinds any amounts allotted to the States from funds 
appropriated for fiscal year 1999 for the Welfare-to-Work 
program that are unexpended as of the date of enactment of the 
section, except for certain close out costs. Unexpended funds 
would consist of funds allotted to the States that are 
unobligated by the States, or obligated by the States, but not 
expended. Only funds to pay for goods and services that have 
already been provided as of the date of enactment are generally 
considered expended. Grantees would be required to terminate 
any agreements providing for the provision of goods and 
services beginning after the date of enactment unless 
alternative funding sources are identified.
      Since this rescission would accelerate the termination of 
the Welfare-to-Work grants to the States that are all due to 
expire during fiscal year 2004, the provision does not rescind 
funds that the Secretary of Labor determines are necessary for 
the States to carry out administrative activities relating to 
closeout. Such costs could include such items as penalties for 
early termination of leases, and personnel costs relating to 
the final reporting and closeout of grant activities. Authority 
is also provided in this provision for the Secretary of Labor 
to take necessary actions to facilitate the orderly and 
equitable closeout of the State grants, notwithstanding the 
programmatic requirements of the Welfare-to-Work program.
      The conferees expect the Employment and Training 
Administration to assist States in establishing a transition 
process to help the remaining welfare-to-work participants 
easily and seamlessly assimilate into Workforce Investment Act 
programs that allow them to continue to receive assistance.

                          Overtime Regulation

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice 
language proposed by the Senate that none of the funds 
appropriated in this Act shall be used to promulgate or 
implement any regulation that exempts employeesfrom the Fair 
Labor Standards Act of 1938. The House did not include this provision.

                          ETA Office Closings

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice 
language proposed by the Senate that the Secretary shall cease 
closing ETA regional offices. The House bill contained no 
similar provision.
      The conferees remain concerned about the Department's 
regional office reorganization. The conferees, therefore, urge 
the Department to maintain the current office structure of the 
Employment and Training Administration Offices.

                         Personal Dust Monitors

      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate that the Secretary shall re-propose a rule on 
respirable coal dust following the successful demonstration of 
personal dust monitors. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.

                    Hamilton County One Stop Center

      The conference agreement includes a provision 
transferring all federal interest in a State of Ohio Employment 
Services Office to Hamilton County, Ohio.

                              New Entrants

      The conference agreement includes a provision to permit 
youth, ages 14 through 17, who by statute or judicial order are 
exempt from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth 
grade, to work inside or outside places of business where 
machinery is used to process wood products. The youth would be 
permitted to perform activities such as sweeping, stacking 
wood, and writing orders. Safety provisions include prohibiting 
the youth from operating machinery, and requiring the use of 
eye and body protections.

not included in either House or Senate bill providing

      The conference agreement includes bill language 
identifying $250,000 for facilities renovation at the Gillis 
Long Hansen's Disease Center as proposed by the Senate rather 
than $248,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement includes $4,850,000 for 
malpractice insurance for volunteer physicians who practice at 
free clinics as authorized by section 224(o) of the Public 
Health Service Act instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The House did not provide funding for this program.
      The conference agreement includes bill language providing 
$10,000,000 to remain available until expended to establish a 
National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Program within HRSA, which 
will provide funds to a network of cord blood banks with two 
specific aims: (1) building an inventory of the highest quality 
cord blood units for use as unrelated donor grafts for patients 
who lack human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors 
and (2) ensuring an integrated system through which physicians 
and patients are able to locate a suitably matched cord blood 
unit or adult volunteer bone marrow donor via a single, 
electronic access point. The conferees intend that this program 
be administered by HRSA.
      Because this is a new and developing field, the conferees 
direct HRSA to use $1,000,000 of the funds provided for the 
cord blood bank to contract with the Institute of Medicine 
(IOM) to commission a study which shall be completed within 
twelve months of enactment of this Act. The study should 
recommend an optimal structure for the cord blood program and 
address pertinent issues to maximize the potential of this 
technology, including collection, storage, standards setting, 
information sharing, distribution, reimbursement, research and 
outcome measures. The IOM should receive input from experts 
including: (a) transplant physicians with expertise in the use 
of cord blood for unrelated marrow transplantation; (b) experts 
in the analysis of clinical outcomes after bone marrow and cord 
blood stem cell transplantations; (c) experts on HLA typing for 
transplantation, especially experts with experience in 
unrelated cord blood transplantation; (d) experts in medical 
database development and management and web-based information 
technology; (e) obstetricians familiar with programs for cord 
blood donation for public use; (f) experts in cord blood 
banking; (g) representatives of existing federally-funded and 
other active cord blood and bone marrow registries; (h) 
representatives of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); (i) 
experts in the accreditation of facilities for cord blood stem 
cell preparation and transplantation; and (j) representatives 
of the National Institutes of Health NHLBI Cord Blood 
Transplantation Study. The conferees expect that no additional 
monies will be expended until the IOM report is completed and 
that by the end of fiscal year 2005, HRSA will implement the 
program following the IOM recommendations. The Secretary shall 
notify the Appropriations Committees of both Houses of Congress 
at least fifteen days prior to the release of funds for this 
program.
      The conferees understand that cord blood is part of a 
continuum of transplantation treatment and support further 
research in cord blood transplantation. A portion of the cord 
blood units collected using these funds should be available for 
the performance of pre-clinical and clinical research focusing 
on cord blood stem cell biology and the use of umbilical cord 
blood stem cells for human transplantation and cellular 
therapies. The conferees recognize the importance of Federal 
oversight to protect public health and safety, and expect that 
funds will be directed to cord blood banks that comply with all 
FDA requirements and have obtained any necessary licenses. The 
conferees intend that this program should be available to 
currently established cord blood banks with active collection 
programs operating under an approved IND from the FDA.
      The conference agreement includes bill language 
identifying $39,740,000 for the rural hospital flexibility 
grants program as provided by both the House and Senate. Within 
the total provided, $15,000,000 is for the Small Rural Hospital 
Improvement Grant program.
      The conference agreement includes bill language 
identifying $280,000,000 for family planning instead of 
$273,350,000 as proposed by the House and $283,350,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees have included bill language identifying 
$25,000,000 for existing community health centers for economic 
stabilization and to offset the rising cost of current 
services. The conferees expect HRSA to use this funding to 
increase basic support for existing health centers based on 
performance-related criteria. The House and Senate reports 
included a similar directive.
      To address the problem of rising expenditures for 
prescription drugs, the conferees recognize that, increasingly, 
use is being made of the Public Health Service drug discount 
program by its grantees, their patients, and third-party 
payers, such as State Medicaid plans. Congress has funded an 
increase in the number of community health centers and other 
safety net health care providers. However, the process for 
quarterly updating of the list of providers certified for the 
drug discount program acts as an unnecessaryadministrative 
barrier to more immediate access to the lower drug prices. Therefore, 
the conferees direct the Public Health Service to adopt procedures for 
immediate access to the drug discounts for qualified entities that are 
specified in section 340B of the Public Health Service Act.
      The conferees remain concerned that the effort to 
restructure HRSA programs and grants management may be having a 
negative effect on the stability of many HRSA grantees. 
Specifically, the restructuring of HRSA's project officer 
system has proven to be detrimental to new grantees, that often 
need immediate, high quality technical assistance to 
successfully deliver care in their communities and meet complex 
program requirements. The conferees expect HRSA to work with 
all stakeholders to improve the availability of accurate 
information and policy clarifications from HRSA. The conferees 
also expect HRSA to improve the timeliness of award notices and 
the notices of the availability of new funds.
      The conferees recently learned that, due to certain 
requirements under Section 330 of the Public Health Service 
Act, a number of school-based health centers that had 
previously received funding under the community health centers 
program are now ineligible for such funding. Recognizing the 
contribution that these entities have made in their respective 
communities, the conferees strongly urge HRSA to make these 
previously funded programs eligible for funding in fiscal year 
2004. The conferees further urge HRSA to develop 
recommendations for overcoming this problem in the future.
      The conference agreement provides $12,000,000 for Native 
Hawaiian health care activities within the consolidated health 
centers program instead of $15,000,000 as provided by the 
Senate. The House did not identify specific funding for Native 
Hawaiian activities.
      The conference agreement includes $2,056,956,000 for Ryan 
White AIDS programs, of which $2,031,956,000 is provided as 
budget authority and $25,000,000 is provided from program 
evaluation funding under section 241 of the Public Health 
Service Act to carry out Ryan White Special Projects of 
National Significance. The House had provided $2,023,599,000, 
while the Senate provided $2,041,599,000, of which $25,000,000 
was from program evaluation funding. The agreement includes 
bill language identifying $753,317,000 for the Ryan White Title 
II State AIDS drug assistance programs as proposed by the House 
instead of $739,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Within the total for Ryan White AIDS programs, no less 
than the amount provided in fiscal year 2003 is included for 
AIDS activities that are targeted to address the growing HIV/
AIDS epidemic and its disproportionate impact upon communities 
of color, including African Americans, Latinos, Native 
Americans, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific 
Islanders.
      The conferees are concerned by the increasing prevalence 
of hepatitis C-HIV co-infection. Co-infection of the hepatitis 
C virus (HCV) in HIV infected patients has become the leading 
cause of AIDS mortality in some parts of the country. The death 
rate is higher and life expectancy shorter for co-infection 
patients than for patients who have only HIV. To address this 
growing problem, the conferees urge HRSA to encourage State 
ADAPs to offer co-infected patients access to approved 
hepatitis C treatments as their resources allow, to ensure that 
the Ryan White critical care funded programs (including Title 
III & IV clinics) provide opportunities for training care 
givers and clinicians to treat co-infected patients, and to 
ensure that AETCs address the need for physician education on 
HCV/HIV co-infection.
      The conferees recognize that it is essential for the 
Title IV program to maximize funds going for services to women, 
children, families and youth and to place an appropriate limit 
on administrative expenses. The conferees agree with HRSA that, 
due to the time constraints related to the approaching 
application deadline, it is not possible to institute this 
limitation in fiscal year 2004 for grants that would be awarded 
in August 2004. In addition, the conferees have concerns with 
the quality of the data that have been collected for 
calculating the proposed cap. In the Notice regarding the 
proposal that was placed in the Federal Register on August 12, 
2003, the definition of ``administrative expenses'' was 
undetermined; however, data were given regarding the 
administrative expenses of the various Title IV grantees. These 
data may or may not have included indirect costs. As a result 
of the lack of a precise definition, the grantees may have 
provided incorrect information regarding their administrative 
expenses. The conferees agree that these data must be accurate 
to determine a fair limitation on administrative expenses that 
ensures that the Title IV grantees remain viable and able to 
provide services for women, children, youth, and families 
infected with HIV. Since the earliest that this limitation may 
be put into effect is fiscal year 2005 for grants that will be 
awarded in August 2005, the conferees strongly urge HRSA to re-
collect data regarding administrative expenses with a precise 
definition to ensure accuracy and comparability.
      The conferees concur in the Senate report language 
regarding 90 percent of total title IV funding being provided 
to grantees and primarily to support maintenance of existing 
care services. The conferees also concur in the Senate report 
language intending that HRSA use a significant portion ofthe 
remaining funds to expand comprehensive services for youth. The 
conferees also concur in Senate language regarding peer-based technical 
assistance and a national consumer and provider education center.
      The conference agreement includes bill language 
designating $121,130,000 of the funds provided for the maternal 
and child health block grant for special projects of regional 
and national significance (SPRANS). The House bill provided 
$117,831,000 for this activity while the Senate bill earmarked 
$116,381,000 for this purpose. It is intended that $4,000,000 
of the SPRANS amount will be used to continue the sickle cell 
newborn screening program and its locally based outreach and 
counseling efforts. In addition, $5,000,000 of the SPRANS 
amount will be used to continue the oral health demonstration 
programs and activities in the States. The conference agreement 
also includes within the SPRANS set-aside $1,600,000 for mental 
health programs and activities in the States as outlined in the 
Senate report, $3,000,000 to begin an epilepsy demonstration, 
and $2,000,000 for newborn and child screening for heritable 
disorders as authorized in Title XXVI of the Children's Health 
Act of 2000. The heritable disorders program is designed to 
strengthen States' newborn screening programs and improve 
States' ability to develop, evaluate, and acquire innovative 
testing technologies, and establish and improve programs to 
provide screening, counseling, testing and special services for 
newborns and children at risk for heritable disorders.
      The conference agreement includes $74,988,000 for 
abstinence education programs instead of $65,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $73,044,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement includes $4,500,000 in program 
evaluation funds for the abstinence education program and 
$70,488,000 in budget authority. The program evaluation funds 
are to be used for evaluation of adolescent pregnancy 
prevention programs. Because the program evaluation funds are 
provided in addition to the budget authority for the abstinence 
education program, the conference agreement strikes language in 
both the House and Senate bills permitting the budget authority 
to be used for evaluation and setting a limit of 3.5 percent of 
the total provided for such purposes. The conferees concur in 
language included in the House report regarding technical 
assistance and capacity building and language included in the 
Senate report about grantees with project periods expiring in 
fiscal year 2003.
      The conference agreement includes $500,000 for rural 
emergency service training and equipment assistance instead of 
$1,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The specific bill 
language providing the funding has been deleted and the funding 
included in the table at the end of the statement of managers.
      The conference agreement includes $11,000,000 for rural 
and community access to rural devices. This includes 
$10,000,000 for the rural program under section 413 of the 
Public Health Service Act and $1,000,000 for the new community 
access demonstration under section 313.
      The conference agreement includes $438,748,000 for health 
professions instead of $391,203,000 as proposed by the House. 
The Senate provided $423,765,000 for a consolidated health 
professions line as well as $50,000,000 for nurse training.
      The conferees concur in the House report language 
allocating fiscal year 2003 level funding for graduate 
psychology education and geropsychology and $19,000,000 for 
geriatric education centers, $7,000,000 for geriatric training, 
and $6,000,000 for geriatric academic career awards. The 
conferees concur in Senate report language allocating at least 
$5,500,000 for the pediatric dental program and providing 
continued funding for the chiropractic-medical school 
demonstration grant program.
      The conference agreement provides $142,763,000 for nurse 
training programs within the health professions training total. 
In using the increase in funding provided above the fiscal year 
2003 level under Nurse Education, Practice, and Retention 
Grants, the conferees expect HRSA to give preference in funding 
to internship and residency programs, career ladder programs, 
and enhancing patient care delivery systems. The conferees 
intend that a portion of the funding provided for loan 
repayment and scholarships be used for scholarships in exchange 
for two years of service at health care facilities with 
critical shortages of nurses.
      The conferees continue to be concerned about the health 
care needs of those in the Mississippi River Delta region. The 
conferees provide $6,800,000 for rural health outreach to 
continue the ongoing initiative in eight States. These grants 
provide funding and technical assistance to help underserved 
rural communities identify and better address their health care 
needs and to help small rural hospitals improve their financial 
and operational performance. The conferees further recommend 
that HRSA consult with the Delta Regional Authority and the 
Delta Health Alliance, given their ongoing relationships with 
communities in the Delta.
      The conferees concur with the Senate report language 
regarding frontier extended stay clinics.
      The conferees support the Student Resident Experiences 
and Rotations in Community Health (SEARCH) program within the 
National Health Service Corps and intend that HRSA continue 
this program in fiscal year 2004.
      The conference agreement includes $35,000,000 for the 
Denali Commission instead of $40,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The House did not include funding for the Commission. 
The conference agreement includes a general provision, section 
222, amending the Denali Commission Act of 1998 to clarify that 
the Commission has authority to use the interagency transfer 
mechanism rather than grants to receive the funding provided in 
this Act. The conferees concur in language in the Senate report 
indicating that the Denali Commission should allocate funds to 
a mix of service facilities. Within the funds provided, 
$2,500,000 is provided to acquire medical equipment for rural 
clinics and hospitals, such as an x-ray machine for Seldovia, 
AK, and $5,000,000 shall be used for upgrade and construction 
of shelters for victims of domestic violence.
      The conferees concur in language in the Senate report 
identifying $3,000,000 within traumatic brain injury funding 
for protection and advocacy services.
      The conference agreement includes $104,317,000 for the 
community access program as proposed by the House. The Senate 
did not provide funding for this program. The conferees 
encourage HRSA, through the Community Access Program, to 
establish demonstration projects between community health 
centers and minority health professions schools for the purpose 
of health status disparities research and data collection. Such 
demonstration projects were authorized in the Health Care 
Safety Net Amendments of 2002.
      The conference agreement includes $150,000,000 for 
program management instead of $155,974,000 as provided by the 
House and $146,686,000 as provided by the Senate.
      The conferees expect HRSA to use no more than one percent 
of the funds allocated for projects for agency administrative 
expenses.
      The Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Act of 1998 established 
the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund to provide compassionate 
payments to certain individuals affected by HIV transmission 
via contaminated blood products. The fund terminated by law on 
November 12, 2003. The conferees are aware of approximately 28 
cases that may still be adjudicated. The conferees understand 
that HRSA has made budgetary arrangements in anticipation of 
potential additional payments. The conferees expect HRSA to 
report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on the 
status of these potential payments by February 1, 2004.

             VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM TRUST FUND

      The conference agreement includes $3,222,000 for the 
administrative costs associated with the Vaccine Injury 
Compensation Program instead of $3,472,000 as proposed by the 
House and $2,972,000 as proposed by the Senate.

               CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION

                Disease Control, Research, and Training

      The conference agreement includes $4,545,472,000 for 
disease control, research, and training at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), instead of $4,588,671,000 
as proposed by the House and $4,494,496,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. In addition, $212,134,000 is made available under 
Section 241 of the Public Health Service Act, the same as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill proposed that 
$13,226,000 be derived under Section 241 authority.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate inserting the word ``purchase'' before the phrase, 
``hire, maintenance, and operation of aircraft.'' The House 
proposed no similar language.
      The conference agreement includes bill language 
earmarking $262,000,000 for equipment, construction, and 
renovation of facilities, instead of $260,000,000 as proposed 
by the Senate. The House proposed $206,000,000 for this 
activity. Within this total, $250,000,000 is for continuation 
of CDC's Facilities in Atlanta and $9,600,000 is for the second 
year costs of replacing CDC's infectious disease laboratory in 
Fort Collins, Colorado and $2,400,000 is to begin replacement 
of CDC's facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio. The conferees continue 
to support the implementation of CDC's Buildings and Facilities 
Master Plan and are pleased with the progress made to date.
      The conferees expect the CDC to utilize a portion of the 
funds provided for buildings and facilities to continue and 
expand security improvements to ensure critical information 
reliability for response to critical events, as well as to 
conduct increasingly varied public health missions.
      The conference agreement includes bill language to allow 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to enter 
into a single contract or related contracts for the full scope 
of development and construction of facilities as proposed by 
both the House and the Senate. The conference agreement also 
includes bill language to allow funds appropriated to the CDC 
to be used to enter into a long-term ground lease for 
construction on non-Federal land, in order to replace their 
laboratory in the Fort Collins, Colorado area as proposed by 
both the House and Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language to 
earmark $293,569,000 for international HIV/AIDS, with 
$150,000,000 earmarked for the International Mother and Child 
HIV Prevention Initiative, the same as proposed by the Senate. 
The House proposed $242,569,000 for international HIV/AIDS, 
with $100,000,000 earmarked for the International Mother and 
Child HIV Prevention Initiative.
      The conference agreement includes bill language as 
proposed by the Senate designating that the following amounts 
shall be available under section 241 (Public Health Service Act 
evaluation set-aside) for the specified activities:
            $127,634,000--National Center for Health Statistics 
        Surveys
            $14,000,000--National Immunization Surveys
            $28,600,000--Information Systems Standards 
        Development and Architecture and Applications-based 
        Research Used at Local Public Health Levels
            $41,900,000--Research Tools and Approaches within 
        the National Occupational Research Agenda
      The House bill provided that $13,226,000 be derived from 
section 241 for National Center for Health Statistics surveys.
Birth Defects
      The conference agreement includes $113,513,000 for birth 
defects, developmental disabilities, disability and health 
instead of $106,339,000 as proposed by the House and 
$110,639,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Within the total, the following amounts are provided for 
the specified activities above the comparable amount for fiscal 
year 2003:
            $5,244,000 to expand autism surveillance and 
        education activities;
            $1,000,000 to expand research activities conducted 
        by the regional Centers for Birth Defects Research and 
        Prevention;
            $250,000 to expand activities related to Fetal 
        Alcohol Syndrome;
            $1,000,000 to expand the National Spina Bifida 
        program;
            $1,500,000 to establish a public health education 
        and research program concerning Tourette syndrome;
            $1,500,000 to expand surveillance and 
        epidemiological efforts of Duchenne and Becker muscular 
        dystrophy;
            $750,000 to expand support for the Special Olympics 
        Healthy Athletes Initiative;
            $2,500,000 to expand the work of the Paralysis 
        Resource Center;
            $1,000,000 to expand disability prevention 
        activities;
            $300,000 to expand the newborn infant screening 
        program;
            $250,000 to expand Limb Loss activities;
            $500,000 to establish a craniofacial malformation 
        program; and
            $274,000 to expand the work of the Attention 
        Deficit Resource Centers.
      The conference agreement includes $3,000,000 above the 
fiscal year 2003 level for the support and expansion of CDC's 
State autism surveillance program. In addition, $2,244,000 is 
provided to establish a national awareness and education 
program that will widely disseminate information regarding 
autism identification and diagnosis to both families and health 
care providers as authorized by Sec. 103 of the Children's 
Health Act of 2000. This program should be administered and 
piloted in partnership with voluntary organizations already 
working in the autism community.
      The conferees concur that the status report on autism 
data collection requested by both the House and Senate is due 
by March 1, 2004.
      The conference agreement includes $1,500,000 to establish 
a public health and research program in partnership with a 
national voluntary health association dedicated to assist 
parents and families of children with Tourette Syndrome as 
proposed by both the House and Senate.
      The conferees continue to support strongly the 
partnership between CDC and the Christopher and Dana Reeve 
Paralysis Resource Center and intend that within the increase 
provided: $500,000 be used to fund up to three applied research 
projects to translate clinical rehabilitation treadmill therapy 
to community-based settings and to train health care 
professionals to deliver this intervention; and $2,000,000 be 
used to expand the work of the Resource Center.
      The conferees commend CDC for its partnership with CHADD 
in developing an AD/HD Resource Center and has provided an 
increase of $274,000 above fiscal year 2003 to expand the 
Resource Center in an effort to respond to the overwhelming 
demand for information and support services. The conferees 
intend that the full amount of the increase be awarded to the 
Resource Center.
      The conferees commend CDC for its partnership with 
Amputee Coalition of America on the National Limb Loss 
Information Center. The conferees intend that the full amount 
of the increase provided be awarded to the Information Center.
      The conference agreement includes $500,000 for 
craniofacial malformation activities. The conferees concur with 
language in the Senate report regarding the establishment of a 
craniofacial malformation and development registry and the 
creation of a plan for an information clearinghouse for parents 
and physicians.
      The conference agreement includes sufficient funds above 
the request for CDC to initiate in fiscal year 2004 
epidemiological and population-based studies on individuals 
with Down syndrome as outlined in the House and Senate reports.
Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion
      The conference agreement includes $859,065,000 for 
chronic disease prevention and health promotion instead of 
$862,011,000 as proposed by the House and $801,844,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. Programs within this account are funded 
at the following levels:

Heart Disease and Stroke................................     $46,000,000
Cancer Prevention and Control...........................     315,631,000
Diabetes................................................      67,342,000

      Within the amounts provided for Cancer Prevention and 
Control $210,929,000 is for the Breast and Cervical Cancer 
Screening Program; $50,000,000 is for Cancer Registries; 
$15,000,000 is for Colorectal Cancer; $12,000,000 is for 
Comprehensive Cancer; $4,950,000 is for Ovarian Cancer; 
$15,555,000 is for Prostate Cancer; $5,000,000 is for the 
Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program; and $2,197,000 is 
for Skin Cancer.
      The conferees applaud the ongoing work at CDC, in 
conjunction with the Lance Armstrong Foundation, to develop a 
National Cancer Survivorship Action Plan. The conferees also 
urge the CDC to develop a cancer survivorship resource center 
focused on the post-treatment needs and long-term survivorship/
quality of life issues.
      The conferees are aware that survival rates of the most 
lethal cancers, including lung, esophageal, liver, and 
pancreatic cancer, remain at or below 15 percent. Further, the 
conferees understand that the University of Kentucky, Markey 
Cancer Center, has begun a three-year effort to establish a 
state-of-the-art early detection and outreach program for a 
rural, medically underserved population with links to best 
treatment practices, clinical trials, and relevant 
translational research. Upon its completion, the conferees 
request that the Secretary, through the Director of the CDC, 
assess both the design and findings of this project, and report 
to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on the 
project's outcomes and any recommendations to increase the 
survival rates of lethal cancers.
      Within the amounts available for Arthritis and Other 
Chronic Diseases, the agreement provides an increase over 
fiscal year 2003 of $250,000 for the expansion of State-based 
arthritis programs and collaborations with the relevant 
voluntary health organizations and of $750,000 to enhance 
epilepsy efforts, in partnership with a national non-profit 
organization that works on behalf of children and adults 
affected by seizures. In addition, $1,000,000 is available 
within Arthritis and Other Chronic Diseases to continue support 
for the National Lupus Patient Registry.
      The conferees encourage the CDC to develop a partnership 
with a national voluntary health association dedicated to 
assisting persons with Interstitial Cystitis (IC) and undertake 
initiatives to expand public and professional education efforts 
concerning IC and enhance the understanding of IC through 
epidemiological studies.
      Within amounts provided for Community Health Promotion, 
$8,100,000 is provided to support and expand the Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance Systems, $2,982,000 is provided for 
continuing and expanding a model project that is testing and

Institute in Boston, Massachusetts to continue practice-based 
assessments, identification, and study of promising and 
heavily-used mind/body practices.
      The conferees concur with language included in the Senate 
report regarding the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) death 
scene protocol and have provided $300,000 to support projects 
to demonstrate the protocol's effectiveness from within funds 
available under Safe Motherhood and Infant Health.
      The conference agreement includes $36,000,000 for the 
VERB (Youth Media) campaign. The conferees intend that the 
funds provided for fiscal year 2004 be used to augment the 
media buy for phase 3 of the campaign and encourage the CDC to 
use these enhanced resources to leverage additional in-kind 
contributions.
      The conferees encourage the CDC to develop partnerships 
with national organizations to enhance the reach and impact of 
the STEPS program by coordinating and delivering program models 
to additional communities across America, including in rural 
and disadvantaged communities. Potential partners should have 
experience directly providingyouth-development programs, long-
standing dedication to promoting lifelong health, and a commitment to 
serving all ages, incomes, and abilities.
      Within the amount for Nutrition and Physical Activity, 
the conference agreement includes $1,000,000 to support a 
comprehensive review of the effects of food marketing on 
children's diet and health, including the characteristics of 
effective marketing of foods to children to promote healthy 
food choices. The conferees request that upon completion of the 
review, a report detailing the review's findings be submitted 
to the appropriate Committees of jurisdiction of the Congress.
Environmental Health
      The conference agreement includes $184,629,000 for 
environmental health instead of $184,829,000 as proposed by the 
House and $184,329,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Within the total provided: $38,518,000 is for the 
environmental health laboratory; $66,728,000 is for 
environmental health activities (including $2,200,000 to 
continue the physician education and public awareness program 
for primary immune deficiency disease as implemented by the 
Jeffrey Modell Foundation, and $27,900,000 to continue the 
health-tracking network); $37,386,000 is for asthma; and 
$41,997,000 is for childhood lead poisoning.
      The conferees support the continuation of CDC's work 
responding to, and preventing adverse health effects of complex 
humanitarian emergencies around the world and commend CDC for 
supporting organizations that apply public health strategies to 
mitigate the impact of conflict on civilian populations in Iraq 
and elsewhere.
Epidemic Services
      The conference agreement includes $92,494,000 for 
epidemic services and response, instead of $82,494,000 as 
proposed by the House and $127,494,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $15,000,000 above the 
comparable level for fiscal year 2003 for the Director to 
expand global disease detection capabilities. The conferees are 
aware that approximately thirty previously unheard of 
infectious diseases were discovered in the last thirty years. 
The conferees intend that the increased funds provided for 
global disease detection be allocated in the manner determined 
by the Director of CDC to enhance the capability to detect and 
track global outbreaks of disease.
      The conferees commend CDC for its partnership with the 
Landmine Survivor Network and have provided funds within 
Epidemic Services to support the Network at not less than the 
fiscal year 2003 level.
Health Statistics
      The conference agreement includes $127,634,000 for Health 
Statistics, to be derived from amounts made available under 
Section 241 of the Public Health Service Act, the same as 
proposed by the Senate. The House proposed $125,899,000 for 
Health Statistics, of which $13,226,000 was to be derived from 
amounts made available under Section 241 of the Public Health 
Service Act.
HIV/AIDS, STD and TB Prevention
      The conference agreement includes $1,299,388,000 for HIV/
AIDS, STD and TB prevention instead of $1,247,388,000 as 
proposed by the House and $1,301,388,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Included in this amount is $993,189,000 for HIV/AIDS 
activities, of which $293,569,000 is for global HIV/AIDS 
activities; $169,072,000 for STD activities; and $137,127,000 
for TB activities. Within the funds provided for global HIV/

HIV Prevention Initiative.
      Within the total for HIV/AIDS, $104,000,000 is provided 
to continue CDC's support of activities that are targeted to 
address the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic and its disparate impact 
on communities of color, including African Americans, Latinos, 
Native Americans, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and 
Pacific Islanders. The conferees intend that CDC follow the 
report accompanying the Labor, HHS and Education and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002 regarding the disbursement of 
these funds, including continuing support for the Directly 
Funded Minority Community Based Organization Program.
      The conferees urge the Director to continue and to 
strengthen CDC support of community-based organizations and 
faith-based organizations in their efforts to provide 
culturally and linguistically appropriate primary and secondary 
HIV prevention programs. The conferees are aware of recent 
concerns regarding instability in the recompetition process and 
encourage the CDC to provide directly funded community and 
faith based organizations with technical assistance and 
capacity building support in order to promote effective and 
sustainable programs.
      Within the total for STD activities, $500,000 is for CDC 
to carry out a competitive grant program to strengthen local 
capacity on Indian reservations to screen for and treat 
sexually transmitted diseases and to educate local populations 
about such diseases and their consequences, as well as how 
transmission of such diseases can be prevented.
      The conferees urge CDC to utilize $1,000,000 of the 
increase provided for Tuberculosis (TB) prevention to partner 
with a private foundation uniquely qualified to test new TB 
vaccines and that has implemented a large-scale community-based 
TB vaccine field trial. CDC should utilize its cooperative 
agreement mechanisms to ensure that the agency has the 
opportunity to provide technical assistance and guidance to 
this important partnership, especially with regard to 
epidemiology.
      The conferees request that the Director prepare a plan to 
comprehensively address blood safety and injection safety in 
Africa under the Global AIDS program, to be completed and 
submitted to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and 
Senate no later than 120 days after enactment of this Act. The 
plan should ensure that all injections occur in a safe manner, 
through provision of an adequate supply of safe injection 
equipment, preferably non-reusable syringes, provider 
education, and waste management, and to foster ``appropriate 
use'' of injections in order to reduce the number of 
unnecessary injections administered. Similarly, the plan should 
reflect an emphasis on both increasing the blood supply through 
donor recruitment and ensuring its safety through proper 
screening of donors and donated blood as well as the 
development or improvement of a robust national blood service. 
In addition, provision should be made for provider education 
and other measures necessary to ensure the appropriate use of 
donated blood and to discourage unnecessary or inappropriate 
uses.
Immunization
      The conference agreement includes a discretionary program 
level total of $633,385,000 for immunization, instead of 
$650,586,000 as proposed by the House and $641,686,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. In addition, $14,000,000 is for 
national immunization surveys to be derived from section 241 
evaluation set-aside funds, the same as proposed by the Senate. 
The House bill included no similar provision.
      The conferees note that the National Vaccine Program 
Office, formerly housed within CDC, will be transferred to the 
Office of the Secretary. Accordingly, the appropriation for 
immunization has been reduced and the $7,301,000 requested to 
support that office is appropriated within the Office of the 
Secretary, General Departmental Management account.
      In addition, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program 
funded through the Medicaid program is expected to provide 
$980,196,000 in vaccine purchases and distribution support in 
fiscal year 2004, for a total immunization program level of 
$1,627,581,000.
      Included in the amount provided is $495,464,000 for the 
section 317 program, and $151,921,000 for global immunization 
activities. Within the total available for global immunization, 
$106,400,000 is for global polio eradication activities, and 
$45,521,000 for other global activities, including the global 
measles program.
      The conferees are aware of sensitivities about research 
involving the safety of childhood vaccines. CDC's Vaccine 
Safety Datalink Data Sharing Program allows external 
researchers to assess vaccine safety by analyzing data from 
managed care organizations. The conferees believe that it is 
essential that these data be available in a way that allows for 
independent review while at the same time protects 
confidentiality and complies with regulations for the 
protection of human subjects involved in research. The 
conferees urge that CDC continue to assure access to these data 
and appropriately preserve final datasets for vaccine safety 
studies and datasets created by CDC for external researchers 
through the Vaccine Safety Datalink Data Sharing Program.
Infectious Diseases
      The conference agreement includes $372,503,000 for 
infectious diseases instead of $382,226,000 as proposed by the

      Within the total provided, $9,000,000 above fiscal year 
2003 is provided for areas of highest scientific and 
programmatic priority for preparing and responding to present 
and emerging infectious disease threats.
      Within the total provided, $2,000,000 above fiscal year 
2003 is to augment CDC's resources for supporting States in 
developing and implementing effective surveillance, prevention, 
and mosquito control to effectively combat West Nile Virus and 
support research on the biology of the disease.
      Within the total provided, $911,000 above fiscal year 
2003 is to expand research, prevention and control activities 
on malaria and to continue CDC's Global Malaria Initiative.
      Within the total provided, $1,000,000 above fiscal year 
2003 is to expand and improve surveillance, research, and 
prevention activities on prion disease. The conferees intend 
that a significant portion of the increase be used to expand 
support for the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance 
Center to augment the national autopsy network for prion 
disease surveillance.
      Within the total, $2,200,000 is provided to continue the 
thalassemia blood safety surveillance program.
      The conferees are deeply concerned by the largest known 
outbreak of Hepatitis A in the Nation, which has been 
developing in western Pennsylvania over the last few weeks. The 
conferees understand that a CDC field investigation team is in 
Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania working with State and local health 
officials to determine the source of the outbreak and limit the 
spread of the disease. The conferees commend the CDC's 
response, and expect the CDC to continue and expand these 
efforts to contain this specific outbreak and to prevent future 
occurrences.
      The conferees are pleased that CDC has branched into new 
areas of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) research and medical 
education in the four-year period in which the $12,900,000 is 
being restored to the CFS program. The conferees expect that 
the payback period will be extended through fiscal year 2005.
Injury Control
      The conference agreement includes $154,632,000 for injury 
control, instead of $152,414,000 as proposed by the House and 
$152,409,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Within the total provided, $3,750,000 is to extend 
implementation of the National Violent Death Reporting System, 
$8,700,000 is for child maltreatment prevention activities, and 
$5,224,000 is for the Traumatic Brain Injury prevention 
program. In addition, sufficient funds are included to continue 
support for all existing Injury Control Research Centers.
Occupational Safety and Health
      The conference agreement provides $236,985,000 for

Senate. In addition, $41,900,000 is available to carry out 
Research Tools and Approaches activities within the National 
Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to be derived from section 
241 evaluation set-aside funds as proposed by the Senate. This 
brings the comparable program level to $278,885,000. The House 
bill had no similar provision.
      Within the total provided, $19,700,000 is for the 
Education and Research Centers and $26,000,000 above the 
request is for research activities in support of implementation 
of NORA.
      Also within the total provided, $3,500,000 above the 
fiscal year 2003 level is provided for the National Personal 
Protective Technologies Laboratory. The conferees intend that 
the funds be used in the manner outlined in the Senate report.
      The conference agreement also includes sufficient funds 
to continue the farm health and safety initiative, the 
construction safety and health program, and to purchase 
personal dosimetry monitors as outlined in the House report.
Public Health Improvement
      The conference agreement includes $143,082,000 for public 
health improvement instead of $144,530,000 as proposed by the 
House and $106,789,000 as proposed by the Senate. In addition, 
$28,600,000 is available to carry out information systems 
standards development and architecture and applications-based 
research used at local public health levels to be derived from 
section 241 evaluation set-aside funds, as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill included no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes $15,000,000 within 
Public Health Improvement to expand public health research that 
is determined by the Director as having high scientific and 
programmatic priority.
      Funds requested within public health improvement for

Office of the Director
      The conference agreement includes $59,707,000 for the 
activities of the Office of the Director, the same as proposed 
by the Senate. The House proposed $49,707,000 for the Office of 
the Director.
      The conferees understand that CDC has elevated its Office 
of Genomics and Disease Prevention to the Office of the CDC 
Director and encourage CDC to continue its work to integrate 
genomics across public health research and practice.
      The conferees understand the urgent need to contact, 
inform, and mobilize physicians during public health 
emergencies. The conferees encourage the CDC to form 
partnerships with entities and organizations that have 
databases of physician contact information to facilitate rapid 
communication of public health alerts.
      The conferees urge CDC to continue its efforts to address 
the unique needs of Native Hawaiians on dialysis in a 
culturally sensitive manner.
      The conferees are aware of potential cost savings that 
may result from improved information technology, 
administrative, and management processes and practices. The 
conferees intend that any savings accrued in fiscal year 2004 
as a result of these improvements must come only from internal 
operational savings of the agency, and may be refocused only 
into other intramural activities or extramural Public Health 
Research activities related to the purposes for which those 
funds were originally appropriated.

                     NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

                       National Cancer Institute

      The conference agreement includes $4,770,519,000 for the 
National Cancer Institute as proposed by both the House and the 
Senate.
      To increase the likelihood of a cure for every child with 
cancer, the conferees urge NCI to increase its support of 
translational research to accelerate the pace of pediatric 
cancer clinical trials. The existing NCI-supported national 
infrastructure of a clinical trials network should be the 
dominant component of this accelerated effort.
      The conferees encourage the Director of NCI to establish 
a task force to explore the continuing unique needs of the 
peoples of Hawaii and the Pacific Basin region.
      The conferees concur with language in the House report 
regarding the importance of the collaboration between NCI and 
CDC regarding tobacco harm reduction. In addition, the 
conferees urge the NCI to examine what additional scientific 
research is needed to determine the relative risks of different 
tobacco products.

                National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute

      The conference agreement includes $2,897,145,000 for the 
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute instead of 
$2,897,595,000 as proposed by the Senate and $2,867,995,000 as 
proposed by the House.
      The conferees encourage NHLBI, in collaboration with the 
Office of Rare Diseases, to develop standards of care for 
pulmonary and cardiac complications associated with Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy.
      The conferees urge NHLBI to develop a set of treatment 
guidelines for von Willebrand disease and further urge the 
Institute to work with medical associations and experts in the 
field when developing such guidelines.

         National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research

      The conference agreement includes $385,796,000 for the 
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research instead 
of $386,396,000 as proposed by the Senate and $382,396,000 as 
proposed by the House.

    National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

      The conference agreement includes $1,682,457,000 for the 
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases instead of $1,683,007,000 as proposed by the Senate 
and $1,670,007,000 as proposed by the House. An amount of 
$150,000,000 is also available to the Institute through a 
permanent appropriation for juvenile diabetes.
      The conferees recognize the research supported by the 
NIDDK digestive diseases branch that is dedicated to the 
treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders, which 
include irritable bowel syndrome. In addition to this important 
research, the conferees encourage the digestive diseases branch 
to support and fund basic, translational and clinical research 
dedicated to developing effective diagnostic tests and 
innovative treatments for gastrointestinal motility disorders 
involving enteric neuromuscular dysfunction including, but not 
limited to, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, 
gastroparesis, and colonic inertia.
      The conferees were pleased to learn of the recent 
discovery that an existing drug, already used on humans to 
treat irregular fluid retention has also been found to retard 
cyst production and disease progression in polycystic kidney 
disease. The conferees urge NIDDK to conduct clinical trials to 
follow up on these recent breakthroughs.
      Branched chain ketoaciduria is a rare inherited disorder 
that prevents the proper metabolism of the three branched-chain 
amino acids found in all protein, and can lead to mental 
retardation, physical disabilities and death. The conferees are 
aware of modeling research currently being performed on mice, 
with the goal of finding a permanent cure for the disease. The 
conferees encourage NIDDK to provide support for this type of 
research and other branched chain ketoaciduria-related 
research.
      The conferees applaud NIDDK for their efforts to combat 
childhood obesity and encourage them to consider particular use 
of the CDC's Prevention Research Centers as a mechanism through 
which to award competitive grants for this initiative.

        National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

      The conference agreement includes $1,510,776,000 for the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke instead 
of $1,468,926,000 as proposed by the House and $1,510,926,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees urge NINDS to increase its overall 
investment in multiple sclerosis (MS) research. Special 
emphasis on imaging, biological markers and clinical trials for 
new therapeutics should be areas of high priority. The 
conferees are pleased to note the development of a joint 
symposium on MS genetics sponsored by NINDS and the National MS 
Society, and encourage the Institute to take a more active role 
at the NIH in furthering MS genetics research by developing 
collaborative strategies with the National Human Genome 
Research Institute and other relevant NIH institutes. The 
conferees request that NIH report back to Congress no later 
than September 30, 2004 with progress in its efforts to expand 
its commitment to multiple sclerosis. The conferees also are 
pleased to note a major success in past years in the creation 
of a joint collaborative research program in ``gender and 
immunity'' between the National Institute on Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a major voluntary association 
for the disease, in which NINDS participates. The conferees 
encourage NINDS to seek similar collaborative activities 
related to MS.
      The conferees urge NINDS, in collaboration with the 
National Institute on Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin 
Diseases and the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development, to accelerate clinical trials to improve treatment 
for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The conferees 
encourage NINDS to actively seek and assess clinical trial 
proposals and to expedite the review process for clinical 
research in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The conferees strongly 
encourage the funding of three additional centers of excellence 
by the end of fiscal year 2004.
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death among women 
worldwide and kills more than twice as many women as do breast 
cancer and AIDS combined. Recognizing that women are the single 
largest group at risk for death from stroke, the conferees 
believe that special attention should be focused on better 
understanding the gender differences with specific attention to 
stroke related to pregnancy; the use of oral contraceptives; 
and the impact of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy on 
stroke risk. The conferees further urge NIH to increase 
research into new therapies for stroke in women as well as ways 
of enhancing the vascular health of all Americans, including 
(1) a clinical trial of carotid endarterectomy and angioplasty/
stenting in women, (2) observational research on differences in 
the way men and women present with stroke symptoms, and (3) 
studies of differences in how men and women respond to FDA-
approved antiplatelet agents for recurrent stroke prevention.
      The conferees strongly support NIH's initiatives toward 
advancing the organization of stroke care and the 
identification of stroke treatment and research centers that 
would provide rapid, early, continuous 24-hour treatment to 
stroke victims, including the use of the clot-buster t-PA, when 
appropriate.

         National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

      The conference agreement includes $4,335,155,000 for the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases instead 
of $4,335,255,000 as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language 
permitting the transfer of $150,000,000 to International 
Assistance Programs, Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, 
and Tuberculosis as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$100,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conferees encourage NIAID to enhance its research 
efforts to identify the cause of eosinophilic-myalgia syndrome 
and to characterize better the pathophysiological events of 
this disease. The conferees support the Institute's efforts to 
support a workshop in 2004 to evaluate the current state of 
knowledge on EMS. The conferees anticipate that the workshop 
will identify new scientific opportunities related to the 
pathogenesis of EMS and improved diagnosis, treatment and 
prevention strategies.
      The conferees are concerned about the pace of research in 
the area of chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome. 
The conferees encourage NIAID, in collaboration with NINDS and 
NIMH, to increase its research portfolio in the areas of CFIDS. 
The conferees further request that the NIH report to the 
Committees on Appropriations by March 1, 2004, on the number of 
grants specifically devoted to CFIDS research, over the past 
five years.

             National Institute of General Medical Sciences

      The conference agreement includes $1,916,333,000 for the 
National Institute of General Medical Sciences instead of 
$1,923,133,000 as proposed by the House and $1,917,033,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.

        National Institute of Child Health and Human Development

      The conference agreement includes $1,250,585,000 for the 
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
instead of $1,245,371,000 as proposed by the House and 
$1,251,185,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees urge NICHD to continue its cooperation and 
participation in the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy programs of 
the National Institute on Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and 
Skin Diseases and NINDS. The conferees commend NICHD for its 
involvement in the Paul Wellstone Centers of Excellence 
programs for Muscular Dystrophy, and urge its ongoing 
commitment to assist the funding of clinical trials proposals 
and expedite the review process for clinical research in 
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, in addition to its investment in 
new Centers of Excellence.

                         National Eye Institute

      The conference agreement includes $657,199,000 for the 
National Eye Institute as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$648,299,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conferees commend the NIH Director's initiative to 
advance translational clinical research through the joint 
efforts of the various Institutes, often in partnership with 
private organizations focused on clinical research and patient 
participation. The conferees are aware of a proposal for a 
national conference on translational clinical research for 
orphan eye diseases. The Director of the NEI is encouraged to 
consider providing support for this important effort.

          National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences

      The conference agreement includes $636,974,000 for the 
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences instead of 
$630,774,000 as proposed by the House and $637,074,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees recognize the complex environmental 
exposures faced by the residents of rural areas. NIEHS is urged 
to address rural environmental concerns through its 
environmental health sciences core centers program.
      The conferees encourage NIEHS to continue its support for 
critical research required to fill data gaps in environmental 
health, with special concern for children's health, including 
the effects of mixtures of chemicals on developing nervous 
systems; accurate exposure levels for environmental chemicals; 
and the development of predictive models of chemical effects on 
developing systems. The conferees encourage the NIEHS to 
collaborate with the CDC on research focused on environmental 
chemical mixtures and computational modeling.

                      National Institute on Aging

      The conference agreement includes $1,031,311,000 for the 
National Institute on Aging instead of $994,411,000 as proposed 
by the House and $1,031,411,000 as proposed by the Senate.

 National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

      The conference agreement includes $504,300,000 for the 
National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin 
Diseases instead of $502,778,000 as proposed by the House and 
$505,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees urge NIAMS, in collaboration with NINDS and 
NICHD, to accelerate clinical trials to improve treatment for 
patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The conferees 
encourage NIAMS to actively seek and assess clinical trial 
proposals and to expedite the review process for clinical 
research in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The conferees 
encourage the funding for three additional centers of 
excellence by the end of fiscal year 2004.
      The conferees commend NIAMS for conducting a workshop on 
the ``Burden of Skin Diseases.'' The workshop participants 
found that there was a lack of specific data on this topic and 
recommended that general and skin disease-specific measures of 
the burden of skin disease be developed in order to generate 
data on the incidence, prevalence, economic burden, quality of 
life, disability, and handicaps attributable to these diseases. 
The conferees request that NIAMS provide a detailed action plan 
of Institute activities to effectively implement the 
recommendations of the workshop participants.

    National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders

      The conference agreement includes $384,477,000 for the

proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language to 
earmark $119,220,000 for extramural facilities construction 
grants as proposed by the Senate. The House did not provide 
funding for extramural facilities construction.
      Within the total provided for NCRR, the conference 
agreement includes $215,000,000 for the Institutional 
Development Awards (IDeA) program and $320,000,000 for the 
General Clinical Research Centers as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees are pleased with reports of the ongoing 
successes of the Science Education Partnerships Award (SEPA) 
program. The NCRR is urged to continue soliciting and funding 
additional SEPA grant applications from science centers and 
other eligible entities.

       National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine

      The conference agreement includes $117,752,000 for the 
National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine 
instead of $116,202,000 as proposed by the House and 
$117,902,000 as proposed by the Senate.

       National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities

      The conference agreement includes $192,724,000 for the 
National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities as 
proposed by the House instead of $192,824,000 as proposed by 
the Senate.

                  John E. Fogarty International Center

      The conference agreement includes $65,800,000 for the 
John E. Fogarty International Center instead of $64,266,000 as 
proposed by the House and $65,900,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.

                      National Library of Medicine

      The conference agreement provides $319,835,000 for the 
National Library of Medicine, of which $311,635,000 is from 
budget authority and $8,200,000 is from amounts available under 
section 241 of the Public Health Service Act to carry out the 
National Information Center on Health Services Research and 
Health Care Technology. The House had provided $316,040,000, 
entirely from budget authority, and the Senate had provided 
$320,035,000, of which $311,835,000 was from budget authority 
and $8,200,000 was from section 241 authority.

                         Office of the Director

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement includes $329,707,000 for the 
Office of the Director instead of $317,983,000 as proposed by 
the House and $323,483,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language 
identifying $7,500,000 for the purposes identified in general 
provision 221.
      The conference agreement provides $500,000 for the 
Foundation for the National Institutes of Health as proposed by 
the House instead of $497,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees concur with the guidance in the Senate 
report regarding limits for NIH reprogramming requests.
      The conferees concur in the House report language 
indicating that the proposal to multi-year fund some or all NIH 
grants is not approved.
      The conferees recognize that breakthroughs in the 
physical sciences underpin many of the remarkable advances in 
the life sciences that have been achieved during the last 
century. Increasingly, the boundaries between the life sciences 
and the physical sciences are being blurred, as capacities and 
talents bridging the disciplines are essential for modern 
experimentation and discovery. Accordingly, the conferees 
believe that a major effort must be undertaken to promote the 
advancement of research at the interface between the life 
sciences and the physical sciences. This interface occurs in 
many agencies including NIH, NSF, Office of Science, Department 
of Energy, DARPA, NASA, NOAA, and others. The conferees commend 
NIH for its plans to evaluate, as part of the NIH Roadmap 
process, what steps need to be taken to encourage progress in 
the physical sciences that will provide support and 
underpinning for future advances in the life sciences and to 
convene a conference to discuss this issue with other Federal 
agencies.
      The conferees commend NIH for recently awarding nine 
five-year grants to expand research on autoimmune disease and 
to increase the number of autoimmunity centers of excellence. 
This coordinated approach, under the NIH Autoimmune Diseases 
Coordinating Committee, involves the full spectrum of NIH 
Institutes. It marks a promising start in implementing the 
recommendations of the NIH Autoimmune Diseases Research Plan.
      The Committee encourages the Office of Rare Diseases to 
work in association with NINDS in studying Niemann-Pick Type C, 
a rare metabolic disorder in which harmful quantities of 
cholesterol and other fatty substances accumulate in the 
spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow and most often in the brain.
      The conferees urge NIH to support the efforts of 
universities, medical schools, scientific societies and other 
groups that are working to develop and implement a system for 
voluntary, peer-driven accreditation of organizations 
throughout the country which are engaged in research involving 
human subjects.
      The conferees encourage the Office of Dietary Supplements 
and NCCAM to review and consider funding research to elucidate 
the mechanisms of action of the B vitamins and antioxidant 
phytochemicals in berries so that work in animal models can be 
extended to human studies. Research with animals has shown that 
diets containing berry fruits (such as blueberries) as well as 
B vitamins can forestall and perhaps reverse many of the 
neurological changes that are associated with age-related 
neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's and 
Alzheimer's disease.

                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

      The conference agreement includes $89,500,000 for 
buildings and facilities as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$80,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement includes language granting full 
scope authority for the contracting of construction of the 
first and second phases of the John E. Porter Neurosciences 
Building as proposed by the Senate. The House did not have a 
similar provision.
      Due to extensive community concerns about the proposed 
construction of a BSL-3 lab on NIH's main Bethesda, MD campus, 
the conferees expect NIH to: (1) submit a report to the Senate 
and House Appropriations Committees within 60 days of enactment 
of this Act detailing the reasons why NIH believes the lab 
should not be built at Fort Detrick, MD; (2) provide the

able to use the services of volunteer advertising agencies and 
donated media.
      The conferees are concerned about the problem of chronic

funding to SAMHSA through direct appropriation rather than 
using the evaluation set-aside.

      Within funds provided, $100,000,000 is for the new drug 
and alcohol treatment voucher initiative as proposed by the 
House. The Senate did not include funding for this program. The 
conferees applaud the Administration for proposing this 
initiative, the Access to Recovery program, which will provide 
much-needed funds to increase capacity and expand access to 
alcohol and drug treatment. The conferees expect that the new 
voucher program will support evidenced-based practice and will 
provide medically appropriate treatment for individuals needing 
care. To this end, the conferees expect that States and 
providers receiving funds under this program will use 
assessment and placement criteria developed by national 
experts, such as the American Society of Addiction Medicine. 
The conferees support the Administration's goal of opening new 
pathways to treatment. At the same time however, the conferees 
direct that all providers participating in the Access to 
Recovery program should be held accountable to the same 
standards of care, performance, licensure and certification 
requirements as other licensed or certified drug and alcohol 
programs in their respective States. The conferees direct 
SAMHSA to report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations 30 days after Access to Recovery funds are 
distributed regarding the States that applied for and received 
grants, the amount awarded to each State, and the services each 
State will provide with these funds. Furthermore, no funds 
shall be expended under this Act for the implementation of the 
Access to Recovery voucher program other than those funds 
specifically provided for by the conferees.

treatment programs for pregnant, postpartum and residential 
women and their children as proposed by the Senate.

homelessness across the Nation. Within the total for substance 
abuse treatment programs of regional and national significance, 
the conference agreement provides funds at no less than the 
fiscal year 2003 level for programs addressing homelessness.
      The conference agreement provides $33,901,000 for 
targeting specific treatment approaches for adolescents and 
young adults. The conferees are aware that there are becoming 
fewer treatment options for teens and young adults and provide 
this funding to address that specific treatment gap.
      Included in the conference agreement is $35,000,000 for 
targeted capacity expansion for general populations, as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees have not included funds for the Screening, 
Brief Intervention, Referral and Treatment (SBIRT) program and 
direct that none of the funds provided in this Act for existing 
programs shall be reduced below fiscal year 2003 levels to fund 
the SBIRT program.

the work environment, retention of nurses, the impact of an

issues related to the current disbursement system of Federal 
Medicaid to providers in the City of San Juan, so as to ensure 
that eligible beneficiaries have access to Medicaid-covered 
health care services. Such a study should examine any existing 
barriers to care and the adequacy of the provider network, as 
well as any lack of capacity that may exist as a result of the 
current system. CMS is further directed to report the findings 
of this study back to the Committee on Appropriations no less

      The conference agreement includes bill language 
identifying $30,000,000 for the CMS revitalization plan as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $65,000,000 as proposed by 
the House.
      The conference agreement does not include language that 
was in the House bill identifying $129,000,000 for processing 
Medicare appeals. Funding is included to support the Social 
Security Administration's costs of Medicare hearings workloads.
      The conference agreement includes $1,722,889,000 for 
Medicare operations instead of $1,776,889,000 as proposed by 
both the House and the Senate. The conference agreement does 
not include the $98,000,000 reduction to Medicare operations 
included in general provision 217 of the House bill. The 
conference agreement includes bill language proposed by the 
Senate making up to an additional $18,000,000 available to CMS 
for Medicare claims processing if unit costs of claims exceed 
particular thresholds. The House bill did not contain similar 
language.
      The conferees are concerned that the proposed Medicare 
``75% Rule'' classifying inpatient rehabilitation facilities 
(IRFs) would have severe consequences for access to inpatient 
services. The conferees concur with the Medicare Payment 
Advisory Commission (MedPAC) finding that further analysis 
should be conducted to identify which criteria are clinically 
appropriate for inclusion in the calculation of the rule used 
to determine eligibility for reimbursement under the IRF 
prospective payment system. The conferees direct CMS to 
contract with the Institute of Medicine to issue a report, in 
consultation with a panel of independent experts in the field 
of physical medicine and rehabilitation, to establish 
clinically appropriate standards for medical necessity and 
clinically appropriate qualification criteria for IRFs. During 
the study period, the conferees expect the Secretary to delay 
implementation of the 75% rule, delay implementation of local 
medical review policies concerning medical necessity, and not 
accept new IRF applications until the report is finished.
      The conferees are concerned that CMS has not updated 
since 1992 the relative values code for the provision of 
portable services, such as X-rays, despite the statutory 
requirement to update these codes every five years. This 
failure may be contributing to the utilization of more costly 
care settings. The conferees urge the Secretary, within 90 days 
of enactment of this Act, to review the relative values code 
for portable X-ray providers and to update this code utilizing 
existing data.
      The conferees are aware that a final rule to revise the 
2004 Medicare Fee Schedule for payment to physicians was issued 
on November 7, 2003. The rule will change payment for 
physicians managing dialysis patients to reflect the varying 
number of visits performed each month to an end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) patient. Yet, there appears to be no published 
evidence that visiting dialysis patients more frequently than 
once per month correlates with improved outcomes. Moreover, the 
conferees are concerned that this change in payment methodology 
may have serious implications for ESRD patients who reside in 
rural communities. The conferees understand that it is equally 
plausible that the quality of an individual visit is more 
critical to ensuring optimal outcomes than is the frequency of 
visits. Therefore, the conferees expect CMS to consult with the 
General Accounting Office, the Relative Value Update Committee, 
and clinical nephrology societies, as well as relevant provider 
and patient organizations, to evaluate and develop an 
alternative payment reform that facilitates enhanced physician/
dialysis patient interaction and outcomes.

                ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

  Payments to States for Child Support Enforcement and Family Support 
                                Programs

      The conference agreement provides $3,292,970,000 for 
payments to States for child support enforcement and family 
support programs. The House bill had proposed $3,292,970,000 
and the Senate bill had proposed $3,292,270,000.

                   Low-Income Home Energy Assistance

      The conference agreement provides $1,900,000,000 for low-
income home energy assistance rather than $1,800,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $2,000,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Of the amount provided $1,800,000,000 is provided for 
formula grants to States. The House bill had proposed 
$1,700,000,000 for State formula grants and the Senate bill 
proposed $2,000,000,000. Within the funds available, 
$27,500,000 is included for the leveraging incentive fund as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $100,000,000 as 
proposed by the House for the contingency fund to meet the 
additional home energy assistance needs arising from a natural 
disaster or other emergency. The Senate bill did not include 
funds for the contingency fund. The conferees expect the 
Secretary to consider the factors identified in the statute 
when making decisions about the release of funds. The conferees 
are aware that the Secretary formally notifies the authorizing 
committees in advance of issuing grants from LIHEAP contingency 
funds, pursuant to Section 2604(e) of the Low-Income Home 
Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8623(e)). The 
conferees request that the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations receive copies of such notifications in advance 
of issuing grants. The conferees urge the Department to provide 
regular information on significant, unanticipated changes in 
home heating and cooling costs and to receive quarterly reports 
on significant variances in regional weather data and fuel 
prices to the Committees on Appropriations and the appropriate 
authorizing committees. Such reports should be provided within 
30 days of the end of any fiscal quarter in which LIHEAP 
contingency funds remain available for obligation. In addition, 
the conferees request for any quarter in which there is a 
release of funds to receive a detailed explanation of the 
factors used to determine the distribution of funds among 
States.
      The conferees are aware that one of the criteria for 
release of emergency funds is a significant increase in 
disconnections. The precursor to disconnection is a household 
in arrearage. The conferees believe that helping families prior 
to disconnection would prevent safety and health concerns 
surrounding a household without energy services. For that 
reason, the conferees urge the Secretary to monitor arrearage 
trends nationwide and consider a significant increase in 
arrearage rates as part of the disconnection criteria.

                     Refugee and Entrant Assistance

      The conference agreement includes $450,276,000 for the 
refugee and entrant assistance programs rather than 
$461,853,000 as proposed by the House and $428,056,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $170,000,000 for the 
transitional and medical services programs rather than 
$200,193,000 as proposed by the House and $180,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees recognize the positive outcomes achieved 
for individuals served through the matching grant fund program. 
Therefore, the conferees encourage the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement (ORR) to ensure that the matching grant program is 
not disproportionately affected by the funding reductions 
proposed due to lower admissions to the United States. The 
conferees request, as part of the fiscal year 2005 
Congressional budget justification, that the ORR provide a 
detailed breakdown on the plan for allocating funding under the 
transitional and medical services program.
      The conference agreement provides $9,968,000 for both the 
victims of trafficking program and the victims of torture 
program. The House bill had included $10,000,000 for each 
program and the Senate bill had proposed $9,935,000 for each 
program.
      The conference agreement provides $153,121,000 for social 
services, the same level as proposed in the House bill. The 
Senate had proposed $140,000,000 for this program. Within funds 
provided, the conference agreement includes $19,000,000 for 
increased support to communities with large concentrations of 
Cuban and Haitian refugees of varying ages whose cultural 
differences make assimilation especially difficult justifying a 
more intense level and longer duration of Federal assistance 
for healthcare and education.
      The conference agreement includes $4,820,000 for 
preventive health rather than $4,835,000 as proposed by the 
House and $4,804,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $49,316,000 for 
targeted assistance. The House bill had proposed $49,477,000 
and the Senate had proposed $49,155,000 for this program.
      The conference agreement provides $53,083,000 for the 
unaccompanied alien children program rather than $34,227,000 as 
proposed by both the House and Senate. These additional funds 
will enable the Office of Refugee Resettlement to meet its 
obligations under the Homeland Security Act, which transferred 
the administration of this program from the former Immigration 
and Naturalization Service. The conferees intend that funding 
provided above the budget request be used to continue making 
progress toward providing appropriate facilities for the care 
of children; improving medical services that address the needs 
of such children; and enhancing the legal representation for 
those involved in this program.
      The conferees recognize the importance of continued 
educational support to schools with a significant proportion of 
refugee children, consistent with previous support to schools 
heavily impacted by large concentrations of refugees, and urge 
the Office of Refugee Resettlement to support these efforts 
should funding become available in the social services or other 
programs.

   Payments to States for the Child Care and Development Block Grant

      The conference agreement includes $2,099,729,000 for the 
child care and development block grant, the same level as both 
the House and Senate bills. Included in the bill is $9,864,000 
within the total funds provided, for child care research, 
demonstration, and evaluation activities as proposed by the 
House. The Senate bill had included $10,000,000 for these 
activities.

                      Social Services Block Grant

      The conference agreement provides $1,700,000,000 for the 
social services block grant, the same level as proposed in both 
the House and Senate bills. The conference agreement provides 
10 percent transfer authority between the social services block 
grant and the temporary assistance for needy families program 
(TANF). The House bill had proposed 5.5 percent 
transferability. The Senate did not include a similar 
provision.

                Children and Families Services Programs

      The conference agreement includes $8,822,097,000 for 
children and families services programs, of which $6,000,000 is 
provided through the evaluation set-aside. The House proposed 
$8,614,670,000 for these programs and the Senate proposed 
$8,788,457,000, of which $6,000,000 was from the evaluation 
set-aside.
Head Start
      The conference agreement includes $6,815,570,000 for Head 
Start, the same as both the House and Senate bills. The 
agreement includes $1,400,000,000 in advance funding, the same 
level as proposed by both the House and Senate.
      The conferees are aware that approximately one-third of 
Head Start programs are affiliated with public school systems 
and often combine or coordinate the transportation of Head 
Start, preschool, and K-12 students. In addition, many center-
based Head Start programs coordinate with local transit 
authorities to provide supervised transportation to Head Start 
children whose parents work non-traditional hours or whose 
geographical distance from the parent's place of employment 
creates a barrier to Head Start participation. Differences 
between Head Start transportation regulations, promulgated by 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and those 
promulgated by State and local authorities, may have the 
unintended consequence of reducing transportation services for 
Head Start students, and in turn, decrease transportation 
options for children. These differences may leave Head Start 
children without transportation or relying on parents to 
provide transportation in their vehicles.
      The conferees recognize that children's safety is the 
most important consideration and that many students 
participating in Head Start programs need access to safe and 
reliable transportation provided by public schools or local 
transit systems. For this reason, the conferees direct the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services to offer a waiver 
option to local educational agency-contracted Head Start 
programs that provide integrated transportation to Head Start 
students. In cases where public schools or local transit 
authorities provide Head Start services, local educational 
agencies should have the option to comply with transportation 
standards for preschool students mandated by the State or local 
educational agencies, transit agencies, State Departments of 
Transportation or the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services.
Consolidated Runaway and Homeless Youth Program
      The conference agreement includes $89,978,000 for the 
consolidated runaway and homeless youth program, the same level 
as proposed by the Senate, rather than $88,043,000 as proposed 
by the House. Within the funds provided, $40,505,000 is 
available for the transitional living program (TLP) and 
$49,473,000 is for basic centers as proposed by the Senate.
Prevention Grants To Reduce Abuse of Runaway Youth
      The conference agreement includes $15,399,000 for 
prevention grants to reduce abuse of runaway youth as proposed 
by the Senate. The House bill had proposed $14,999,000 for 
these grants.
Child abuse
      The conference agreement includes $34,623,000 for child 
abuse discretionary programs instead of $26,301,000 as proposed 
by the House and $28,401,000 as proposed by the Senate. Within 
the funds provided for child abuse prevention programs, the 
agreement includes the following items:

AGAPE of Central Alabama, Inc., Montgomery, Alabama, for 
    their work with children in need....................         $70,000

West River Foundation, Sturgis, SD, to establish early 
    childhood development programs in small communities.         500,000
Abandoned Infants Assistance
      The conference agreement provides $12,126,000 for the 
abandoned infants assistance program, the same level as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill had proposed $12,086,000 
for this program.
Child Welfare Services
      The conference agreement provides $291,037,000 for child 
welfare services rather than $291,986,000 as proposed by the 
House and $290,088,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Child Welfare Training
      The conference agreement includes $7,460,000 for child 
welfare training rather than $7,470,000 as proposed by the 
House and $7,449,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Adoption Opportunities
      The conference agreement includes $27,285,000 for the 
adoption opportunities program rather than $27,343,000 as 
proposed by the House and $27,227,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
Adoption Incentives
      The conference agreement provides $35,000,000 for the 
adoption incentive program for bonuses for adoptions completed 
prior to the end of fiscal year 2004, $27,500,000 of which is 
unused fiscal year 2003 funds, instead of $43,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $42,720,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement includes bill language, which 
allows funds appropriated for bonus payments in Public Law 108-
7 and available for obligation through September 30, 2004 to be 
used to make bonus payments for adoptions completed before 
September 30, 2004. The conferees note that the number of 
adoptions from the public foster care system has increased 
significantly over the past several years, rising from 27,761 
in fiscal year 1997 to 50,179 in fiscal year 2002. As a result 
of this increase and based on the most recent estimates, fewer 
resources will be needed in fiscal year 2004 to make bonus 
payments to States for the full amount for which they are 
eligible under this program.
Adoption Awareness
      The conference agreement includes $12,864,000 for the 
adoption awareness program rather than $12,906,000 as proposed 
by the House and $12,822,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Compassion Capital Fund
      The conference agreement includes $48,000,000 for the 
compassion capital fund, instead of $50,000,000 as proposed by 
the House and $34,772,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Social Services and Income Maintenance Research
      The conference agreement includes $18,767,000 for social 
services and income maintenance research, of which $6,000,000 
is provided through the evaluation set-aside. The House had 
proposed $5,982,000 for this program and the Senate proposed 
$31,812,000, of which $6,000,000 was from the evaluation set-
aside.
      The conferees note that efforts undertaken through the 
State information technology consortium have led to greatly 
improved systems communications and compliance in both the TANF 
and child support enforcement (CSE) programs. For TANF, the 
conferees have provided $2,000,000 to permit States to utilize 
uniquely designed web-based technology to improve benefit 
delivery and fulfill new Federal reporting requirements. For 
CSE, the conferees have provided $3,000,000 to continue the 
consortium's efforts to improve data exchange between CSE and 
the courts in ways that will significantly reduce the time lag 
between court orders and enforcement/collections activities.
      The conferees are concerned that children continue to be 
left unaccounted for and underserved within State child welfare 
systems. Protecting the Nation's most vulnerable populations, 
especially youth in State protective care, should receive 
significant attention. The conferees are aware of a project 
being developed by Rx for Reading that would provide a model 
for a case management tool housing all of the health and 
education records of children in the care of the counties of 
the State of California, including those in foster care and 
residential facilities, in a web browser-based database. The 
conferees understand that this database could replace a number 
of stand alone, antiquated databases and automate manual record 
keeping, which would enable caregivers, foster families, 
educators, doctors and case workers to easily access and update 
information relating to their services and functions through 
secure portals.
      The conferees also provide sufficient funding for the 
following:

 Alaska Children's Services of Anchorage for operations 
    of programs to serve needs of at risk, low income 
    youth in Anchorage..................................        $300,000

    and Prevention Research program.....................         350,000

Community-Based Resource Centers
      The conference agreement includes $33,403,000 for the 
community-based resource centers as proposed by the House 
rather than $33,412,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Developmental Disabilities
      For developmental disabilities programs, the conference 
agreement includes $73,515,000 for State Councils as proposed 
by the Senate instead of $71,500,000 as proposed by the House. 
The conference agreement includes $38,644,000 for protection 
and advocacy services as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$36,500,000 as proposed by the House. The agreement also 
includes $11,642,000 for special projects as proposed by the

proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement includes $15,000,000 for the 
disabled voter services programs. Within the funds provided, 
$10,000,000 shall be for payments to States to promote disabled 
voter access as proposed by the Senate rather than $13,000,000 
as proposed by the House and $5,000,000 shall be for payments 
to States for disabled voter protection and advocacy, the same

      The conferees are aware that funding for protection and 
advocacy services under section 291 of the Help America Vote 
Act currently is not being made available to protection and 
advocacy services that specifically address the Native American 
community. Native Americans with disabilities experience unique 
challenges in exercising the right to vote. For that reason, 
the conferees intend that organizations providing protection 
and advocacy services to Native Americans as defined in the 
Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act 
should also be deemed an eligible entity under the Help America 
Vote Act.
Native American Programs

American programs as proposed by the Senate, instead of 
$45,119,000 as proposed by the House.

authorized by the Family Support Act.

proposed by the Senate.

House and $7,203,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                        Aging Services Programs

      The conference agreement includes $1,381,689,000 for 
aging services programs instead of $1,377,421,000 as proposed 
by the House and $1,361,193,000 as proposed by the Senate. 
Within the total, $5,500,000 is available for medication 
management, screening, and education activities as proposed by 
the Senate. The House had proposed $5,000,000 for these 
activities.
      The conference agreement includes $356,000,000 for 
supportive centers, instead of $357,000,000 as proposed by the 
House and $355,673,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $19,559,000 for

is provided for Native American caregivers support rather than

by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $718,704,000 for 
nutrition programs rather than $720,655,000 as proposed by the 
House and $716,964,000 as proposed by the Senate. Within the 
total, $388,646,000 is provided for congregate meals rather 
than $390,000,000 as proposed by the House and $387,292,000 as 
proposed by the Senate and $149,073,000 is provided for the 
nutrition services incentives program rather than $149,670,000 
as proposed by the House and $148,697,000 as proposed by the

proposed by the House and $17,843,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conferees continue to support funding at no less 
than last year's level for national programs scheduled to be 
refunded in fiscal year 2004 that address a variety of issues, 
including elder abuse, native American issues and legal 
services.
      Within the funding provided, the conference agreement 
includes $3,000,000 for social research into Alzheimer's 
disease care options, best practices and other Alzheimer's 
research priorities that include research into cause, cure and 
care, as well as respite care, assisted living, the impact of 
intervention by social service agencies on victims, and related 
needs. The agreement provides that this research utilize and 
give discretion to Area Agencies on Aging and their non-profit 
divisions in municipalities with aged populations (over the age 
of 60) of over 1,000,000, with preference given to the largest 
population. The conferees recommend that unique partnerships to 
affect this research be considered for the selected Area Agency 
on Aging.
      Given the enormous demands on Alzheimer's family 
caregivers, the conferees have included $1,000,000 to support 
the continuation of an Alzheimer's family contact center for 
round-the-clock help to Alzheimer's families in crisis.
      The conferees expect the Administration on Aging to 
continue to fund the National program of statewide senior legal 
services hotlines (also called legal help lines) at their 
current levels and ideally to provide an increase in the number 
of States served by these legal hotlines.
      The conferees also include the following amounts under

professional shortage areas.
      The conferees strongly support the Buy American Act, 
which was enacted in 1933 to ensure that the Federal government 
supports domestic companies and domestic workers by buying 
American-made goods. The Act includes a number of waiver 
provisions that allow Federal agencies to buy foreign goods in 
some circumstances, but there is little disclosure or 
accountability in the waiver process. The conferees direct the 
Secretary to issue a report not later than 60 days after the 
end of fiscal year 2004 on the amount of acquisitions made by 
the Department during such fiscal year of articles, materials,

include a similar provision.
      The conferees intend that, of the funding provided to the 
Office of Minority Health, no less than the fiscal year 2003 
funding level be allocated to a culturally competent and 
linguistically appropriate public health response to the HIV/

outcomes audit required under Mammography Quality Standards Act

Institute of Medicine focusing on the state of emergency care 
in the United States. The study should examine the different 
roles of emergency departments as emergency care provider, 
safety net provider, portal of entry provider and disaster 
response provider, along with an identification of the 
impediments to successfully performing those roles. The study 
should also examine workforce issues, including residency 
training and problems in obtaining emergency physicians in 
rural areas, information technology and systems issues that 
relate to speeding access and treatment to emergency patients 
while improving patient safety, and the development of a 
research agenda needed to provide the information necessary to 
ensure that the American people have access to the emergency 
medical services they require in the future.
      The conferees direct that the effects statements required 
for the General Departmental Management account include a level 
of detail that identifies the funding for each Office in the 
Office of the Secretary, such as the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Administration and Management.
      The conferees concur in the Senate report language 
regarding the collection of racial, ethnic and primary health-
related data; the embryo adoption awareness campaign; and new 
and continuing projects in the adolescent family life program.
      The conference agreement modifies House report language 
to direct the Secretary to request that Title X grantees 
voluntarily provide the following information regarding 
abortions: the number of Title X-funded sites that also provide 
abortions with non-Federal funds. The Secretary's request shall 
be limited to the above question with no additional information 
regarding the identity of the clinics or the patients receiving 
abortions. The conferees direct that when the Secretary 
requests the information, the letter of request should contain 
a statement making it clear that the grantees' responses shall 
be voluntary and without consequence, or threat of consequence, 
to non-responsiveness. The conferees further direct that the 
records documenting this information shall be retained by the 
grantee, and shall not be provided to the Secretary nor any 
other Federal, State, or local official or entity. The 
conferees expect the Secretary to provide a report to the House 
and Senate appropriations committees four months after 
enactment of this Act summarizing the volunteered information.
      The conferees are concerned about underage drinking and 
the need to take immediate steps to better coordinate Federal 
efforts combating this problem facing our Nation. The conferees 
are aware of recommendations that the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) establish an interagency committee on the 
prevention of underage drinking and issue an annual report 
summarizing all Federal agency activities concerning this 
issue, including key surveillance data and progress being made 
in reducing underage drinking. The conferees direct the 
Secretary to take immediate steps to implement these 
recommendations. In addition, the conferees directthe 
Secretary, in coordination with agencies such as SAMHSA and NIAAA, to 
prepare a plan for combating underage drinking, including the projected 
costs and next steps to be taken, and report progress on such a plan 90 
days after enactment of this Act.
      The conferees support the Administration's goals of 
ending chronic homelessness and creating 150,000 units of 
permanent supportive housing. However, the conferees believe 
these goals were not properly reflected in the Department's 
budget request. The Administration is instructed to include as 
part of its fiscal year 2005 budget request a description of 
new and continuing resources that are being applied to create 
and sustain permanent supportive housing for people 
experiencing chronic homelessness and a description of the 
resources necessary to achieve the goal of ending chronic 
homelessness.
      Within the amount provided, sufficient funds are included 
to publish and widely disseminate the U.S. Surgeon General's 
report on osteoporosis and related bone diseases. In an effort 
to heighten public awareness of this report, the Surgeon 
General is encouraged to work with voluntary health 
organizations dedicated to promoting lifelong bone health.
      The conferees urge the Department to begin a study on 
comprehensive pharmacy services in light of changes in 
technology, distance and distributive learning models, the 
aging of the populations and the Department's study on the 
severe pharmacist shortage, to analyze how these factors may 
influence the nature of pharmaceutical education and 
interventions in healthcare.
      The conferees direct that specific information requests 
from the chairmen and ranking members of the Subcommittees on 
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related 
Agencies, on scientific research or any other matter, shall be 
transmitted to the Committees on Appropriations in a prompt 
professional manner and within the time frame specified in the 
request. The conferees further direct that scientific 
information requested by the Committees on Appropriations and 
prepared by government researchers and scientists be 
transmitted to the Committees on Appropriations, uncensored and 
without delay.
      By January 1, 2005, the Secretary shall develop policy 
recommendations and issue a report to Congress by which vision 
rehabilitation services would be provided by vision 
rehabilitation professionals in an appropriate setting, 
including the patient's home environs, acting under a qualified 
physician's general supervision. The report may include 
adopting a national credentialing measure, or other steps 
deemed necessary by the Secretary, that would ensure patient 
quality of care. In developing the recommendations, the 
Secretary should consult with the National Vision 
Rehabilitation Cooperative, the Association for Education and 
Rehabilitation of the Blind, the Academy for Certification of 
Vision Rehabilitation and Education Professionals, the American 
Academy of Ophthalmology, and the American Optometric 
Association and other interested organizations.

                            Policy Research

      The conference agreement provides $20,750,000 for policy 
research from program evaluation funding. The House bill 
provided $20,483,000, of which $2,483,000 was Federal funds and 
$18,000,000 was program evaluation funding. The Senate bill 
provided $23,499,000, entirely from program evaluation funding.

            Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund

      The conference agreement includes $1,776,846,000 for the 
Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) to 
enhance Federal, State, and local preparedness to counter 
potential biological, disease, chemical, and radiological 
threats to civilian populations, the same as proposed by the 
House. The Senate proposed $1,856,040,000 for the Fund.
      The agreement continues bill language applicable in prior 
fiscal years to allow the Secretary to transfer amounts 
specified in the account between categories subject to normal 
reprogramming procedures.
      The conference agreement continues language, applicable 
during fiscal year 2003, exempting from any personnel ceiling 
applicable to the Agency, Service, or the Department of Health 
and Human Services both civilian and Commissioned Officers 
detailed to States, municipalities or other organizations under 
authority of Section 214 of the Public Health Service Act for 
purposes related to homeland security during their period of 
detail or assignment.
      Within the amount provided: $1,116,156,000 is for the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; $545,870,000 is for 
the Health Resources and Services Administration; and 
$64,820,000 is for the Office of the Secretary.
      The conferees note that funds requested within this 
account for Poison Control, and Emergency Medical Services for 
Children are provided within the Health Resources and Services 
Administration. This brings the comparable total for the Public 
Health and Social Services Emergency Fund to $1,820,700,000.
      Within the amounts available to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC): $940,000,000 is for State and 
Local Preparedness, $158,116,000 is for Upgrading CDC Capacity; 
and $18,040,000 is for the fourth year of a collaborative 
research program on anthrax vaccine.
      Within the amounts available for State and Local 
Preparedness, the conference agreement includes $847,456,000 
for State Cooperative Agreements, $29,838,000 for Public Health 
Preparedness Centers and $5,500,000 for Centers for Advanced 
Local Public Health Practice.
      Funds available for Public Health Preparedness Centers 
shall be used to establish collaborative programs with State 
and local public health agencies, enhance practice-based 
training of students, and to increase participation of public 
health practitioners in the Centers education and training 
activities.
      The conferees concur with language in the Senate report 
concerning the needs of local health departments and encourage 
both the Director and the Secretary to ensure that funds 
appropriated for State and local public health preparedness are 
spent in a manner with which local public health officials 
concur. Furthermore, it is expected that local public health 
agencies will continue to be full partners in developing State 
preparedness plans.
      The conferees note that the Health Alert Network now 
falls under the umbrella of the Public Health Information 
Network under development by the CDC. The conferees encourage 
CDC to provide adequate funding to improve public health 
capacity for electronic communication and data exchange at the 
local level in a manner consistent with the Public Health 
Information Network and with which local public health 
officials concur. This will enable enhanced local capacity that 
has resulted from HAN funding to continue.
      The conference agreement includes $2,000,000 to continue 
to discover, develop, and transition anti-infective agents to 
combat emerging diseases from within amounts available for 
Upgrading CDC Capacity.
      The conferees encourage CDC to conduct a demonstration 
project with World Medical Leaders to disseminate news, 
information, and alerts to physicians who are on the front 
lines in the effort to recognize biological, chemical, and 
radiological events.
      Within the funds available to the Health Resources and 
Services Administration (HRSA) is $518,000,000 for Hospital 
Preparedness and $27,870,000 to provide incentives for 
curricular reform in health professions schools and the 
delivery of continuing education to those already in practice.
      The conferees recognize the importance of training in 
biopreparedness and response for emergency physicians and 
encourage HRSA to support the development of a national 
bioterrorism response course for practicing emergency 
physicians. The conferees further encourage HRSA to work with 
the relevant professional associations through which emergency 
physicians receive their continuing education credits.
      The agreement includes $3,000,000 within funds provided 
to the Office of the Secretary to continue activities related 
to the transformation and modernization of the Public Health 
Service Commissioned Corps.
      The conferees recognize the need for development of a 
comprehensive national strategy to address the Nation's medical 
response capabilities given the growing threat of biological, 
chemical, radiation or explosive weapons attacks in the United 
States. The conferees are aware that the University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is pursuing a comprehensive, 
integrated strategy for dealing with threats throughout the 
region. The conferees urge the Department to study the 
preparedness efforts of institutions such as UPMC, the 
effectiveness of these programs, and the feasibility of 
replicating this type of initiative nationwide.
      The conferees are aware that a new technology, known as 
nanometal enhanced fluorescence (NanoMEF), offers promise for 
providing a rapid, ultra sensitive, method for the detection of 
bio-organisms, such as anthrax and smallpox. The conferees 
encourage the Director to review this promising technology and 
consider supporting its development from within the funds 
provided.
      In addition to the funds for terrorism preparedness and 
response, the conference agreement includes $50,000,000 for 
activities to ensure year-round production capacity of 
influenza vaccine, the same as proposed by the House. The 
Senate proposed $100,000,000 for the same activities.

                           General Provisions

                        EVALUATION TAP AUTHORITY

      The conference agreement includes a provision as proposed 
by the Senate to allow for a 2.2 percent evaluation tap 
pursuant to section 241 of the Public Health Service Act. This 
tap is to be applied to programs authorized under the Public 
Health Service Act. The House bill contained a provision to 
allow for a 1.25 percent evaluation tap.

                     ONE PERCENT TRANSFER AUTHORITY

      The conference agreement includes language permitting the 
Secretary of HHS to transfer up to one percent of discretionary 
funds between appropriations, with up to an additional 2 
percent subject to approval by the Appropriations Committees. 
The language permits the transfer of funds appropriated for HHS 
in this Act as proposed by the House. The Senate bill proposed 
the transfer of funds under this or any other Act.

              REFUGEE STATUS OF CERTAIN PERSECUTED GROUPS

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate to extend the refugee status for persecuted 
religious groups. The House bill contained no similar 
provision. The conferees intend to fully protect religious 
minority refugee applicants from Iran, including the current 
caseload of Iranian Christians, Jews, Bahai, Mandeans and 
Zoroastrians. Therefore, the administration should implement 
the provisions of section 213 of the conference report with 
respect to new applications, as well as to review previously 
denied applications for refugee applicants who have remained 
outside of Iran without a viable solution after being denied 
refugee status.

                                 SYNAR

      The conference agreement includes a provision directing 
States to maintain expenditures in fiscal year 2004 for tobacco 
prevention programs and for compliance activities at the same 
level as in fiscal year 2003 as proposed by the Senate.

bill contained no similar provision.

                  PARKINSON'S DISEASE RESEARCH CENTERS

      The conference agreement includes a general provision 
proposed by the Senate that overrides section 409B(c) of the 
Public Health Service Act, which limits the number of 
Parkinson's disease research centers that may be supported by 
the National Institutes of Health. The agreement includes 
language making this provision permanent so that the language 
does not need to be repeated each fiscal year.

                 HHS HUMAN RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PLAN

      The conference agreement does not include a general 
provision proposed by the Senate prohibiting the use of funds 
for the HHS human resources consolidation plan. The House bill 
contained no similar provision. The conferees direct the 
Secretary to provide the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees a report identifying the benchmarks HHS is using to 
measure the speed and cost of its human resources transactions, 
comparing those benchmarks as of October 1, 2003 to fiscal year 
2004 Department performance on a semi-annual basis. The 
conferees are disappointed that such benchmarks have not been 
provided to the Committees, despite commitments from the 
Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management to do so 
before the consolidation took effect. The conferees expect data 
in the report that would indicate the average and median length 
of time to post positions, the average and median length of 
time to complete hiring, the percentage of applicants accepting 
the position when offered, the number of transactions assigned 
per human resource FTE, and the estimated cost per transaction.

                             CONCIERGE CARE

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice bill 
language proposed by the Senate regarding a study of concierge 
care. However, the conferees concur in the direction from the 
Senate reflected in the bill language to the General Accounting 
Office to conduct a study on concierge care and to report to 
Congress their findings and recommendations no later than 
eighteen months after enactment of this Act. The House bill did 
not include a similar provision.

                     PEDIATRIC RESEARCH INITIATIVE

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice the 
general provision proposed by the Senate requiring the National 
Institutes of Health to report on its pediatric research 
initiative. The conferees concur in the direction from the 
Senate reflected in the bill language to produce the report no 
later than January 2004. The House did not include a similar 
provision.

                         POISON CONTROL CENTERS

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice a

of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to report to 
Congress on a plan to address blood and injection safety in 
Africa. The conference agreement includes a similar requirement 
within the Statement of the Managers under the heading for the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The House bill 
contained no similar provision.

                         HANSEN'S DISEASE STUDY

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice a 
general provision proposed by the Senate requiring a report 
concerning Hansen's disease. The conferees concur in the 
direction from the Senate reflected in the bill language to 
produce the report. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.

             CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT FUNDS

      The conference agreement does not include a general

                         NIH ROADMAP INITIATIVE

      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate authorizing the Director of NIH to enter into 
agreements to carry out research in support of the NIH roadmap 
initiative. The House bill did not include such a provision. 
This provision has been included to assess the merits of this 
funding approach and to demonstrate whether this funding 
mechanism would accelerate the research agenda. The conferees 
direct the Director of the NIH to enter into these agreements 
solely on the basis of scientific merit, opportunity for 
medical breakthroughs and urgency of need. It is the conferees 
intent that these funds be obligated solely at the discretion 
of the Director of NIH. The conferees understand that all 
awards would be subject to a competitive process. The language 
in this Title appropriating funds for the Office of the 
Director of NIH includes a limitation of $7,500,000 which may 
be used under the authority created in this general provision.

                           Denali Commission

      The conference agreement includes language amending the 
Denali Commission Act of 1998 to clarify that the Commission 
has authority to use the interagency transfer mechanism rather 
than grants to receive the funding provided in this Act. The 
House and Senate bills did not contain this provision.

                   TITLE III--DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

                    Education for the Disadvantaged

      The conference agreement includes $14,528,522,000 for 
Education for the Disadvantaged instead of $14,507,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $14,107,356,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      For Grants to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) the 
agreement provides $12,412,000,000. Both the House and the 
Senate proposed $12,350,000,000 for this program. The 
conference agreement includes $7,107,283,000 for basic grants 
and $1,365,031,000 for concentration grants. The agreement also 
includes $1,969,843,000 for targeted grants, and $1,969,843,000 
for education finance incentive grants. Concentration grants, 
targeted grants, and incentive grants are all provided on an 
advance-funded basis.
      The House proposed $7,172,971,000 for basic grants, 
$1,365,031,000 for concentration grants, $3,018,499,000 for 
targeted grants and $793,499,000 for education finance 
incentive grants. The Senate bill proposed $7,107,282,000 for 
basic grants, $1,365,031,000 for concentration grants, 
$1,670,239,000 for targeted grants, and $2,207,448,000 for 
education finance incentive grants.
      The conference agreement also includes language proposed 
by the Senate which specifies that the Secretary of Education 
shall obtain annually updated census poverty data for the 
purpose of distributing title I funds. The conference agreement 
does not include language proposed by the Senate directing the 
Secretary to use data available on July 1, 2003 to calculate 
grants for fiscal year 2004 under title I, notwithstanding any 
other provision of law.
      The conference agreement includes $248,375,000 for the 
Even Start program instead of $250,000,000 as proposed by the 
House and $175,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees 
commend the Office of Student Achievement and School 
Accountability for their efforts to coordinate and integrate 
existing Federal, State, and local literacy resources, 
including those provided under the Head Start program, Title I 
programs, and Adult Education programs, to strengthen and 
expand family literacy services. The conferees are aware that 
the 2003 report, ``State Administration of the Even Start 
Family Literacy Program: Structure, Process and Practices'', 
prepared by the U.S. Department of Education, calls for 
``Federal leadership to promote collection of core program and 
participant data that are comparable across States.'' The 
conferees also note that the report indicates ``States differed 
greatly in every aspect of Even Start performance indicators 
that were submitted in June 2001, including the measures used, 
performance standards set, and subgroups to which the 
measurements and standards are to be applied,'' and recommends 
areas where ``further development is needed to enable 
successful implementation of the [Performance Indicators] 
system.''
      The conferees believe that the development of program 
performance indicators is critical to the Even Start program, 
however the conferees also understand that much of this 
development must take place at the State level. Therefore, the 
conferees urge the Department of Education to work with State 
coordinators of the Even Start Family Literacy Program and 
national organizations representing family literacy programs in 
developing these indicators. The conferees are aware that 
similar efforts are underway in the adult education, Head 
Start, and elementary and secondary education programs and 
suggest that the frameworks and indicators developed under 
these programs could be adapted to the Even Start progam as 
well. The conferees also believe that the performance 
indicators should be consistent with the findings of the 
ongoing Even Start evaluation being conducted by the Institute 
for Education Sciences, as required by Title I (B) Sec. 1239 to 
``improve the performance and effectiveness'' of adults and 
children participating in Even Start Family Literacy programs. 
The conferees look forward to receiving information in the 2005 
Congressional Budget Justification about the Department's plans 
(including a timeline for implementation) for collecting this 
information.
      The conference agreement also includes $1,030,000,000 for 
Reading First State Grants instead of $1,050,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $1,000,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. It also includes $95,000,000 for Early Reading First 
instead of $100,000,000 as proposed by the House and

the House and $24,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

advanced placement fees instead of $23,347,000 as proposed by 
the House and $24,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                 SAFE SCHOOLS AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION

      The conference agreement includes $862,813,000 for 
programs in safe schools and citizenship education account, 
instead of $825,068,000 as proposed by the House and 
$818,547,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $445,483,000 for State 
grants instead of $468,949,000 as proposed by the House and 
$422,017,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The agreement also includes $154,680,000 for national 
programs instead of $160,180,000 as proposed by the House and

      The conferees also understand that a minimum of 
$9,000,000 remains available under the Project SERV program to 
provide for education-related services to school districts in 
which the learning environment has been disrupted due to a 
violent or traumatic crisis.
      The conferees direct the Department to implement the Act 
consistent with their intent, as reflected in the table above, 
and request an implementation plan to be submitted to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of 
enactment of the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 
2004. To the extent that the Department wishes to reprogram 
funds in order to address other activities or alter the 
allocation of funds for activities listed in the chart above, 
the conferees expect the Department to follow the guidance 
provided in this statement of the managers.
      The conference agreement includes $300,000 for the 
continued operation of the National Clearinghouse for 
Educational Facilities, the Nation's sole source for 
comprehensive information about school planning, design, 
financing, construction and maintenance. These funds will be 
used to address issues related to school safety and healthy 
school buildings, as described in the administration's budget 
request. The conference agreement also includes $700,000 for 
the Clearinghouse through the Fund for the Improvement of 
Education.
      The conference agreement includes bill language requiring 
the Department to spend $850,000 for the National Recognition 
Awards program under the guidelines described in section 120(f) 
of Public Law 105-244.
      The conference agreement includes $30,000,000 for grants 
to reduce alcohol abuse as proposed by the Senate. The House 
did not propose separate funding for this.
      The conference agreement includes $50,000,000 for 
mentoring programs as proposed by the House instead of 
$28,700,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement 
includes $34,000,000 for elementary and secondary school 
counseling as proposed by the Senate instead of $32,289,000 as 
proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement includes $70,000,000 for 
physical education programs as proposed by the Senate instead 
of $60,000,000 as proposed by the House. The funds should be 
used for the purpose identified in the No Child Left Behind 
Act, which states: ``The purpose of this subpart is to award 
grants and contracts to initiate, expand, and improve physical 
education programs for all kindergarten through 12th grade 
students.'' The conferees are aware that this Act also requires 
the Secretary to report to Congress describing the programs 
funded under this subpart, documenting the success of such 
programs in improving physical fitness, and making 
recommendations for the continuation and improvement of such 
programs. The conferees would like this data to inform the 
fiscal year 2005 budget processand therefore direct the 
Secretary to provide this report to Congress no later than May 3, 2004.
      The conference agreement includes $28,812,000 for the 
Civic Education program to support both the We the People 
programs and the Cooperative Education Exchange, as proposed by 
the House and Senate bills. The conferees intend that 
$16,890,000 will be provided to the nonprofit Center for Civic 
Education to support the We the People programs. Within the 
total for the We the People program, the conferees intend that 
$2,980,000 be reserved to continue the comprehensive program to 
improve public knowledge, understanding, and support of 
American democratic institutions which is a cooperative project 
among the Center for Civic Education, the Center on Congress at 
Indiana University, and the Trust for Representative Democracy 
at the National Conference of State Legislatures, and that 
$1,490,000 be used for continuation of the school violence 
prevention demonstration program, including $500,000 for the 
Native American initiative.
      The conference agreement also includes $11,922,000 for 
the Cooperative Education Exchange program. Within this amount, 
the conferees intend that $4,470,750 is for the Center for 
Civic Education and $4,470,750 for the National Council on 
Economic Education, while the remaining $2,980,500 should be 
used to continue the existing grants funded under the 
authorizing statute for civics and government education, and 
for economic education.
      The agreement also includes $25,000,000 for State Grants 
for Incarcerated Youth as proposed by the Senate. The House did 
not provide funding for this activity.

                      ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION

      The conference agreement includes $685,258,000 for 
English Language Acquisition programs instead of $685,515,000 
as proposed by the House and $669,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement includes language allowing the 
Secretary to transfer funding not needed to continue 
discretionary activities under antecedent programs to the 
formula program line. The conference agreement includes bill 
language which allows the Secretary to calculate fiscal year 
2004 State allotments using Census data utilized in making 
fiscal year 2003 State allotments and the most recent data 
reported by States for the number of immigrant children and 
youth. It is the intent of the conferees that data from the 
previous year only be used for determining allocations for 
fiscal year 2004 and that data from the American Community 
Survey will be available for determining the fiscal year 2005 
and subsequent years, allocations, as required by the No Child 
Left Behind Act.
      The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) calls for school 
districts to significantly accelerate English learners' 
progress towards achieving the Act's goals that 100 percent of 
all students reach proficient status or higher by 2013-2014. 
The conferees are concerned that for areas such as those in 
California, where the concentration of English language 
learners is high, this will be a challenge. The conferees are 
also aware that a number of regional educational offices have 
collaborated in an effort to ensure that the goals and 
requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act's English 
proficiency provisions will be met. The conferees strongly 
encourage the Department to provide support for regional 
educational initiatives that accelerate the academic progress 
of English language learners and recognize that local 
educational agencies with heavy concentrations of English 
learners are particularly challenged in meeting these 
requirements, with agencies in some cases having to double 
their instructional efforts to close the academic gap.

                           SPECIAL EDUCATION

      The conference agreement includes $11,307,072,000 for 
Special Education instead of $11,049,790,000 as proposed by the 
House and $12,227,464,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
agreement provides $5,894,072,000 in fiscal year 2004 and 
$5,413,000,000 in fiscal year 2005 funding for this account.
      Included in these funds is $10,129,398,000 for Grants to 
States part B instead of $9,874,398,000 as proposed by the 
House and $11,058,533,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conferees are concerned that the participation of students with 
disabilities in vocational educational programs has led to 
confusion regarding who is responsible for providing services 
and who is responsible for paying for these services. The 
conferees want to remind States and school districts that they 
have an obligation to ensure that the services outlined in a 
child's individualized education plan are provided in a timely 
manner, regardless of where the services are provided.
      The conference agreement includes $51,364,000 for State 
Program Improvement as proposed by the House instead of 
$44,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $78,589,000 for 
research and innovation instead of $77,210,000 as proposed by

            REHABILITATION SERVICES AND DISABILITY RESEARCH

      The conference agreement includes $3,013,305,000 for 
Rehabilitation Services and Disability Research instead of 
$2,999,165,000 as proposed by the House and $3,004,360,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees are disturbed by the Department's actions 
with respect to funds appropriated in last year's bill, which 
were to be used to improve the quality of applied orthotic and 
prosthetic research. The conferees understand that the 
Department made a decision to allow these funds to lapse, 
instead of obligating them for the specific purpose for which 
Congress intended them to be used. The Department's actions 
violated the clear, statutory intent of the Congress. The 
conferees note that these actions follow the Department's 
decision to ignore language in the Statement of the Managers 
accompanying the fiscal year 2002 appropriations bill which 
provided $1,000,000 for this same purpose. The conference 
agreement again includes $1,000,000 to continue the orthotic 
and prosthetic initiative that the Congress established in 
fiscal year 2002. The conferees intend that $1,000,000 included 
in the conference agreement shall be awarded to the American 
Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists (AAOP) for activities 
that further the purposes of the grant received by the Academy 
for the period beginning October 1, 2003. These funds are in 
addition to the original $993,500 grant received by the AAOP on 
October 1, 2003.
      The agreement also includes $23,930,000 for demonstration 
and training programs instead of $20,895,000 as proposed by 
both the House and the Senate. Within the amounts provided for 
vocational rehabilitation demonstration and training programs, 
the conference agreement includes funding for the following 
activities:

      The conference agreement includes $107,285,000 for the 
National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research 
instead of $110,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$109,285,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $26,097,000 for 
assistive technology instead of $11,132,000 as proposed by the 
House and $26,824,000 as proposed by the Senate. The agreement 
also includes language allowing States which have received 
assistive technology extension grants in the past and are 
scheduled to be phased out of the program to continue to 
receive an award in fiscal year 2004 at the fiscal year 2003 
level. This language is provided to allow time for the 
authorizing committees of jurisdiction to review the program in 
the context of reauthorizing the Assistive Technology Act. The 
conferees are aware that this program was originally designed 
to be ``seed money'' to develop assistive technology activities 
at the State level. The authorizing statute specifies that the 
State grant portion of the program would sunset after ten 
years, giving States time to develop their own programs in this 
area. The conferees note that more than $36,000,000 was awarded 
for grants under title III of the Assistive Technology Act, 
which will support authorized activities through at least 
fiscal year 2004 for all grantees. This conference agreement 
does not include additional funds for such activities, but the 
conferees intend to examine the performance outcomes achieved 
under this program and evaluate additional funding needed to 
continue authorized activities in the fiscal year 2005 budget 
process. The conferees support the goal of this program, which 
is to maximize the independence and participation in society by 
individuals with disabilities through the establishment or 
expansion of programs that fund alternatives to the traditional 
payment options of public assistance and self-financing so that 
individuals with disabilities can acquire assistive technology 
devices and services.

account.
      The conference agreement includes $1,202,100,000 for 
Vocational Education basic State grants instead of 
$1,200,000,000 as proposed by the House and $1,192,200,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $7,228,000 for Tribally 
Controlled Postsecondary Vocational Institutions instead of 
$7,500,000 as proposed by the Senate and $6,955,000 as proposed 
by the House. The agreement also includes language proposed by 
the Senate notwithstanding any other provision of law or any 
regulation that the Secretary of Education shall not require 
the use of a restricted indirect cost rate for grants issued 
pursuant to the tribally controlled postsecondary vocational 
and technical institutions program. The House did not contain 
this provision.
      The conference agreement includes $4,968,000 for the 
tech-prep education demonstration authorized under section 207 
of the Perkins Act as proposed by the Senate. The agreement 
also includes $9,438,000 to continue the occupational and 
employment information program as proposed by the Senate. The 
House did not include funding for these activities.
      The conference agreement includes $577,781,000 for adult 
education State grants instead of $584,300,000 as proposed by

agreement also includes $9,223,000 for adult education national 
leadership activities and $6,732,000 for the National Institute 
for Literacy as proposed by the Senate. The House proposed 
funding for these activities at $9,438,000 and $6,517,000, 
respectively.
      The conference agreement also includes $175,000,000 for 
the smaller learning communities program as proposed by the 
House instead of $160,947,000 as proposed by the Senate. As in 
past years, the conference agreement provides the funds on a 
forward funding basis and specifies that these funds shall be 
used only for activities related to the redesign of large high 
schools enrolling 1,000 or more students.
      The conference agreement includes $10,000,000 for 
community technology centers instead of $20,000,000 as proposed 
by the Senate. The House did not propose funding for this 
activity.

                      STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

      The conference agreement includes $14,090,430,000 for 
Student Financial Assistance instead of $14,247,432,000 as 
proposed by the House and $14,174,115,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The agreement provides a program level of $12,077,998,000 
for Pell Grants instead of $12,250,000,000 as proposed by the 
House and $12,176,683,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees continue to be concerned about issues 
within the consolidation loan program. The conferees are aware 
that some borrowers would like to see the current law changed 
to allow for consolidation with any lender or holder, 
regardless of how many lenders with whom the borrower has 
loans. The conferees are concerned that without change to the 
current law governing consolidation loans, some borrowers may 
not be permitted to consolidate their loans with any lender 
they choose. The leaders of the authorizing committees have 
expressed a desire to address this and other issues during the 
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act so as to address 
the Consolidation Loan Program as a whole. The conferees 
strongly urge those committees to take action quickly to ensure 
borrowers have the best options available to them in order to 
manage their student loan obligations.
      The conferees are aware that section 428H(d)(2) of the 
Higher Education Act permits the Secretary to increase 
unsubsidized loan limits, beyond those limits expressly 
contained in the Act, in cases where he determines that a 
higher amount is warranted in order to carry out the purpose of 
the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) with respect 
to students engaged in specialized training requiring 
exceptionally high costs of education. The conferees are also 
aware that in exercising this discretion, the Secretary has 
provided increased loan limits for students in numerous 
graduate and professional medical programs but has not done so 
for the comparable program of doctor of naturopathic medicine 
(ND). The conferees direct the Secretary to examine the 
borrowing needs of graduate naturopathic medical students to 
determine whether they should be given additional borrowing 
opportunities under the FFELP.

                       STUDENT AID ADMINISTRATION

      The conference agreement includes $118,010,000 for 
student aid administration instead of $120,010,000 as proposed 
by the House and $104,703,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                            HIGHER EDUCATION

House and $1,969,982,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Aid for Institutional Development
      The conference agreement includes $94,551,000 for 
Hispanic Serving Institutions as proposed by the Senate instead

Hawaiian Institutions as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$8,180,000 as proposed by the House.

strengthening tribal colleges and universities, instead of

proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree that the funds 
provided are to be used to support continuation of existing 
basic grants and new planning or implementation grant awards.

renovation and construction of facilities to help address 
urgently needed facilities repair and expansion.
International Education and Foreign Language Studies
      The conference agreement includes $89,740,000 for the 
domestic activities of the international education and foreign 
languages studies programs instead of $93,240,000 as proposed 
by the House and $86,240,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education
      The conference agreement includes $155,311,000 for the 
Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education instead of

Other Programs
      The conference agreement includes $837,500,000 for TRIO 
instead of $835,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$840,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      With regard to the GEAR UP program, the conferees concur 
in the administration's request to provide a sixth and final 
year award to grantees first funded in 1999, while continuing 
all other funded projects. The conferees also have provided 
funds above the fiscal year 2003 level and the budget request 
for the Department to fund a new grant competition under the 
GEAR UP program. The conferees believe that grants should not 
be ``front-loaded'', but instead should be awarded on an annual 
basis from the fiscal year 2004 and subsequent appropriations 
during the period of the grant, contingent upon grantee 
performance. The conferees note that grants were awarded using 
this approach during the first several years of the program. 
The conferees expect the Department to consult with them prior 
to the announcement of any new grant competition.
      The agreement also includes $41,000,000 for Byrd Honors 
Scholarships as proposed by the Senate instead of $40,734,000 
as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement also includes $89,415,000 for 
Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $90,000,000 as proposed by the House. The conference 
agreement includes $16,194,000 for the child care access 
program as proposed by the Senate instead of $15,000,000 as 
proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement does not include funding for 
Thurgood Marshall Scholarships as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $4,968,000 as proposed by the House. The agreement 
also includes $994,000 for Olympic Scholarships as proposed by 
the House. The Senate bill did not provide funding for this 
program.

                           Howard University

      The conference agreement includes $240,180,000 for Howard 
University instead of $242,770,000 as proposed by the House and 
$238,440,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                    Institute of Education Sciences

      The conference agreement includes $478,717,000 for 
Education Research, Statistics and Improvement instead of 
$500,599,000 as proposed by the House and $532,956,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees provide $166,500,000 for research instead 
of $185,000,000 as proposed by the House and $144,090,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conferees have provided at least 
$24,362,000 for the National Research and Development Centers 
program in recognition of the need for the Department of 
Education to implement the Education Sciences Reform Act of 
2002. The funding is sufficient to provide continued funding 
for current centers' awards as requested by the administration 
and an additional $5,000,000 to begin awarding new research and 
development centers in fiscal year 2004 in accordance with the 
requirements of section 133(c) of Public Law 107-279. The 
conferees expect the Department to implement the law by 
addressing the topics required in the statute, with particular 
attention to rural education.
      The conferees strongly support the premise that 
developing, identifying and implementing scientifically based 
research is critical to the success of the No Child Left Behind 
Act and to the increased effectiveness generally of education 
programs and interventions. In particular, the conferees 
believe that a greater focus must be placed on the use of 
randomized controlled trials, longitudinal studies, and other 
research that meets the standards set by the National Research 
Council. The development of an enhanced research infrastructure 
will help build a base of research-proven interventions that 
can be used by educational institutions to help improve the 
educational outcomes of our Nation's student population. The 
conferees note that there is a lack of scientifically based 
education research, such as randomized research trials.
      The conferees direct the Assistant Secretary for the 
Institute of Education Sciences to contract with the National 
Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of Science to 
undertake a study of teacher preparation programs in the United 
States. The conferees expect this study to synthesize data and 
research on the academic preparation and educational 
characteristics of candidates in pre-service, graduate, and 
alternative certification programs; the specific content and 
experiences that are provided to candidates for degrees and 
alternative certification in education; the consistency of the 
required course work and experiences in reading and mathematics 
across teacher preparation programs; and the degree to which 
the content and experiences are based on converging scientific 
evidence. If the NRC determines that there is insufficient 
information and research from which to generate a useful 
synthesis, it may engage in data collection, either by directly 
contracting with one or more organizations to design and 
implement surveys and other data collection activities, or by 
working collaboratively through the National Center for 
Education Statistics of the Institute of Education Sciences of 
the U.S. Department of Education, and/or the National Institute 
of Child Health and Human Development of the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services to enable data collections to support 
the work of the NRC.
      The NRC also should develop a model for collecting 
information on the content knowledge, pedagogical competence 
and effectiveness of graduates from teacher education programs 
and teachers trained in alternative certification programs, and 
review the needs of schools for high quality teachers, as 
called for in the No Child Left Behind Act. The conferees 
expect this work to be conducted for K-12 teachers with a focus 
on reading, mathematics, and science instruction.
      The conferees strongly urge the Department to launch a 
competition for new comprehensive centers, in accordance with 
title II, sections 203 and 205, of the Education Sciences 
Reform Act of 2002, as soon as possible. The competition cannot 
be held until the 10 regional advisory committees described in 
section 206 conduct needs assessments. Therefore, the conferees 
urge the Department to ensure that the committees complete 
their work by September 1, 2004.
      The conference agreement does not include funding for 
statewide data systems as proposed by the House. The Senate 
bill included $80,000,000 for this activity.
      The conference agreement also includes $92,208,000 for 
statistics instead of $95,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$89,415,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The agreement includes $90,235,000 for National 
Assessment activities as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$90,825,000 as proposed by the House. The agreement also 
includes $5,090,000 for the National Assessment Governing Board 
as proposed by the House instead of $4,532,000 as proposed by 
the Senate.

                        Departmental Management

      The conference agreement includes $425,000,000 for 
Departmental program administration instead of $434,494,000 as 
proposed by the House and $349,730,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The agreement also includes $89,275,000 for the Office 
for Civil Rights, instead of $91,275,000 as proposed by the 
House and $77,884,000 as proposed by the Senate. The agreement 
also includes $47,137,000 for the Office of the Inspector 
General instead of $48,137,000 as proposed by the House and 
$37,661,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees strongly support the Buy American Act, 
which was enacted in 1933 to ensure that the Federal government 
supports domestic companies and domestic workers by buying 
American-made goods. The Act includes a number of waiver 
provisions that allow Federal agencies to buy foreign goods in 
some circumstances, but there is little disclosure or 
accountability in the waiver process. The conferees, therefore, 
direct the Secretary to issue a report not later than 60 days 
after the last day of fiscal year 2004 on the amount of 
acquisitions made by the Department during such fiscal year of 
articles, materials, or supplies that were manufactured outside 
the United States. Such report shall separately indicate the 
dollar value of any articles, materials, or supplies purchased 
by the department that were manufactured outside the United 
States, an itemized list of all waivers under the Buy American 
Act (41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.) that were granted with respect to 
such articles, materials, or supplies, and a summary of total 
procurement funds spent on goods manufactured in the United 
States versus funds spent on goods manufactured outside of the 
United States.
      The conferees are concerned that Federal tax dollars not 
be spent to compete with private-sector businesses. The 
conferees expect the Department to be prepared to answer 
questions regarding this issue during the fiscal year 2005 
budget hearings.

collection systems), offset by a reduction to management and 
administration accounts at the Department of Education. The 
House bill contained no similar provision.

contained no similar provision.

                           Migrant Education

      The conference agreement does not include a provision

                     Study of Need Analysis Formula

      The conference agreement includes a provision directing 
the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance to 
conduct a thorough study of the feasibility of simplifying the 
need analysis methodology for all Federal student financial 
assistance programs and the process of applying for such 
assistance. The provision includes a postponement of any tax

                               Impact Aid

      The conference agreement includes a provision relating to 
the timely filing of an Impact Aid application from a school

provision.

                       TITLE IV--RELATED AGENCIES

             Corporation for National and Community Service

        DOMESTIC VOLUNTEER SERVICE PROGRAMS, OPERATING EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $356,443,000 for the 
Domestic Volunteer Service programs instead of $352,836,000 as 
proposed by the House and $355,187,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)
      The conference agreement includes $94,287,000 for VISTA 
as proposed by the Senate instead of $93,674,000 as proposed by 
the House.
Volunteers in Homeland Security
      The conference agreement includes $9,935,000 for 
Volunteers in Homeland Security as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $5,000,000 as proposed by the House.
National Senior Volunteer Corps
      The conference agreement includes $46,260,000 for the 
Senior Companion Program (SCP) as proposed by the House instead 
of $46,563,000 as proposed by the Senate. The agreement also 
includes $58,501,000 for the Retired Senior Volunteer Program 
(RSVP) as proposed by the House instead of $58,884,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Funds appropriated for fiscal year 2004 may not be used 
to implement or support service collaboration agreements or any 
other changes in the administration and/or governance of 
national service programs prior to passage of a bill by the 
authorizing committees of jurisdiction specifying such changes. 
The conference agreement does not include funding for senior 
demonstration activities. Both the House and the Senate funded 
this program at $397,000.
Program Administration
      The conference agreement includes $36,685,000 for program 
administration instead of $38,229,000 as proposed by the House 
and $34,346,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees have 
included funds to provide training and technical assistance to 
local projects in performance measurement as envisioned by the 
Government Performance and Results Act. The conferees are aware 
of concerns relating to performance measurements, and therefore 
direct the Corporation to continue to gather feedback for the 
Senior Corps national associations in order to develop the most 
appropriate and useful criteria.
      The conferees are aware of the Corporation's recent 
decision to make the director of the Iowa State office 
responsible for administration of the Nebraska State office as 
well. Over the past two years, the Senate Committee on 
Appropriations has clearly indicated its concern over such 
proposed consolidations, but the Committee was nonetheless 
informed that the consolidation was necessary due to budgetary 
constraints. The conferees are aware that employee bonuses in 
the Corporation's headquarters have more than doubled during 
the year this consolidation took place. In fact, the increase 
in bonuses was almost triple the amount needed to prevent this 
consolidation. The conferees are concerned that grantees and 
constituents in Iowa and Nebraska may receive a lowered level 
of service because of the distance and time involved in 
managing two State offices. For this reason, the conferees have 
included sufficient funding to maintain a separate State 
director in the Nebraska State office.

                  Corporation for Public Broadcasting

      The conference agreement provides $400,000,000 in funding 
for fiscal year 2006, as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$330,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conferees strongly urge the CPB to allocate a minimum 
of $100,000 in a Community Service Base Grant to each of the 14 
public radio stations around the Nation that provide the sole 
source of radio news and information in their communities. The 
additional funds would permit these stations to extend their 
broadcast hours and improve service to their listeners. 
Recipients of these grants should not be denied eligibility for 
any other CPB grant programs.
      The conference agreement also includes $50,000,000 for 
digital conversion instead of $55,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The House had proposed providing authority for CPB to 
utilize previously appropriated funds for this purpose.
      The conference agreement also includes $10,000,000 as the 
first installment of a three-year project to replace the 
satellite interconnection system. This amount is the same as 
the Senate. The House had proposed providing authority for CPB 
to utilize previously appropriated funds for this purpose.

                Institute of Museum and Library Services

      The conference agreement provides $262,596,000 for the 
Institute of Museum and Library Services instead of 
$238,126,000 as proposed by the House and $243,889,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Within the total for the Institute, the conference 
agreement includes funding for the following activities in the 
following amounts.

      The conferees direct the Institute to increase direct 
support for programs to improve textbooks, materials and other 
means of educational reform to teach Middle Eastern youth about 
nonviolent approaches to resolving intergenerational cycles of 
conflict and hatred, and ways that these cycles can be broken. 
The conferees direct the Institute to report to the Committees 
on Appropriations, by March 1, 2004, on their efforts in this 
area.

                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS

                         Adjustment of Advances

adjusting the amount of education funding advanced in the

                          CONFERENCE AGREEMENT

      The following table displays the amounts agreed to for 
each program, project or activity with appropriate comparisons:

                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004

                        Congressional Directives

      The conferees agree that Executive Branch propensities 
cannot substitute for Congress's own statements concerning the 
best evidence of Congressional intentions; that is, the 
official reports of the Congress. The committee of conference 
approves report language included by the House (House Report 
108-243) or the Senate (Senate Report 108-146) that is not 
changed by the conference. The statement of the managers, while 
repeating some report language for emphasis, is not intended to 
negate the language referred to above unless expressly provided 
herein.

                 TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

                        Office of the Secretary

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $80,903,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the office of the secretary instead of 
$94,077,000 as proposed by the House and $91,276,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. Bill language is included that 
specifies amounts by office, consistent with actions in prior 
years, and limits transfers among each office to no more than 5 
percent. The bill language specifies that any transfer greater 
than 5 percent shall be submitted for approval to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations. Bill language, as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate, allows the Department to 
spend up to $60,000 for official reception and representation 
activities, and credits to the appropriation up to $2,500,000 
in user fee receipts.
      The following table summarizes the appropriation for each 
office:

Immediate office of the Secretary.......................      $2,210,000
Immediate office of the Deputy Secretary................         700,000
Office of the General Counsel...........................      15,403,000
Under Secretary of Transportation for Policy............      12,312,000
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Budget and 
    Programs............................................       8,536,000
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Governmental 
    Affairs.............................................       2,300,000
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration....      24,612,000

Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization..       1,268,000
Office of the Chief Information Officer.................       7,500,000
Office of Intelligence and Security.....................       2,000,000

      Implementation of Air Transportation Safety and System 
Stabilization Act for cargo carriers.--The conferees expect 
that the Department would administer funds made available under 
title I of the Air Transportation Safety and System 
Stabilization Act without discrimination among directly 
competitive air carriers and note that comparable percentages 
of the notional maximum amount of compensation payable under 
section 103(b)(2) of that Act provides a credible check on the 
Department's allocation decisions. Further, the conferees 
expect that the Secretary will defer any final determination on 
disputed claims until the Comptroller General's review is 
completed, and would refer any remaining disputed claims to an 
administrative law judge upon an affected claimant's request. 
In addition, the Department is directed to provide the report 
requested by the Senate.
      Congressional justification materials.--The conferees 
direct the office of the secretary to submit its congressional 
justification materials in support of the individual offices of 
the offices of the secretary at the same level of detail 
provided in the congressional justifications presented in 
fiscal year 2003, and to submit annual Congressional budget 
justifications for each modal administration to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations on the date on which the 
President's budget is delivered officially to Congress.
      Office of Intelligence and Security.--The conferees 
acknowledge the mission of this office has changed 
significantly since enactment of the Aviation and 
Transportation Security Act. Consequently, the conferees direct 
the Secretary to submit, not later than March 1, 2004, a report 
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations describing 
in detail the organization, mission, and responsibilities of 
this office, as well as a five year projection of staffing and 
budget resources.
      Outstanding reports.--The conference agreement continues 
the longstanding policy expressed in the Senate report 
directing the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Budget and 
Programs to report quarterly on the status of all outstanding 
Congressional reports and reporting requirements, including the 
degree of delinquency of Congressionally requested reports and 
an estimated date for delivery. The conferees note that not 
only are many reports themselves late, but in fiscal year 2003, 
the quarterly compilation described herein was itself only 
submitted in one of four quarters required. The conferees will 
work with the office of the secretary to ensure that this 
situation improves in the coming year.
      Cyber threat intelligence.--The conferees recognize the 
importance of utilizing proactive cyber threat intelligence to 
protect the critical infrastructure assets of the department. 
The conferees encourage the department to deploy a performance-
based cyber threat intelligence service that contains the 
aggregation of known technical vulnerabilities, original 
technical vulnerability research, geopolitical cyber threat 
analysis, malicious code research and predictive cyber threat 
analysis. The conferees also recognize that many serious cyber 
attacks originate from non-English-speaking regions of the 
world. As such, the cyber threat intelligence services 
described above must include a demonstrated ability to collect 
cyber threat intelligence in multiple languages, including 
Arabic.
      Grant notifications to Congress.--The conferees agree 
that the report, directed by the Senate, submitting options for 
providing grant notifications in electronic format should be 
submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
not later than December 31, 2003.

      The conference agreement provides $52,000,000 for 
payments to air carriers, to be derived from the airport and 
airway trust fund, as proposed by the Senate. The House 
proposed $63,000,000 from the airport and airway trust fund 
under the Federal Aviation Administration. In addition to these 
funds, the program will receive $50,000,000 in mandatory 
spending pursuant to the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 
1996, resulting in a program budget of $102,000,000. Funding is 
to be derived from the airport and airway trust fund and is 
available until expended, as proposed by both the House and 
Senate.

proposed by the Senate. Of the total amount provided, 
$4,500,000,000 is to be derived from the airport and airway 
trust fund instead of $4,043,000,000 proposed by the House and 
$6,000,000,000 proposed by the Senate. Funds are distributed in 
the bill by budget activity, as proposed by the Senate.
      Contract tower cost-sharing.--The bill specifies 
$6,500,000 for continuation of the contract tower cost-sharing 
program as proposed by the Senate instead of $7,500,000 as 
proposed by the House.
      Rule implementing exemption process for mandatory 
retirement.--The conference agreement includes language 
proposed by the House requiring the Secretary of Transportation 
to issue, not later than March 1, 2004, final regulations 
establishing an exemption process for individual air traffic 
controllers to delay mandatory retirement until not later than 
age 61. The Senate bill included no similar provision.
      Level of operational air traffic control supervisors.--
The conference agreement includes language proposed by the 
House specifying that $4,000,000 of funds under this heading 
are available only to raise the level of operational air 
traffic control supervisors to 1,726. The Senate bill included 
no similar provision.
      Memoranda of understanding.--The conference agreement 
modifies language proposed by the House related to the 
implementation of memoranda of understanding or memoranda of 
agreement between FAA and its bargaining units. The 
modification would prohibit funds from continuing to implement 
an existing MOU or MOA if such documents are not filed in a 
central registry after January 1, 2004.
      Administration of government credit cards.--The agreement 
includes language proposed by the House related to FAA 
management of government credit cards. The Senate bill included 
no similar provision.

      Deployable flight incident recorders.--The conferees are 
aware of technology that makes flight data recorders, cockpit 
voice recorders, and emergency locator transmitters more 
survivable and recoverable, such as through systems integrating 
these devices into one unit combined with crash sensors, 
allowingthem to eject automatically from an aircraft upon 
impact and thus delivering them safely away from the impact site. The 
conferees encourage the FAA to investigate and consider implementing 
regulations that incorporate such systems into the commercial air 
traffic fleet.
      Commercial space launch regulations.--For over four 
decades, the U.S. Air Force has supervised commercial space 
launch operations at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and other 
federal ranges, resulting in an impeccable safety record. The 
conferees have been advised that the FAA is considering 
commercial space launch regulations, and are concerned that the 
FAA not introduce new regulations that are unnecessary, 
duplicative, or which introduce undue costs relative to 
existing Air Force regulations on this industry.
      Non-precision GPS approaches.--The conference agreement 
provides an additional $3,000,000 to continue work to develop 
and publish an increased number of non-precision instrument 
approaches for airports that are not part 139 certified.
      International Summit on Aviation Safety and Security.--
The conferees acknowledge the success of the International 
Summit on Aviation Safety and Security established by the 
George Washington University, and urge the FAA to continue 
funding as long as the agency believes that it enhances 
aviation safety and security.
      Administration of potential shortfall due to essential 
air service transfer.--The conferees agree that the FAA 
Administrator has the flexibility to propose the use of funds 
in either the ``Operations'' or ``Facilities and equipment'' 
appropriations to address any shortfalls in essential air 
service funding for which FAA resources are required under 
existing law. The Administrator is directed to advise the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the appropriations 
and programs from which these funds would be drawn.

                        FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT

                    (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement includes $2,910,000,000 for 
``Facilities and equipment'', instead of $2,900,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $2,916,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Of the total amount available, $420,841,200 is 
available for one year, and $2,489,158,800 is available for 
three years. The bill specifies that, of the total funding 
provided, $3,000,000 is for audit services to be performed by 
the Defense Contract Audit Agency, instead of $7,000,000 as 
proposed by the House; and $25,000,000 is for the Houston area 
air traffic system, instead of $20,000,000 as proposed by the 
House. The conference agreement does not include the 
$100,000,000 proposed by the Senate for transfer to the 
``Grants-in-aid for airports'' program. Funds for this program 
are provided in their entirety under ``Grants-in-aid for 
airports''.
      The following table provides a breakdown of the House and 
Senate bills and the conference agreement by program:

      Precision runway monitors.--The conferees expect the FAA 
to proceed with the acquisition, installation, and operation of 
a precision runway monitor at Cleveland Hopkins International 
Airport. The City of Cleveland has devoted significant time and 
effort to facilitate the acquisition of a PRM system to 
complement runway improvements at the airport. Because the PRM 
is a key component of the overall modernization effort, the 
conferees expect FAA to proceed expeditiously with this project 
to ensure the PRM is operational when the new runway opens in 
the year 2004.
      Advanced technology development and prototyping.--The 
conference agreement includes $70,100,000 for advanced 
technology development and prototyping instead of $52,600,000 
as proposed by the House and $76,600,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The following table compares the conference agreement 
to the House and Senate bills by budget activity:

      Airport research.--Of the $12,000,000 provided, 
$4,000,000 is for the airfield improvement program under 
section 905 of Public Law 106-181 and to expand the program to 
include asphalt; and $1,500,000 is to continue evaluation of 
the runway obstruction warning system at Gulfport-Biloxi 
Airport, MS, as proposed by the Senate.
      Automated airborne flight alert system.--The conference 
agreement provides $3,000,000 for the Automated Airborne Flight 
Alert System (AAFAS). The AAFAS program is a demonstration of a 
prototype rapid response capability to transmit flight data 
from commercial-type aircraft using data management and 
communications equipment already installed on most modern 
aircraft through software modernization. The conferees agree 
that the funding is a continuation of previous AAFAS work 
presently underway.
      Pulsed fast neutron analysis.--The conferees agree to 
provide $4,000,000 for a demonstration of pulsed fast neutron 
analysis technology at George W. Bush Intercontinental Airport 
in Houston, Texas, instead of $7,500,000 proposed by the 
Senate. The conferees direct FAA to provide a status report on 
this demonstration to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations no later than July 1, 2004.
      Standard terminal automation replacement system 
(STARS).--In a recent audit, the Inspector General has raised 
several concerns over the deployment strategy for the STARS 
system, and has recommended that the FAA perform detailed life 
cycle cost analyses justifying the costs and benefits of 
replacing the common ARTS sites with STARS. While the conferees 
support the STARS program, it is not clear at this time whether 
the most cost-effective strategy would result in an all-STARS 
deployment, or one where common ARTS and STARS are both 
maintained in the national airspace system. The conferees 
direct the agency not to obligate the government contractually 
during fiscal year 2004 to actions which would involve 
replacement of common ARTS systems or ARTS color displays until 
the Inspector General reviews and validates the life cycle cost 
studies and other relevant analyses provided to FAA's Joint 
Resources Council to justify and rebaseline the program. 
However, this does not prohibit the agency from including such 
activities in contract options that the agency could exercise 
after full review and approval is received. The conferees are 
neutral on the issue of STARS deployment, and await the FAA's 
detailed analyses and the Inspector General's review.
      En route automation.--The conferees provide $307,700,000 
for en route automation, a reduction of $40,000,000 below the 
budget estimate. The conferees agree that this program requires 
close scrutiny, including the IG review directed by the Senate.
      Approach lighting system improvement program.--The 
conference agreement for this program shall be distributed as

      Oceanic automation system.--The conferees agree to an IG 
audit of this program, as proposed by the Senate, but direct 
the IG to compare FAA's pursuitof oceanic automation 
capabilities not only to the experience of NavCanada, but to 
Airservices Australia and other major oceanic ATC service providers.
      New York integrated control complex.--The conferees agree 
to provide $5,000,000 for continued analysis of a New York 
integrated control complex as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$2,000,000 proposed by the House. While the conferees support 
further analysis of this potential consolidation, such project 
should not receive higher funding or schedule priority than the 
Houston area air traffic system, which preceded it in time and 
is projected to provide significant benefit to air traffic in 
that region. Given future budget constraints, it is likely that 
the agency will have to phase consolidation projects, no matter 
how meritorious. First funding priority should be given to the 
Houston project, which is already underway.
      Determination of operations versus capital budgeting.--
The House and Senate Committees have noted several instances 
this year of activities budgeted in the capital appropriation 
that appear to be ongoing operating expenses. In many cases, 
these expenses have been either denied or transferred to the 
operations budget. While the conferees understand there is 
significant pressure on FAA's operating budget, those pressures 
should be addressed by controlling or avoiding the expenses 
directly, rather than by transferring them to another account. 
To gain further insight into this issue, the conferees direct 
the U.S. General Accounting Office to conduct an audit of FAA's 
policies for determining when an expense should be budgeted in 
the operating budget or the capital budget. This should include 
a detailed look at policies and practices for budgeting 
personnel compensation, benefits, travel, and related expenses 
in the capital budget. In addition, the conferees request the 
GAO to compare these policies to those of the Department of 
Defense and other civilian agencies with large acquisition 
budgets. This report should be submitted to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations by April 15, 2004.
      Free flight phase one.--The conferees believe that some 
of the activities presented under this program appear to be for 
sustaining engineering or similar operating expenses. The 
conferees encourage FAA to include those expenses in the 
agency's operating budget in future budget requests.
      Global communication, navigation, and surveillance 
systems initiative.--The conference agreement includes 
$20,000,000 for the global communication, navigation, and 
surveillance systems (GCNSS) initiative. The conferees direct 
the FAA to submit a report on this initiative to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than March 31, 
2004. The report should detail the status of planned fiscal 
year 2004 activities for the program as well as the anticipated 
future funding requirements for this initiative.
      VOR/DME.--The conferees agree that, of the funds provided 
for VOR/DME, the following allocations shall be made, as 
proposed by the House: Sarasota/Bradenton International 
Airport, FL (relocate VORTAC, including land acquisition), 
$4,500,000; John F. Kennedy Memorial Airport, WI (install VOR 
and DME), $400,000; and Rice Lake Regional Airport, WI (install 
VOR and DME), $400,000.
      Facilities at the FAA Technical Center.--The conferees 
request the FAA Administrator to submit a report to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations, no later than February 
15, 2004, concerning the status of civil aviation security 
research and development facilities at the FAA Technical 
Center. The report should address any facilities or space 
formally transferred to the Department of Homeland Security as 
well as cost savings attributable to such transfer. The 
responsibilities for civil aviation security were largely 
transferred to DHS in 2001. Although the FAA had several 
security-related facilities at the FAA Technical Center, it is 
not yet clear from budget documentation whether appropriate 
facilities costs and support costs have been adjusted to 
reflect the transfer of this mission.
      Facility security risk management.--The conferees are not 
clear why this program has such a large unobligated balance, 
given the agency's internal reprogramming of funds to 
accelerate these projects in late 2001 and supplemental funding 
provided in the same year. The FAA is directed to provide a 
report, no later than January 15, 2004, to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations explaining the cause of the 
unobligated balance and the agency's plan to eliminate it. 
Considering this backlog, the conference agreement provides 
$30,000,000 as proposed by the House instead of $36,900,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      DCAA audits.--The conferees share the concern of the 
House that FAA should not be curtailing Defense Contract Audit 
Agency (DCAA) audits when ongoing programs still suffer major 
cost overruns and billing disputes. When this responsibility 
was transferred to individual modes from the Office of 
Inspector General a few years ago, the IG warned that agencies 
should not be allowed to reduce or eliminate those audits. 
Unfortunately, due to lax management the agency has done just 
that. The conferees re-emphasize to FAA that these valuable 
audits should be increased and used on most, if not all, major 
acquisition programs of the agency. The conference agreement 
includes $3,000,000 solely for this purpose.

                              (RESCISSION)

      The conference agreement includes a rescission of 
unobligated balances from ``Facilities and equipment'' of 
$30,000,000. The Secretary is directed to advise the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations on the distribution of this 
rescission prior to its implementation.

                 Research, Engineering, and Development

                    (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement provides $119,439,000 for 
research, engineering, and development instead of $108,000,000 
as proposed by the House and $118,939,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The following table compares the conference agreement 
to the budget estimate and the House and Senate bills by budget

                      (LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)

                    (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement includes a liquidating cash 
appropriation of $3,400,000,000, as proposed by the Senate. The 
House had no similar appropriation.
      Obligation limitation.--The conferees agree to an 
obligation limitation of $3,400,000,000 for the ``Grants-in-aid 
for airports'' program as proposed by the Senate. The House 
bill contained no similar limitation.
      Administration.--The conference agreement includes a 
limitation on administrative expenses of $66,254,000 instead of 
$66,638,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement 
distributes funding as follows:

        Activity                                                  Amount

                    ____________________________________________________
      Total.............................................      66,254,000

      Small community air service development pilot program.--
The bill includes $20,000,000 under the obligation limitation 
to continue the small community air service development pilot 
program, as proposed by the Senate. The House had no similar 
funding. This is consistent with actions taken in fiscal years 
2002 and 2003.
      Installation of bulk explosive detection systems.--The 
bill includes a provision proposed by the Senate prohibiting 
funds for the replacement of baggage conveyor systems, 
reconfiguration of terminal baggage areas, or other airport 
improvements necessary to install bulk explosive detection 
systems. Funding responsibility for these activities has now 
transferred to the Department of Homeland Security.
      San Diego Airport.--The conferees remain concerned over 
the Air Transportation Action Plan (ATAP) site selection 
process being conducted by the San Diego County Regional 
Airport Authority. The authority has selected sites for review 
without considering whether the potential sites are even 
available. Of particular concern, most of the selected sites 
are important active military installations which are 
unavailable for civilian use.
      Priority consideration for letters of intent.--The 
conferees agree that FAA should give priority consideration to 
letter or intent applications for improvement projects at Gary/
Chicago Airport and Birmingham International Airport during 
fiscal year 2004.
      High priority projects.--Of the funds covered by the 
obligation limitation in this bill, the conferees direct FAA to 
provide not less than the following funding levels, out of 
available resources, for the following projects in the 
corresponding amounts. The conferees agree that state 
apportionment funds may be construed as discretionary funds for 
the purposes of implementing this provision. To the maximum 
extent possible, the administrator should work to ensure that 
airport sponsors for these projects first use available 
entitlement funds to finance the projects. However, the FAA 
should not require sponsors to apply carryover entitlements to 
discretionary projects funded in the coming year, but only 
those entitlements applicable to the fiscal year 2004 
obligation limitation. The conferees further direct that the 
specific funding allocated above shall not diminish or 
prejudice the application of a specific airport or geographic 
region to receive other AIP discretionary grants or multiyear 
letters of intent.
      Airports to receive priority consideration for grant 
funding.--The conferees agree that Slidell Airport, LA and 
Paulding County Airport, GA are to be given priority 
consideration for discretionary grant funding by the FAA during 
fiscal year 2004.

      Alaska statewide airport improvement program.--The 
conferees are aware of plans for a floatplane airport to be 
located in the Matanuska Susitna Borough. Within the funds 
provided to the State of Alaska for various airport 
improvements, the managers expect $2,000,000 to be made 
available for this facility once it has received the necessary 
approvals.

                   AVIATION INSURANCE REVOLVING FUND

      The conference agreement deletes language proposed by the 
Senate authorizing funds for aviation insurance activities 
under 49 U.S.C. 443 (``war risk insurance''). This 
authorization is no longer needed for the orderly execution of 
the program.

          General Provisions--Federal Aviation Administration

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the House prohibiting funds for engineering work related to an 
additional runway at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International 
Airport in Louisiana.
      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the House prohibiting funds for FAA to mandate without-cost 
space, utilities, or other items in airport sponsor-owned 
buildings. The Senate had a nearly identical provision with a 
technical difference in wording.
      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the House prohibiting funds to change weight restrictions or 
prior permission rules at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. The 
Senate bill contained a nearly identical provision under 
section 534.
      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate authorizing the FAA Administrator to accept funds

the Senate specifiying that, of funds provided for FAA 
``Facilities and equipment'', $2,000,000 is for air traffic 
control facilities at the John C. Stennis International Airport 
in Mississippi. Funding for this project has been provided 
under ``Facilities and equipment''.

                     FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION

                 Limitation on Administrative Expenses

      The conference agreement limits administrative expenses 
of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to $337,604,000 
instead of $359,458,000 as proposed by the House and 
$337,834,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides that $7,000,000 shall 
be made available under section 104(a)(1)(A) of title 23, 
U.S.C. to carry out environmental streamlining activities.
      The conferees recommend the following adjustments to the 
budget request by program and activity:

Employee development....................................     -$4,606,000

FECA administrative costs...............................         -84,000

      Employee multidisciplinary development program.--Instead 
of providing $4,606,000 for the employee development program, 
the conference agreement provides these funds for the employee 
multidisciplinary development program, as directed in the House 
report. The conference agreement directs FHWA to provide a 
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by 
March 15, 2004 on this new program. The report should include 
the goal of the program, what activities it will support, how 
many employees are expected to participate, how employees are 
selected for the program, and how it is different from the 
employee development program funding in prior years.
      Information technology planning.--The conference 
agreement provides $20,869,000 for information technology 
equipment, security, and support, instead of $21,369,000 as

the conference agreement directs FHWA to provide a report to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on 
intelligent bridge systems no later than March 1, 2004.
      Public lands.--The conference agreement includes language 
directing that funds allocated to FHWA's public lands 
discretionary program be derived from that program and not from 
funds allocated to the National Park Service's regions, as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate. In addition, the 
conferees direct that these funds not come from funds allocated 
to the Fish and Wildlife Service's regions, as proposed by the 
House.
      I-66 westbound widening from Rosslyn Tunnel to Dulles 
Connector, Virginia.--The conference agreement provides that as 
of June 1, 2004, unobligated funds for the I-66 westbound 
widening from Rosslyn tunnel to Dulles Connector under the

be available to the Route 7 Widening project in Fairfax County, 
Virginia.
      Miller Creek Bridge project.--The conference agreement 
directs FHWA to apply remaining funds provided in P.L. 107-87 
for the environmental clearance process for the Miller Creek 
Bridge Project in Montana to final design, right of way 
acquisition, construction and construction engineering 
activities.
      Alaskan Way Viaduct, Washington.--The conference 
agreement includes Senate language encouraging FHWA to work 
with state and local officials to determine the amount of 
emergency relief funds that should be committed to the Alaskan 
Way Viaduct project.
      I-80 Colfax Narrows project.--The conference agreement 
includes $2,000,000 for the rehabilitation and reconstruction 
of a portion of the Interstate highway connecting eastern 
California and western Nevada in Placer County, CA. The states 
have been advancing the project and this funding will move the 
multi-year project into the next stage of development. The 
funds will be provided to the project by agreement with Nevada 
to improve the safety and reduce congestion on this section of 
Interstate highway.
      U.S. Highway 67/167, North Little Rock, Arkansas.--The 
conferees recognize the potential for economic development in 
the North Hills area of North Little Rock. In order to 
alleviate congestion problems that would hinder that 
development, the conferees direct the Federal Highway 
Administration to work with the Arkansas Highway and 
Transportation Department and the City of North Little Rock to 
develop a plan for southbound access from U.S. Highway 67/167 
near the intersection of Interstate 30 and Interstate 40 in 
North Little Rock, AR no later than March 1, 2004.

                 Limitation on Transportation Research

ITS Deployment incentive program........................     122,000,000
      Total.............................................     232,000,000

      Joint Program Office.--In the early 1990s, the 
appropriations committees expressed strong support for the 
formulation of a Joint Program Office (JPO) within the DOT to 
oversee the Federal role in the National Intelligent 
Transportation system (ITS) effort. This office, which is 
located within the Federal Highway Administration, now provides 
overall program direction and budget coordination among the 
multiple DOT offices conducting ITS activities. The success of 
the Federal investment in ITS has been due partly to the 
effective functioning of the JPO. For example, the JPO's close 
association with FHWA's research, headquarters staff, and 
regional offices has ensured a unified approach to providing 
training, implementing and testing standards, and adhering to a 
national systems architecture. The conferees maintain that the 
JPO's positive working relationship with the FMCSA and FTA has 
facilitated progress in advancement of technologies and the 
deployment of activities.
      The appropriation for ITS provided by the conferees is 
predicated on the continuation of the JPO conducting the 
functions identified previously. Maximum efficiencies are most 
likely to be obtained by retaining the current administrative 
structure of the JPO within the FHWA with a reporting function 
to the Deputy Secretary. If there is any change in the 
administrative structure or responsibilities of the JPO, the 
Secretary is directed to inform the House and Senate Committees 
on Appropriations and to justify in detail such changes.

systems deployment, the conferenceagreement provides that not 
less than the following sums shall be available for intelligent

              FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION

                          Motor Carrier Safety

                 Limitation on Administrative Expenses

                          (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement includes $176,070,000 for 
administrative expenses of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA) under the FMCSA limitation on 
administrative expenses (LAE) account. The House and Senate 
bills proposed $92,712,176 and $292,972,233, respectively for 
both administrative expenses plus five grant programs. The 
conference agreement provides funding for these grant programs 
under a miscellaneous appropriations within the Federal Highway 
Administration appropriation, and provides funding under 
FMCSA's LAE in the following manner:

Safety is good business.................................        $250,000
Crash data improvements.................................       5,000,000
Conditional carrier review..............................       2,000,000
Household goods enforcement.............................         920,000
Hotline.................................................         375,000
Research and technology.................................       7,000,000
Regulatory development..................................       9,500,000
Information management..................................      11,843,000
Administrative infrastructure...........................       7,000,000

      Safety is good business program.--The conference 
agreement provides $250,000 for the safety is good business 
program, consistent with the House. The Senate proposed 
$500,000. The conference agreement retains language contained 
in the House report that FMCSA should first use this funding to 
develop a goal and initiatives that are directly related to 
that goal.
      Conditional carrier review.--The conference agreement 
provides $2,000,000 for conditional carrier reviews as proposed 
by the Senate. The House report provided $1,334,000.
      Household goods enforcement.--The conference agreement 
provides $920,000 for the household goods enforcement program, 
instead of $896,000 as proposed by the House and $1,370,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. This level provides adequate funding 
for the seven requested positions at half-year levels.
      Research and technology.--The conference agreement 
provides $7,000,000 for motor carrier safety research and 
technology, consistent with both the House and Senate 
proposals. The conference retains language directing FMCSA to 
submit a 5-year research and development strategic plan to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than 
June 15, 2004, as proposed by the Senate.
      Regulatory development.--The conference agreement 
provides $9,500,000 for regulatory development instead of 
$11,000,000 proposed by the House and $8,000,000 proposed by 
the Senate.
      Information management.--The conference agreement 
provides a total program level of $11,843,000 for information 
management, an increase of $2,500,000 from the fiscal year 2003 
level. The House bill proposed $13,500,000 and the Senate bill 
proposed $10,398,000.
      Administrative infrastructure.--The conference agreement 
provides $7,000,000 for administrative infrastructure instead 
of $4,423,000 as proposed by the House and $10,423,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Share the road safely program.--Consistent with the 
Senate, the conference agreement does not provide funding for 
the share the road safely program. Funding for this program is 
provided under the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration appropriation. The House proposed $500,000 for 
this program.
      PATRIOT ACT (CDL background checks).--The conference 
agreement, consistent with both the House and Senate, does not 
provide funding for CDL background checks as this 
responsibility has been transferred to the Department of 
Homeland Security.
      State grants.--In addition to the $176,070,000 provided 
under the limitation on administrative expenses, the conference 
agreement includes a total of $111,500,000 for Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration programs under the Federal 
Highway Administration miscellaneous appropriation from the 
Highway Trust Fund (other than the mass transit account). Both 
the House and Senate bills proposed funding these programs from 
within FMCSA's limitation onadministrative expenses. The 
conference agreement provides the funds in the following manner:

        Program                                               Conference
New entrant program--State grants \1\...................      $8,000,000
New entrant program--Federal portion \1\................       3,500,000
Southern border inspection facilities...................      47,000,000
Commercial driver's license improvement grants..........      21,000,000
Southern border operations grants.......................      23,000,000
Northern border truck inspection grants.................       9,000,000

\1\ This reflects a portion of the total $28,500,000 provided for the 
new entrant program. Of this amount, $25,000,000 is provided for grants 
to states, and $3,500,000 is for Federal responsibilities associated 
with the program.

      New entrant program.--The conference agreement provides a 
total of $28,500,000 for the new entrant program. The 
conference reiterates the decision contained in both the House 
and Senate reports that the majority of funding for this 
program is in the form of state grants, and therefore retains 
only $3,500,000 for oversight and other Federal 
responsibilities. The House proposed $2,200,000 for the Federal 
portion of this program and the Senate proposed $4,456,000. In 
addition, $8,000,000 in state grants is provided under the 
Federal Highway Administration miscellaneous appropriations, 
and an additional $17,000,000 is provided for state grants 
under the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. The 
conference retains language directing FMCSA to submit a new 
entrant program implementation plan to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations no later than 90 days after 
enactment of this Act.
      Hazardous materials permitting program.--The conference 
agreement provides $1,050,000 for the hazardous materials 
permitting program, instead of $1,135,000 provided by the House 
and $2,000,000 provided by the Senate. This amount is adequate 
to fund the 13 requested positions at half-year levels.
      Commercial drivers license program.--Consistent with both 
the House and Senate, the conference agreement provides 
$21,000,000 for the commercial driver's license improvement 
grants program. The conference agreement retains the House 
language that encourages FMCSA to continue working with the 
American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the 
Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, lead MCSAP agencies and 
licensing agencies to improve all aspects of the CDL program. 
In addition, FMCSA should consider sponsoring another pilot 
project involving law enforcement and driver licensing agencies 
to explore new and innovative ways to ensure that drivers who 
have been convicted of a disqualifying offense do not operate 
during the period of suspension or revocation. Finally, FMCSA 
should continue to support the judicial and prosecutorial 
outreach effort.
      Southern border inspection facilities.--Consistent with 
the Senate bill, the conference agreement provides $47,000,000 
to construct truck inspection facilities at the Southern 
border. The House bill contained no similar appropriation.
      Southern border operations grants.--Consistent with both 
the House and Senate bills, the conference agreement provides 
$23,000,000 for southern border operations grants.
      Northern border inspection grants.--Consistent with both 
the House and Senate bills, the conference agreement provides 
$9,000,000 in northern border truck inspections grants.
      Border enforcement.--The conference agreement provides 
$121,908,000 in border funding, of which $47,000,000 is for 
infrastructure improvements, $32,000,000 is for state 
operations grants, and $42,908,000 is for personnel and 
enforcement operations. The conference agreement retains 
language proposed by the Senate directing FMCSA to establish a 
process to effectively enforce and monitor Mexican motor 
carriers and report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations within one year after the date of enactment of 
this Act.

                 National Motor Carrier Safety Program

                (LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)

                          (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement provides a liquidating cash 
appropriation of $190,000,000 for the national motor carrier 
safety program as proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                      (LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)

       The conference agreement includes a limitation on 
obligations of $190,000,000 for motor carrier safety grants as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.
       The conference agreement provides funding for the 
national motor carrier safety program as follows:

                                                                  Amount

    Data analysis and information systems...............    (14,000,000)
    Implementation of PRISM.............................     (5,000,000)
    Driver programs.....................................     (1,000,000)

\1\ Does not include $8,000,000 provided under FHWA's miscellaneous 
appropriation and $3,500,000 provided under FMCSA's LAE.

      Solid Waste Shippers.--From funds provided for the high 
priority initiative program, the conference agreement directs 
FMCSA to evaluate the effectiveness of the Final Rule on cargo 
securement for containing solid waste (including sewage sludge 
and combustion ash), both in container and flat bed surface 
transport. The analysis shall include safety, economic, and 
environmental considerations, and shall be provided to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by October 15, 
2004.
      Hazmat tracking system.--As proposed by the Senate, the 
conference agreement directs $2,000,000 from funds provided for 
the high priority initiative program for an expanded satellite-
based, mobile communications system to monitor and track 
hazardous material and high-value cargo in uncovered areas of 
the United States.
      Operation Respond.--As proposed by the Senate, the 
conference agreement provides $1,000,000 from funds provided 
for the high priority initiative program, to design, build and 
demonstrate the benefits of a seamless hazardous materials 
incident detection, management, and response system, including 
the expansion of the Operation Respond network. The conferees 
urge that these funds be used to establish a national first 
responders emergency services network and to accelerate 
deployment of Operation Respond software.
      New Hampshire study.--As proposed by the House, the 
conference agreement provides $250,000 from funds provided for 
the high priority initiative program, to the New Hampshire 
Department of Transportation to conduct a study to evaluate the 
safety, economic and infrastructure impacts of a weight limit 
exemption on Interstates 89 and 93.
      Surge Brakes.--The Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA) prohibits surge brakes for use in 
interstate commerce. Since private vehicles are not subject to 
this prohibition, it causes administrative enforcement and 
safety problems for rental businesses and their consumers. The 
conference agreement directs FMCSA to determine, within 90 days 
of enactment of this Act, if it should initiate a rulemaking to 
consider permitting the use of surge brakes on small and medium 
trailers used in interstate commerce.

    General Provisions--Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration

      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
130) subjecting funds appropriated in this Act to the terms and 
conditions of section 350 of Public Law 107-87, including that 
the Secretary submit a report on Mexico-domiciled motor 
carriers. This provision was proposed by both the House and Senate.
      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
131) prohibiting the use of funds in this Act to implement or 
enforce any provision of the Final Rule issued on April 16, 
2003 as it applies to operators of utility service vehicles and 
as it applies to motion picture and television production 
drivers working at a site within 100 air mile radius of the 
reporting location.

$148,102,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The agreement includes a provision carried since fiscal 
year 1996 that prohibits NHTSA from obligating or expending 
funds to plan, finalize, or implement any rulemakings that 
would add requirements pertaining to tire grading standards 
that are not related to safety performance. This provision was

      Workforce planning and development.--The conference 
agreement provides no funding for workforce planning and 
development, as proposed by both the House and Senate.
      Training and technical assistance to the states.--The 
conferees encourage NHTSA to conduct a comprehensive review of 
the agency's training programs, including an evaluation of 
other models and different media for improving the professional 
capabilities of State grantees, as proposed by the Senate. In 
addition, the conferees direct NHTSA to develop and implement 
two new State training courses, as proposed by the Senate, and 
$200,000 is provided for this purpose. One training course 
should be designed to strengthen the ability of State highway 
safety offices to analyze data and identify State and local 
behavioral highway safety programs. The second course should 
provide hands-on experience for State highway safety offices on 
how to conduct evaluations or reviews of program performance.
      Regulatory activities.--The conferees direct NHTSA to 
update their self-imposed regulatory activities plan by 
December 1, 2003, as proposed by the House. NHTSA should 
include public comments that have been received, as well as new 
data and research results. This plan should be submitted 
through correspondence to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations and posted on NHTSA's website.

      Budget justification.--Within the fiscal year 2005 budget 
request, NHTSA is directed to include information on 
expenditures on impaired driving, motorcycle, and national 
occupant protection programs from fiscal year 2003 and 
estimated plans for fiscal year 2004, as proposed by the House. 
This information should also describe which activities are 
based on proven research and implementation strategies.
      Impaired driving.--The conferees direct NHTSA to submit a 
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, no 
later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, detailing 
strategies and activities that will be utilized in fiscal year 
2004 with regard to targeting specific populations in impaired 
driving efforts, as proposed by the Senate.
      In addition, the conferees direct NHTSA to explore 
whether there is a more fitting theme for the impaired driving 
program than ``You Drink and Drive, You Lose,'' and to report 
findings and recommendations to the House and Senate 
Appropriations Committees in a letter by January 30, 2004, as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Occupant protection.--Within the amount provided for 
occupant protection programs, the conference agreement provides 
$3,000,000 for outreach initiatives to increase seat belt use, 
as proposed by the Senate.
      Within the amount provided for national impaired driving 
programs, the conference agreement provides $4,500,000 for 
impaired driving activities, as proposed by the Senate:

Judicial/prosecutorial initiative.......................      $1,500,000
Repeat offender tracking model..........................       2,000,000
Target population outreach..............................       1,000,000

      The conferees direct NHTSA to refrain from obligating 
funds provided in fiscal year 2003 (Public Law 108-7) for 
judicial and prosecutorial awareness until the required report 
is submitted to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, as proposed by the Senate.
      Traffic law enforcement.--The conferees strongly support 
NHTSA's law enforcement liaison (LEL) program, believing that 
high-visibility enforcement of highway traffic safety programs 
is integral to improving the safety on the nation's roads. The 
LEL function is largely responsible for the implementation of 
specific enforcement programs and mobilizations relating to the 
highly successful Click It or Ticket program as well as the You 
Drink and Drive, You Lose initiative. Both of these programs 
must have an enforcement component to ensure their success, and 
the LELs interact with the law enforcement community to promote 
the enforcement components of these programs. In fiscal year 
2003, NHTSA spent approximately $561,000 to fund LEL programs 
in eight of the ten regions. The conferees encourage NHTSA to 
increase this support in fiscal year 2004 and to strive to 
expand the presence of this program to all ten regions.
      Emergency medical services.--Within the amount provided 
for emergency medical services, the conference agreement 
provides $1,000,000 for training EMS personnel in delivering 
pre-hospital care to patients with traumatic brain injuries, as 
proposed by the Senate. An additional $1,000,000 is also 
provided for research at the USA Center for the Study of Rural 
Vehicular Trauma, as proposed by the Senate.
      Records and licensing.--Within the amount provided for 
records and licensing, the conference agreement provides 
$1,000,000 for a digital watermarking technology pilot program 
to easily determine the authenticity of State-issued IDs, as 
proposed by the Senate, and $1,000,000 for the interstate 
digital image exchange project and online verification of birth 
records program.
      Highway safety research.--Within the amount provided for 
highway safety research, the conference agreement provides 
$750,000, for transportation safety research at Florida 
Agricultural and Mechanical University. The objective of FAMU's 
research will be to reduce the severity of traffic injuries 
among the youth and adults between the ages of 0-34 and will 
focus on aggressive driving, road rage, speed control, occupant 
protection and alcohol impaired driving countermeasures. The 
conferees encourage NHTSA to work with FAMU toidentify a 
suitable research project that will focus on an area that will advance 
highway safety.
      Share the road safely.--The conference agreement provides 
$500,000 for the share the road safely program, to be 
administered by NHTSA, as proposed by the Senate. NHTSA is 
encouraged to work with FMCSA and State highway safety 
representatives to determine the best avenues for educating 
both the motoring public and commercial motor vehicle drivers, 
including incorporating such information in driver education 
courses.

                         RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS

      Crash causation study.--The conference agreement provides 
$7,000,000 for the crash causation study, as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Motorcycle injury prevention.--There was a continuous 
decline in motorcycle crash fatalities from the mid-1980's 
through 1997. Since 1997 however, motorcycle fatalities have 
increased annually. The conferees urge NHTSA to focus on 
strategies to reduce the alarming numbers of motorcyclists 
killed and injured in alcohol-related crashes each year.
       Within the amount provided for crashworthiness research, 
the conference agreement provides $40,000 for the New Hampshire 
Department of Safety to conduct a study to evaluate the speed 
and safety threshold for preventing and analyzing motorcycle 
injuries, as proposed by the House. The New Hampshire 
Department of Safety is encouraged to work with the Honda Inova 
Fairfax Hospital CIREN Center in Fairfax, Virginia, which 
specializes in analyzing motorcycle injuries.
      Crashworthiness research.--Within the amount provided for 
crashworthiness research, the conference agreement provides 
$2,000,000 for brain and spinal cord injury research at the 
Southern Consortium for Injury Biomechanics, $1,000,000 for a 
joint research initiative between Vermont's College of Medicine 
(UVM), Texas A&M University and Fletcher Allen Health Care, 
$300,000 for the University of Massachusetts, Amherst Risk 
Prone Driving research, $300,000 for South Carolina DOT 
research and development for ball bearing packages with 
intelligent safety aids for vehicles, and $1,500,000 for the 
George Washington University National Crash Analysis Center for 
advanced crashworthiness research.
      National tire efficiency.--Within the amount provided for 
research and analysis, the conference agreement provides 
$500,000 for the Secretary of Transportation, through the 
National Academy of Sciences, to develop and perform a national 
tire fuel efficiency study and literature review to consider 
the relationship that low rolling resistance replacement tires 
designed for use on passenger cars and light trucks have on 
fuel consumption and tire wear life. The study shall address 
the potential of securing technically feasible and cost-
effective fuel savings from low rolling resistance replacement 
tires that do not adversely affect tire safety, including the 
impacts on performance and durability or adversely impact tire 
tread life and scrap tire disposal, and that does fully 
consider the average American ``drive cycle''. The study shall 
further address the cost to the consumer including the 
additional cost of replacement tires and any potential fuel 
savings. The report shall be submitted to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations, the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation 
Committee not later than January 1, 2006.

                           SAFETY PERFORMANCE

      Fuel economy standards.--The conference agreement 
provides $1,000,000 for the fuel economy standards program and 
directs NHTSA to reevaluate the agency's goals with regard to 
fuel economy and produce an updated performance structure, as 
proposed by the House.

                         GENERAL ADMINISTRATION

      Harmonization of vehicle safety standards.--The 
conference agreement provides $100,000 for the harmonization of 
vehicle safety standards, due to budget constraints.

                        Operations and Research

                (LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)

                      (LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)

                          (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement provides $72,000,000 from the 
highway trust fund to carry out provisions of 23 U.S.C. 403, as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                        National Driver Register

                          (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement provides $3,600,000 for the 
National Driver Register, as proposed by both the House and the 
Senate.

                     Highway Traffic Safety Grants

                (LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)

                      (LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)

                          (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement limits obligations for highway 
traffic safety grants to $225,000,000, as proposed by both the 
House and the Senate. The bill includes separate obligation 
limitations with the following funding allocations:

State and community grants..............................    $165,000,000
Occupant protection incentive grants....................      20,000,000
Alcohol incentive grants................................      40,000,000

      State highway safety program administration.--The GAO 
recently released a report regarding the oversight of State 
Highway Safety Programs (GAO-03-474). This report included the 
recommendation that NHTSA should provide more guidance to 
regional offices regarding when it is appropriate to use 
management reviews and improvement plans to assist states with 
their highway safety programs. The Senate had reiterated this 
recommendation in the fiscal year 2004 report and directed 
NHTSA to undertake steps necessary to implement this guidance. 
However, the House had included language in the fiscal year 
2004 report directing NHTSA to begin to approve each state's 
highway safety plan, if they received Section 402 funding, as 
the agency did prior to 1998.
      Therefore, the conferees direct NHTSA to examine the 
agency's policies with regard to the state grant programs, and 
submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, which should include current agency policies 
for providing guidance to states on how best to craft 
respective highway safety plans and an analysis of oversight 
review responsibilities NHTSA currently has with regard to 
these plans, as proposed by the House. In addition, the report 
should include the steps that NHTSA would undertake if, in 
reviewing a state's plan, the agency had a conflict with the 
way in which states planned to obligate Federal grant funds. 
The report should include a detailed spectrum of annual 
examples, since fiscal year 2000, for which States used Section 
402 funds, including items that NHTSA considers exemplary and 
items NHTSA may consider frivolous.
      NHTSA is also directed to develop a clear policy on 
management review of state highway safety plans, including when 
a state improvement plan should be required, as proposed by the 
Senate. This should be included in the report.
      Funding of $50,000 in operating expenses has been 
provided to undertake this study, and a copy must be provided 
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by 
February 20, 2004.
      Highway public safety mobilizations.--The conferees are 
concerned that the current timing of the national seat belt and 
impaired driving mobilizations inMay and July does not allow 
ample time for either NHTSA or State and local law enforcement agencies 
to adequately plan for these intensive efforts. The conferees believe 
it is important that NHTSA and the States have adequate time to 
properly plan and prepare for each of these mobilizations in order to 
have the maximum impact on saving lives and preventing injuries. To 
that end, the conferees direct NHTSA to work with State and local 
authorities and the safety community to establish a comprehensive plan 
and date certain for future national impaired driving mobilizations. 
Much like the nation has embraced May as the ``Click It or Ticket'' 
month, the conferees expect that this coordinated effort will allow 
NHTSA to establish an annual date for carrying out an effective 
impaired driving mobilization to be accompanied by national paid 
advertising. The conferees direct NHTSA to report to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations 90 days after the date of enactment 
of this Act on the agency's implementation plans and to keep the 
Committees informed throughout the fiscal year as to the progress of 
these efforts.
      The conferees are also aware that NHTSA is currently 
evaluating the effectiveness of a safety mobilization effort in 
Tennessee that combines both the seat belt and impaired driving 
messages. The conferees are interested in the results of this 
combined effort to determine whether a similar effort should be 
conducted at the national level as part of the 2004 
mobilization schedule. NHTSA is directed to report to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations by February 16, 2004 
with the findings of the Tennessee effort as well as any other 
State mobilizations that may combine seat belt and impaired 
driving messages.

   General Provisions--National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
140) allowing states to use funds provided under section 402 of 
title 23, U.S.C., to produce and place highway safety public 
service messages. The provision provides that any state that 
uses funds for such purposes must submit a report to the 
Secretary, who in turn is directed to submit them to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The provision 
allocates $10,000,000 for national paid media to support 
national safety belt mobilizations under Section 157 and 
$20,000,000 under Section 163 to include: $2,750,000 to support 
State impaired driving mobilization enforcement efforts, 
$14,000,000 for paid media to support national law enforcement 
mobilizations on impaired driving, and $250,000 for continued 
evaluation of alcohol-impaired driving messages. In addition, 
$3,000,000 from the Section 163 program should be dedicated to 
an impaired driving demonstration program.
      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
141) prohibiting NHTSA from transferring funds to the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety Administration for the share the road 
safely program.
      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
142) authorizing the Secretary, for fiscal year 2004, to use 
funds necessary to carry out section 157 of title 23, United 
States Code.
      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
143) authorizing the Secretary, for fiscal year 2004, to use 
funds necessary to carry out section 163 of title 23, United 
States Code.
      The conference agreement deleted a provision in the House 
bill regarding truck trailer manufacturing regulations.

                    FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION

                         Safety and Operations

      The conference agreement provides $130,825,000 for safety 
and operations as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$130,922,000 as proposed by the House. Within this total, the 
conferees have funded 25 new full-time equivalents. The 
conference agreement includes language that permits $11,712,000 
of the total funding to remain available until expended as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.
      Workforce planning.--Consistent with the Senate report, 
the conference agreement deletes $350,000 for workforce 
planning.
      Personnel.--Consistent with the House report, the 
conference agreement deletes $78,000 for one full time 
equivalent for Title VI enforcement. Instead, the conference 
agreement provides $78,000 for a financial analyst to support 
the new oversight responsibilities placed on the Department. 
This analyst will help manage activities designed to track 
Amtrak's financial performance, to support the Secretary's 
representatives in dealing with the greater number of issues of 
substance coming before the board, and to monitor the financial 
aspects of the grants, including the capital, operating, and 
North East Corridor grants.
      Grade crossing safety action plan update.--As directed by 
the Senate, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit a 
highway-railway grade crossing safety action plan update, 
coordinated among FRA, FHWA, FMCSA, NHTSA and the ITS Joint 
Program Office, with the fiscal year 2005 budget justification.

                   Railroad Research and Development

      The conference agreement provides $34,025,000 for 
railroad research and development instead of $28,225,000 as 
proposed by the House and $34,225,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System 
(NDGPS).--The conference agreement provides $5,800,000 for 
NDGPS. The House did not fund this project and the Senate 
provided $6,000,000.
      Marshall University/University of Nebraska.--The 
conference agreement includes $2,000,000 to support Marshall 
University and the University of Nebraska to conduct safety 
studies in rail equipment, human factors, track, and rail 
safety related issues.
      West Virginia University (WVU).--The conference agreement 
provides a total of $250,000 for structural integrity research 
utilizing glass fiber reinforced polymers on railroad ties at 
WVU's Constructed Facilities Center.

            Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Program

      The conference agreement includes a provision, proposed 
by both the House and the Senate, specifying that no new direct 
loans or loan guarantee commitments shall be made using federal 
funds for the payment of any credit premium amounts during 
fiscal year 2004. No federal appropriation is required since a 
non-federal infrastructure partner may contribute the subsidy 
amount required by the Credit Reform Act of 1990 in the form of 
a credit risk premium. Once received, statutorily established 
investigation charges are immediately available for appraisals 
and necessary determinations and findings.
      The conference agreement includes a provision, proposed 
by the Senate, mandating that no payment of principal or 
interest shall be collected during fiscal year 2004 for the 
direct loan made to the National Railroad Passenger 
Corporation.

                    Next Generation High-Speed Rail

      The conference agreement provides $37,400,000 for the 
next generation high-speed rail program instead of $28,250,000 
as proposed by the House and $29,350,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The following table summarizes the conference agreement 
by budgetary activity:
        Program                                                   Amount

                    ____________________________________________________
      Total.............................................      37,400,000

      Train control systems.--The conferees note that several 
new and ongoing pilot projects are important to demonstrating 
the operational and safety benefits of wider deployment of 
train control system technologies on freight railroads. The 
conferees encourage the FRA to utilize a portion of its 
appropriations to further the development and testing of safety 
overlay train control technologies that work in conjunction 
with existing methods of operation and signal and control 
systems to protect against the consequences of human and 
technology failures.
      Diesel multiple units.--The conference agreement provides 
$5,000,000 to validate the compliance of diesel multiple units 
with existing passenger car safety standards and to make a 
grant to up to two public bodies for the purpose of initiating 
a demonstration in daily revenue service of a compliant DMU 
during calendar years 2003 and 2004. Federal funding shall only 
be made available if funds are matched on a dollar-for-dollar 
basis from non-federal sources and shall only be used for 
activities related to establishing the compliance of the DMU 
design with passenger safety standards and for the acquisition 
of DMUs (through a conventional competitive procurement 
process) and service facilities necessary for revenue service 
demonstration. All other expenses, including the cost of 
passenger facilities and any net operating expenses are not 
eligible for funding under this appropriation. In making the 
grant award decision, FRA shall consider among its criteria: 
the extent that the award would develop or facilitate the 
domestic rail passenger car manufacturing industry and the 
extent that it is compatible with DMU technology acquired 
pursuant to the fiscal year 2003 appropriation. Nothing shall 
preclude FRA from making funds available to the recipient of 
the fiscal year 2003 award.
      California corridor.--Funds made available for high-speed 
rail in California should supplement, not replace, state 
funding for this same program.
      Northern New England high speed rail corridor.--The 
conference agreement directs the Secretary to include the train 
routes from Boston, Massachusetts via Worcester and 
Springfield, Massachusetts to Albany, New York and from 
Springfield, Massachusetts via Hartford, Connecticut to New 
Haven, Connecticut as part of the existing Northern New England 
High Speed Rail Corridor.
      Magnetic levitation.--In order to assist in the 
evaluation of the potential of magnetic levitation to achieve 
traffic congestion relief and determine its appropriate role in 
our nation's transportation system, the conferees direct FRA to 
provide the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations a 
report comparing the cost and benefits of magnetic levitation 
to other modes of travel. This report should be undertaken 
while moving forward on submitted projects.
      Rail-highway crossing hazard eliminations.--A total of 
$5,250,000 is made available for the elimination of rail-
highway crossing hazards. A limited number of rail corridors 
are eligible for these funds. Of these set-aside funds, the 
following allocations were made:

Assembly Street, Whaley Street and Rosewood Drive, 
    Columbia, South Carolina............................       1,050,000
Tulsa, OK sealed corridor quiet zone....................       1,575,000
Hamilton Boulevard over CSX rail line near US 90, 
    Mobile, Alabama.....................................       1,250,000
Washington State high speed rail corridor grade crossing 
    project.............................................       1,000,000
Wisconsin Railway-Highway crossing hazard elimination 
    project.............................................         375,000

                    ____________________________________________________
    Total...............................................       5,250,000

                     Alaska Railroad Rehabilitation

      The conference agreement provides $25,000,000 for the 
Alaska Railroad, as proposed by the Senate. The House bill 
contained no similar appropriation.

         Grants to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation

                                (AMTRAK)

      The conference agreement provides $1,225,000,000 for the 
Secretary of Transportation to make quarterly grants to Amtrak, 
instead of $900,000,000 asproposed by the House and 
$1,346,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of these funds, $760,000,000 
is provided for operating subsidy grants and $465,000,000 is provided 
for capital grants. Flexibility of the Secretary to allocate funds to 
either operating or capital subsidies is not included, as proposed by 
the Senate.
      DOT oversight.--The conference agreement directs the 
Secretary to approve funding for all train routes for operating 
losses and capital expenditures, including advance purchase 
orders, after receiving and approving a grant request 
accompanied by detailed financial information, revenue 
projections, and capital expenditure projection justification, 
as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees direct the Secretary to ensure that Amtrak 
continues to meet all debt principal and interest payments in 
fiscal year 2004, as proposed by the House and Senate. The 
Secretary is also directed to ensure that any funds provided to 
Amtrak be spent in a prudent manner, on projects where positive 
results can be seen, that maximize operational efficiencies, 
that promote those lines that have the highest ridership and 
that have cost sharing agreements in place. Amtrak shall not be 
permitted to begin any new projects unless the project can be 
fully funded with the fiscal year 2004 appropriation and Amtrak 
generated revenues, unless such projects are critical for 
safety or infrastructure repairs, as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement directs the Secretary to vouch 
for the accuracy of financial information Amtrak provides to 
Congress, in the form of a signed letter to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations, that accompanies the 
transmittal of the quarterly grant documents to the Committees 
and continues to meet the specified criteria, as proposed by 
the House. The conference agreement also prohibits the 
Secretary from obligating or expending any funds until Amtrak 
agrees to continue abiding by certain provisions agreed to 
under the direct loan agreement signed on June 28, 2002.
      Continuation of commuter rail services.--The conference 
agreement includes a provision (Section 150) authorizing the 
Surface Transportation Board to continue commuter rail service 
if Amtrak should cease operations, as proposed by the House. 
Within the funds provided, the conference agreement directs the 
Secretary to reserve $60,000,000 to fund costs incurred if 
directed service orders are issued by the Surface 
Transportation Board. At the Secretary's discretion and based 
on the financial stability of Amtrak, the Secretary may make 
the reserved funds available to Amtrak through appropriate 
grants during the fourth quarter, to the extent that no 
directed service orders have been issued or are expected to be 
issued.
      In addition, the Federal Railroad Administration, in 
coordination with the Surface Transportation Board, shall 
submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, the House Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science 
and Transportation regarding contingency plans the Department 
has in place in the event that Amtrak should cease operations 
and an emergency commuter service order must be carried out. 
This report is due no later than 90 days from enactment of this 
Act.
      Annual business plan.--The conference agreement includes 
language, modified from the House and Senate bills, directing 
Amtrak to submit to the Secretary of Transportation, the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations, the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on 
Commerce, Science and Transportation a comprehensive business 
plan approved by the Board of Directors for operating subsidies 
and capital projects, including advance purchase orders, to be 
funded in fiscal year 2004. The plan must include targets for 
ridership, revenues, and capital and operating expenses, as 
applicable, and a separate accounting of such targets for the 
Northeast Corridor; commuter service; long-distance Amtrak 
service; state-supported service; each intercity train route; 
including Autotrain; and commercial activities including 
contract operations and mail and express. For capital 
expenditures, the plan must include a description of the work 
to be funded, with cost estimates and a timetable for 
completion. The plan must be submitted within 60 days of 
enactment of this Act, in both paper and electronic formats, 
and must be posted on Amtrak's website.
      The conference agreement directs that no funding may be 
used for projects or expenses not approved by the Secretary or 
included on Amtrak's business plan, as proposed by the House 
and Senate. Any variations to the base operating and capital 
plans, including advance purchase orders, must be submitted to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, according to 
the Department's reprogramming guidelines.
      The conference agreement continues bill language 
requiring Amtrak to continue to submit monthly supplemental 
reports regarding the business plan, which should describe work 
completed, any changes to the business plan, and justification 
for such changes, as proposed by the House and Senate. These 
reports should be submitted in an electronic format and posted 
on Amtrak's website. The reports shall continue to be submitted 
to the Secretary and the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations and must be submitted every month, within 30 
days following the last business day of the previous month.
      State-assisted intercity rail service.--The conference 
agreement also includes a provision (Section 151) that directs 
the Secretary to develop and implement a fair competitive bid 
procedure by January 1, 2004, to assist states in introducing 
carefully managed competition to demonstrate whether this could 
provide higher quality rail service at reasonable prices, as 
proposed by the House. The Secretary must administer the 
process, monitor its progress, and make monthly reports to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Secretary 
may reprogram up to $2,500,000 from Amtrak operating grant 
funds to assist in costs of implementing this process. From 
this amount, the Secretary may make grants available to the 
states for any purpose consistent with achieving the goals of 
the process. The Secretary must also evaluate the fair 
competitive bid procedures and report to the House and Senate 
Appropriations Committees, the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Committee on Commerce, 
Science and Transportation by July 1, 2004. In addition, within 
30 days of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall report to 
these same Committees on options for insurance pooling to 
provide states and operators with the lowest possible insurance 
costs.
      Military and Veterans Discount Program.--The conferees 
are dismayed to learn that Amtrak management is giving 
consideration to terminating its discount program for the 
nation's veterans, members of the National Guard and Reserve, 
and active duty military members. At a time when so many 
military members are risking their lives on a daily basis, the 
conferees are greatly disappointed that Amtrak would consider 
terminating this discount program, especially since travelers 
that utilize the discount must travel under specified 
restrictions during off-peak travel times. The conferees expect 
Amtrak to continue this discount program and believe that the 
amount of funding provided in this Act for Amtrak is sufficient 
to avoid any necessity to terminate this well-deserved benefit 
for our nation's veterans and military members.

          General Provisions--Federal Railroad Administration

      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
150) authorizing the Surface Transportation Board to continue 
commuter rail service if Amtrak should cease operations.
      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
151) requiring the Secretary of Transportation, working with 
affected states, to develop and implement a fair competitive 
bid procedure to assist states in introducing carefully managed 
competition to demonstrate whether competition may provide 
higher quality rail service at reasonable prices.

                     FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION

                        Administrative Expenses

      The conference agreement provides $75,500,000 for 
administrative expenses of the Federal Transit Administration, 
instead of the $72,500,000 as proposed by the House and 
$73,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Within this total, the 
conference agreement appropriates $15,100,000 from the general 
fund. The general fund appropriation shall be available until 
expended.
      The conference agreement specifies the appropriations for 
each of the FTA offices in bill language, as proposed by both 
the House and Senate. In addition, the Administrator is 
authorized to transfer funding between offices, but transfers 
totaling more than three percent must be approved by both the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
      The conference agreement includes a provision, contained 
in both bills, that would reimburse the Department of 
Transportation's Inspector General $2,000,000 for costs 
associated with audits and investigations of transit-related 
issues. The conference agreement also includes a provision that 
specifies the amount of funding available for the National 
transit database to be not less than $2,200,000 for fiscal year 
2004.
      Administrative expenses.--Salaries and benefits have been 
provided for all current on-board FTE at the Federal Transit 
Administration. The request for an additional 10 FTE has been 
denied, consistent with the Senate proposal. FTA has grown 
unencumbered for some time, increasing by 18% in ten years, and 
the conferees are troubled that FTA continues to seek new 
employees every year in double-digit quantities. Many items 
within the central account have been kept at levels consistent 
with fiscal year 2003, as increases of over 50% were requested 
in some instances, such as transportation and training.
      In addition, this year FTA has submitted letters to the 
Committees with important attachments missing; has approved a 
reprogramming--and advised a Member of Congress of such 
action--without requesting such change from the Committees on 
Appropriations; and has been reluctant to provide information 
in a responsive manner. The conferees will not tolerate the 
continuation of these kinds of errors and demand that FTA 
develop better procedures for improved internal coordination.
      Budget justifications.--The conferees direct FTA to 
submit its fiscal year 2005 congressional budget justification 
for administrative expenses by office, as proposed by the House 
and Senate, with material detailing salaries and expenses, 
staffing increases, and programmatic initiatives of each 
office.
      Grants management.--The conferees are concerned with the 
increasing number of projects that are not obligated in a 
three-year period that consequently become available for 
reallocation. At the same time, the House and Senate Committees 
on Appropriations have heard a litany of complaints from 
project sponsors of the lack of cooperation and assistance from 
FTA during the grant application process and the amendment 
process for full funding grant agreements. While the conferees 
expect aggressive oversight from the agency, they will not 
condone intimidation or dilatory bureaucratic obstacles that 
needlessly delay the obligations of discretionary projects. FTA 
should set new goals for the timing of grant obligations for 
each discretionary category and strive to meet those goals.
      In the event that FTA receives a request from a Member of 
Congress regarding a reprogramming of funding for transit 
projects in their district or state, FTA shall direct the 
Member of Congress to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations to establish a resolution. The Committees shall 
review the matter and notify FTA of the resolution.
      Project and financial management oversight activities.--
The conferees direct FTA to submit to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations quarterly FMO and PMOC reports for 
each project with a full funding grant agreement.
      Full funding grant agreements (FFGAs).--TEA-21, as 
amended, requires that the FTA notify the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations as well as the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on 
Banking sixty days before executing a full funding grant 
agreement. In its notification to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations, the conferees direct the FTA to 
include therein the following: (1) a copy of the proposed full 
funding grant agreement; (2) the total and annual federal 
appropriations required for that project; (3) yearly and total 
federal appropriations that can be reasonably planned or 
anticipated for future FFGAs for each fiscal year through 2004; 
(4) a detailed analysis of annual commitments for current and 
anticipated FFGAs against the program authorization; (5) an 
evaluation of whether the alternatives analysis made by the 
applicant fully assessed all viable alternatives; and (6) a 
financial analysis of the project's cost and sponsor's ability 
to finance the project, which shall be conducted by an 
independent examiner and which shall include an assessment of 
the capital cost estimate and the finance plan; the source and 
security of all public- and private-sector financial 
instruments; the project's operating plan, which enumerates the 
project's future revenue and ridership forecasts; and a listing 
of all planned contingencies and possible risks associated with 
the project.
      The conferees also direct FTA to inform the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations thirty days before 
approving scope changes in any full funding grant agreement, as 
proposed by the House. Correspondence relating to scope changes 
shall include any budget revisions or program changes that 
materially alter the project as originally stipulated in the 
full funding grant agreement, and shall include any proposed 
change in rail car procurements.
      The conferees have not included language, proposed by the 
House, directing FTA to report to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations before any project in the new 
starts process is given approval by FTA to advance to 
preliminary engineering or final design. The conferees would 
encourage FTA to ensure that the Committees are aware of 
project development and progression, but do not require 
official correspondence.
      New starts report.--The conferees were satisfied with the 
timely submission of FTA's fiscal year 2004 annual report on 
new starts projects. TEA-21 required this report to be 
submitted in conjunction with the budget, yet year after year, 
this report was submitted months late. Without a timely 
submission of this information, the conferees cannot make well-
informed decisions about new starts projects. To ensure that 
this report continues to be submitted on time, the conference 
agreement includes bill language that requires FTA to submit 
its annual new starts report with the initial submission of the 
President's budget request. An untimely submission of this 
crucial report will result in penalties to FTA's administrative 
expenses account.
      Charter service activities.--The conferees direct FTA to 
revisit Part 604 of Title 49 of the United States Code to 
ensure that the statute continues to meet its purpose of 
ensuring that federally funded equipment and facilities should 
not be used to compete unfairly with private charter operators, 
as proposed by theHouse. A report shall be submitted to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later then December 
31, 2003, on FTA's efforts.
      Buy America enforcement.--The conferees direct the Office 
of Inspector General to review FTA's most recent 
interpretations of manufactured components and subcomponents as 
well as the use of temporary exemptions regarding domestic 
content under the Buy America statute, as proposed by the 
Senate. A report shall be submitted to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations no later than March 1, 2004.
      Transit agency advertising.--The conferees are concerned 
that transit agencies accepting Federal grant funds may be 
providing their advertising space to organizations that 
encourage the public to break the law. For example, the 
conferees note with displeasure that public service advertising 
space in Washington, DC's Metropolitan Area Transit Authority 
rail stations and buses has been used to advocate changing the 
nation's laws regarding marijuana usage. WMATA has provided 
$46,250 worth of space to these types of ads; therefore, as a 
warning to other transit agencies, the conferees have deleted 
funding totaling $92,500 from projects and activities for WMATA 
in this bill.
      While the conferees applaud the efforts of many transit 
agencies to prevent ads that promote marijuana use, the 
conferees remain concerned that the opportunity exists 
nationwide for transit properties to run similar advertising. 
Therefore, the conference agreement includes a provision 
(Section 177) that prohibits Federal transit grantees from 
obligating or expending funds that would otherwise be available 
in the Act, if the grantee is involved directly or indirectly 
with any activity, including displaying or permitting to be 
displayed advertisements on its land, equipment, or in its 
facilities, that promote the legalization or medical use of 
substances listed in schedule I of section 202 of the 
Controlled Substance Act.

                             Formula Grants

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides a total program level 
of $3,839,000,000 for formula grants of the Federal Transit 
Administration, as proposed by both the House and Senate. 
Within this total, the conference agreement appropriates 
$767,800,000 from the general fund. The general fund 
appropriation shall be available until expended. The FTA 
oversight takedown shall not exceed the amount authorized in 
current law.
      The conference agreement provides that funding made 
available under the clean fuels formula grant program under 
this heading shall be transferred to and merged with funding 
provided for the replacement, rehabilitation, and purchase of 
buses and related equipment and the construction of bus-related 
facilities under ``Federal Transit Administration, capital 
investment grants''.

                   University Transportation Research

      The conference agreement provides a total of $6,000,000 
for the university transportation research program as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate. Of this amount, $1,200,000 is 
from the general fund and shall be available until expended.

                     Transit Planning and Research

      The conference agreement provides a total of $126,000,000 
for transit planning and research. Within the total, the 
conference agreement appropriates $25,200,000 from the general 
fund. The general fund appropriation shall be available until 
expended.
      Within the funds appropriated for transit planning and 
research, $5,250,000 is provided for rural transportation 
assistance; $4,000,000 is provided for the National Transit 
Institute; $8,250,000 is provided for the transit cooperative 
research program; $60,385,600 is provided for metropolitan 
planning; $12,614,400 is provided for state planning; and 
$35,500,000 is provided for the national planning and research 
program.

                      Trust Fund Share of Expenses

                (LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)

                          (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement provides $5,847,200,000 in 
liquidating cash for the trust fund share of transit expenses.

                       Capital Investment Grants

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides a total program level 
of $3,137,500,000 to remain available until expended for

      Within the total program level, $1,206,506,000 is 
provided for fixed guideway modernization; $607,200,000 is 
provided for the replacement, rehabilitation, and purchase of 
buses and related equipment and the construction of bus-related 
facilities; and $1,323,794,000 is provided for new fixed 
guideway systems.
      Three year availability of section 5309 discretionary 
funds.--The conferees direct FTA to reprogram funds from 
recoveries and previous appropriations that remain available 
after three years and are available for reallocation to only 
those new starts and bus and bus facilities projects that are 
identified. The FTA shall notify the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations 15 days prior to any such proposed 
reallocation. Therefore, the conferees direct FTA to reallocate 
funds provided in the fiscal year 2001 Department of 
Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act or 
previous Acts for the following bus and bus facilities 
projects, which shall supplement funding for bus and bus 
facility projects listed in this report:

            Woburn, buses and bus facilities, MA
            Elizabeth Ferry Project, NJ
            Greenport and Sag Harbor, ferries and vans, NY
            Westchester and Duchess counties, vans, NY
            Phoenixville, transit related improvements, PA

      The conferees direct FTA to reallocate funds provided in 
the fiscal year 2001 Department of Transportation and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Act or previous Acts for the following 
new starts projects:

            Boston-South Boston Piers Transitway Project
            Massachusetts North Shore Corridor Project

      FTA restrictions on funding for non-FFGA new start 
projects.--The conferees strongly support language proposed by 
the Senate that rejects an FTA reinterpretation of Sections 
5309(e)(6), (7), and (8) of Title 49, U.S.C. Through this 
reinterpretation, FTA is withholding the release of 
appropriated funds for new starts projects that have received 
more than $25,000,000 in Federal funding prior to receiving a 
full funding grant agreement. The conference agreement includes 
a general provision that rejects the FTA analysis that once a 
project exceeds $25,000,000 it is subject to FTA review and 
evaluation and therefore FTA must approve it for advancement, 
while withholding appropriated funds. Further, there is no 
limit of $25,000,000 on alternatives analysis, preliminary 
engineering, or final design, and a project seeking more than 
that amount for such activities does not need an early systems 
work agreement, as FTA has interpreted to be required under 
subsection (g)(1). The conferees direct FTA to expeditiously 
release previously appropriated funds for all new starts 
projects identified in this and prior appropriations Acts that 
remain unobligated and have not been reallocated by the 
Congress, upon request of the grantee and the satisfaction of 
statutory requirements.
      Pooled procurement pilot project.--The conference 
agreement includes a general provision establishing a pooled 
procurement pilot program for bus procurements (Section 166), 
as proposed by the Senate. FTA shall disseminate the benefits 
of voluntary buyer collaboration to transit systems and review 
upcoming and current procurements to determine suitable 
candidates for selection as pilot projects. Additionally, the 
FTA is directed to evaluate the process employed and the 
results achieved by each pool and report the findings to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than 60 
days after the award of a contract.

                         Bus and Bus Facilities

      Bus and bus facilities.--The conference agreement 
provides $607,200,000, together with $50,000,000 transferred 
from ``Federal Transit Administration, formula grants'' and 
$20,000,000 transferred from ``Federal Transit Administration, 
job access and reverse commute grants'' and merged with funding 
under this heading, for the replacement, rehabilitation and 
purchase of buses and related equipment and the construction of 
bus-related facilities. No funding is made available to carry 
out the clean fuels program in this Act. In addition, funds 
made available for bus and bus facilities are to be 
supplemented with funds from reallocated projects included in 
the fiscal year 2001 Appropriations Act.
      Funds provided for buses and bus facilities are 
distributed as follows:

                               New Starts

      New starts.--The conference agreement provides 
$1,323,794,000, for new fixed guideway systems. In addition, 
funds made available for new starts are to be supplemented with 
$4,514,482 from reallocated projects included in the fiscal 
year 2000 and 2001 Appropriations Acts under ``Federal Transit 
Administration, job access and reverse commute grants''.
      Alternatives analysis review.--The conferees are 
concerned that sufficient weight and review are not being given 
to the earliest stage of new starts projects, namely the 
alternatives analysis undertaken by local communities. 
Therefore, the conferees direct FTA to ensure that alternative 
modes and/or alignments analyzed as part of the metropolitan 
planning process fully support the selection of projects 
forwarded to FTA for proposed new starts funding. Specifically, 
the alternatives analysis made by applicants must fully weigh 
viable alternatives and ensure that quantitative measures are 
used in choosing the locally preferred alternative. The 
conferees direct FTA to report to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations on how the agency will undertake 
this direction, as well as recommendations, that include 
statutory changes if necessary, for improving the alternatives 
analysis process to improve planning at the onset. The report 
is due by March 1, 2004.
      Ratings for new starts criteria.--The conferees are also 
concerned that FTA may have changed their new starts ratings 
criteria, specifically the new ``time savings per rider'' 
measure, hastily. Therefore, the conferees direct FTA to 
revisit the issue of the abolition of the ``cost-per-new-
rider'' measure. FTA shall report to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations on the justification for the 
elimination of that rating, as well as the reasoning for the 
new ``time savings per rider'' implementation.
      Within this report, FTA should also detail other 
characteristics that may be useful in evaluating new start 
projects, particularly traffic congestion relief. FTA should 
include suggestions for how these criteria could be 
quantitatively measured and rated in the annual new starts 
report. This report shall be submitted to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations by February 16, 2004.

      Utah program of projects.--The conference agreement 
includes a provision (Section 171) that amends the Federal 
Transit Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-178; 112 Stat. 338) by 
creating section 3042, which provides for the coordinated 
development and governmental funding for Utah transportation 
projects. Subsection (a) directs FTA and FHWA to work with the 
Utah Transit Authority and the Utah Department of 
Transportation to coordinate preconstruction and construction 
of the regional commuter rail project and the northern segment 
of I-15 reconstruction located in the Wasatch Front corridor 
extending from Brigham City to Payson, Utah. Subsection (b) 
defines a program of related projects for purposes of 
determining and allocating the governmental and nongovernmental 
share of project costs. This subsection permits federal funds 
that may remain after completion of the Medical Center 
Extension to be allocated to a vehicle and storage track 
extending from the Delta Center; permits use of the value of 
the purchase of the regional commuter rail right-of-way from 
Brigham City to Payson, Utah, to be used for the 
nongovernmental share of the Weber County to Salt Lake City 
segment; permits the purchase and rehabilitation of rail 
vehicles with non-governmental funds for use on one project to 
be counted toward the nongovernmental share of another project; 
and permits crediting non-matched funding for the northern 
segment of I-15 reconstruction to the non-governmental share of 
the regional commuter rail project.

efficiency; identification of significant intermodal obstacles 
associated with each port; and a summary of future actions 
MARAD plans to take to address and improve the throughput of 
cargo in America's ports. The conferees expect MARAD to work 
with industry groups as well as the scientific community in the 
completion of this study.
      Additional Required Reports.--The conferees direct MARAD 
to submit all reports as directed in the House report no later 
than 45 days after enactment of this Act.

                             Ship Disposal

      The conference agreement includes $16,211,000 for the 
disposal of obsolete vessels of the National Defense Reserve 
Fleet, instead of the $14,000,000 proposed by the House and 
$18,422,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                    Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program

      The conference agreement includes $4,498,000 for 
administration expenses of the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program 
(Title XI) as proposed by the Senate. The conferees note 
MARAD's cooperation with the Department of Transportation's 
Inspector General (DOTIG) on the implementation of managerial 
reforms of the Title XI program and are encouraged by the 
progress towards certification of the maritime loan guarantee 
process, as specified in P.L. 108-11.

                           Ship Construction

                              (RESCISSION)

      The conference agreement includes a rescission of 
unobligated balances totaling $4,107,056 from the dormant ship 
construction account.

              General Provisions--Maritime Administration

      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
180) authorizing MARAD to furnish utilities and services and 
make necessary repairs in connection with any lease, contract, 
or occupancy involving Government property under control of 
MARAD, and allow payments received to be credited to the 
Treasury.
      The conference agreement includes a provision (Section 
181) prohibiting obligations to be incurred during the current 
fiscal year from the construction fund established by the 
Merchant Marine Act, 1936.

              RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION

                     Research and Special Programs

      The conference agreement provides $46,441,000 for 
research and special programs, instead of $47,018,000 as 
proposed by the House and $42,516,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Within this total, $2,510,000 is available until 
September 30, 2006, instead of $2,427,000 as proposed by the 
House and $3,473,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement permits up to $1,200,000 in fees 
to be collected and deposited in the general fund of the 
Treasury as offsetting receipts. Also, the conference agreement 
includes language that permits funds received from states, 
counties, municipalities, other public authorities and private 
sources for expenses incurred for training, reports publication 
and dissemination, and travel expenses incurred in the 
performance of hazardous materials exemptions and approval 
functions. The House and Senate proposed both of these 
provisions.
      Prior year funding decisions.--In House Joint Resolution 
2 (Public Law 108-7), the Transportation and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2003, the Congress denied 
certain funding in RSPA's budget request for the reason that 
there were decreases that the Congress had taken in previous 
Acts and RSPA was requesting that the Congress restore that 
funding. RSPA has again undertaken this type of budgeting in 
the fiscal year 2004 request. The conferees are strongly 
dismayed at this trend, and direct RSPA and the Department of 
Transportation Office of Budget and Policy to cease these types 
of requests immediately.
      Further, the conferees direct RSPA to implement 
appropriate accounting procedures and budgetary tools to ensure 
proper accounting and integrity of appropriated funds, as 
proposed by the Senate. A report is due to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations ninety days after enactment of 
this Act, detailing the measures that will be taken to address 
these shortfalls and a timeline for implementation.

                     Office of Hazardous Materials

      The conference agreement provides $23,675,000 for the 
office of hazardous materials, instead of $23,558,000 as 
proposed by the House and $22,814,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The following adjustments are made to the budget 
estimate:

Reduce funding for requested hazmat positions and 
    associated administrative costs.....................       -$494,000

      New positions.--The conference agreement provides one new 
hydrogen fuel engineer position for the office of research and 
technology.
      Hydrogen fuels research.--Before new staff is hired, the 
office of research and technology shall perform an assessment 
on the safety and technology status of the infrastructure 
supporting hydrogen fuels transportation. The report shall 
include an analysis of what steps RSPA is taking to work with 
the Department of Energy to ensure that all research related to 
hydrogen fuels is complementary in order to maximize 
investment. The report should be submitted to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than February 1, 
2004, and $50,000 is provided for necessary research.

                   Office of Emergency Transportation

      The conference agreement provides $2,720,000 for the 
office of emergency transportation, instead of $2,463,000 as 
proposed by the House and $2,802,000 as proposed by the Senate. 
The following adjustments are made to the budget estimate:

Reduce funding for requested positions and associated 
    administrative costs................................       -$514,000
Reduce funding for emergency transportation regional 
    equipment and training..............................        -250,000
Reduce funding for restoration of fiscal year 2003 
    across-the-board cut................................         -13,000

      New positions.--The conference agreement provides seven 
new positions for the office of emergency transportation: five 
crisis management center positions and two full-time regional

flexibility to ensure that the regional emergency response 
teams are adequately equipped, as proposed by the Senate.

                      Office of Program Management

      The conference agreement provides $17,539,000 for the 
office of program management, instead of $18,858,000 as 
proposed by the House and $14,506,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The following adjustments are made to the budget 
estimate:

Reduce funding for requested positions and associated 
    administrative costs................................       -$434,000
Reduce funding for infrastructure technology 
    modernization.......................................        -859,000
Reduce funding for restoration of fiscal year 2003 
    across-the-board cut and TASC cut...................        -320,000

      New positions.--The conference agreement provides five 
new positions for the office of program management; one 
contracting specialist, one database manager, two IT staff, and 
one support service specialist.
      Infrastructure technology modernization.--Due to budget 
constraints, the conference agreement reduces funding for 
RSPA's IT upgrade by $859,000. The conferees direct RSPA to 
keep the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations informed 
of these extensive upgrades through biannual correspondence, 
due in February and August, as proposed by the House.

                            PIPELINE SAFETY

                         (PIPELINE SAFETY FUND)

                    (OIL SPILL LIABILITY TRUST FUND)

      The conference agreement provides a total of $66,305,000 
for the pipeline safety program, instead of $64,054,000 as 
proposed by the House and $67,612,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Within this total, $21,828,000 is available until 
September 30, 2006, instead of $21,786,000 as proposed by the 
House and $22,710,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Of this total, the conference agreement specifies that 
$13,000,000 shall be derived from the Oil Spill Liability Trust 
Fund and $53,305,000 from the Pipeline Safety Fund. The House 
bill allocated $9,000,000 from the Oil Spill Liability Trust 
Fund and $55,054,000 from the Pipeline Safety Trust Fund. The 
Senate bill provided $17,183,000 from the Oil Spill Liability 
Trust Fund and $50,429,000 from the Pipeline Safety Fund. The 
following adjustments are made to the budget estimate:

Deny decreased funding for one-call grants..............     +$1,000,000
Reduce funding for requested positions and associated 
    administrative costs................................      -1,342,000
Reduce funding for restoration of fiscal year 2003 
    across-the-board cut................................        -581,000

      New positions.--The conference agreement provides twelve 
new positions for the office of pipeline safety: four natural 
gas IMP inspectors, two State program manager liaisons, four 
FERC inspectors, and two Alaska regulations specialists.
      State one-call grants.--The conferees deny a proposed 
decrease in one-call grants, as proposed by the House and 
Senate, and have restored $1,000,000. The conferees feel 
strongly that these grants are an important tool in reducing 
the number of pipeline incidents.
      Pipeline safety fund and oil spill liability trust 
fund.--The conferees direct the Office of Pipeline Safety to 
allocate oversight activities between the hazardous liquid and 
gas pipelines and to factor the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund 
into the allocation formula that determines the hazardous 
liquid pipeline user fee assessment to accurately reflect the 
amount and type of oversight activities being conducted by the 
office consistent with the Trust Fund. The fiscal year 2005 
budget justification should adequately address this issue.

                     EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS GRANTS

                     (EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FUND)

      The conference agreement provides $200,000 for emergency 
preparedness grants as proposed by both the House and the 
Senate. The conference agreement includes a limitation on 
obligations of $14,300,000, consistent with both the House and 
Senate proposals.

                      Office of Inspector General

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $56,000,000 for the 
Office of Inspector General.

                      Surface Transportation Board

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides a funding level of 
$19,521,000 for the Surface Transportation Board to fund 
salaries and expenses from a direct appropriation, as proposed 
by both the House and Senate. The conference agreement includes 
language as proposed by both the House and the Senate that 
allows the Board to offset $1,050,000 of its appropriation from 
fees collected during the fiscal year, for a total program 
level of $18,521,000.
      Union Pacific/Southern Pacific merger.--On December 12, 
1997, the Board granted a joint request of Union Pacific 
Railroad Company and the City of Wichita and Sedgwick County, 
KS (Wichita/Sedgwick) to toll the 18-month mitigation study 
pending in Finance Docket No. 32760. The decision indicated 
that at such time as the parties reach an agreement or 
discontinue negotiations, the Board would take appropriate 
action.
      By petition filed June 26, 1998, Wichita/Sedgwick and UP/
SP indicated that they had entered into an agreement, and 
jointly petitioned the Board to impose the agreement as a 
condition of the Board's approval of the UP/SP merger. By 
decision dated July 8, 1998, the Board agreed and imposed the 
agreement as a condition to the UP/SP merger. The terms of the 
negotiated agreement remain in effect. If UP/SP or any of its 
divisions or subsidiaries materially changes or is unable to 
achieve the assumptions on which the Board based its final 
environmental mitigation measures, then the Board should reopen 
Finance Docket 32760 if requested by interested parties, and 
prescribe additional mitigation properly reflecting these 
changes if shown to be appropriate.

                  TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

                          Departmental Offices

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides $176,109,000 for 
departmental offices of the Treasury Department instead of 
$175,809,000 proposed by the House and $174,809,000 proposed by 
the Senate. A table comparing the House bill, Senate bill, and 
conference agreement follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Office of Foreign Assets Control.--The conference 
agreement specifies not less than 120 full-time equivalent 
(FTE) staff-years for this office, as proposed by the Senate.
      Reports on travel.--Modifying a proposal of the House, 
the conferees agree that quarterly reports are to be submitted 
providing details on the international travel of departmental 
employees.
      Staffing in certain offices.--The conferees agree that 
the department is limited to 19 FTE in the Office of 
International Affairs, as proposed by the Senate, and 14 FTE 
for the Executive Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial 
Crimes, as proposed by the House.
      Marketing of the new $20 currency note.--The conferees 
acknowledge that some expenditure was necessary to market the 
new $20 currency note to the public and to private businesses 
both in the United States and abroad. However, the amount spent 
by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) for this purpose 
was excessive, and far greater than similar efforts in the 
past. Although BEP is self-financed through a revolving fund, 
this does not absolve the bureau from being cost-efficient in 
all of its operations. The conferees direct BEP to submit to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, not later 
than December 31, 2003, a report showing the baseline amount of 
funds returned to the Treasury from their recurring operations 
at the end of fiscal year 2003. The conferees further direct 
BEP to manage its operations in a manner so that, by the end of 
fiscal year 2005, that baseline amount has been increased by 
$14,000,000. The Appropriations Committees will monitor this 
situation annually to help ensure those targets are reached.
      CyberShield.--The conferees are aware of efforts to 
develop a public/private partnership which will develop best 
practices in real-time detection and the creation of response 
centers to protect existing financial services sectors from 
next generation cyber attacks. The conferees encourage the 
Department of the Treasury to work closely with the Department 
of Homeland Security to support this important initiative.

        DEPARTMENT-WIDE SYSTEMS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides $36,400,000 for 
department-wide systems and capital investment programs, 
instead of $36,653,000 as proposed by the House and $36,928,000 
as proposed by the Senate. The bill includes language proposed 
by the Senate restricting any of these funds for programs of 
the Internal Revenue Service, which has its own capital 
appropriation. The reduction from the budget estimate of 
$528,000 is to be allocated against the HR Connect program.
      HR Connect.--Including the $25,461,000 in this bill for 
fiscal year 2004, the HR Connect project will have received 
over $140,000,000 in appropriations since its beginning in 
fiscal year 1998. Although the conferees remain committed to 
this project, given its significant cost and scope, as well as 
recent downsizing at the Treasury Department affecting program 
requirements, the conferees direct the Secretary of the 
Treasury to provide to the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees, within six months of enactment of this Act, a 
status report on the project. The report should include, but 
not be limited to, the following: (1) the original scope of 
this effort and any changes to those initial requirements since 
the beginning of the project in 1998; (2) accomplishments to 
date on the development and implementation of new systems and 
software, and the success in deploying those new systems across 
Treasury bureaus; (3) the impact that these new systems have 
had on overall human resource management processes of the 
Department; (4) the savings, if any, that have resulted from 
the implementation of HR Connect throughout the department thus 
far; and (5) the additional funding necessary beyond fiscal 
year 2004 to complete the project.

                      Office of Inspector General

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $13,000,000 for 
salaries and expenses of the Office of Inspector General, 
instead of $12,792,000 proposed by the House and $12,687,000 
proposed by the Senate.
      Study on expanded use of blanks.--The conferees agree to 
the study, proposed by the House, on the potential and cost-
effectiveness of expanded use of pre-made ``blanks'' by the 
U.S. Mint in the production of circulating coins. However, 
instead of using the U.S. General Accounting Office to complete 
this study, as proposed by the House, the conferees agree that 
the study should be performed by the Treasury Office of 
Inspector General, and additional funding has been included for 
this purpose. The report should be submitted to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations, and appropriate 
legislative committees, not later than April 1, 2004.
      Treasury Building and Annex repair and restoration 
project.--The conferees note that since the first full year of 
funding for this project in fiscal year 1998, $178,000,000 has 
been appropriated for the project. This is in addition to the 
$28,000,000 appropriated in fiscal year 1997 to undertake 
immediate repairs resulting from fire damage to the Treasury 
Building in 1996. As part of the conferees' ongoing oversight 
of major capital projects, the conferees direct the Treasury 
Inspector General to conduct an audit of all Treasury Building 
renovation and restoration contracts since fiscal year 1998. 
Such audit shall include, but need not be limited to: (1) 
compliance with all applicable procurement laws, rules, and 
regulations, and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as 
amended; (2) a review of the scope, requirements, and cost 
reasonableness of the project, as well as the process for 
managing change orders to the original scope and design; and 
(3) the effectiveness, efficiency, and economy of contractor 
operations. The audit shall be completed and submitted to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within eight 
months of enactment of this Act. Additional funding is provided 
in this appropriation for completion of this audit.

           Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $128,034,000 as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                Air Transportation Stabilization Program

by both the House and the Senate.

           Treasury Building and Annex Repair and Restoration

      The conference agreement provides $25,000,000 as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate. The bill prohibits the 
obligation of $7,000,000 for this program until completion of 
the Inspector General audit described under ``Treasury Office 
of Inspector General, salaries and expenses'' or until approval 
in writing by the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations.

                  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

The provision accepts Senate language prohibiting the issuance 
of regulations on cash balance pension plans, and requires the 
Treasury Department to submit legislation to the Congress 
within 180 days to provide transition relief for older and 
longer-service employees affected by conversions of traditional 
pension plans to cash balance plans. The House had a similar 
provision under title seven of the bill, which is not included 
in the conference agreement.

Senate requiring a study compiling statistics on the earned

      The bill includes a provision (sec. 216) proposed by the 
Senate extending the pay demonstration project at the Alcohol 
Tax and Trade Bureau from five years to six years, which will 
result in the program being extended through fiscal year 2004.

House relating to the reimbursement of financial institutions 
for services directed or required by the Secretary of the

TITLE III--EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO 
                             THE PRESIDENT

                     Compensation of the President

      The conference agreement provides $450,000 for 
compensation of the President as proposed by both the House and 
Senate. The bill includes a general provision codifying in 
statutory law the substance of provisions carried in 
appropriations Acts since 1981. The modification of 3 U.S.C. 
102 stipulates that the President's expense allowance shall not 
be included as gross income, and any unused portion shall 
revert to the Treasury. This is identical to current law as 
carried in annual appropriations Acts, and will obviate the 
need to carry this provision each year in the appropriations 
process.

                           White House Office

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

$66,057,000 as proposed by the House and $61,937,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. Of the funding provided, $7,231,000 is 
for the Office of Homeland Security. The restriction on the 
obligation of funds in the House report relating to a report on 
funding for renovation and furnishings is not necessary, as the 
report has been submitted. The reduction of $1,100,000 reflects 
elimination of the President's Critical Infrastructure Advisory 
Board since submission of the budget, as proposed by the House.

             Executive Residence at the White House Office

                           OPERATING EXPENSES

by both the House and the Senate.

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

by the Senate instead of $9,000,000 as proposed by the House.

                       Homeland Security Council

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The bill deletes the separate appropriation for this 
council proposed by the Senate. Instead, the conference 
agreement provides funding under ``White House Office'', as 
proposed by the House but at a modified level.

                        Office of Administration

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $82,826,000 as proposed 
by the House instead of $77,164,000 as proposed by the Senate. 
The agreement reflects reductions proposed by the House for 
information technology services (-$1,500,000) and security 
services for the Office of Science and Technology Policy (-
$1,096,000) as well as a transfer back to this account for the 
core enterprise pilot program (+$8,258,000). The conferees 
encourage the Administration to include all EOP funds for the 
core enterprise pilot program under this appropriation in the 
fiscal year 2005 budget request. The bill specifies that, of 
the total funding provided, $20,578,000 is for capital 
investment plan activities as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$17,470,000 as proposed by the House.

                    Office of Management and Budget

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      Reception and representation expenses.--The bill includes 
$3,000 as proposed by the Senate instead of $1,500 as proposed 
by the House.
      Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.--The 
conferees direct that $1,000,000 of the total funding provided 
in this appropriation be withheld from obligation until 
resolution of existing programmatic concerns by House conferees 
are addressed and the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations approve of such obligation.
      Implementation of the Federal Data Quality Act.--The 
conferees are concerned that agencies are not complying fully 
with the requirements of the Federal Data Quality Act (FDQA). 
The conferees agree that data endorsed by the Federal 
Government should be of the highest quality, and that the 
public should have the opportunity to review the data 
disseminated by the Federal Government for its accuracy and 
have available to it a streamlined procedure for correcting 
inaccuracies. The Administrator of the Office of Information 
and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) is directed to submit a report to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by June 1, 
2004 on whether agencies have been properly responsive to 
public requests for correction of information pursuant to the 
FDQA, and suggest changes that should be made to the FDQA or 
OMB guidelines to improve the accuracy and transparency of 
agency science.

the Senate instead of $40,000,000 as proposed by the House. Of 
this amount, the conferees agree to provide $24,000,000 for the 
technology transfer program as proposed by the Senate, instead 
of $22,000,000 as proposed by the House. The conferees direct 
ONDCP to report to the Committees on Appropriations, no later 
than December 31, 2003, on CTAC funding allocations, 
specifically providing a detailed spending plan for both the 
research and development program and the technology transfer 
program for fiscal years 2001-2003. In addition, the conferees

Appropriations on how fiscal year 2004 funds will be spent, as 
well as to provide biannual reports on priority counterdrug 
enforcement research and development requirements and the 
status of projects funded by CTAC. Finally, the conferees 
direct ONDCP to include in the fiscal year 2005 budget request 
a specific accounting of the total number of grant applications

                     Federal Drug Control Programs

                NATIONAL YOUTH ANTI-DRUG MEDIA CAMPAIGN

      While the conferees are encouraged by data released by 
the Partnership for a Drug-Free America showing welcome trends 
in the incidence of youth drug use, the conferees wish to 
reemphasize the need to demonstrate that such trends can be 
linked to the Media Campaign itself. The conferees therefore 
direct ONDCP to submit to the Committees on Appropriations an 
evaluation plan for the Media Campaign covering fiscal years 
2004-2008 no later than 120 days after enactment of this Act. 
In addition, the conferees direct ONDCP to provide to the

physics lab and office building for CDRH.

Appropriations on this matter no later than 90 days after the 
enactment of this Act.

   DIVISION G--DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN 
          DEVELOPMENT, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS

      The language and allocations set forth in House Report 
108-235 and Senate Report 108-143 should be complied with 
unless specifically addressed to the contrary in the conference 
report and statement of the managers. Report language included 
by the House which is not changed by the report of the Senate 
or the conference and Senate report language which is not 
changed by the conference is approved by the committee of the 
conference. The statement of the managers, while repeating some 
report language for emphasis, does not intend to negate the 
language referred to above unless expressly provided herein. In 
cases where the House or Senate have directed the submission of 
a report, such report is to be submitted to both House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations.

              Operating Plan and Reprogramming Procedures

      The conferees continue to have a particular interest in 
being informed of reprogrammings which, although they may not 
change either the total amount available in an account or any 
of the purposes for which the appropriation is legally 
available, represent a significant departure from budget plans 
presented to the Committees in an agency's budget 
justifications, the basis of this appropriations Act.
      Consequently, the conferees direct the departments, 
agencies, boards, commissions, corporations and offices funded 
at or in excess of $100,000,000 in this bill, to consult with 
the Committees on Appropriations in both the House and Senate 
prior to each change from the approved budget levels in excess 
of $500,000 between programs, activities, object 
classifications or elements unless otherwise provided for in 
the statement of the managers accompanying this Act. For 
agencies, boards, commissions, corporations and offices funded 
at less than $100,000,000 in this bill, the reprogramming 
threshold shall be $250,000 between programs, activities, 
object classifications or elements unless otherwise provided 
for in the statement of the managers accompanying this Act. 
Additionally, the conferees expect the Committees on 
Appropriations to be promptly notified of all reprogramming 
actions which involve less than the above-mentioned amounts. If 
such actions would have the effect of significantly changing an 
agency's funding requirements in future years, or if programs 
or projects specifically cited in the statement of the managers 
or accompanying reports of the House and Senate are affected by 
the reprogramming, the reprogramming must be approved by the 
Committees on Appropriations regardless of the amount proposed 
to be moved. Furthermore, the conferees direct that the 
Committees on Appropriations be consulted regarding 
reorganizations of offices, programs, and activities prior to 
the planned implementation of such reorganizations.
      The conferees also direct that the Departments of 
Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, as well as 
the Corporation for National and Community Service, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Chemical Safety and 
Hazard Investigation Board shall submit operating plans, signed 
by the respective secretary, administrator, or agency head, for 
review by the Committees on Appropriations of both the House 
and Senate within 60 days of enactment of this Act. Other 
agencies within this Act should continue to submit operating 
plans consistent with prior year policy, or as directed in this 
statement of the managers.
      The conferees reiterate language proposed by the House 
regarding the Committees' longstanding position that while the 
Committees reserve the right to call upon all offices in the 
departments, agencies, boards, and commissions, access to the 
budget offices is essential.

                TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

      In addition to the directives above, the conferees direct 
that no changes may be made to any account or objective, except 
as approved by the Committees, if it is construed to be policy 
or change in policy. It is the intent of the conferees that all 
carryover funds in the various appropriations accounts are 
subject to the normal reprogramming requirements outlined 
above. The Department is directed to notify the Committees on 
Appropriations should the loan limitation of any program 
administered by the Department be met or exceeded.

                    Veterans Benefits Administration

                       COMPENSATION AND PENSIONS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $29,845,127,000 for compensation and 
pensions as proposed by both the House and the Senate, of which 
not more than $17,056,000 is to be transferred to general 
operating expenses and medical services.

                         READJUSTMENT BENEFITS

      Appropriates $2,529,734,000 for readjustment benefits as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                   VETERANS INSURANCE AND INDEMNITIES

      Appropriates $29,017,000 for veterans insurance and 
indemnities as proposed by both the House and the Senate.

         VETERANS HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAM FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates such sums as may be necessary for costs 
associated with direct and guaranteed loans from the veterans 
housing benefit program fund program account as proposed by 
both the House and the Senate, plus $154,850,000 to be 
transferred to and merged with general operating expenses.

                  EDUCATION LOAN FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $1,000 for the costs of direct loans from 
the education loan fund program account as proposed by both the 
House and the Senate, plus $70,000 to be transferred to and 
merged with general operating expenses.

            VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $52,000 for the costs of direct loans from 
the vocational rehabilitation loans program account as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate, plus $300,000 to be 
transferred to and merged with general operating expenses.

          NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $571,000 for administrative expenses of the 
native American housing loan program account to be transferred 
to and merged with general operating expenses as proposed by 
both the House and the Senate. Provides a loan limitation of 
$50,000,000 for the program instead of $40,000,000 as proposed 
by the House. The Senate did not provide a loan limitation for 
this program.

  GUARANTEED TRANSITIONAL HOUSING LOANS FOR HOMELESS VETERANS PROGRAM 
                                ACCOUNT

      Provides up to $600,000 of the funds available in medical 
services and general operating expenses to carry out the 
guaranteed transitional housing loans for homeless veterans 
program instead of $350,000 as proposed by the House and 
$750,000 as proposed by the Senate. Retains the reporting 
requirement regarding the status of the loan program as 
proposed by the Senate. The conferees are concerned that this 
program simply does not meet the needs of the organizations for 
which it is intended.

                     Veterans Health Administration

      The conferees have agreed to provide total resources of 
$28,569,220,000 to fund the various operating programs of the 
Veterans Health Administration (VHA), an increase of 
$1,570,000,000 over the appropriation request level. None of 
the funds are contingent upon an emergency declaration. 
Further, the conferees have agreed to fund VHA through a new 
account structure comprised of four accounts: medical services, 
medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and 
prosthetic research. The conferees have taken this action to 
provide better oversight and receive a more accurate accounting 
of funds.

                            MEDICAL SERVICES

      Provides $17,867,220,000 to finance medical services for 
all veterans and beneficiaries in VA, State, and contract 
medical facilities.
      Deletes bill language proposed by the House and the 
Senate delaying the availability of funds.
      Retains bill language making $1,100,000,000 available 
until September 30, 2005, as proposed by the Senate.
      Retains bill language providing the Secretary with the 
authority to establish a priority system for veterans seeking 
medical care as proposed by the Senate. The House included 
similar authority as an administrative provision.
      Retains bill language proposed by the Senate allowing the 
Secretary to give priority to medical services for priority 1-6 
veterans. The House instead proposed a separate account for 
priority 1-6 veterans.
      Retains bill language allowing the transfer of up to 
$400,000,000 to the construction, major projects account for 
the purposes of implementing Capital Asset Realignment for 
Enhanced Services (CARES) recommendations as proposed by the 
Senate. The conferees direct the VA to notify the Committees on 
Appropriations prior to the transfer of funds for this purpose 
as stated in Senate Report 108-143.
      Modifies bill language proposed by the Senate allowing 
the Secretary to fill privately written prescriptions from VA 
facilities for designated veterans. The conferees agree that 
such benefit should not result in additional cost to the VA. 
The House did not include a similar provision. The conferees 
direct the Secretary to collect and independently verify data 
on the costs and benefits of this new drug benefit and submit a 
report to the Committees on Appropriations by March 2, 2004, 
detailing the number of veterans who would utilize such 
benefit, as well as costs or savings to the VA.
      Moves bill language proposed by the Senate in medical 
care directing the Secretary to conduct a recovery audit 
program. Instead, the conference agreement includes the 
provision under administrative provisions as proposed by the 
House.
      Moves bill language proposed by the Senate transferring 
the balances from the medical care collections fund into 
medical care for the purposes of that account. Instead, the 
conference agreement includes a similar provision as a separate 
section under administrative provisions.
      Reiterates report language included in House Report 108-
235 directing the establishment of two Mental Illness Research, 
Education and Clinic Centers.
      Reiterates language included in Senate Report 108-143 
directing VA to collaborate fully with the Department of 
Defense in the VET-HEAL program.
      The conferees encourage the VA to continue developing 
collaborative agreements with medical schools at Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities and minority serving 
institutions in the areas of research, residency programs and 
the delivery of health care services.
      The conferees strongly encourage the Department to pursue 
aggressively new technologies available for diagnosing 
colorectal cancer which are less invasive, less expensive and 
provide equal or better patient evaluations than older methods.
      The conferees urge the Department to provide by April 2, 
2004, information on VA compliance rates with VHA Directive 
2003-017, the treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), 
and an evaluation of FDA-approved technologies which could 
assist doctors in meeting the goals of that directive.

                         MEDICAL ADMINISTRATION

      Appropriates $5,000,000,000 for the expenses of the 
headquarters offices of the Veterans Health Administration as 
well as the costs of Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 
offices and facility directors, all information technology 
hardware and software, legal services, billing and coding 
activities, procurement, and related activities.
      Includes language allowing $150,000,000 of the funds to 
be available until September 30, 2005.
      The conferees agree that the Department must continue 
research oversight activities at a level not less than directed 
in the fiscal year 2003 appropriations Act. Further, the 
conferees reiterate the language contained in House Report 108-
235 regarding the reporting and consulting requirements of the 
oversight board.
      The conferees are concerned that the realignment 
recommendations of the CARES Commission may lead to a reduction 
in long-term care, domiciliary care, and mental health 
services. The VA is expected to expedite the strategic planning 
process for these services. Based on the Secretary's statements 
the conferees urge that no closures or reduction in long-term 
care, domiciliary care, and mental health services will take 
place until the full analysis is completed. The VA should 
submit updates on their progress in this effort to the 
Committees on Appropriations.
      The conferees encourage the VA to consider all travel 
issues, such as road conditions, number of lanes on access 
highways, and seasonal changes in and other factors relating to 
the weather, in any analysis on the future needs of veterans 
health care. Further, the CARES Commission should give as much 
attention to solving the special needs of veterans who live in 
rural areas as it does to providing for the health care needs 
of veterans living in more highly populated areas and include 
in its recommendations investments and initiatives to achieve 
the Department's accessibility standard for primary health care 
in rural and highly-rural health care markets.
      The conferees recognize the benefits of and the need to 
have CARES-related hearings within 30 miles of all facilities 
facing closure or a significant realignment of services, as 
well as the need for veterans participation at these hearings. 
The VA is encouraged to hold hearings in all affected 
communities following the Secretary's final recommendation.
      Finally, the conferees direct the Secretary, prior to 
implementing any facility closure as recommended in the final 
CARES plan, to develop recommendations for future use of such 
facilities (including, but not limited to, enhanced-use lease 
opportunities and clinics) and submit a report to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations on the recommendations for 
each facility.
      To ensure improved security, greater control, and unified 
manageability of information technology systems, the conferees 
direct the VA to consolidate critical applications including 
all business/corporate applications, messaging, office 
automation, and relevant medical systems applications at no 
more than six sites nationwide for the purpose of providing 
business continuity capabilities between each site to ensure 
continuity of operations of mission critical VA activities.

                           MEDICAL FACILITIES

      Appropriates $4,000,000,000 for the operation, 
maintenance and security of VHA's capital infrastructure. 
Included under this heading are provisions for the costs 
associated with utilities, engineering, capital planning, 
leases, laundry and food services, grounds keeping, garbage, 
housekeeping, facility repair, and property disposition and 
acquisition. None of the funds for the land and structures 
object classifications are subject to delay.
      Inserts new language allowing $150,000,000 of the funds 
to be available until September 30, 2005.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to 
make the North Chicago VA Medical Center available to the Navy 
to the maximum extent feasible, including the modification of 
its surgical suites. The conferees also direct the Secretary to 
finalize, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, site 
selection for a new joint Navy/VA ambulatory care center to 
serve both veterans and active duty naval personnel in this 
community. The conferees urge the Secretary to study the 
placement of the clinic adjacent to the North Chicago VA 
Medical Center. The Secretary shall report to the Committees on 
Appropriations on the site selection and progress on the 
surgical suite and urgent care modifications by July 30, 2004.
      The conferees are aware of a pending enhanced-use lease 
agreement between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the 
City of Fort Thomas, Kentucky for twelve residential buildings. 
The conferees direct the Secretary, prior to executing the 
enhanced-use lease agreement, to offer to transfer one of the 
residential properties to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to 
be used as the residence for the Commander of the Great Lakes 
and Ohio River Division, if the Secretary determines it is 
cost-beneficial to the Department. As a condition of the 
transfer, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will assume 
responsibility and costs for all utilities and all related 
access issues of the transferred property, and property 
compliance with City historic preservation codes and any 
residential association regulations. Further, the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers will grant an access easement to recognize 
the existing alley that is used for vehicular access to the 
adjacent properties.

                    MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH

      Appropriates $408,000,000 for medical and prosthetic 
research as proposed by the House instead of $413,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conferees direct the continued 
partnership with the National Technology Transfer Center at the 
current level of effort.

                      Departmental Administration

                       GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES

      Appropriates $1,283,272,000 for general operating 
expenses as proposed by both the House and Senate.
      Provides not less than $1,005,000,000 for the Veterans 
Benefits Administration (VBA) as proposed by the House instead 
of $1,004,704,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Provides two-year availability for $66,000,000 as 
proposed by the House instead of $64,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Deletes the travel limitation proposed by the House. The 
Senate did not include a travel limitation.
      The conferees direct VA to proceed with information 
technology initiatives supporting the Department's enterprise 
architecture and continuity of operations capabilities and 
direct that not less than $25,000,000 be allocated for these 
activities Department-wide.
      The conferees encourage the Department to undertake the 
conversion of paper claims at the VBA to a digital format 
consistent with the paperless claim initiative.

                    NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION

      Appropriates $144,203,000 for the National Cemetery 
Administration as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$144,223,000 as proposed by the House. Provides two-year 
obligation authority for $7,200,000 of the appropriated funds 
as proposed by the Senate instead of one-year availability for 
all funds as proposed by the House.
      The conferees strongly urge the Department to continue 
efforts at the Johnson's Island Cemetery in Sandusky, Ohio to 
determine if veterans are interned under a roadway bordering 
the cemetery and report back to the Committees on 
Appropriations of their findings.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      Appropriates $62,000,000 for the Office of Inspector 
General instead of $62,250,000 as proposed by the Senate and 
$61,750,000 as proposed by the House.

                      CONSTRUCTION, MAJOR PROJECTS

      Appropriates $272,690,000 for construction, major 
projects as proposed by the Senate instead of $274,690,000 as 
proposed by the House. The conferees have included bill 
language proposed by the Senate which defines a major 
construction project as one where the estimated cost is more 
than the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 8104(a)(3)(A), instead 
of a definite dollaramount as proposed by the House. The 
conferees are aware that the authorizing committees of jurisdiction 
have legislation pending which would raise the current $4,000,000 
project threshold and have referenced the appropriate citation in lieu 
of a dollar amount in anticipation of new legislation.
      The conference agreement includes $181,000,000 to support 
construction projects supporting recommendations of the CARES 
plan, instead of $173,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$183,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Additional 
recommendations of the conferees are as follows:

      The conferees direct continued efforts and planning to 
co-locate the Denver VA Medical Center with the University of 
Colorado Hospital and a Department of Defense medical facility 
at the Fitzsimmons campus.
      The conference agreement does not include specific 
planning funds for a clinic at the Defense Supply Center due to 
a lack of authorization, but the conferees encourage the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to continue working with the 
Secretary of Defense to identify a suitable construction site 
in anticipation of future project authorization.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to 
continue the current development of a cemetery annex on 
property transferred from the Miramar Naval Air Station.
      The conferees reiterate language included in Senate 
Report 108-143 and House Report 108-235 regarding the disposal 
of the Lakeside VA Medical Center, full funding for 
implementation of the CARES recommendations, public-private 
partnerships for new facility construction, a requirement that 
the Department submit a comprehensive CARES plan, and the 
requirement that all construction be consistent with CARES or 
the national cemetery studies.

                      CONSTRUCTION, MINOR PROJECTS

      Appropriates 252,144,000 for construction, minor projects 
as proposed by both the House and the Senate. The conferees 
have included bill language proposed by the Senate which 
defines a minor construction project as one where the estimated 
cost is equal to or less than the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 
8104(a)(3)(A), instead of a definite dollar amount as proposed 
by the House. The conferees are aware that the authorizing 
committees of jurisdiction have legislation pending which would 
raise the current 4,000,000 project threshold and have 
referenced the appropriate citation in lieu of a dollar amount 
in anticipation of new legislation.
      The conference agreement provides up to 40,000,000, 
instead of 35,000,000 as proposed by the House and 42,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate, for construction projects 
implementing CARES recommendations, to be available upon 
notification of and approval by the Committees on 
Appropriations.
      The conferees strongly urge the Department to allocate a 
greater percentage of its construction budget for quality and 
safety improvements to research facilities.
      The conferees reiterate language contained in House 
Report 108-235 regarding the requirement that all VA 
construction be consistent with CARES or the national cemetery 
studies, project approval by a central VA capital review board, 
and Deputy Secretary approval for any group of projects where 
the total costs exceed the major/minor construction threshold.
      The conferees direct the Department to proceed with the 
planned acquisition and development of a parking lot at the St. 
Louis VA Medical Center, John J. Cochran Division, using 
appropriations previously provided for in construction, minor 
projects. The Department is encouraged to explore the 
possibility of an enhanced-use lease partnership to establish a 
structured parking facility on the site.

                         PARKING REVOLVING FUND

      The conference agreement does not include the House 
proposal for a separate parking revolving fund account. Rather, 
the conferees have agreed to the administrative provision 
proposed by the Senate which deposits receipts from the parking 
revolving fund into the medicalcare collections fund for 
medical services. Authority for construction or alteration of a parking 
facility is now included under the construction, major projects and 
construction, minor projects accounts.

       GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE EXTENDED CARE FACILITIES

      Appropriates $102,100,000 for grants for construction of 
state extended care facilities as proposed by both the House 
and the Senate.
      The conferees encourage the Department to work with the 
State of New Jersey as that state applies for a grant.

          GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE VETERANS CEMETERIES

      Appropriates $32,000,000 for grants for construction of 
state veterans cemeteries as proposed by both the House and the 
Senate.

                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

                    (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

      Retains the first twelve administrative provisions which 
were carried in both the House and Senate bills, and which have 
been carried in previous years.
      Retains the provision proposed by the Senate allowing the 
Department to reimburse the Office of Resolution Management up 
to $29,318,000 and the Office of Employment Discrimination 
Complaint Adjudication up to $3,059,000 from fiscal year 2004 
salary and expenses accounts.
      Retains the provision proposed by the House providing 
$25,000,000 of VA's total information technology budget for 
enterprise architecture activities under the Office of the 
Chief Information Officer.
      Retains the provision proposed by the Senate regarding 
implementation of Public Law 107-287 by prohibiting funds for 
implementation of section 2 and section 5.
      Deletes the provision proposed by the House allowing the 
Secretary to establish a priority system for veterans seeking 
medical services. The conference agreement instead includes in 
medical services a similar provision proposed by the Senate in 
medical care.
      Retains the provision proposed by the Senate merging 
various receipt accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
into the Medical Care Collections Fund.
      Retains the provision proposed by the House directing the 
Secretary to conduct a recovery audit program.
      Retains the provision proposed by the Senate allowing the 
Secretary to transfer enhanced-use lease revenue from the 
Medical Care Collections Fund to the construction accounts.
      Retains the provision proposed by the House allowing the 
Secretary to furnish recreation services and pay funeral 
expenses. The Senate proposed an almost identical provision 
under medical care.
      Modifies the provision transferring all balances in the 
medical care collections fund to medical services. Both the 
House and Senate included provisions transferring the receipts 
from the medical care collections fund to medical accounts in 
different parts of the bill.
      Modifies language proposed by the House allowing the 
transfer of funds between Veterans Health Administration 
accounts.
      Deletes without prejudice language proposed by the House 
renaming the Houston VAMC. The conferees defer to the 
jurisdiction of the relevant authorizing committees.
      Deletes the provision proposed by the House directing the 
Secretary to report on sharing agreements with the Department 
of Defense. Report language is instead included under the 
medical facilities account.
      Inserts a provision directing VA to implement the revised 
VHA account structure within 90 days of enactment and to submit 
the fiscal year 2005 budget justification using the account 
structure included in this Act.
      Inserts a provision rescinding $270,000,000 of prior year 
funds from medical care. This funding is re-appropriated to 
medical services. The Senate proposed an identical provision 
under medical care.

         TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT

      The conferees restate the reprogramming requirements with 
respect to amounts approved for each appropriations account 
within this title. The Department must limit the reprogramming 
of funds between the programs, projects, and activities within 
each account to not more than $500,000 without prior approval 
of the Committees on Appropriations. Unless otherwise 
identified in this statement of managers or committee reports, 
the most detailed allocation of funds presented in the budget 
justifications shall be considered to be approved, with any 
deviation from such approved allocation subject to the normal 
reprogramming requirements outlined above. Further, it is the 
intent of the conferees that all carryover funds in the various 
accounts, including recaptures and deobligations, are subject 
to the normal reprogramming requirements outlined above. 
Further, no changes may be made to any program, project, or 
activity if it is construed to be policy or a change in policy, 
without prior approval of the Committees. Finally, the 
conferees expect to be notified regarding reorganizations of 
offices, programs or activities prior to the planned 
implementation of such reorganizations, as well as be notified, 
on a monthly basis, of all ongoing litigation, including any 
negotiations or discussions, planned or ongoing, regarding a 
consent decree between the Department and any other entity.

                       Public and Indian Housing

                        HOUSING CERTIFICATE FUND

              (INCLUDING TRANSFER AND RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $19,371,481,762 instead of $18,580,606,000 
as proposed by the House and $18,433,606,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. This amount is $2,259,868,941 over the amounts provided 
in fiscal year 2003 and represents a 13.2 percent increase. The 
conference agreement does not include language proposed by the 
Senate to require the Secretary to make available other funds 
should funds provided be insufficient.
      In lieu of any direction included in the House and Senate 
reports, unless otherwise provided for below, the Department is 
directed to use the guidance set forth below in administering 
the programs under this account in fiscal year 2004.
      The conference agreement includes language to allocate 
funds among the various activities as follows:
      Renewals.--The conference agreement provides a total of 
$17,635,130,745 for renewals of section 8 vouchers, section 8 
project-based assistance, and moderate rehabilitation 
contracts, instead of $16,445,578,000 as proposed by the House 
and $16,202,616,000 as proposed by the Senate. The amount 
provided represents a $2,467,419,924, or 16 percent, increase 
over the fiscal year 2003 level for renewals.
      Pursuant to the budget request, the conference agreement 
assumes funding for project-based section 8 contract amendment 
needs in fiscal year 2004 will be met through recaptures.
      The conferees are concerned about the spiraling increase 
in the cost of providing assistance under the voucher program. 
The conferees are aware that the national average cost per 
voucher has increased at a rate of more than double the average 
increase in the private rental market in each of the last two 
years, including a 10 percent increase in 2002 and an 
additional estimated 9 percent increase in 2003. At the same 
time, the rental housing market has softened. The conferees are 
aware that the Secretary has the administrative authority to 
control the rapidly rising costs of renewing expiring annual 
contributions contracts (ACC), including the budget based 
practice of renewing expiring ACCs, and expect the Secretary to 
utilize these tools.
      Because of the alarming increases to the cost of rents 
under the section 8 tenant-based program the conferees direct 
HUD to report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations by July 31, 2004, on the underlying reasons for 
these annual increases in the average costs of section 8 rents. 
While the conferees support efforts by PHAs to increase their 
utilization of vouchers to serve additional families, PHAs must 
manage their programs in a prudent manner to maximize the 
number of families served. Therefore, the report needs to (1) 
identify all the laws, regulations and policies that currently 
govern the setting of voucher rents; (2) review the 
implementation of these laws, regulations and policies by 
public housing agencies and HUD in areas where the voucher 
rents appear to be inconsistent with the cost of comparable 
housing in the unsubsidized rental housing market; (3) the 
costs associated with such laws, regulations and policies; and 
(4) recommendations to maximize the delivery of assistance 
under the section 8 program.
      Language proposed by the Senate is not included to limit 
the contract terms for renewals under the Emergency Low Income 
Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPRA) and the Low Income 
Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 
(LIHPRA). The House did not propose a similar provision. To the 
extent that the renewal of such contracts is in the best 
interest of the Federal government, the Department may enter 
into contract terms consistent with other project-based 
programs. However, the conferees direct that funding for such 
renewals be limited to a one-year term as required in the 
annual appropriations Act.
      Language is included, modified from language proposed by 
the House and Senate, to renew expiring section 8 tenant-based 
annual contributions contracts for each public housing agency 
based on the total number of unit months reported under lease 
by the PHA on its most recent end-of-year financial statement 
or as adjusted by such additional information submitted by the 
PHA as of August 1, 2003, and by applying an inflation factor 
based on local or regional inflation factors to the actual per 
unit cost.
      Language is included as proposed by the House prohibiting 
funds from being used to support a total number of unit months 
under lease which exceeds a PHA's authorized level of units 
under contract, instead of language proposed by the Senate 
authorizing funds to be used to fund over-leased units under 
certain conditions.
      The conferees direct the Department to allow maximum 
flexibility under the law in order to allow PHAs to be 
temporarily over-issued and/or over-leased due to efforts to 
reach full leasing. While PHAs may become temporarily over-
leased, they may not, at any time, exceed their total unit 
month allocation (12 months times total number of authorized 
vouchers) for its fiscal year.
      If a PHA over-issues and over-leases vouchers to such an 
extent that it exceeds its total unit month allocation for its 
fiscal year, the Department shall take any appropriate action 
to ensure that funding for such over-leasing does not occur, 
including the recapture or withholding of funds. In addition, 
the Department may take whatever administrative actions are 
available to it to reprimand or sanction PHAs that have over-
issued or over-leased in a manner that displays a negligent or 
intentional disregard for the limits on voucher renewals and 
leasing set by the Congress.
      The conferees understand that during 2003 some PHAs over-
issued and over-leased vouchers to a level that exceeds their 
maximum total unit month allocation. The conferees expect such 
PHAs to take all actions necessary to stay within their fiscal 
year 2004 total unit month allocation and direct the Department 
to ensure compliance with such limitation. In the interim, such 
PHAs may use balances derived from funds provided prior to 
fiscal year 2003 that remain in their administrative fee 
reserves and program reserves, if necessary, to ensure that 
currently housed families may continue to use their section 8 
vouchers. However, in no case shall funds derived from fiscal 
year 2003 appropriations or funds provided in this Act be used 
for such purpose.
      Central Reserve Fund.--$136,846,017 for a central reserve 
fund instead of $568,503,000 as proposed by the House and 
$461,329,000 as proposed by the Senate. Modified language is 
included to allow the Secretary to use the Central Fund, as 
necessary, for additional units not under lease on August 1, 
2003, but not to exceed the authorized contracted level. 
Language proposed by the House and Senate is not included to 
allow the Central Fund to also be used for increased per unit 
costs as such costs have been reflected in the amount provided 
for renewals.
      Language is included as proposed by the House prohibiting 
funds made available in the central fund from being used to 
support a total number of units under lease in excess of a 
PHA's authorized level of units. The Senate proposed language 
to require the Secretary to make available funds for additional 
units under lease to maintain a PHA's authorized voucher level 
throughout the year, including turnover and reissued vouchers 
is not included. In addition, language proposed by the Senate 
requiring the Secretary to make available other funds should 
the amount provided be insufficient to maintain such a level is 
not included.
      Language proposed by the Senate is not included 
authorizing the Secretary to use up to $36,000,000 from the 
central fund for incremental vouchers for non-elderly and 
disabled families impacted by elderly-only designations in 
public housing. The House did not include similar language.
      Modified language is included, similar to language 
proposed by the House, requiring the Secretary to submit 
quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations on the 
obligation of funds provided in the central fund. Such report 
shall include the following: the amounts made available from 
the central fund provided for additional units not under lease 
as of August 1, 2003, delineated by PHA, and the total balance 
remaining in the fund. The first such report is due no later 
than May 1, 2004.
      Tenant Protection.--$206,495,000 for rental subsidies for 
tenant protection activities to replace project-based section 8 
assistance with section 8 vouchers, for conversion of section 
202 and section 23 projects to section 8 assistance, for the 
family reunification program and for the witness protection 
program, as proposed by the House instead of $252,203,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Family Self Sufficiency Coordinators.--$48,000,000 for 
service coordinator staff in each public housing agency as 
proposed by the House, instead of $72,000,000 as proposed by 
the Senate.
      Administrative Costs--Section 8 Voucher Program.--Not to 
exceed $1,242,000,000 for PHA administrative costs and other 
expenses, instead of $1,209,020,000 as proposed by the House 
and $1,339,448,400 as proposed by the Senate.
      In lieu of language proposed by the Senate to allocate 
funds pursuant to the formula specified in section 8(q) of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 and language proposed by the 
House giving the Secretary the flexibility to determine the 
allocation of funds, the conference agreement includes new 
language as described below.
      Of this amount, not to exceed $1,192,000,000 shall be 
allocated on a pro rata basis to PHAs based on the amount of 
funding they were eligible to receive in 2003 or would have 
been eligible to receive notwithstanding the reductions due to 
excess administrative fee balances pursuant to the fiscal year 
2003 Act. In addition, up to $50,000,000 is available to be 
allocated at the Secretary's discretion to PHAs that need 
additional funds to administer their section 8 programs in 
fiscal year 2004. New language is also included requiring that 
these funds be distributed as provided for in this Act 
notwithstanding any other provision of law.
      Language is included as proposed by the House prohibiting 
any funds provided under this, or any other Act, from being 
used to supplement the amounts designated in this account for 
administrative expenses. The Senate did not include similar 
language.
      Modified language is included similar to language 
proposed by the House limiting the use of section 8 
administrative reserves to activities related to the provision 
of section 8 rental assistance, including related development 
activities. The Senate did not include similar language.
      Language proposed by the House is not included to require 
the Secretary to recapture certain unspent administrative fees. 
The Senate did not include similar language.
      The conferees are concerned that neither HUD nor the 
public housing agencies complied fully with requirements in the 
FY 2003 appropriations Act that reduced the payment of section 
8 administrative fees to public housing agencies based on the 
amount of funds in their administrative fee accounts as of 
January 31, 2003. The conferees understand that the amounts 
PHAs disclosed to HUD to comply with the requirements of the 
Act were far less than expected. Therefore, the conferees 
direct GAO to review compliance with the provisions of the Act. 
GAO is expected to report on these issues no later than April 
10, 2004, to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
      Administrative Costs--Project-Based Section 8 Program.--
$100,000,000 for contractors to administer the project-based 
section 8 program, the same amount proposed by the House and 
Senate.
      Working Capital Fund.--Not less than $3,010,000 for 
transfer to the Working Capital Fund for the development of and 
modifications to information technology systems as proposed by 
both the House and the Senate.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
proposed by the Senate bill to designate up to $3,000,000 for 
an outside audit of the funds included for the various programs 
covered by the Housing Certificate Fund. The House did not 
include a similar provision. Instead, the conferees direct GAO 
to conduct an audit of this account, including a review of how 
funds are accounted for and allocated by program and activity. 
The report should identify the sources and uses for section 8 
funds obligated by the Department in fiscal years 2002 and 
2003. In particular, GAO should review HUD's method of 
accounting for all programs and activities covered by this 
account as well as how public housing agencies maintain and 
account for their use of these funds for each program and 
activity (including the use of section 8 reserves and how 
public housing agencies track expenditures). The final report 
on the findings in the audit is due to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations no later than July 15, 2004, and 
is directed to include recommendations to improve the quality 
and timeliness of information as to the actual costs of each 
program and activity and the amount of any carryover or unused 
funds.
      The conferees direct the Department to provide a report 
to the Committees on Appropriations no later than April 1, 
2004, on the status of implementation of the Public and Indian 
Housing Information Center (PIC).
      Language is included as proposed by the House allowing 
the Secretary to transfer up to 15 percent of the funds 
provided for renewals, the central fund and administrative fees 
to supplement amounts provided for renewals and the central 
fund under certain circumstances and in accordance with certain 
procedures. The Senate proposed similar language.
      Includes language permanently requiring all PHAs to 
submit accounting data for funds provided under this account in 
this Act or any other Act by source of funds and purpose of 
such funds as proposed by the Senate. The House did not include 
similar language.
      Includes language rescinding $2,844,000,000 from 
unobligated balances of funds appropriated in fiscal year 2003 
and prior years, instead of $1,372,000,000 as proposed by the 
House and the Senate. Includes language allowing unobligated 
balances in programs governed by reallocation provisions to be 
used to meet this rescission as proposed by the House and the 
Senate.

                      PUBLIC HOUSING CAPITAL FUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $2,712,255,000 for the public housing 
capital fund as proposed by the House instead of $2,641,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      Does not include language proposed by the House and 
Senate designating a portion of funds to be allocated only to 
those PHAs that have met certain obligation and expenditure 
requirements, nor is language included proposed by the House to 
nullify such requirements upon publication of a final rule 
implementing the obligation and expenditure requirements set 
forth in the Quality Housing and Workforce Responsibility Act 
of 1998 (QHWRA). The conferees note that the provisions 
proposed in both bills were carried in prior appropriations 
Acts as an interim procedure to allocate funds to high 
performing PHAs until such time as the Department implemented 
the timeliness requirements set forth in section 9(j) of QHWRA. 
The conferees understand that the Department has implemented 
such provisions and will allocate the amounts provided in 
fiscal year 2004 in accordance with the procedures and 
requirements set forth in such section, obviating the need for 
the interim procedures.
      Includes modified language, similar to language proposed 
by the House and Senate and carried in prior years, regarding 
the delegation of waiver authority and the definition of the 
term ``obligate''.
      Includes $50,000,000 for technical assistance including 
up to $13,000,000 for remediation services to certain troubled 
PHAs as proposed by the Senate, instead of $51,000,000 for 
technical assistance including up to $13,000,000 for 
remediation services to troubled PHAs as proposed by the House.
      Includes no less than $10,610,000 for information 
technology systems and up to $500,000 for section 23 projects 
as proposed by both the House and Senate.
      Includes up to $40,000,000 for emergency capital needs 
resulting from emergencies or natural disasters in fiscal year 
2004 as proposed by the House. The Senate proposed similar 
language.
      Includes $15,000,000 for Neighborhood Networks grants to 
be awarded on a competitive basis as proposed by the Senate. 
The House did not include funding for this purpose. Language is 
included, similar to language proposed by the Senate, requiring 
such funds to be competitively awarded. The conferees remind 
HUD that these funds, and all other funds provided in this Act, 
are to be awarded on a competitive basis in accordance with the 
requirements set forth in section 205 under administrative 
provisions in this title.
      The conference agreement does not include $125,000,000 
for a new loan financing program of public housing proposed by 
the Senate to be authorized in an administrative provision in 
this title. The conferees further understand that 92 PHAs have 
successfully utilized $313,556,000 in public housing funds to 
leverage $1,012,149,000 in private sector financing to address 
capital modernization needs. The conferees encourage PHAs to 
continue to pursue such partnerships. The conferees encourage 
the authorization committees to explore additional alternative 
financing tools to leverage private sector financing for 
capital improvements in public housing. The House did not include 
similar funding or language.
      The conferees reiterate the direction included in the 
House report regarding quarterly reports on the obligation and 
expenditure of capital funds with the first report due no later 
than February 2, 2004.

                     PUBLIC HOUSING OPERATING FUND

      Appropriates $3,600,000,000 for the public housing 
operating fund as proposed by the House instead of 
$3,576,600,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Language is included specifying that funds provided in 
this Act are to be used only for 2004 payments to public 
housing authorities as proposed by the House. Language is also 
included permanently prohibiting funds provided in this Act and 
any other Act from being used for payments to public housing 
agencies for the operating costs of public housing for any year 
prior to the current year of such Act as proposed by Senate. 
The House proposed similar language. The conferees have 
included such language to ensure that funds appropriated are 
used for current year operating subsidies payments rather than 
to augment the amount of prior year operating subsidy payments 
above the level appropriated in such year, a previous practice 
which the Committees have questioned as a violation of 
appropriations law.
      Language is included making $10,000,000 available for 
programs to assist in the investigation, prosecution and 
prevention of criminal activities in public housing to be 
administered through a reimbursable agreement with the 
Department of Justice (DOJ). The conferees expect that HUD 
determine, in consultation with DOJ, the priorities in the 
allocation of these funds.

     REVITALIZATION OF SEVERELY DISTRESSED PUBLIC HOUSING (HOPE VI)

      Appropriates $150,000,000 for the revitalization of 
severely distressed public housing program (HOPE VI), instead 
of $195,115,000 as proposed by the Senate and $50,000,000 as 
proposed by the House.
      Language is included making funds available for 
obligation until September 30, 2005, as proposed by the House, 
instead of providing no-year authority as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Of the amount provided, the conference agreement includes 
$4,000,000 for technical assistance, instead of $5,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $3,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Language is not included setting forth certain conditions 
and requirements on the recapture of funds from grants awarded 
under the HOPE VI program prior to fiscal year 1998 as proposed 
by the Senate. The House did not address this matter. The 
conferees encourage HUD to continue to work with public housing 
authorities to ensure timely completion of projects, but 
recognize that not all grantees are making such progress. The 
conferees understand the Secretary has the authority to take 
action against grantees which have failed to meet the 
requirements associated with such grants, including but not 
limited to, the recapture of funds. The conferees understand 
that beginning in March 2002 HUD began to take a series of 
actions to improve its oversight of HOPE VI grantees including 
developing and implementing enforcement actions, remedies and 
penalties for nonperformance. In addition, a May 2003 General 
Accounting Office (GAO) review of HUD's HOPE VI grant selection 
and oversight processes made several recommendations including 
development of a formal written enforcement policy to hold 
public housing authorities accountable for the status of their 
grants. The conferees request the Department submit a report to 
the Committees on Appropriations, no later than February 1, 
2004, which identifies the changes implemented and planned to 
improve HUD's oversight of HOPE VI grantees; the status of each 
HOPE VI project funded prior to 1999 and any actions taken to 
ensure timely completion of such project; the Department's 
plans for implementing the recommendations made by GAO; and 
proposed alternative housing strategies to mitigate the impact 
of a recapture of funds on residents of failed HOPE VI 
projects.

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $654,100,000 instead of $661,600,000 as 
proposed by the House and $646,600,000 as proposed by the

training, and technical assistance instead of $5,000,000 as

      Of the total amount, $2,000,000 is for guaranteed loans 
to subsidize a total guaranteed loan principal of up to

subsidize a total loan volume of up to $8,049,000 as proposed 
by the House.
      The Department is directed to submit the report required 
by section 9 of Public Law 107-292 on the extent of black mold 
infestation of Native American housing in the United States, 
and recommendations to address the infestation, by December 15, 
2004.

      Appropriates $1,035,000 for guaranteed loans for Native 
Hawaiian housing to subsidize a total guaranteed loan principal 
of up to $39,712,000 as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$1,000,000 to subsidize a total loan principal of up to 
$35,347,985 as proposed by the House.

      Language proposed by the Senate to exempt existing 
grantees from changes resulting from Federal government-wide 
changes in designations in metropolitan statistical areas is 
not included. The House did not include a similar provision.

                 RURAL HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

      Appropriates $25,000,000 for rural housing and economic 
development as proposed by both the House and Senate. Language 
is included requiring funds to be awarded competitively as

distributed on a competitive basis in accordance with the 
requirements set forth in section 205 under administrative 
provisions in this title.

      Appropriates $15,000,000 for grants to the second round 
of empowerment zones as proposed by the House. The Senate did

provide a report to the Committees not later than March 1, 
2004, on the status of the resolution of all audit findings.

                       COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $4,950,000,000 for various activities funded 
in this account as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$4,959,000,000 as proposed by the House. The conferees agree to 
the following:
      --$4,356,550,000 for formula grants under the Community

$35,500,000 for such activities including $31,500,000 for LISC

forth in section 305(c) of the Multifamily Housing Property 
Disposition Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 3547). The conferees will 
not entertain waivers of such requirements. In addition, funds

expenses incurred prior to the receipt of economic development 
initiative funding. Modified language is included, similar to 
language proposed by the House and Senate, to target funds made

                        HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides funding for the housing 
for the elderly (section 202) program and the housing for the 
disabled (section 811) program in two new accounts as proposed 
by the House rather than continuing funding for both programs 
under one account as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement recommends a total program level 
of $794,320,000 for the section 202 program. Of this amount, 
$778,320,000 is provided as a direct appropriation instead of 
$773,320,000 as proposed by the House and $783,286,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. In addition, $16,000,000 is derived 
from unobligated balances from funds provided for project-based 
rental assistance contracts (PRAC) renewals in fiscal year 2003 
that were not needed to meet this requirement and recaptures of 
excess prior year funds, as proposed by the House. The Senate 
did not address this matter.
      The conference allocates funds as follows:
      --$691,850,000 for new capital and PRAC contracts, 
instead of $695,850,000 as proposed by the House and 
$636,816,000 as proposed by the Senate;
      --$2,000,000 for one-year renewals of expiring PRAC 
payments as proposed by the House instead of $26,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conferees note that this amount 
represents the revised estimate of funding necessary for PRAC 
renewals in fiscal year 2004, however should additional funds 
be required the Department may reallocate funds from new 
capital grants as necessary subject to standard reprogramming 
requirements;
      --$50,000,000 for service coordinators and the 
continuation of congregate services grants as proposed by the 
House and Senate;
      --$30,000,000 for assisted living conversion grants and 
emergency capital repairs. The House proposed $25,000,000 for 
assisted living conversion grants and the Senate proposed 
$30,000,000 for assisted living conversion grants and 
substantial capital repair grants. Modified language is 
included designating these funds for assisted living conversion 
grants and for emergency capital repairs as determined by the 
Secretary.
      The conferees are aware of concerns regarding the long-
term conditions and needs of the sections 202 and 236 assisted 
housing stock. The conferees direct theDepartment to conduct a 
capital assessment of the stock and provide a report to the Committees 
on Appropriations not later than August 15, 2004, on alternatives to 
address such long-term needs. As part of this report, the conferees 
request that the Department examine whether the mechanisms used under 
the Mark-to-Market program for certain federally-insured properties can 
be applied to the section 202 and section 236 portfolios as a means of 
addressing such needs in a cost-effective manner;
      --$20,000,000 for competitive grants for planning, design 
and development activities for section 202 projects. These 
funds are to be allocated for project planning, preliminary 
design, site control activities and other development costs, 
including gap financing if appropriate, directly related to 
section 202 projects in order to facilitate timely completion 
of such projects. The conferees do not intend for these funds 
to be used for technical assistance but instead expect such 
funds to be used for start-up costs associated with such 
projects. Language is not included to create a revolving loan 
fund as proposed by the Senate. The conferees believe such 
needs can be addressed through this competitive grant program; 
and
      --no less than $470,000 for transfer to the Working 
Capital Fund for information technology activities.
      Language is included making funds available for 
obligation for three years as proposed by the House instead of 
four years as proposed by the Senate.
      Language is included transferring and merging all 
unexpended balances previously appropriated for the section 202 
program to this new account as proposed by the House. The 
Senate did not address this matter.

                 HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement recommends a total program level 
of $256,470,000 for the section 811 program. Of this amount, 
$250,570,000 is provided as a direct appropriation as proposed 
by the House and the Senate and an additional $5,900,000 is 
derived from unobligated balances from funds provided for 
project-based rental assistance contracts (PRAC) renewals in 
fiscal year 2003 that are not needed to meet this requirement 
and recaptures of excess prior year funds, as proposed by the 
House. The Senate did not address this matter.
      The conference allocates funds as follows:
      --$213,300,000 for new capital and PRAC contracts and new 
vouchers as proposed by the House. The Senate included 
$200,045,000 for this purpose under the Housing for Special 
Populations account;
      --$42,700,000 for one-year renewal costs of section 811 
rental assistance and expiring PRAC contracts as proposed by 
the House instead of $50,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conferees note that this amount represents the revised estimate 
of funding necessary for PRAC renewals in fiscal year 2004, 
however should additional funds be required the Department may 
reallocate funds from new capital grants as necessary subject 
to standard reprogramming requirements; and
      --no less than $470,000 for transfer to the Working 
Capital Fund for information technology activities.
      Language is included allowing the Secretary to designate 
up to 25 percent of funds, excluding amounts for voucher 
renewals, to be used for new voucher assistance for the 
disabled as proposed by the House and the Senate.
      Language is included making funds available for 
obligation for three years as proposed by the House instead of 
four years as proposed by the Senate.
      Language is included transferring and merging all 
unexpended balances previously appropriated for the section 811 
program to this new account as proposed by the House. The 
Senate did not address this matter.

                         FLEXIBLE SUBSIDY FUND

                          (TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Includes language regarding the transfer of excess rental 
charges to this fund as proposed by the House. Language 
proposed by the Senate is not included allowing certain excess 
rental charges to be refunded to owners rather than transferred 
to the Fund.

                       RENTAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE

                              (RESCISSION)

      Includes a rescission of up to $303,000,000 from 
recaptured excess section 236 funds resulting from the pre-
payment of such mortgages as proposed by the House and the 
Senate.

                  MANUFACTURED HOUSING FEES TRUST FUND

      Appropriates up to $13,000,000 for authorized activities 
from fees collected in the Fund as proposed by the House. The 
Senate included similar language.

                     Federal Housing Administration

               MUTUAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE PROGRAM ACCOUNT

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      Establishes an $185,000,000,000 limitation on commitments 
to guarantee single-family loans during fiscal year 2004 as 
proposed by the House and the Senate. The conferees do not 
concur with language proposed by the Senate regarding the 
appropriateness of the decision to change the point of 
obligation for this program. In lieu of such language 
addressing this matter, the conferees direct the Department to 
submit quarterly reports on the status of commitments as 
compared to the commitment limitation in addition to 
notification reports required by section 3(b) of Public Law 99-
289.
      Establishes a $50,000,000 limitation on direct loans to 
nonprofits and governmental entities in connection with the 
sale of HUD-owned single-family properties as proposed by the 
House and the Senate.
      Appropriates $359,000,000 for administrative expenses as 
proposed by both the House and Senate. Of this amount, 
$355,000,000 is to be transferred to the salaries and expenses 
account and not to exceed $4,000,000 is to be transferred to 
the Office of Inspector General as proposed by both the House 
and Senate.
      Appropriates $85,000,000 for administrative contract 
expenses and includes language allowing up to an additional 
$30,000,000 to be made available for such expenses in certain 
circumstances as proposed by both the House and Senate.
      Transfers no less than $20,744,000 from administrative 
contract expenses under this account to the Working Capital 
Fund for the development of and modifications to information 
technology systems as proposed by both the House and Senate.
      In lieu of the language included in the Senate report 
regarding the Asset Control Area program and revitalization 
areas, the conferees instead agree to require a report from the 
Department on revitalization area designations. The conferees 
direct HUD to submit a report no later than February 15, 2004, 
to the Committees on Appropriations that describes the criteria 
and methodology the Department uses to determine revitalization 
areas; lists the communities that have lost their 
revitalization area designation since June, 2002; and provides 
justification for the changes. The conferees understand that 
the Department is currently conducting a review of all 
revitalization areas, and expect that this review will be 
discussed in the report. The conferees expect that the 
Department will continue to recognize communities with high 
concentrations of HUD-foreclosed properties as revitalization 
areas. The conferees do not concur with the language in the 
Senate report regarding the withholding of salary payments to 
departmental employees responsible for administering this 
program.
      The conferees reiterate the guidance and direction 
included in the Senate report regarding language included under 
administrative provisions to publish a regulation to allow HUD 
to preclude certain buyers from purchasing foreclosed 
properties during the disposition process.

                GENERAL AND SPECIAL RISK PROGRAM ACCOUNT

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      Establishes a $25,000,000,000 limitation on multifamily 
and specialized loan guarantees during fiscal year 2004 as 
proposed by the House and the Senate.
      Appropriates $15,000,000 for subsidy costs to support 
certain multifamily and special purpose loan guarantee programs 
as proposed by the House and the Senate.
      In lieu of the language in the Senate report regarding 
the section 242 hospital insurance program, the conferees note 
that legislation was recently enacted that facilitates the 
availability of section 242 hospital insurance in states 
without a certificate of needprogram. This new authority should 
help geographically diversify the section 242 program which will help 
ensure the financial soundness of the program. The conferees direct HUD 
to report to the Committees on Appropriations no later than August 15, 
2004, on its efforts to geographically diversify the hospital insurance 
portfolio; assess overall financial risks from the section 242 program 
to the insurance fund; assess the importance of the section 242 program 
in meeting healthcare facility needs as compared to other public and 
private funding options; and any recommendations to improve the section 
242 program, including options to reduce the financial risk of the 
program. The Department is directed to consult with the Department of 
Health and Human Services in developing this report.

                Government National Mortgage Association

GUARANTEES OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM ACCOUNT

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $10,695,000 for administrative expenses to 
be transferred to the salaries and expenses account as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate.

                    Policy Development and Research

                        RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY

      Appropriates $47,000,000 for research and technology as 
proposed by both the House and Senate.
      Includes $7,500,000 for the Partnership for Advancing 
Technology in Housing (PATH) initiative, instead of $7,000,000 
as proposed by the House and the Senate. The conferees expect 
the Department to increase support for manufactured housing 
from within the amounts provided for the PATH program to 
support continuing research on promising technologies for the 
manufactured housing industry.
      The conferees reiterate the direction included in the 
Senate report denying demonstration authority without prior 
congressional approval.

                   Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity

                        FAIR HOUSING ACTIVITIES

      Appropriates $48,000,000 for this account instead of 
$46,000,000 as proposed by the House and $50,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Of this amount, $27,750,000 is for the Fair Housing 
Assistance Program (FHAP) and $20,250,000 is for the Fair 
Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP). The House proposed 
$25,750,000 for FHAP and $20,250,000 for FHIP and the Senate 
proposed $30,000,000 for FHAP and $20,000,000 for FHIP.

                     Office of Lead Hazard Control

                         LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION

      Appropriates $175,000,000 for lead hazard reduction 
instead of $130,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$175,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees agree to allocate funds as follows:
      --$96,000,000 for the lead-based paint hazard control 
grant program to provide assistance to State and local 
governments and Native American tribes for lead-based paint 
abatement in private low-income housing;
      --$9,000,000 for Operation LEAP;
      --$10,000,000 for technical assistance and support to 
State and local agencies and private property owners;
      --$10,000,000 for the Healthy Homes Initiative for 
competitive grants for research, standards development, and 
education and outreach activities to address lead-based paint 
poisoning and other housing-related diseases and hazards; and
      --$50,000,000 for an initiative to target lead abatement 
funds to areas with the highest lead paint abatement needs.
      Includes modified language making available $50,000,000 
on a competitive basis to those areas with the highest lead 
paint abatement needs as determined by the highest number of 
pre-1940 units of occupied rental housing, a disproportionately 
high number of documented cases of lead-poisoned children, and 
an applicant's demonstrated capacity to implement successfully 
the proposed uses of the funds. Language is also included 
requiring that not less than 90 percent of the funds made 
available under this initiative to be used exclusively for 
abatement or interim control of lead-based paint hazards, risk 
assessments, inspections or temporary relocation. Language is 
also included requiring recipients of funds awarded under this 
initiative to provide a matching contribution of not less than 
25 percent of the total grant award. The conferees believe that 
communities with the highest lead paint risk to children must 
employ an aggressive approach to lead-based paint abatement, 
and suggest that grants made under this new initiative be not 
less than $2,000,000. The conferees intend that eligible 
recipients of these funds will be units of local government. In 
selecting recipients for funding under this initiative, the 
Department shall consider the capacity of the applicant to use 
the funds provided, including the success of the applicant in 
using previously provided Federal dollars for lead-based paint 
hazard reduction, as well as the applicant's strategies to 
mobilize public and private resources to address this problem. 
Grant recipients under this initiative are expected to use 
funds for abatement and hazard reduction in privately owned 
rental-housing units that serve low-income families with 
children under the age of six. Units treated with funds 
provided under this initiative must remain available for low-
income residents for at least three years following treatment 
of the lead-based paint hazard. The conferees do not intend for 
any action taken in this Act to prejudice any ongoing or future 
litigation brought against lead pigment manufacturers. 
Additionally, no action taken in this Act is intended to 
mitigate the responsibility of housing owners to address the 
existence of lead-based paint hazards in a timely and 
expeditious manner.
      The conferees are aware that the Department currently 
reserves approximately 80 percent of the current lead-based 
paint hazard control grant program funding for allocation to 
current grantees or previous grantees, with the remaining 20 
percent provided for new grantees. The conferees request that 
the Department evaluate this policy to ensure that such 
allocation is appropriate to ensure that resources are made 
available to communities with the need as well as the capacity 
to use such grants. Further, the conferees urge the Department 
to consider the total amount of Federal and non-Federal 
resources available to address lead-based paint hazards when 
allocating funds provided for the current lead-based paint 
hazard control grant program.
      The conferees encourage the Department to consider a 
proposal from the Community Environmental Research Center as 
well as proposals on black mold and dissemination of 
information to the public and provide funds if appropriate. 
However, the Department is reminded that all funds provided 
under this heading and in this Act are to be distributed on a 
competitive basis in accordance with the requirements set forth 
in section 205 under administrative provisions in this title.

                     Management and Administration

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $1,123,130,000 for salaries and expenses 
instead of $1,122,130,000 as proposed by the House and 
$1,111,530,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of this amount, 
$547,000,000 is provided as a direct appropriation under this 
account as proposed by the House instead of $535,400,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes language as proposed by 
the House directing the Department to allocate funds provided 
under this heading in the manner specified in the joint 
explanatory statement of the managers accompanying this Act 
unless the Committees on Appropriations are notified and 
approve of any changes in the operating plan or through a 
reprogramming. The Department may reallocate funds and FTEs 
between the amounts specified below for these offices only in 
accordance with operating plan and/or reprogramming procedures. 
Amounts provided are consistent with modifications made by the 
Department to the original budget submission to reflect the 
revised staffing distribution consistent with the corrective 
action plan submitted to the Committees on Appropriations in 
response to the significant over-hiring that occurred during 
fiscal year 2003. In addition, the conference agreement 
includes an increase of $10,000,000 and 75 FTEs for the Office 
of Public and Indian Housing to establish a Division of Quality 
Assurance for activities associated with the section 8 voucher 
program.
      The following office and object classifications are to be 
used as the basis of any changes in funding and staffing 
distributions:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Office                        FTE        Amount

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Consistent with modifications to the original budget 
submission, the object classification distribution, which shall 
also serve as the basis for operating plan and reprogramming 
changes, is as follows:
            Personal Services--$889,234,000
            Travel and Transportation of Persons--$20,600,000
            Transportation of Things--$550,000
            Rent, Communications and Utilities--$135,555,000
            Printing and Reproduction--$3,900,000
            Other Services--$64,901,000
            Supplies and Materials--$4,990,000
            Furniture and Equipment--$3,200,000
            Indemnities--$200,000
      Public and Indian Housing Division of Quality 
Assurance.--Includes $10,000,000 and 75 FTEs to establish a 
Division of Quality Assurance within the Office of Public and 
Indian Housing. The conference agreement establishes this new 
division to ensure accurate and timely data regarding the 
expenditure and projected future funding requirements for the 
section 8 voucher program. The conferees recommend $7,500,000 
in Personal Services and $2,500,000 in Other Services object 
classifications for this purpose.
      Operating Plans/Reprogramming Requirements.--The 
conferees appreciate the need for management flexibility to 
allocate management and administrative resources or reorganize 
offices and programs to address changing requirements at the 
departments and agencies funded in the bill, including HUD. To 
provide such flexibility, while ensuring appropriate 
consultation and oversight, all Departments within the 
Subcommittee's jurisdiction are required to submit operating 
plans and reprogramming letters and reorganization proposals 
for Committee approval. The conferees direct HUD to follow the 
Committees' requirements regarding operating plans, 
reprogrammings and reorganizations so that the Committees are 
kept informed of, and therefore are better able to respond to, 
changing requirements at the Department. HUD is reminded that 
operating plans or reprogramming requirements apply to any 
reallocation of resources totaling more than $500,000 among any 
program, project or activity as well as to any significant 
reorganization within offices or the proposed creation or 
elimination of any program or office, regardless of the dollar 
amount involved; and any reorganization, regardless of the 
dollar amount involved. Object classification changes above 
$500,000 also are subject to operating plan or reprogramming 
requirements. Unless otherwise specified in this Act or the 
accompanying report, the approved level for any program, 
project, or activity is that amount detailed for that program, 
project, or activity in the Department's annual detailed budget 
justification document. These requirements apply to all funds 
provided to the Department. The Department is expected to make 
any necessary changes during fiscal year 2004 to its current 
procedures and systems to ensure that it is able to meet the 
necessary operating plan and reprogramming requirements applied 
to other agencies funded in the bill.
      Language proposed by the House to require submission of a 
staffing plan is not included. The Senate did not propose 
similar language. Instead, the conference agreement reiterates 
the direction in the Senate report regarding submission of 
quarterly reports on hiring.
      Language is included as proposed by the House related to 
funds control improvements to prohibit any official or employee 
from being designated as a funds allotment holder unless the 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) has determined 
such person has implemented adequate funds control systems and 
received appropriate training; requires the OCFO to establish 
control of and maintain adequate systems of accounting and 
other available funds; and clarifies the point of obligation 
for purposes of determining a violation of the Anti-Deficiency 
Act. Language is also included as proposed by the House making 
a technical correction to the fiscal year 2003 Act regarding 
the point of obligation. The conferees reiterate the direction 
in the House report regarding the recognition of well-
established appropriations law related to the point of 
obligation of funds and joint execution for obligation of funds 
when possible. The Senate did not propose similar language.
      The conferees have not included the Senate bill language 
and the House and Senate report language regarding overall 
authority for appropriations law. The conferees are in 
disagreement on this matter.
      Language proposed by the Senate is not included to 
prohibit the Department from paying the salaries (other than 
pensions and related costs) of any employees who had 
significant responsibility for allocating funding for the over-
leasing of vouchers by public housing agencies. The House did 
not include similar language.
      Language is included in the bill placing a limitation on 
the number of GS-14 and GS-15 employees at the Department as 
proposed by the House and the Senate.
      The conferees reiterate the direction included in the 
Senate report regarding the limitation on non-career employees.
      Budget Submission.--The conferees strongly disagree with 
the effort to substitute ``performance-based budgeting'' for 
the traditional budget structure or otherwise incorporate it 
into the budget justification for the Department. The 
Department is reminded that the detailed budget justification 
books are produced for the Committees on Appropriations in 
order to provide the necessary detail on the budget request and 
therefore are to be submitted in a manner that the Committees 
on Appropriations find most useful to assess funding requests 
and program requirements. The supplementary ``performance-based 
budget'' document for the Department for fiscal year 2004 
attempted to divide the entire Department's budget across six 
broad strategic goals such as ``Strengthening Communities'', 
``Embrace High Standards of Ethics, Management 
andAccountability'', and ``Promote Decent and Affordable Housing''. 
This strategic planning document contained minimal information useful 
to the Committees to assess the Department's fiscal year 2004 budget 
request or funding requirements. Therefore, language is included under 
Administrative Provisions requiring the fiscal year 2005 annual budget 
justification materials to be submitted in the traditional structure 
with sufficient detailed information to satisfy the Committees' needs.

                          WORKING CAPITAL FUND

      Appropriates $235,000,000 for the Working Capital Fund 
instead of $240,000,000 as proposed by the Senate and 
$90,000,000 as proposed by the House. In addition, the 
conference agreement includes $65,156,000 in transfers from the 
following accounts to support program-specific information

            Native American Indian block grants--$2,720,000
            Housing certificate fund--$3,010,000
            Housing for the elderly--$470,000
            Housing for persons with disabilities--$470,000
            Interagency Services--$306,000
            Office of Inspector General--$300,000
      The conferees reiterate the direction included in the 
House report on continued development and definition of a five-
year information technology plan consistent with the format 
previously provided to the Department and direct such updated 
plan be submitted no later than February 1, 2004.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $101,000,000 for the Office of Inspector 
General instead of $100,080,000 as proposed by the House and 
$102,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of this amount, 
$24,000,000 is provided by transfer from the various funds of 
the Federal Housing Administration as proposed by the House and 
the Senate.

                         CONSOLIDATED FEE FUND

                              (RESCISSION)

      Includes language rescinding remaining balances in the 
Fund as proposed by the House and the Senate.

             Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $39,915,000 for the Office of Federal 
Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) to be derived from 
collections available in the Federal Housing Enterprise 
Oversight Fund instead of $32,415,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement provides an additional 
$7,500,000 as requested in a budget amendment submitted to the 
Congress for one-time costs to conduct special investigations 
of the enterprises and for strengthening the examination and 
legal functions. Language is included specifying funds for 
these requested purposes.
      Language is included requiring not less than 60 percent 
of the total amount made available under this heading shall be 
used only for examination, supervision and capital oversight to 
ensure that the enterprises are operating in a financially 
sound manner and comply with statutory capital requirements.
      Language is also included requiring the Secretary to 
submit a spending plan no later than January 15, 2004. The 
Secretary is directed to submit a separate plan for the funds 
provided for special investigations if such funds are required 
prior to the submission of the spending plan.

                       Administrative Provisions

      Includes modified language similar to language proposed 
by the House and the Senate regarding the distribution of 
certain HOPWA funds.
      Includes language requiring all funds to be awarded 
competitively except as explicitly provided for in statute as 
proposed by the House. The Senate proposed similar language.
      Includes modified language similar to language proposed 
by the House and the Senate requiring the Department to submit 
a spending plan for the use of technical assistance, training, 
and management improvement funds provided for in this Act to 
the Committees on Appropriations by January 15, 2004.
      Includes language as proposed by the House requiring the 
Secretary to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on 
Appropriations regarding all uncommitted, unobligated, 
recaptured and excess funds. The Senate proposed similar 
language.
      Does not include language proposed by the Senate to 
reauthorize the HOPE VI program beyond fiscal year 2004 since 
it is the conferees' understanding that authorization 
legislation is currently being considered by the relevant House 
and Senate committees of jurisdiction. The House did not 
include similar language. The conferees support continuing 
funding of this program absent an alternative approach to the 
revitalization of distressed public housing or other compelling 
policy reasons.
      Includes language proposed by the Senate requiring the 
Secretary to maintain section 8 assistance on certain 
properties occupied by elderly or disabled families. The House 
did not include similar language.
      Includes language proposed by the Senate requiring the 
Secretary to submit an annual report to the Committees on 
Appropriations regarding the number of Federally-assisted units 
under lease and the per unit costs to the Federal government of 
such units. The House did not include similar language.
      Does not include language to amend section 683(2) of the 
Housing and Community Development Act of 1972 to authorize 
service coordinators in section 811 projects as proposed by the 
Senate. The House did not include similar language.
      Includes language proposed by the Senate regarding 
interest paid on certain mortgage insurance claims. The House 
did not include similar language.
      Includes modified language to change the name of the 
Interagency Council on the Homeless similar to language 
proposed by the Senate. Language proposed by the Senate is not 
included to authorize non-reimbursable detailees. The House did 
not include similar language.
      Does not include language proposed by the Senate to 
authorize FHA single-family mortgage insurance to be provided 
to sub-prime borrowers at reduced premiums and appraisal 
limitations. The House did not include similar language. The 
conferees support efforts to assist low-income persons in 
repairing negative credit histories where appropriate. However, 
the Department needs to stem the escalating default rate in 
FHA's single-family mortgage insurance programs before it 
assumes new risks posed by persons with credit problems.
      Language is included as proposed by the Senate to allow 
HUD to participate in the Directory of New Hires program. The 
House did not include similar language.
      Does not include language to amend section 9 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize a new loan-
financing program for public housing authorities as proposed by 
the Senate. The House did not include similar language.
      Does not include language to amend the McKinney-Vento Act 
to raise the salary cap for the Executive Director of the U.S. 
Interagency Council on Homelessness from the current Executive 
Level V to Executive Level III. The House did not include a 
similar provision.
      Includes language proposed by the Senate to authorize the 
Department to allocate CDBG non-entitlement funds to localities 
in the State of Hawaii should the State fail to elect to 
administer such funds by July 31, 2004. The House did not 
include a similar provision.
      Includes language proposed by the Senate to amend the 
purposes of a grant related to Hollander Ridge in Baltimore, 
Maryland. The House did not include a similar provision.
      Includes language proposed by the Senate requiring the 
Secretary to conduct negotiated rulemaking for purposes of 
changes to the formula governing the public housing operating 
fund and requires a final rule to be issued no later than July 
1, 2004. The House did not include similar language.
      Includes new language allowing the Secretary to maintain 
and dispose of certain elderly and disabled projects upon 
foreclosure. Neither the House nor Senate included similar 
language.
      Includes new language requiring the Department to submit 
its fiscal year 2005 budget justification to the Committees on 
Appropriations in the traditional budget structure rather than 
in a ``performance-based budget'' structure and in accordance 
with the terms and conditions specified below. For the last 
three years, the conferees have expressed concerns regarding 
the adequacy of the Department's annual budget justification to 
the Committees on Appropriations. While improvements have been 
made, the fiscal year 2004 budget justification provided 
insufficient information to meet the Committees' requirements. 
For example, the Department's fiscal year 2004 justification 
contained less than 13 pages of information for programs 
representing over half of the Department's entire budget. The 
Department is directed to develop and present the fiscal year 
2005 budget justification in the traditional budget structure, 
delineated by appropriation account, providing detailed 
information on the prior year, current year, and requested 
funding levels for each program, project, or activity funded 
within each account; a detailed narrative description of each 
program, project, or activity; and any proposed changes to such 
program, project, or activity. Object classification displays 
are to be included as supplements, not substitutes, to detailed 
displays of funding provided in prior years and requested in 
fiscal year 2005 for each program, project, or activity within 
each account. Within the justification materials for the 
Management and Administration account, the Department is to 
continue to delineate prior year, current year, and requested 
positions, FTEs, and funding levels for each program within 
each office, delineated by headquarters and field office 
components and as compared to the Department's workload 
staffing model (REAP). Such materials shall include a detailed 
justification for any proposed staffing changes among such 
offices.

                    TITLE III--INDEPENDENT AGENCIES

                  American Battle Monuments Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      Appropriates $41,300,000 for salaries and expenses 
instead of $47,276,000 as proposed by the House and $35,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate. The conferees have not included a 
provision proposed by the House which would have delayed the 
availability of $10,000,000 until September 1, 2004.
      The amount provided includes $9,000,000 for the Normandy 
Interpretive Center. The conferees note that approximately 
$9,000,000 in additional funding will be required to complete 
the Center and expect this amount to be included in the fiscal 
year 2005 budget submission.

             Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      Appropriates $8,250,000 instead of $8,550,000 as proposed 
by the House and $8,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conferees have not included language providing $2,500,000 of 
this amount to be available for two fiscal years as proposed by 
the Senate.
      The conferees encourage the Board to work with the 
Department of Homeland Security to develop a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) regarding the Board's specific duties to 
protect from and respond to terrorist acts on chemical and 
related industrial plants. The Board is directed to update the 
Committees on Appropriations by June 30, 2004 on progress made 
towards developing a MOU.
      Modifies language proposed by the Senate regarding 
financial statements to be prepared by the Chief Operating 
Officer of the Board in accordance with the Accountability of 
Tax Dollars Act of 2002. The IG shall submit to the Chief 
Operating Officer of the Board a report on the audit not later 
than November 15th of the fiscal year for which a statement was 
prepared.
      The conferees have included language and funding under 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Inspector 
General designating the Inspector General of EPA to serve as 
the Inspector General of the Chemical Safety and Hazard 
Investigation Board. The duties of the Inspector General shall 
be those outlined in the Inspector General Act of 1978, as 
amended. As these duties are not supervisory or directive in 
nature, the independence of the Board remains as specified in 
the Board's authorizing statute.

                             EMERGENCY FUND

      Provides $450,000 for an Emergency Fund as proposed by 
the House.

                       DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

              Community Development Financial Institutions

   COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      Appropriates $61,000,000 for the community development 
financial institutions fund program account, instead of 
$51,000,000 as proposed by the House and $70,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Includes $4,000,000 for technical assistance designed to 
benefit Native American communities instead of $3,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $5,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Provides $12,000,000 for administrative expenses as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $13,000,000 as proposed by 
the House.
      Provides for a cost limitation on direct loans of 
$6,000,000 with $250,000 for administrative expenses as 
proposed by both the House and Senate.
      Provides for a limitation on the amount of direct loans 
of $11,000,000 as proposed by both the House and Senate.
      The conferees direct the Fund to submit an update to its 
5-year strategic plan to the Committees on Appropriations of 
the House and Senate that outlines its effort to improve the 
economic needs of Native Americans. The report is to be 
submitted by April 20, 2004.
      The conferees agree with the Senate direction that the 
CDFI Fund make funds for financial assistance available to 
CDFIs regardless of their size and to continue the Small and 
Emerging CDFI Assistance program. Additionally, the conferees 
direct the CDFI Fund to restore out-migration and population 
loss as criteria in determining Investment Areas for fiscal 
year 2004.

                   Consumer Product Safety Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      Appropriates $60,000,000 as proposed by the House and the 
Senate.

             Corporation for National and Community Service

       NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS OPERATING EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $553,225,000 for national and community 
service programs operating expenses. The House proposed 
$363,452,000 to fund the operating expenses and salaries and 
expenses, but not the Trust, which was funded under a separate 
heading. The Senate proposed $452,575,000 to fund the operating 
expenses and the Trust, but not salaries and expenses, which 
were funded under a separate heading. This conference agreement 
mirrors the account structure of the Senate.
      Appropriates $314,000,000 for AmeriCorps*State and 
National grants (authorized under subtitle C) and education 
award only grants (authorized under subtitle H), plus an 
additional $130,000,000 for the Trust. The House proposed 
$244,352,000 for grants plus $110,000,000 appropriated under a 
separate account for the Trust. The Senate proposed a lump sum 
of $340,000,000 to fund both grants and the Trust. The 
conference agreement allows for education award only grants to 
be funded from this same authority as proposed by both the 
House and the Senate.
      Within the amount provided for AmeriCorps*State and 
National grants, the conferees have provided up to $55,000,000 
for national direct grants.
      The conferees strongly urge the Corporation to develop 
separate application guidelines for professional corps that 
recognize the unique challenges inherent in building service 
corps of full-time professionals.
      The conference agreement transfers not less than 
$130,000,000 to the Trust, of which $5,000,000 is to support 
national service scholarships to high school students and 
$10,000,000 is to be held in reserve as required by the 
Strengthen AmeriCorps Program Act. The Trust funds the 
education awards for members who successfully complete their 
commitments in the three AmeriCorps programs: AmeriCorps*State 
and National, AmeriCorps*NCCC and AmeriCorps*VISTA (the latter 
of which is appropriated under a different appropriations Act). 
The conference agreement includes language which allows for the 
transfer of sums from AmeriCorps*State and National grants to 
the Trust in order to ensure sufficient funding for education 
award commitments. The conference agreement assumes the 
Corporation will provide up to 40 percent of its grant awards 
as education award only grants. The conferees direct the 
Corporation to include in its Operating Plan the number of 
members, both FTE and total number of volunteers this funding 
level will support, as well as the specific program mix of 
education award only and stipend grants. The conference 
agreement does not include a cap on the number of members 
enrolled in the Trust.
      The conferees expect that the Corporation will offer any 
individual selected for enrollment or re-enrollment as an 
AmeriCorps*VISTA member the option of receiving an education 
award.
      The conferees also expect that the Corporation will 
ensure that all continuation grants, through which the 
Corporation has made multi-year commitments, are funded prior 
to funding new grants, provided the grantees are in compliance 
with all requirements.
      The conference agreement includes $12,000,000 for state 
commission administration as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$13,000,000 as proposed by the House. The conferees direct the 
Corporation to address the management problems of the state 
commissions as identified by the Inspector General.
      Provides $10,000,000 to the Points of Light Foundation, 
of which up to $2,500,000 may be used for an endowment as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.
      The conference agreement also includes $5,000,000 for 
America's Promise, as proposed by both the House and the 
Senate.
      The conference agreement does not include funding for the 
Promise Fellows program. The 2004 budget request included 
$4,900,000 for this program. However, the Corporation was able 
to allocate funding for the proposed 2004 program from fiscal 
year 2003 funds carried over into fiscal year 2004 in order to 
complete the program.
      Provides funding for AmeriCorps*National Civilian 
Community Corps of $25,000,000 as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $24,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      Limits funding for Learn and Serve grants (authorized by 
subtitle B) for school-based and community-based service 
learning programs to $43,000,000 as proposed by the Senate, 
instead of $40,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      Limits funding for subtitle H grants, innovation, 
demonstration and assistance activities, to $11,225,000 instead 
of $14,575,000 as proposed by the Senate and $6,100,000 as 
proposed by the House. The conferees have provided $500,000 for 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day grants; $725,000 for the Service 
Learning Clearinghouse and Exchange; $2,000,000 for training 
and technical assistance; $1,000,000 for next generation 
grants; and $4,000,000 for disability programs.
      The conferees have provided $3,000,000 for challenge 
grants and direct the Corporation to comply with the funding 
requirements of this program as included in House Report 108-
10.
      The conference agreement provides $3,000,000 for audits 
and evaluations, of which $2,000,000 is to assist grantees with 
the development of their performance measures, and $1,000,000 
is for a National Academy of Public Administration study as 
directed in Senate Report 108-143. The conferees further direct 
the Corporation to provide detailed funding levels and 
descriptions for each initiative under subtitle H in its 
Operating Plan and future budget request materials.
      The conferees have included bill language, identical to 
language that has been included in previous conference reports, 
regarding Federal costs per participant. The conferees direct 
the Corporation to report within 90 days of enactment on how 
the Corporation has complied with this directive. The conferees 
further direct that future efforts to reduce Federal costs per 
participant should target administrative and overhead costs, 
not volunteers' stipends.
      The conference agreement does not include specific 
proposals by the Senate to increase matching requirements. The 
conferees, however, would expect that larger, well-established 
partners of the Corporation should be able to better leverage 
their Federal funding so that a greater percentage of their 
operating expenses would come from other than Federal sources. 
The conferees direct the Corporation to undertake public notice 
and comment rulemaking, should the Corporation propose to 
revise the matching funds requirements contained in the grant 
competition guidelines, for those longstanding partners which 
have received significant funding from the Corporation in many 
successive years. Further, the Corporation is directed to 
collect information on the grantees which receive more than 
$500,000 annually from the Corporation and the amount of other 
Federal and non-Federal funds the recipients have leveraged and 
make the information available if requested.
      Reiterates language proposed by the House directing the 
Corporation to review thoroughly its grant programs and 
financial systems, and submit a report not less than 90 days 
after enactment of this Act detailing a plan for reform and 
accountability.
      Modifies language proposed by the Senate directing the 
Corporation to comply fully with the recommendations of the 
Inspector General Audit Report of July 24, 2003, by directing 
the Corporation to prohibit expenditures until the Inspector 
General certifies that substantial compliance has been 
achieved.
      Reiterates language proposed by both the House and the 
Senate regarding reports submitted to the Committees on 
Appropriations detailing the enrollment levels of the various 
AmeriCorps programs and the financial status of the Trust to be 
submitted monthly.
      The conferees encourage the Corporation to consider a 
change to the grant cycle so that grant awards can be made to 
recipient organizations before the organization recruits 
members to fill awarded slots.
      The conferees direct the Corporation to undertake public 
notice and comment rulemaking to develop a definition of 
sustainability.
      The conferees direct that future budget requests should 
not include funding for programs, agencies or operations 
outside of the jurisdiction of this Act. Instead, the 
Administration should request those funds from the appropriate 
subcommittee of the Committees on Appropriations, or request 
appropriate transfer authority.

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      Appropriates $25,000,000 for salaries and expenses 
associated with the administrative activities of the 
Corporation as proposed by the Senate. The House included 
funding under the operating expenses account.
      Of the amount provided the conference agreement assumes: 
$18,300,000 for salaries and benefits; $400,000 for travel; 
$2,300,000 for technology; $2,000,000 for administrative 
expenses; and $2,000,000 for the Office of the Chief Financial 
Officer.
      The conferees agree that decisions and ultimate 
responsibility for determining pay increases and performance 
bonuses belong to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the 
Corporation. However, the conferees prohibit the CEO from 
approving bonuses and salary increases for senior managers 
unless the Inspector General certifies that all recommendations 
from the July 24, 2003, Inspector General report have been 
implemented.
      The conferees remind the Corporation of the reporting 
requirements set forth at the beginning of this division. The 
conferees agree that for fiscal year 2004, the Corporation must 
report to and receive approval from the Committees on 
Appropriations on any reprogramming request in excess of 
$100,000. Various reporting requirements listed in both the 
House report and the Senate report must be fulfilled with the 
submission of the fiscal year 2004 operating plan unless 
otherwise noted. Further, the conferees direct the Corporation 
to provide better, detailed information in the budget request 
for all CNCS accounts regarding planned and on-going 
activities, the costs of those activities, and the expected 
results.
      The conferees expect that the funding provided will 
support all of the Corporation's current employees, including 
those whom the Corporation has previously funded within 
subtitle H funds, including National Senior Service Corps 
recruitment employees.
      The conferees reiterate report language proposed by the 
Senate regarding the Alternative Personnel System.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      Appropriates $6,250,000 for Office of Inspector General, 
instead of $6,000,000 as proposed by the House and $6,500,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      Retains report language proposed by the Senate directing 
the Inspector General to audit AmeriCorps*State and National 
grantees which are in the top ten percent of receiving the most 
grant funds.

                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

      Retains the two administrative provisions proposed by 
both the House and Senate regarding qualified student loans 
eligible for education awards and the availability of funds for 
the placement of volunteers with disabilities.
      Inserts a new administrative provision, which was 
proposed by the Senate under the national and community service 
programs operating expenses account. The conference agreement 
includes modified language directing the Inspector General to 
levy sanctions in accordance with standard Inspector General 
audit resolution procedures, which include, but are not limited 
to, debarment of any grantee found to be in violation of 
AmeriCorps program requirements, including using funds to lobby 
the Congress.
      The conference agreement includes a new administrative 
provision proposed by the Senate as a general provision 
requiring the Corporation to ensure 1) that significant changes 
to program requirements or policy are made only through public 
notice and comment rulemaking; and 2) the integrity of the 
grant selection process.

               U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      Appropriates $15,938,000 for salaries and expenses as 
proposed by the House instead of $16,220,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Both the House and the Senate provided $1,175,000 for 
the pro bono program.

                      DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--CIVIL

instead of $25,961,000 as proposed by the House and $32,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate, and provides $1,000 for official 
representation expenses.

                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

                     National Institutes of Health

          NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES

      Appropriates $78,744,000 as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $80,000,000 as proposed by the House.

            Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry

            TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH

      Appropriates $73,467,000 for toxic substances and 
environmental public health as proposed by both the House and 
Senate. This funding is to be derived from the Superfund Trust 
Fund to the extent resources are available. Any remaining 
requirements will come from the General Treasury.

                    Environmental Protection Agency

      The conference agreement includes $8,411,469,000 for 
programs administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.

fiscal year 2003.

      The conferees are fully supportive of the collaborative 
partnership of the EPA and the National Institutes of Health in 
their system of Centers for Children's Environmental Health and 
Disease Prevention Research. The conferees direct that EPA 
continue to support a competitive system of not less than 
twelve such centers and that it maintain the average level of 
funding for each center at not less than the historic level of 
approximately $500,000 for direct costs.
      From within amounts transferred to ``Science and 
Technology'' from ``Hazardous Substance Superfund'', the 
conferees direct that funding for the Gulf Coast Hazardous 
Substance Research Center continue at no less than the fiscal 
year 2003 level.
      The conferees continue to support the partnership between 
the EPA and the National Technology Transfer Center and direct 
that the Agency continue the cooperative agreement at the 
fiscal year 2001 funding level.
      The conferees direct EPA to contract with the National 
Academy of Sciences within 60 days of enactment for two 
separate studies: (1) a study on the health risks to children 
from residential lead contamination, as proposed by the Senate; 
and (2) a study of health, safety, and environmental risks of 
coal combustion wastes used for reclamation in active and 
abandoned mines.
      The conferees are aware of the progress being made by the 
Agency through its Climate Protection Program: Transportation 
program on the development of clean, cost effective, and high 
fuel efficiency engine and powertrain technologies. The 
conferees direct that the Agency continue to fund the clean 
automotive technology program on advanced hybrid vehicles, 
extremely clean diesel technologies, and advanced gasoline 
engine concepts at levels sufficient to complete this work in 
fiscal year 2004.
      The conferees are aware that EPA released its draft risk 
assessment of Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA)-treated play sets 
and decks on November 12, 2003, and is seeking the advice of 
its Science Advisory Panel (SAP) regarding this probabilistic 
assessment of cancer risk. The conferees understand that this 
risk assessment is scheduled for a final release later this 
year following the SAP review. The conferees are aware that 
EPA--in conjunction with industry and other stakeholders--has 
developed a draft biomonitoring study protocol consistent with 
SAP recommendations and intends to complete a biomonitoring 
study by October 2004. This study will provide additional 
information on CCA risk. Once this biomonitoring study is 
complete, the conferees expect that EPA will make any 
appropriate changes to the final risk assessment and re-issue 
the assessment accordingly.
      The conferees are aware of the Florida Area Coastal 
Environmental (FACE) Initiative to identify and investigate the 
sources of nutrients, trace metals, and unregulated substances 
entering the coastal waters of Florida. This initiative's 
participants include local, state, and federal agencies and the 
Florida university community led by the University of South 
Florida Department of Marine Science and the University of 
Miami's Center for Marine Ecosystem Science and Policy. The 
conferees direct EPA to report back to the Committees on 
Appropriations by March 1, 2004, on progress toward 
implementation of the FACE program.
      The conferees are encouraged by new technology that has 
the potential to eliminate contaminating microorganisms from 
water, and ultimately reducing and halting the spread of 
disease through contaminated water. The conferees commend the 
efforts of EPA to bring this technology to bear upon current 
water treatment and purification problems, and strongly 
encourage EPA to continue to foster this technology.
      The conferees are aware of promising developments in idle 
reduction technologies, including advanced truck stop 
electrification. The conferees urge the Agency to fund 
demonstration pilots of this technology as part of its SmartWay 
Transport program.
      The conferees encourage EPA to use and expand programs at 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities to leverage 
available resources in existing programs for capacity building 
and coordinated research to broaden the base of quality water 
resource centers throughout the country.

      The conferees strongly support the objectives of the 
Agency's enforcement program, and have provided additional 
resources to enable the Agency to fund a total of not less than 
2,237 enforcement FTEs in this account (3,465 FTEs throughout 
the Agency), equal to the fiscal year 2003 enacted level.
      The conference agreement provides the full budget request 
for the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP), the High 
Production Volume (HPV) Chemical Challenge Program, and the 
Voluntary Children's Chemical Evaluation Program (VCCEP).
      The conference agreement also provides the full budget 
request for the Great Lakes National Program Office.
      The conference agreement provides the full budget request 
of $2,000,000 for the Water Information Sharing and Analysis 
Center (Water ISAC) to gather, analyze, and disseminate 
sensitive security information to water and wastewater systems. 
The conferees direct that the Water ISAC shall be implemented 
through a grant to the Association of Metropolitan Water 
Agencies.
      The conferees have, within available funds, provided 
$2,000,000 for nine Environmental Finance Centers, the same as 
for fiscal year 2003. Also from within available funds, the 
Agency is provided with $250,000 to continue development of 
BASINS models, GIS mapping, integration with other financial 
and planning tools, and incorporation of cost-effectiveness 
considerations into integrated priority ranking systems.
      Within available funds, the Agency is directed to 
contract with an independent research organization, within 60 
days of enactment, to complete a comprehensive study of jobs 
created by water infrastructure financing, as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conferees expect EPA to specify all funding for paid 
advertising throughout the Agency in the fiscal year 2004 
operating plan and in the fiscal year 2005 budget submission.
      The conferees are concerned that Federal agencies 
continue to receive failing grades due to weaknesses in cyber 
security management. To address this weakness, the conferees 
believe agencies can use vulnerability management as a means of 
securing critical computer networks. The conferees direct EPA 
to provide no less than $500,000, within available funds, to 
demonstrate a cyber-security/vulnerability management solution 
which, in real time, continuously and accurately discovers 
network exposures and measures policy compliance in an 
extensible and scalable manner. This management solution can be 
achieved by using appliance-based technology to run a hardened 
operating system that communicates through encryption using 
digital certificates for authentication. The conferees direct 
the Agency to report to the Committees on Appropriations on the 
efficacy of this technology no later than October 1, 2004.
      The conferees understand that EPA supports Electro 
Catalytic Oxidation, a multi-pollutant control technology for 
coal fired power plants. The conferees encourage EPA to 
continue to explore the potential clean air benefits of this 
promising technology.
      The conferees support the Agency's electronics recycling 
initiative, and encourage the Agency to support pilot projects 
through the Polymer Alliance Zone's MARCEE Initiative to 
develop a market-based sustainable electronics recycling 
infrastructure.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      Appropriates $37,558,000 for the Office of Inspector 
General, an increase of $750,000 over the amounts proposed by 
the House and the Senate. In addition to amounts appropriated 
directly to the OIG, $13,214,000 is also available by transfer 
from funds appropriated for the Hazardous Substance Superfund.
      The conferees have included language designating the 
Inspector General of EPA to serve as the Inspector General for 
the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. An 
additional $750,000, not in the budget request, and up to 5 
FTEs are provided in fiscal year 2004 for this function. The 
conferees direct that adequate funding be included in the 
budget request in future fiscal years to carry out this 
function.

                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

      Appropriates $40,000,000 for buildings and facilities, 
instead of $42,918,000 as proposed by the Senate and 
$42,368,000 as proposed by the House.

                     HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $1,265,000,000 for Hazardous Substance 
Superfund as proposed by the Senate instead of $1,275,000,000 
as proposed by the House. Bill language provides that such sums 
as are available from the Superfund trust fund upon the date of 
enactment are available for this activity, with the remainder 
to be derived from general revenues of the Treasury. Additional 
language provides for the transfer of $13,214,000 to the Office 
of Inspector General, and for the transfer of $44,697,000 to 
the Science and Technology account. The conference agreement 
does not include delayed obligations in the superfund account 
as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees have agreed to the following fiscal year 
2004 funding levels:
      1. $880,281,000 for Superfund response and cleanup 
activities, an increase of $28,895,000 over the fiscal year 
2003 enacted level.
      2. $147,557,000 for enforcement activities.
      3. $140,425,000 for management and support.
      4. $13,214,000 for transfer to the Office of Inspector 
General.
      5. $44,697,000 for research and development activities, 
to be transferred to the Science and Technology account.
      6. $38,826,000 for reimbursable interagency activities, 
including $28,150,000 for the Department of Justice and 
$10,676,000 for OSHA, FEMA, NOAA, the United States Coast 
Guard, and for the Department of the Interior.
      The conferees direct the EPA IG to conduct an evaluation 
of Superfund expenditures at headquarters and the regions and 
recommend options for increasing resources directed to 
extramural cleanup while minimizing administrative costs. The 
conference agreement does not include a provision, as proposed 
by the Senate, to require EPA to allocate a specific percentage 
of its superfund budget to site remedy construction and long-
term response activities. However, the conferees expect EPA to 
direct the maximum possible resources to these activities, and 
look forward to reviewing the IG's recommendations for 
increasing funding for these critical activities within 
available resources.
      The conferees direct the EPA Inspector General to conduct 
an investigation into all financial transactions, including 
revenue and spending, by the Gloucester Environmental 
Management Services (GEMS) Trust, and make its findings 
available to the public no later than April 1, 2004.

                LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK PROGRAM

      Appropriates $76,000,000 for the leaking underground 
storage tank program instead of $79,845,000 as proposed by the 
House and $72,545,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                           OIL SPILL RESPONSE

      Appropriates $16,209,000 for oil spill response as 
proposed by the House and the Senate.

                   STATE AND TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS

      Appropriates $3,896,800,000 for state and tribal 
assistance grants instead of $3,601,950,000 as proposed by the 
House and $3,814,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Bill 
language specifically provides $1,350,000,000 for Clean Water 
State Revolving Fund (SRF) capitalization grants, of which up 
to $75,000,000 is to be made available for use by States that 
choose to make loans, including interest-free loans, that 
increase non-point and non-structural, decentralized 
alternatives, expanding the choices available to communities in 
their fight for clean water. The conferees again strongly 
encourage States that can do so to pursue innovative 
technologies in this regard, but emphasize that this program is 
voluntary and that States not participating in the program will 
nevertheless continue to receive their normal level of funding 
through the established SRF formulas.
      Additional bill language provides $850,000,000 for Safe 
Drinking Water SRF capitalization grants; $50,000,000 for the 
United States-Mexico Border program; $43,000,000 for grants to 
address drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs in 
rural and native Alaska communities; $3,500,000 for remediation 
of above ground leaking fuel tanks in Alaska pursuant to Public 
Law 106-554; $6,600,000 for grants for construction of 
alternative decentralized wastewater facilities; $93,500,000 
for Brownfields grants; $1,175,200,000 for categorical grants 
to the states and tribes, including $50,000,000 for Brownfields 
categorical grants and $20,000,000 for the Environmental 
Information Exchange program; and $325,000,000 for cost-shared 
grants for construction of water and wastewater treatment 
facilities and infrastructure and for groundwater protection 
infrastructure.
      The conferees have included bill language which: (1) for 
fiscal year 2004, authorizes the Administrator of the EPA to 
use funds appropriated pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution 
Control Act (FWPCA) to make grants to Indian tribes pursuant to 
section 319(h) and 518(e) of FWPCA; (2) will permit the states 
to include as principal amounts considered to be the cost of 
administering SRF loans to eligible borrowers, with certain 
limitations; (3) for fiscal year 2004, authorizes the states to 
transfer funds between the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water 
SRF programs; and (4) stipulates that no funds provided in the 
Act to address water infrastructure needs of colonias within 
the United States along the United States-Mexico border shall 
be made available to a county or municipal government unless 
that governmental entity has established an enforceable 
ordinance or rule which prevents the development or 
construction of any additional colonia areas, or the 
development within an existing colonia of any new home, 
business, or other structure which lacks water, wastewater, or 
other necessary infrastructure.
      As in previous years, the conferees have included bill 
language which stipulates that none of the funds provided in 
this or any previous years' Act for the Safe Drinking Water SRF 
may be reserved by the Administrator for health effects studies 
on drinking water contaminants. The conferees have instead 
provided significant resources for such studies within EPA's 
Science and Technology account.
      The conferees have included new bill language which sets 
certain requirements for Alaska Native Village grants, 
including: (1) a 25% cost share from the State of Alaska; (2) a 
limitation on administrative expenses; and (3) the 
establishment of a statewide priority list and a set-aside for 
regional hub communities.
      The conferees eliminated a provision included by the 
Senate which was designed to make the use of targeted water and 
wastewater investments in combination with funding from state 
revolving funds more flexible. The House did not include this 
provision. Because of concerns over the best way to address 
flexibility in the combined use of these funds, the conferees 
instead direct the EPA to report to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations by February 15, 2004 with 
recommendations on ways to enhance the combined use of these 
funds.
      The conferees have included bill language which makes 
technical corrections and changes to grants approved in 
previous fiscal years.
      Of the funds provided for the United States-Mexico Border 
program, $7,000,000 is for continuation of the El Paso, Texas 
desalination and water supply project, and $2,000,000 is for 
the Brownsville, Texas water supply project.
      The conference agreement provides $6,600,000 for six 
specific grants under the National Decentralized Wastewater 
Demonstration program. The program, which has shown success in 
developing and transferring technologies which offer 
alternatives to centralized wastewater treatment facilities, 
also requires a cost-share whereby each grantee must provide 
25% of the project's total cost. The six projects included for 
funding are located in Seattle, Washington ($1,350,000); 
Blackstone Watershed, Massachusetts and Rhode Island 
($1,350,000); Boise, Idaho ($1,000,000); Pasquotank River 
Watershed, North Carolina ($1,350,000); Washington, D.C. 
($800,000); and Chagrin River Watershed, Ohio ($750,000). As in 
previous years, these projects were determined by non-
governmental, independent analysis based upon their unique and 
diverse geology and geography, their ability to provide the 
greatest technological diversity using limited financial 
resources, and the commitment of each community or regional 
area to find and fund appropriate alternative technologies to 
resolve their wastewater treatment needs.
      Within the State and Tribal Categorical Grant program, 
the conference agreement includes:
      1. $228,550,000 for air resource assistance to State and 
local governments under sections 103 and 105 of the Clean Air 
Act, including $10,000,000 for the five State/Regional Haze 
planning organizations;
      2. $11,050,000 for air resource assistance grants to 
Tribal governments;
      3. $8,150,000 for radon grants;

      10. $102,600,000 for public water system supervision 
grants;
      11. $11,000,000 for underground injection control grants;
      12. $5,000,000 for Drinking Water Program State Homeland 
Security Coordination grants;
      13. $106,400,000 for RCRA financial assistance grants;
      14. $50,000,000 for Brownfields categorical cleanup 
grants;
      15. $11,950,000 for underground storage tank grants;
      16. $13,100,000 for pesticides program implementation 
grants;
      17. $13,700,000 for lead risk reduction grants;
      18. $5,150,000 for toxic substances compliance/
enforcement grants;
      19. $19,900,000 for pesticides enforcement grants;
      20. $20,000,000 for the information exchange network 
program;
      21. $6,000,000 for pollution prevention incentive grants;
      22. $2,250,000 for enforcement and compliance assurance 
grants; and
      23. $62,500,000 for Indians general assistance grants.
      The conferees have not provided funding for a grant for 
drinking water infrastructure improvements in San Juan, Puerto 
Rico.
      The conferees have provided $325,000,000 for a targeted 
program making grants to communities for the construction of 
drinking water, wastewater and storm water infrastructure and 
for water quality protection. As in past years, these grants 
shall be accompanied by a cost-share requirement whereby 45 
percent of a project's cost is the responsibility of the 
community or entity receiving the grant. In those few cases 
where such cost-share requirement poses a particular financial 
burden on the recipient community or entity, the conferees 
support the Agency's use of its long-standing guidance for 
financial capability assessments to determine reductions or 
waivers from this match requirement.
      With the exception of the limited instances in which an 
applicant meets the criteria for a waiver, the conferees have 
provided no more than 55% of an individual project's cost, 
regardless of the amount appropriated below. Consistent with 
direction in the fiscal year 2003 Conference Report on this 
bill, the phrase `terms and conditions' referenced in the bill 
language includes the maximum 55% federal share, as well as the 
intended recipients and the specific project descriptions, as 
listed below.

                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

      The conferees have again this year included an 
administrative provision giving the Administrator specific 
authority to, in the absence of an acceptable tribal program, 
award cooperative agreements to federally recognized Indian 
Tribes or Intertribal consortia so as to properly carry out 
EPA's environmental programs.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision, as 
proposed by the House, extending for one year the collection of 
$21,500,000 in maintenance fees. Nor does the conference 
agreement include prohibitions on the collection of pesticide 
registration and tolerance fees, as proposed by the House. 
Instead, the conference agreement includes a provision, as 
proposed by the Senate, which provides for the collection of 
certain pesticides fees through fiscal year 2008 (see title V).
      The conferees have included a new provision proposed by 
the Senate which, for fiscal year 2004, extends the eligibility 
of brownfield grant recipients to those who purchased 
properties prior to the enactment of the Small Business 
Liability Relief and Brownfield Revitalization Act of 2001. The 
conferees have not included a provision that would permit the 
use of certain brownfield grant funds for administrative costs, 
as the Senate had proposed.
      The conferees have not included a provision, as proposed 
by the Senate, that clarifies an existing exemption in the 
Clean Air Act concerning state regulations of engines under 50 
horsepower.

                   Executive Office of the President

                OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY

      Appropriates $7,027,000 as proposed by the House and the 
Senate.

  COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

      Appropriates $3,238,000 as proposed by the House and the 
Senate.

                 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      Appropriates $30,125,000 for the Office of Inspector 
General, as proposed by the House instead of $30,848,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. Funds for this account are derived from 
the Bank Insurance Fund, the Savings and Loan Insurance Fund, 
and the FSLIC Resolution Fund and are therefore not reflected 
in either the budget authority or budget outlay totals.

                    General Services Administration

                FEDERAL CITIZEN INFORMATION CENTER FUND

      Appropriates $14,000,000 as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $12,500,000 as proposed by the House. Provides 
limitation of $21,000,000 on availability of the Fund as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $18,000,000 as proposed by 
the House. Funds in excess of this amount are available for 
expenditure only as authorized in future appropriations Acts.

           United States Interagency Council on Homelessness

                           OPERATING EXPENSES

      Appropriates $1,500,000 for the United States Interagency 
Council on Homelessness as proposed by the Senate. The House 
had included the same amount of funding for this activity under 
its prior name, Interagency Council on the Homeless.
      The conferees expect HUD to continue providing 
administrative support on a reimbursable basis to the Council.

             National Aeronautics and Space Administration

      Of the amounts approved by the conferees in this 
agreement, NASA must limit reprogramming of funds between 
programs and activities to not more than $500,000 without prior 
notification to the Committees on Appropriations of the House 
and Senate. Any activity or program cited in this report shall 
be construed as the position of the conferees and should not be 
subject to reductions or reprogramming without prior approval. 
The conferees agree with the Senate directive that NASA include 
the outyear budget impacts of all reprogramming requests, 
including the outyear budget impact of all missions in the 
annual operating plan. The conferees direct NASA to identify, 
in the initial operating plan and all subsequent revisions, all 
Space Shuttle Return to Flight costs and purposes, the 
anticipated budget runout of the Return to Flight actions, and 
the funding sources being used to pay for the Return to Flight 
costs. The operating plan and all subsequent changes to the 
plan shall include a separate accounting of all program/mission 
reserves.
      The conferees agree with the House direction that NASA is 
to provide no less than $2,000,000 to demonstrate encryption 
technology as part of its cyber-security architecture. This 
demonstration should be conducted in cooperation with the NASA 
Inspector General. NASA is to report to the Committees on 
Appropriations of the House and Senate within 90 days on its 
plan to conduct this demonstration and is directed to convey 
the results of the demonstration upon its completion.
      The conferees agree with the Senate directive for NASA to 
provide a comprehensive plan that will respond to the Columbia 
Accident Investigation Board report as well as address other 
staffing, systemic and program shortcomings in NASA programs. 
The plan should include an assessment of any proposed 
investments that NASA considers critical to the reform of the 
agency and the success of its missions. The conferees expect 
the plan to include a 10-year funding profile for implementing 
the proposed reforms with benchmarks that are designed to 
ensure a safe return to flight. The conferees direct NASA to 
provide the report to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
House and Senate no later than January 15, 2004.
      The conferees agree with the Senate direction for a 
report on the risks associated with illegal transfer or theft 
of sensitive technologies. The conferees direct NASA and the 
NASA Inspector General to work together and report annually on 
these issues, including an assessment of risk.
      The conferees agree that program delays often result in 
large cost increases that are increasingly difficult to justify 
and that NASA should have as a priority a desire to reduce 
these costs. Therefore, the conferees direct NASA to work to 
reduce the costs associated with program delays, and report to 
the Committees on Appropriations by January 15, 2004 on options 
for cost reductions. In arriving at these options, NASA should 
include in the report an explanation of what constitutes core 
staff and program needs versus full development and operations 
staff requirements.

                       SPACE FLIGHT CAPABILITIES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $7,512,100,000 for space flight capabilities 
instead of $7,806,100,000 as proposed by the House and 
$7,582,100,000 as proposed by the Senate. Specifies that 
$15,000,000 of the amount provided for the Space Shuttle Life 
Extension Program shall be for development and independent 
assessment of concepts to increase crew survivability for crew 
sizes of 4 to 7 as proposed by the House. The conferees have 
not included the House language which would have specified 
these efforts should result in increased survivability by a 
factor of 20. Deletes the Senate language which would have 
specified $3,986,000,000 for activities related to the Space 
Shuttle and prohibited transfer of any of these funds to other 
programs or activities. Deletes Senate language which would 
have capped International Space Station costs at 
$1,507,000,000. Retains House language which allows for the 
transfer of funds from this account to the science, 
aeronautics, and exploration account in accordance with section 
312(b) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958.
      The amount provided is a reduction of $270,000,000 from 
the budget request and includes a reduction of $200,000,000 
from the International Space Station request and a reduction of 
$70,000,000 from the Space Launch Initiative budget request.
      While the conferees have agreed to delete Senate bill 
language which would have specified $3,986,000,000 for 
activities related to the Space Shuttle, the conferees agree 
that none of the reductions specified in this report should be 
taken against this activity. Transfers made pursuant to section 
312(b) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act, while 
allowed, will need to be fully justified and approved by the 
Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senatein advance 
of the transfer and must include the outyear implications on all 
activities involved in the reprogramming action.
      The conferees have not included a cost cap on the 
International Space Station as proposed by the Senate but do 
agree that there are substantial cost reductions associated 
with the program as a result of shuttle operations being 
suspended and agree that NASA needs to be more aggressive in 
controlling costs associated with reduced program activity.
      The conferees agree that of the funds appropriated in 
this account, $24,000,000 shall be for the commercial 
technology program within the Innovative Technology Transfer 
Partnerships theme. NASA shall maintain this program as it 
existed in fiscal year 2003 and prior fiscal years.
      The conferees do not agree with the Senate direction that 
the Space Flight Advisory Committee is to report directly and 
independently to the Congress on NASA's implementation of the 
Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) recommendations. 
Implementation of the CAIB recommendations is addressed further 
in the Inspector General section of this statement.
      The conferees are in agreement that the new charter of 
the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel addresses the concerns 
expressed in the Senate report and will satisfy the desire of 
the conferees to receive timely reports that assess the shuttle 
program in terms of safety, upgrades, operations, and overall 
management of the shuttle program.
      Upon the resumption of shuttle flights to the 
International Space Station, the conferees direct NASA to 
develop and forward to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
House and Senate a plan detailing the steps necessary to reach 
U.S. Core Complete, as well as the outyear costs associated 
with this plan.
      The conferees are in agreement that the Orbital Space 
Plane External Program Assessment Team (EPAT), as currently 
chartered, will address many of the concerns expressed by the 
Senate when its report suggested the creation of an independent 
oversight committee. However, the conferees are concerned that 
the current membership relies too heavily on former NASA 
officials and direct NASA to expand the membership of the EPAT 
to include individuals that have extensive non-NASA experience 
in program management to ensure necessary independence from the 
Space Launch Initiative program management. The conferees also 
direct the EPAT to report on its assessments of the program to 
the Congress on a quarterly basis, with the first report due on 
December 31, 2003.
      The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) program is expected to 
represent a significant investment by the American taxpayers if 
it is carried out to completion. It is therefore necessary that 
NASA manage this program unlike any other program it has ever 
executed or tried to execute in the past. The conferees believe 
that first and foremost, NASA must heed all the findings and 
recommendations of the International Space Station Management 
and Cost Evaluation report as well as the CAIB report. It does 
not appear from materials provided to the Congress thus far 
that this is the case. The conferees understand that NASA is 
currently scheduled to release the OSP full-scale development 
Request for Proposals (RFP) in late 2003, and are concerned 
that the goals of this RFP may not be aligned with the results 
of the ongoing interagency space policy review. The conferees 
believe that NASA should not release the RFP until the 
interagency space policy review has been completed and NASA has 
determined that the RFP is consistent with the results of this 
review. Additionally, the conferees believe the President must 
assure the Congress that sufficient resources will be available 
to support the contract awarded as a result of the RFP and the 
related NASA in-house efforts in fiscal year 2004 and the 
outyears and anticipate receipt of such assurances in a timely 
manner. Any operating plan changes that involve this program 
will not take effect until 90 days after submission to the 
Congress unless approved by the Committees on Appropriations of 
the House and Senate sooner than 90 days.
      The conferees agree with the Senate direction that NASA 
report by January 31, 2004, on the outyear costs for each 
project within the Next Generation Launch Technology program, 
the criteria being used to select technologies for investment, 
and the metrics used to determine whether projects within the 
program are progressing or should be discontinued.
      The conferees understand that NASA is currently assessing 
complementary and/or replacement logistics support to and from 
the International Space Station (ISS). This assessment 
encompasses utilization of Progress, Automated Transfer Vehicle 
(ATV), H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), Alternative Access to Space 
(AAS) concepts, Autonomous Shuttle, and possibly other cargo 
capability concepts. The AAS studies have an anticipated 
completion date of January 2004 to be followed by a thorough 
review of all the options by NASA. Additionally, the conferees 
understand that the administration is reviewing overall U.S. 
space exploration goals, including new cargo capability, as 
part of the fiscal year 2005 budget process. The conferees 
direct the administration to report back to the Committees on 
Appropriations of the House and Senate with the Agency's plan 
on ISS re-supply services by June 1, 2004.
      The conferees are concerned that in its desire to return 
the shuttle to full operations, NASA may damage seriously the 
integrity of the Shuttle Life Extension Program (SLEP). The 
conferees believe that the process that NASA has put in place 
for the SLEP will correctly identify cost effective and 
necessary modifications, but NASA must still demonstrate the 
resolve to execute properly the program by requesting adequate 
budget resources and devoting management attention to the 
effort. The conferees will continue to examine this program and 
will not entertain unrealistic reprogramming proposals that 
place the program's overall objectives in jeopardy.

                  SCIENCE, AERONAUTICS AND EXPLORATION

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Appropriates $7,929,900,000 for science, aeronautics and 
exploration instead of $7,707,900,000 as proposed by the House 
and $7,730,507,000 as proposed by the Senate. Includes language 
as proposed by the Senate which allows funding to be used for 
restoration of facilities.
      The amount provided includes the following reductions to 
the budget request:
      1. $8,000,000 from the Space Interferometer Mission;
      2. $20,000,000 from Project Prometheus;
      3. $10,000,000 from the Beyond Einstein program; and
      4. $11,000,000 from the Global Climate Change Research 
Polarimeter program;
      The conferees agree that the high radiation environment 
the Jupiter Icy Moons (JIM) mission is expected to encounter 
calls for development of low-cost hardened microcircuit devices 
for the JIM mission and is encouraged that the Jet Propulsion 
Lab is undertaking an immediate effort to validate new 
technology in time for its use on the JIM mission. The 
conferees share the concern expressed by the Senate regarding 
the Project Prometheus program, particularly uncertainties in 
the mission design, and the dependence on the new unproven 
technologies. For these reasons, the conferees direct NASA to 
provide specific program milestones and funding paths for all 
elements of Project Prometheus and report progress to the 
Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate on a 
quarterly basis. All funding lines should include a full run-
out of costs for at least 10 years. The first quarterly report 
is due on December 31, 2003.
      The conferees are in agreement with the House direction 
for NASA to evaluate the level of stipends for its Graduate 
Student Research Program and the Earth System Science 
Fellowships as well as the House direction for an evaluation on 
the merits of expanding its use of graduate fellowships. Both 
reports are due not later than June 30, 2004.
      The conferees share the concern of the House with regard 
to the establishment of a National Program Office for air 
traffic management development and direct NASA to report to the 
Committees on Appropriations by March 31, 2004 on efforts to 
establish the Office.
      The conferees remain strongly supportive of the Center of 
Excellence for Aerospace Propulsion Particulate Emissions 
Reduction established at the University of Missouri-Rolla's 
Cloud and Aerosol Sciences Lab and expect NASA to develop a 
plan to utilize the Center's capabilities on an ongoing basis.
      The conferees are aware that two of the three Virtual 
Airspace Modeling and Simulation (VAMS) programs being 
developed for the Federal Aviation Administration have been 
fully funded in NASA's budget submission. The conferees also 
note that the third program, Display System Replacement (DSR) 
enhancements, is a two-year, $15,000,000 effort that has not 
received adequate funding in the request. Because of the 
importance of these programs, the conferees expect that NASA 
fully fund all three programs in fiscal year 2004, including 
$8,000,000 for DSR, and provide sufficient resources in the 
fiscal year 2005 submission to ensure their completion by the 
close of the fiscal year.
      The conferees direct NASA to task the GSFC EOSDIS Project 
Office to develop the initial baseline architecture and 
information technology blueprint for the future EOSDIS 
andexpect this activity to mirror the direction proposed in Senate 
Report 108-143. The conferees wish to reiterate that all future earth 
science enterprise missions should take full advantage of the existing 
EOSDIS system rather than creating individual ``stove pipe'' ground 
systems that will diminish the integrated architecture developed over 
the last dozen years.
      The conferees are aware that technical problems affecting 
the Landsat 7 satellite threaten the nation's ability to 
continue providing land remote sensing data. The Land Remote 
Sensing Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-555) directed the Landsat 
Program Manager to evaluate the options for a successor land 
remote sensing system to Landsat 7 and set forth four options 
for developing a successor system. To ensure that the U.S. 
Government does not experience a loss of remote land sensing 
capabilities which would jeopardize the nation's domestic, 
foreign policy and national security interests, the conferees 
instruct NASA to immediately begin developing a successor to 
the Landsat 7 system in accordance with P.L. 102-555. 
Furthermore, the conferees instruct NASA, working in 
conjunction with the United States Geological Survey, to 
develop a successor system that may be implemented in the near 
term based on the remaining options cited in the Land Remote 
Sensing Policy Act. It is the conferee's expectation that NASA 
will include in its FY 2005 budget justification a detailed 
plan and timeline for developing a successor system to Landsat 
7.
      The conferees have provided an additional $8,500,000 for 
the NPOESS Preparatory Project to initiate the mission's 
science data system through the EOSDIS Core System at the 
Goddard Space Flight Center. Such a system should have 
capabilities to: process Level 1 data; distribute it to not 
less than five Climate Analysis and Research Systems (CARS) for 
higher level processing; and archiving all Level 1 data and 
products resulting from higher level processing activities. The 
conferees believe NASA, through the GSFC-ECS, must assume

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      Appropriates $27,300,000 for the Office of Inspector 
General instead of $26,300,000 as proposed by both the House 
and Senate. The conferees have agreed to a higher funding level 
to ensure the Inspector General has the resources to hire 
sufficient staff with technical expertise to monitor long-term 
compliance with the recommendations of the Columbia Accident 
Investigation Board (CAIB). The conferees also believe the 
Inspector General should work closely with the Return to Flight 
Task Group, the Stafford-Covey group, as it reviews NASA's 
implementation of the CAIB recommendations. The conferees 
direct the Inspector General to report on efforts to hire 
additional technical staff to the Committees on Appropriations 
of the House and Senate by June 30, 2004.
      The conferees agree with the direction contained in the 
Senate report regarding a review of NASA's contract procedures 
and conventions to determine reforms which may lead to cost 
savings.

                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

      The conferees have included five administrative 
provisions which were in both the House and Senate bills. The 
conferees have not included a provision on the working capital 
fund as proposed by the Senate. The conferees have not included 
a Senate provision which would have prohibited NASA from using 
any funds to compensate any person who contracts with NASA if 
that individual had selected early retirement or taken a buy-
out from NASA.
      The conferees agree with the Senate direction that NASA 
report on the budgetary impact of its proposed reforms to its 
personnel practices.
      The conferees agree with the Senate direction that NASA 
should contract with the National Academy of Public 
Administration on the organizational structure of NASA 
headquarters and field operations.

                  National Credit Union Administration

                       CENTRAL LIQUIDITY FACILITY

      Provides limitation of $1,500,000,000 on CLF lending 
activities from borrowed funds as proposed by the House and 
Senate.
      The conferees direct NCUA to provide quarterly reports on 
lending activities of the CLF through September 2004.

               COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT REVOLVING LOAN FUND

      Appropriates $1,200,000 instead of $1,000,000 as proposed 
by the House and $1,500,000 as proposed by the Senate. Within 
this amount, $1,000,000 is provided to augment funds available 
for technical assistance grants for fiscal year 2004 and 
$200,000 is available until expended for loans to community 
development credit unions.

                      National Science Foundation

      The conferees agree that the National Science Foundation 
is to abide by the reprogramming requirements set forth in the 
beginning of the statement of the managers.

                    RESEARCH AND RELATED ACTIVITIES

      Appropriates $4,276,600,000 for research and related 
activities instead of $4,306,360,000 as proposed by the House 
and $4,220,610,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees 
have included bill language which provides up to $345,000,000 
for polar research and operations support and $90,000,000 for a 
comprehensive research initiative on plant genomes for 
economically significant crops.
      The conference agreement provides $4,276,600,000 for 
ongoing and new research priorities of the Foundation, an 
increase of over $220,140,000 above the fiscal year 2003 level. 
Within the very severe overall fiscal constraints imposed on 
the conferees for fiscal year 2004, the managers have given 
their highest priority to funding basic research within the 
research and related activities account. This account supports 
investigator-initiated grants within each of the core 
disciplines as well as critical cross-cutting research which 
brings together multiple disciplines. The conferees urge the 
Foundation in allocating the scarce resources provided in this 
bill and in preparing its fiscal 2005 budget request to be 
sensitive to maintaining the proper balance between the goal of 
stimulating interdisciplinary research and the need to maintain 
robust single issue research in the core disciplines.
      The conferees direct NSF to include multi-year budget 
estimates and future budget impacts for multi-disciplinary and 
mid-level activities in the annual operating plan and in future 
budget requests.
      The specific funding level for each of NSF's research 
activities is as follows:

housing program, as proposed by the Senate.

                        ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION

      Language is included as an administrative provision, as 
proposed in the budget submission, which amends the 
Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act to bring the 
Corporation's compensation practices in line with those of 
federally chartered non-profit corporations.

          DIVISION H--MISCELLANEOUS APPROPRIATIONS AND OFFSETS

                    (INCLUDING RESCISSIONS OF FUNDS)

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      Sec. 101. The conference report includes language 
regarding the Conservation Security Program.
      Sec. 102. This section redirects funds provided by P.L. 
108-106 from the Emergency Preparedness and Response, Disaster 
Relief account to the Forest Service and Natural Resources 
Conservation Service and other accounts in the Department of 
Agriculture which fund critically needed wildfire, forestry and 
watershed protection services in response to the unprecedented 
wildfire emergencies which recently devastated portions of 
southern California. The emergency declaration does not 
increase emergency spending beyond what was designated in P.L. 
108-106.
      Sec. 103. The conference agreement provides additional 
funding for reimbursement to State and local law enforcement 
agencies for security costs associated with the 2004 
Presidential Candidate Nominating Conventions. The conference 
agreement provides not more than $25,000,000 each for New York 
City and Boston. The Department of Justice is directed to

to provide a $49,000,000 increase for the advance procurement 
and full funding of the Virginia class submarine and a 
$19,600,000 increase for additional requirements for the 
refueling of the SSN-715. The conferees understand that 
$9,200,000 is available from fiscal year 2004/2005 Research, 
Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy funds made available for 
New Design SSN and Advanced Submarine Systems Development. The 
conferees direct that the $9,200,000 reduction be applied 
solely to projects included in the base program requested in 
the fiscal year 2004 budget and applied equally to both New 
Design SSN and Advanced Submarine Systems Development programs. 
The conferees request that a breakout of the application of 
this reduction be provided to the congressional defense 
committees within 30 days of enactment of this Act. The 
conferees further understand that $8,000,000 of the funds 
appropriated in fiscal year 2003 and $11,800,000 of the funds 
appropriated in fiscal year 2004 for outfitting, post delivery, 
conversions, and first destination transportation are in excess 
to current requirements and therefore available for 
reprogramming. The conferees direct that these reductions be 
equitably applied to the ships and submarines for which the 
funds were originally requested.
      The conference agreement includes a general provision 
which makes technical adjustments to section 724 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, as 
amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2004.

regarding the storage of mercury in the National Defense 
Stockpile.
      The conference agreement includes a general provision 
providing technical adjustments and authority for certain 
classified activities provided for in Public Law 107-206 and 
described in the classified annexes accompanying that Act and 
Public Law 108-11.
      The conference agreement includes a general provision 
providing direction regarding funds provided in Public Laws 
107-117, 107-248, and 108-87 under the heading ``National 
Defense Sealift Fund'' for construction of additional sealift 
capacity.
      DoD-VA Medical Care.--The conferees direct the Secretary 
of the Navy to expand the use of the North Chicago VA Medical 
Center by the DoD beneficiaries of the Great Lakes region. The 
conferees also direct the Secretary to work with the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to finalize site selection for a joint 
Navy/VA ambulatory care center to serve both DoD beneficiaries 
and veteran patients. The conferees urge the Secretary to study 
siting the clinic adjacent to the North Chicago VA Medical 
Center. The Secretary shall report to the Committees on 
Appropriations on the site selected by July 30, 2004. The 
conferees also understand that the Committees will see a 
proposal for design planning and funding construction of this 
facility in fiscal year 2006.
      Chemical Biological Suit.--The conferees are concerned 
with a recent GAO finding that the production of the JSLIST 
chemical biological suit worn by U.S. soldiers is dependent 
upon a foreign-based, single supply source for its most 
critical components. The Joint Program Executive Office for 
Chemical and Biological Defense plan to field test and qualify 
an off-the-shelf, alternate fabric/membrane to incorporate into 
a next generation suit will take three years to complete given 
current funding levels. The conferees direct the Department of 
Defense to provide necessary funds from those available 
immediately to begin field testing and qualification of an 
alternate, off-the-shelf fabric/membrane for the JSLIST suit.
      Digitization of DoD Technical Manuals.--Within 10 days of 
the effective date of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall 
complete the transfer of contract and program administration of 
the funds appropriated for the Digitization of DoD Technical 
Manuals from the Army to the Marine Corps Systems Command and 
shall transfer the balance of unobligated fiscal year 2003 
funds and all fiscal year 2004 funds appropriated for this 
program from Other Procurement, Army to the ``Auto Test 
Equipment Systems'' line in Procurement, Marine Corps. The 
Secretary shall ensure that the transfer occurs in a manner 
that causes no delays or disruption in the program.
      Vaccine Development.--The conferees are aware that there 
has been considerable progress made by DARPA on the development 
of a therapeutic vaccine for protection against anthrax as a 
weapon of bioterrorism. The conferees understand that the 
research and development has progressed to the point where 
primate and human clinical trials are the next phase. The 
conferees encourage the Department of Defense to continue this 
important research, and if necessary, use existing 
reprogramming authorities to address any fiscal year 2004 
funding shortfalls should they emerge.
      Philadelphia Military Academy.--The conferees recommend 
the Department of Defense establish a Junior ROTC program at 
the Philadelphia Military Academy. The Department should 
establish this program as quickly as feasible and use funds 
previously appropriated for these types of training programs.
      Consequence Management Training.--It is the conferees' 
intent that the funds appropriated in Public Law 107-248 for 
consequence management training at Camp Gruber are to train 
both DoD personnel and non-DoD first responders.
      Family Assistance and Ombudsman for WRAMC.--The demand 
for medical treatment and family assistance has increased 
significantly at our military medical facilities. In 
particular, there have been almost 2,000 soldiers who have gone 
through Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) for medical 
treatment since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 
WRAMC staff has responded exceptionally well to the medical 
needs of our injured troops and should be commended for their 
work. The conferees, however, are concerned that family members
