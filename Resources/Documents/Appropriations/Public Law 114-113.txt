                United States assistance or has an effective arrangement 
                that is providing substantial reimbursement of such 
                taxes; or
                    (B) the foreign policy interests of the United 
                States outweigh the purpose of this section to ensure

        describes the privileges and immunities applicable to United 
        States foreign assistance for such country generally, or an 
        individual agreement between the Government of the United States 
        and such government that describes, among other things, the 
        treatment for tax purposes that will be accorded the United 
        States assistance provided under that agreement; and
            (2) the term ``taxes and taxation'' shall include value

that are specifically designated for particular programs or activities 
by this or any other Act may be extended for an additional fiscal year 
if the Secretary of State or the USAID Administrator, as appropriate, 
determines and reports promptly to the Committees on Appropriations that 
the termination of assistance to a country or a significant change in 
circumstances makes it unlikely that such designated funds can be 
obligated during the original period of availability:  Provided, That 
such designated funds that continue to be available for an additional 
fiscal year shall be obligated only for the purpose of such designation.

    Sec. 9007.  Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to the 
Committees on Appropriations and Foreign Relations of the Senate and the 
Committees on Appropriations and Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives a written report on ways to improve the effectiveness, 
and mitigate the risks, of United States participation in the 
International Monetary Fund (the Fund) that includes the following:
            (1) An analysis of recent changes to the surveillance 
        products and policies of the Fund and whether those products and 
        policies effectively address the shortcomings of surveillance by 
        the Fund in the periods preceding the global financial crisis 
        that began in 2008 and the European debt crisis that began in 
        2009.
            (2) A discussion of ways to better encourage countries to 
        implement policy recommendations of the Fund, including--
                    (A) whether the implementation rate of such policy 
                recommendations would increase if the Fund provided 
                regular status reports on whether countries have 
                implemented its policy recommendations; and
                    (B) whether or not lending by the Fund should be 
                limited to countries that have taken necessary steps to 
                implement such policy recommendations, including an 
                analysis of the potential effectiveness of that 
                limitation.
            (3) An analysis of the transparency policy of the Fund, ways 
        that transparency policy can be improved, and whether such 
        improvements would be beneficial.
            (4) A detailed analysis of the riskiness of exceptional 
        access loans provided by the Fund, including--
                    (A) whether the additional interest rate surcharge 
                is working as intended to discourage large and prolonged 
                use of resources of the Fund; and
                    (B) whether it would be beneficial for the Fund to 
                require collateral when making exceptional access loans, 
                and how requiring collateral would affect the make-up of 
                exceptional access loans and the demand for such loans.
            (5) A description of how the classification of loans 
        provided by the Fund would change if Fund quotas were increased 
        under the amendments to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund 
        proposed in resolution 66-2 of the Board of Governors of the 
        Fund, including an assessment of how the quota increase would 
        affect the classification of exceptional access loans 
        outstanding as of the date of the report and whether the quota 
        increase would lead to revisions of the classification of such 
        loans.
            (6) A discussion and analysis of lessons learned from the 
        lending arrangements that included the Fund, the European 
        Commission, and the European Central Bank (commonly referred to 
        as the ``Troika'') during the European debt crisis.
            (7) An analysis of the risks or benefits of increasing the 
        transparency of the technical assistance projects of the Fund, 
        including a discussion of--
                    (A) the advantages and disadvantages of the current 
                technical assistance disclosure policies of the Fund;

[[Page 129 STAT. 2834]]

                    (B) how technical assistance from the Fund could be 
                better used to prevent crises from happening in the 
                future; and
                    (C) whether and how the Fund coordinates technical 
                assistance projects with other organizations, including 
                the United States Department of the Treasury, to avoid 
                duplication of efforts.

            (3) that any increase in the cost of labor, training, or 
        delays resulting from the use of such hiring preference does not

by the Secretary and statutorily required low-income and very low-income 
use restrictions if any, associated with one or more multifamily housing 
project or projects to another multifamily housing project or projects.
    (b) Phased Transfers.--Transfers of project-based assistance under 
this section may be done in phases to accommodate the financing and 
other requirements related to rehabilitating or constructing the project 
or projects to which the assistance is transferred, to ensure that such 
project or projects meet the standards under subsection (c).
    (c) The transfer authorized in subsection (a) is subject to the 
following conditions:
            (1) Number and bedroom size of units.--
                    (A) For occupied units in the transferring project: 
                The number of low-income and very low-income units and 
                the configuration (i.e., bedroom size) provided by the 
                transferring project shall be no less than when 
                transferred to the receiving project or projects and the 
                net dollar amount of Federal assistance provided to the

                receiving project or projects.
                    (B) For unoccupied units in the transferring 
                project: The Secretary may authorize a reduction in the 
                number of dwelling units in the receiving project or 
                projects to allow for a reconfiguration of bedroom sizes 
                to meet current market demands, as determined by the 
                Secretary and provided there is no increase in the 
                project-based assistance budget authority.

[[Page 129 STAT. 2890]]

            (2) The transferring project shall, as determined by the 
        Secretary, be either physically obsolete or economically 
        nonviable.
            (3) The receiving project or projects shall meet or exceed 
        applicable physical standards established by the Secretary.
            (4) The owner or mortgagor of the transferring project shall 
        notify and consult with the tenants residing in the transferring 
        project and provide a certification of approval by all 
        appropriate local governmental officials.
            (5) The tenants of the transferring project who remain 
        eligible for assistance to be provided by the receiving project 
        or projects shall not be required to vacate their units in the 
        transferring project or projects until new units in the 
        receiving project are available for occupancy.
            (6) The Secretary determines that this transfer is in the 
        best interest of the tenants.
            (7) If either the transferring project or the receiving 
        project or projects meets the condition specified in subsection 
        (d)(2)(A), any lien on the receiving project resulting from 
        additional financing obtained by the owner shall be subordinate 
        to any FHA-insured mortgage lien transferred to, or placed on, 
        such project by the Secretary, except that the Secretary may 
        waive this requirement upon determination that such a waiver is 
        necessary to facilitate the financing of acquisition, 
        construction, and/or rehabilitation of the receiving project or 
        projects.
            (8) If the transferring project meets the requirements of 
        subsection (d)(2), the owner or mortgagor of the receiving 
        project or projects shall execute and record either a 
        continuation of the existing use agreement or a new use 
        agreement for the project where, in either case, any use 
        restrictions in such agreement are of no lesser duration than 
        the existing use restrictions.
            (9) The transfer does not increase the cost (as defined in 
        section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended) 
        of any FHA-insured mortgage, except to the extent that 
        appropriations are provided in advance for the amount of any 
        such increased cost.

    Sec. 216.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in fiscal

States Housing Act of 1937 or other Federal programs, the Secretary 
shall maintain any rental assistance payments under section 8 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 and other programs that are attached

determines, in consultation with the tenants and the local government, 
that such a multifamily property owned or held by the Secretary is not

appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts remain in 
effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual 
abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major 
threats to health and safety after written notice to and informed 
consent of the affected tenants and use of other available remedies, 
such as partial abatements or receivership. After disposition of any 
multifamily property described under this section, the contract and 
allowable rent levels on such properties shall be subject to the 
requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.

or guideline relating to asset management that restricts or limits in 
any way the use of capital funds for central office costs pursuant to

are eligible under section 9(e) for assistance with amounts from the 
operating fund in excess of the amounts permitted under section 9(g)(1) 
or 9(g)(2).

    Sec. 220.  No official or employee of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development shall be designated as an allotment holder unless the 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer has determined that such allotment 
holder has implemented an adequate system of funds control and has 
received training in funds control procedures and directives. The Chief 
Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a trained allotment holder

Department of Housing and Urban Development shall, for fiscal year 2016, 
notify the public through the Federal Register and other means, as

                    (B) receives consecutive scores of less than 60 on

Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured projects with 
assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but do not apply to such units 
assisted under section 8(o)(13) (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public 
housing units assisted with capital or operating funds under section 9

project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the exercise of 
contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for 
imminent major threats to health and safety after written notice to and 
informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other remedies set 
forth above. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation 
with the tenants and the local government, that the property is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, 
State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 524 
of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 
(``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be remedied in

payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties, 
or provide other rental assistance. The Secretary shall report semi-

through the Real Estate Assessment Center and have physical inspection 
scores of less than 30 or have consecutive physical inspection scores of 
less than 60. The report shall include:
            (1) The enforcement actions being taken to address such 
        conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties and 
        termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have such 
        conditions multiple times; and
            (2) Actions that the Department of Housing and Urban 
        Development is taking to protect tenants of such identified 
        properties.

    Sec. 226.  None of the funds made available by this Act, or any 
other Act, for purposes authorized under section 8 (only with respect to 
the tenant-based rental assistance program) and section 9 of the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.), may be used by any 
public housing agency for any amount of salary, including bonuses, for 
the chief executive officer of which, or any other official or employee 
of which, that exceeds the annual rate of basic pay payable for a 
position at level IV of the Executive Schedule at any time during any

    Sec. 237.  The language under the heading ``Rental Assistance

Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-55) <<NOTE: 42 USC 1437f 
note.>>  is amended:
            (1) In proviso eighteen, by inserting ``for fiscal year 2012 
        and hereafter,'' after ``Provided further, That''; and
            (2) In proviso nineteen, by striking ``, which may extend

    Sec. 238.  Section 526 (12 U.S.C. 1735f-4) of the National Housing 
Act is amended by inserting at the end of subsection (b):
    ``(c) The Secretary may establish an exception to any minimum 
property standard established under this section in order to address 
alternative water systems, including cisterns, which meet requirements 
of State and local building codes that ensure health and safety 
standards.''.
    Sec. 239.  <<NOTE: 42 USC 1437f note.>> The Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development shall increase, pursuant to this section, the number 
of Moving to Work agencies authorized under section 204, title II, of 
the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development 
and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (Public Law 104-134; 
110 Stat. 1321) by adding to the program 100 public housing agencies 
that are designated as high performing agencies under the Public Housing 
Assessment System (PHAS) or the Section Eight Management Assessment 
Program (SEMAP). No public housing agency shall be granted this 
designation through this section that administers in excess of 27,000 
aggregate housing vouchers and public housing units. Of the agencies 
selected under this section, no less than 50 shall administer 1,000 or 
fewer aggregate housing voucher and public housing units, no less than 
47 shall administer 1,001-6,000 aggregate housing voucher and public 
housing units, and no more than 3 shall administer 6,001-27,000 
aggregate housing voucher and public housing units. Of the 100 agencies 
selected under this section, five shall be agencies with portfolio 
awards under the Rental Assistance Demonstration that meet the other 
requirements of this section, including current designations as high 
performing agencies or such designations held immediately prior to such 
portfolio awards. Selection of agencies under this section shall be 
based on ensuring the geographic diversity of Moving to Work agencies. 
In addition to the preceding selection criteria, agencies shall be 
designated by the Secretary over a 7-year period. The Secretary shall 
establish a research advisory committee which shall advise the Secretary 
with respect to specific policy proposals and methods of research and 
evaluation for the demonstration. The advisory committee shall include 
program and research experts from the Department, a fair representation 
of agencies with a Moving to Work designation, and independent subject 
matter experts in housing policy research. For each cohort of agencies 
receiving a designation under this heading, the Secretary shall direct 
one specific policy change to be implemented by the agencies, and with 
the approval of the Secretary, such agencies may implement additional 
policy changes. All agencies designated under this section shall be 
evaluated through rigorous research as determined by the Secretary, and 
shall provide information requested by the Secretary to support such 
oversight and evaluation, including the targeted policy changes. 
Research and evaluation shall be coordinated under the direction of the

[[Page 129 STAT. 2898]]

Secretary, and in consultation with the advisory committee, and findings 
shall be shared broadly. The Secretary shall consult the advisory 
committee with respect to policy changes that have proven successful and 
can be applied more broadly to all public housing agencies, and propose 
any necessary statutory changes. The Secretary may, at the request of a 
Moving to Work agency and one or more adjacent public housing agencies 
in the same area, designate that Moving to Work agency as a regional 
agency. A regional Moving to Work agency may administer the assistance 
under sections 8 and 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 
U.S.C. 1437f and g) for the participating agencies within its region 
pursuant to the terms of its Moving to Work agreement with the 
Secretary. The Secretary may agree to extend the term of the agreement 
and to make any necessary changes to accommodate regionalization. A 
Moving to Work agency may be selected as a regional agency if the 
Secretary determines that unified administration of assistance under 
sections 8 and 9 by that agency across multiple jurisdictions will lead 
to efficiencies and to greater housing choice for low-income persons in 
the region. For purposes of this expansion, in addition to the 
provisions of the Act retained in section 204, section 8(r)(1) of the 
Act shall continue to apply unless the Secretary determines that waiver 
of this section is necessary to implement comprehensive rent reform and 
occupancy policies subject to evaluation by the Secretary, and the 
waiver contains, at a minimum, exceptions for requests to port due to 
employment, education, health and safety. No public housing agency 
granted this designation through this section shall receive more funding 
under sections 8 or 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 than it 
otherwise would have received absent this designation. The Secretary 
shall extend the current Moving to Work agreements of previously 
designated participating agencies until the end of each such agency's 
fiscal year 2028 under the same terms and conditions of such current 
agreements, except for any changes to such terms or conditions otherwise 
mutually agreed upon by the Secretary and any such agency and such 
extension agreements shall prohibit any statutory offset of any reserve 
balances equal to 4 months of operating expenses. Any such reserve 
balances that exceed such amount shall remain available to any such 
agency for all permissible purposes under such agreement unless subject 
to a statutory offset. In addition to other reporting requirements, all 
Moving to Work agencies shall report financial data to the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development as specified by the Secretary, so that the 
effect of Moving to Work policy changes can be measured.

    Sec. 240. (a) Authority.--Subject to the conditions in subsection 
(d), the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may authorize, in 
response to requests received in fiscal years 2016 through 2020, the 
transfer of some or all project-based assistance, tenant-based 
assistance, capital advances, debt, and statutorily required use 
restrictions from housing assisted under section 811 of the Cranston-

of housing, as permitted by the Secretary.

        accommodate the financing and other requirements related to 
        rehabilitating or constructing the housing to which the 
        assistance is transferred, to ensure that such housing meets the 
        conditions under subsection (d).
            (2) The capital advance repayment requirements, use 
        restrictions, rental assistance, and debt shall transfer 
        proportionally from the transferring housing to the receiving 
        housing.

    (d) Conditions.--The transfers authorized by this section shall be 
subject to the following conditions:
            (1) the owner of the transferring housing shall demonstrate 
        that the transfer is in compliance with applicable Federal, 
        State, and local requirements regarding Housing for Persons with 
        Disabilities and shall provide the Secretary with evidence of 
        obtaining any approvals related to housing disabled persons that 
        are necessary under Federal, State, and local government 
        requirements;
            (2) the owner of the transferring housing shall demonstrate 
        to the Secretary that any transfer is in the best interest of 
        the disabled residents by offering opportunities for increased 
        integration or less concentration of individuals with 
        disabilities;
            (3) the owner of the transferring housing shall continue to 
        provide the same number of units as approved for rental 
        assistance by the Secretary in the receiving housing;
            (4) the owner of the transferring housing shall consult with 
        the disabled residents in the transferring housing about any 
        proposed transfer under this section and shall notify the 
        residents of the transferring housing who are eligible for 
        assistance to be provided in the receiving housing that they 
        shall not be required to vacate the transferring housing until 
        the receiving housing is available for occupancy;
            (5) the receiving housing shall meet or exceed applicable 
        physical standards established or adopted by the Secretary; and
            (6) if the receiving housing has a mortgage insured under 
        title II of the National Housing Act, any lien on the receiving 
        housing resulting from additional financing shall be subordinate 
        to any federally insured mortgage lien transferred to, or placed 
        on, such housing, except that the Secretary may waive this 
        requirement upon determination that such a waiver is necessary 
        to facilitate the financing of acquisition, construction, or 
        rehabilitation of the receiving housing.

    (e) Public Notice.--The Secretary shall publish a notice in the 
Federal Register of the terms and conditions, including criteria for the 
Department's approval of transfers pursuant to this section no later 
than 30 days before the effective date of such notice.
    Sec. 241. (a) Of the unobligated balances, including recaptures and 
carryover, remaining from funds appropriated to the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development under the heading ``General and Special 
Risk Program Account'', and for the cost of guaranteed notes and other 
obligations under the heading ``Native American Housing Block Grants'',

    (b) All unobligated balances, including recaptures and carryover, 
remaining from funds appropriated to the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development under the headings ``Rural Housing and Economic 
Development'', and ``Homeownership and

Opportunity for People Everywhere Grants'' are hereby permanently 
rescinded.
    Sec. 242.  Funds made available in this title under the heading 
``Homeless Assistance Grants'' may be used by the Secretary to 
participate in Performance Partnership Pilots authorized in an 
appropriations Act for fiscal year 2016 as initially authorized under 
section 526 of division H of Public Law 113-76 and extended under 
section 524 of division G of Public Law 113-235:  Provided, That such 
participation shall be limited to no more than 10 continuums of care and 
housing activities to improve outcomes for disconnected youth.
    Sec. 243.  With respect to grant amounts awarded under the heading 
``Homeless Assistance Grants'' for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 for the 
Continuum of Care (CoC) program as authorized under subtitle C of title 
IV of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, costs paid by program 
income of grant recipients may count toward meeting the recipient's 
matching requirements, provided the costs are eligible CoC costs that 
supplement the recipients CoC program.
    Sec. 244.  With respect to funds appropriated under the ``Community 
Development Fund'' heading for formula allocation to states pursuant to 
42 U.S.C. 5306(d), the Secretary shall permit a jurisdiction to 
demonstrate compliance with 42 U.S.C. 5305(c)(2)(A) if it had been 
designated as majority low- and moderate-income pursuant to data from 
the 2000 decennial Census and it continues to have economic distress as 
evidenced by inclusion in a designated Rural Promise Zone or Distressed 
County as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission. This section 
shall apply to any such state funds appropriated under such heading

rental housing program:  Provided, That in addition, $40,000,000 shall

following terms and conditions:
            (1) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) shall 
        make grants to counseling intermediaries approved by the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (with match to 
        be determined by NRC based on affordability and the economic 
        conditions of an area; a match also may be waived by NRC based 
        on the aforementioned conditions) to provide mortgage 
        foreclosure mitigation assistance primarily to States and areas 
        with high rates of defaults and foreclosures to help eliminate 
        the default and foreclosure of mortgages of owner-occupied 
        single-family homes that are at risk of such foreclosure. Other 
        than areas with high rates of defaults and foreclosures, grants 
        may also be provided to approved counseling intermediaries based 
        on a geographic analysis of the Nation by NRC which determines 
        where there is a prevalence of mortgages that are risky and 
        likely to fail, including any trends for mortgages that are 
        likely to default and face foreclosure. A State Housing Finance 
        Agency may also be eligible where the State Housing Finance 
        Agency meets all the requirements under this paragraph. A HUD-
        approved counseling intermediary shall meet certain mortgage 
        foreclosure mitigation assistance counseling requirements, as 
        determined by NRC, and shall be approved by HUD or NRC as 
        meeting these requirements.
            (2) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance shall only be 
        made available to homeowners of owner-occupied homes with 
        mortgages in default or in danger of default. These mortgages 
        shall likely be subject to a foreclosure action and homeowners 
        will be provided such assistance that shall consist of 
        activities that are likely to prevent foreclosures and result in 
        the long-term affordability of the mortgage retained pursuant to 
        such activity or another positive outcome for the homeowner. No 
        funds made available under this paragraph may be provided 
        directly to lenders or homeowners to discharge outstanding 
        mortgage balances or for any other direct debt reduction 
        payments.
            (3) The use of mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance by 
        approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing Finance 
        Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the borrower's 
        financial situation, an evaluation of the current value of the 
        property that is subject to the mortgage, counseling regarding 
        the assumption of the mortgage by another non-Federal party, 
        counseling regarding the possible purchase of the mortgage by a 
        non-Federal third party, counseling and advice of all likely 
        restructuring and refinancing strategies or the approval of a 
        work-out strategy by all interested parties.
            (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds 
        under this paragraph to its own charter members with expertise 
        in foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a certification 
        by NRC that the procedures for selection do not consist of any 
        procedures or activities that could be construed as a conflict 
        of interest or have the appearance of impropriety.

[[Page 129 STAT. 2903]]

            (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing 
        Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall have 
        demonstrated experience in successfully working with financial 
        institutions as well as borrowers facing default, delinquency 
        and foreclosure as well as documented counseling capacity, 
        outreach capacity, past successful performance and positive 
        outcomes with documented counseling plans (including post 
        mortgage foreclosure mitigation counseling), loan workout 
        agreements and loan modification agreements. NRC may use other 
        criteria to demonstrate capacity in underserved areas.
            (6) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to $2,000,000 may be made available to build the mortgage 
        foreclosure and default mitigation counseling capacity of 
        counseling intermediaries through NRC training courses with HUD-
        approved counseling intermediaries and their partners, except 
        that private financial institutions that participate in NRC 
        training shall pay market rates for such training.
            (7) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to 5 percent may be used for associated administrative 
        expenses for NRC to carry out activities provided under this 
        section.
            (8) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance grants may 
        include a budget for outreach and advertising, and training, as 
        determined by NRC.
            (9) NRC shall continue to report bi-annually to the House 
        and Senate Committees on Appropriations as well as the Senate 
        Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee on its 
        efforts to mitigate mortgage default.

                guidance on the following:
                          (i) Identification of types of information 
                      that would qualify as a cyber threat indicator 
                      under this title that would be unlikely to include 
                      information that--
                                    (I) is not directly related to a 
                                cybersecurity threat; and
                                    (II) is personal information of a 
                                specific individual or information that 
                                identifies a specific individual.
                          (ii) Identification of types of information 
                      protected under otherwise applicable privacy laws 
                      that are unlikely to be directly related to a 
                      cybersecurity threat.
                          (iii) Such other matters as the Attorney 
                      General and the Secretary of Homeland Security 
                      consider appropriate for entities sharing cyber

for establishing international standards, specifications, and best 
practices related to the administration and governance of border 
controls and inspection formalities, should establish standards for the 
introduction of electronic passports (referred to in this section as 
``e-passports''), and obligate member countries to utilize such e-
passports as soon as possible. Such e-passports should be a combined 
paper and electronic passport that contains biographic and biometric 
information that can be used to authenticate the identity of travelers 
through an embedded chip.

                          (i) Any applicant with an eligible claim 
                      described in subsection (c)(2) who has received, 
                      or is entitled or scheduled to receive, any 
                      payment that is equal to, or in excess of, 30 
                      percent of the total compensatory damages owed to 
                      such applicant on the applicant's claim from any 
                      source other than this Fund shall not receive any 
                      payment from the Fund until such time as all other 
                      eligible applicants have received from the Fund an 
                      amount equal to 30 percent of the compensatory 
                      damages awarded to those applicants pursuant to 
                      their final judgments or to claims under 
                      subsection (c)(2)(B) or (c)(2)(C). For purposes of 
                      calculating the pro rata amounts for these 
                      payments, the Special Master shall not include the 
                      total compensatory damages for applicants excluded 
                      from payment by this subparagraph.
                          (ii) To the extent that an applicant with an 
                      eligible claim has received less than 30 percent 
                      of the compensatory damages owed that applicant 
                      under a final judgment or claim described in 
                      subsection (c)(2) from any source other than this 
                      Fund, such applicant may apply to the Special 
                      Master for the difference between the percentage 
                      of compensatory damages the applicant has received 
                      from other sources and the percentage of 
                      compensatory damages to be awarded other eligible 
                      applicants from the Fund.
            (4) Additional payments.--On January 1 of the second 
        calendar year that begins after the date of the initial payments 
        described in paragraph (1) if funds are available in the Fund, 
        the Special Master shall authorize additional payments on a pro 
        rata basis to those claimants with eligible claims under 
        subsection (c)(2) and shall authorize additional payments for 
        eligible claims annually thereafter if funds are available in 
        the Fund.
            (5) Subrogation and retention of rights.--
                    (A) United states subrogated to creditor rights to 
                the extent of payment.--The United States shall be 
                subrogated to the rights of any person who applies for 
                and receives payments under this section, but only to 
                the extent and in the amount of such payments made under 
                this section. The President shall pursue these 
                subrogated rights as claims or offsets of the United 
                States in appropriate ways, including any negotiation 
                process that precedes the normalization of relations 
                between the foreign state designated as a state sponsor 
                of terrorism and the United States or the lifting of 
                sanctions against such foreign state.
                    (B) Rights retained.--To the extent amounts of 
                damages remain unpaid and outstanding following any 
                payments made under this subsection, each applicant 
                shall retain that applicant's creditor rights in any 
                unpaid and outstanding amounts of the judgment, 
                including any

                prejudgment or post-judgment interest, or punitive

                shall address the following:
                          (i) The types of disposable devices that could

                      durable medical equipment under the Medicare 
                      program, the similarities and differences between 
                      such disposable devices and the durable medical 
                      equipment for which they would be a substitute, 
                      and the extent to which other payers, including 
                      the Medicaid program and private payers, cover 
                      such disposable devices.

                      under current Medicare coverage and payment 
                      policies for disposable devices that are 
                      substitutes for durable medical equipment and how 
                      such policies affect manufacturers' decisions to 
                      develop innovative products and providers' and 
                      suppliers' decisions to use such products.
                          (iii) Implications of expanding coverage under 
                      the Medicare program to include additional 
                      disposable devices that are substitutes for 
                      durable medical equipment.
                          (iv) Payment methodologies that could be used 
                      to pay for disposable devices that are substitutes 
                      for durable medical equipment other than 
                      applicable disposable devices pursuant to the 
                      amendments made by subsections (a) and (b).
                          (v) Other applicable areas determined 
                      appropriate by the Comptroller General.

                      under the home health benefit, use the applicable 
                      disposable device and the period of use of the 
                      applicable disposable devices compared to the 
                      beneficiaries who use the substitute durable 
                      medical equipment and their period of use.
                          (iii) How payment rates of other payers, 
                      including the Medicaid program and private payers,

                      obligations, and
                          (ii) is written in a manner calculated to be
