Account Level Data Standards

This list of data elements describes the appropriations accounts from whichagencies fund Federal awards.

 

The DATA Act requirements for data definitions and reporting financial data didnot necessitate developing new definitions, as agencies have collected and reported these data to OMB and Treasury for decades. The definitions for the financial dataelements below were written explicitly to inform the public and others not wellversed in the nuances of the Federal Government's budgeting and accounting laws,
administrative guidance, operational systems, and audited agency financial systems.
Agencies will continue to follow the detailed guidance in OMB Circular A-11 andthe Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) in recording financial data in their systems


and reporting the same to OMB and Treasury. The data standards below are drawnfrom these more detailed definitions that agencies will continue to follow.

 

Data Element

Data Definition

AppropriationsAccount

The basic unit of an appropriation generally reflecting eachunnumbered paragraph in an appropriation act. Anappropriation account typically encompasses a number of activities or projects and may be subject to restrictions orconditions applicable to only the account, the appropriationact, titles within an appropriation act, other appropriation acts,
or the Government as a whole.

 

An appropriations account is represented by a TAFS createdby Treasury in consultation with OMB.

(defined in OMB Circular A-11)

BudgetAuthorityAppropriated

A provision of law (not necessarily in an appropriations act)
authorizing an account to incur obligations and to makeoutlays for a given purpose. Usually, but not always, anappropriation provides budget authority.

(defined in OMB Circular A-11)

Object Class

Categories in a classification system that presents obligationsby the items or services purchased by the FederalGovernment. Each specific object class is defined in OMB Circular A-11 § 83.6.

(defined in OMB Circular A-11)

Obligation

Obligation means a legally binding agreement that will resultin outlays, immediately or in the future. When you place anorder, sign a contract, award a grant, purchase a service, ortake other actions that require the Government to makepayments to the public or from one Government account toanother, you incur an obligation. It is a violation of the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)) to involve the FederalGovernment in a contract or obligation for payment ofmoney before an appropriation is made, unless authorized by law. This means you cannot incur obligations in a vacuum; youincur an obligation against budget authority in a Treasuryaccount that belongs to your agency. It is a violation of theAntideficiency Act to incur an obligation in an amount greaterthan the amount available in the Treasury account that isavailable. This means that the account must have budget




authority sufficient to cover the total of such obligations atthe time the obligation is incurred. In addition, the obligation you incur must conform to other applicable provisions of law,
and you must be able to support the amounts reported by thedocumentary evidence required by 31 U.S.C. § 1501.
Moreover, you are required to maintain certifications andrecords showing that the amounts have been obligated (31U.S.C. § 1108). The following subsections provide additional guidance on when to record obligations for the different typesof goods and services or the amount.

 

Additional detail is provided in Circular A‐11.

Other Budgetary Resources

New borrowing authority, contract authority, and spendingauthority from offsetting collections provided by Congress inan appropriations act or other legislation, or unobligatedbalances of budgetary resources made available in previouslegislation, to incur obligations and to make outlays.

(defined in OMB Circular A-11)

Outlay

Payments made to liquidate an obligation (other than therepayment of debt principal or other disbursements that are"means of financing" transactions). Outlays generally areequal to cash disbursements but also are recorded for cash-
equivalent transactions, such as the issuance of debentures topay insurance claims, and in a few cases are recorded on anaccrual basis such as interest on public issues of the publicdebt. Outlays are the measure of Government spending.

(defined in OMB Circular A-11)
