limitations of the data.

    (b) For fiscal year 2013 and thereafter, the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shall include in all such data 
releases, language similar to the following that would make clear that 
trace data cannot be used to draw broad conclusions about firearms-
related crime:
            (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement 
        authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale 
        and possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies 
        may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons 
        are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not

[[Page 127 STAT. 272]]

        all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms 
        traced are used in crime.
            (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for 
        purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of 
        firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected do 
        not constitute a random sample and should not be considered 
        representative of the larger universe of all firearms used by 
        criminals, or any subset of that universe. Firearms are normally 
        traced to the first retail seller, and sources reported for 
        firearms traced do not necessarily represent the sources or 
        methods by which firearms in general are acquired for use in 
        crime.

    Sec. 515. <<NOTE: Audits. Reports. Deadlines.>> (a) The Inspectors 
General of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science 
Foundation, and the Legal Services Corporation shall conduct audits, 
pursuant to the Inspector General Act (5 U.S.C. App.), of grants or 
contracts for which funds are appropriated by this Act, and shall submit 
reports to Congress on the progress of such audits, which may include 
preliminary findings and a description of areas of particular interest, 
within 180 days after initiating such an audit and every 180 days 
thereafter until any such audit is completed.

    (b) <<NOTE: Public information. Web posting.>> Within 60 days after 
the date on which an audit described in subsection (a) by an Inspector 
General is completed, the Secretary, Attorney General, Administrator, 
Director, or President, as appropriate, shall make the results of the 
audit available to the public on the Internet website maintained by the 
Department, Administration, Foundation, or Corporation, respectively. 
The results shall be made available in redacted form to exclude--
            (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, 
        United States Code; and
            (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the 
        public access to which could be used to commit identity theft or 
        for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.

    (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by this Act 
may not be used for the purpose of defraying the costs of a banquet or 
conference that is not directly and programmatically related to the 
purpose for which the grant or contract was awarded, such as a banquet 
or conference held in connection with planning, training, assessment, 
review, or other routine purposes related to a project funded by the 
grant or contract.
    (d) <<NOTE: Certification.>> Any person awarded a grant or contract 
funded by amounts appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to 
the Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the Administrator, 
Director, or President, as appropriate, certifying that no funds derived 
from the grant or contract will be made available through a subcontract 
or in any other manner to another person who has a financial interest in 
the person awarded the grant or contract.

    (e) <<NOTE: Effective 
date. Consultation. Determination. Applicability.>> The provisions of 
the preceding subsections of this section shall take effect 30 days 
after the date on which the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics, determines that a uniform set of rules and requirements, 
substantially similar to the requirements in such subsections, 
consistently apply under the executive branch ethics program to all 
Federal departments, agencies, and entities.

    Sec. 516. (a) <<NOTE: Consultation. Assessment. China.>> None of the 
funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this Act may be 
used by the Departments

[[Page 127 STAT. 273]]

of Commerce and Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, or the National Science Foundation to acquire an 
information technology system unless the head of the entity involved, in 
consultation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other 
appropriate Federal entity, has made an assessment of any associated 
risk of cyber-espionage or sabotage associated with the acquisition of 
such system, including any risk associated with such system being 
produced, manufactured or assembled by one or more entities that are 
owned, directed or subsidized by the People's Republic of China.

    (b) <<NOTE: Determination. Reports.>> None of the funds appropriated 
or otherwise made available under this Act may be used to acquire an
