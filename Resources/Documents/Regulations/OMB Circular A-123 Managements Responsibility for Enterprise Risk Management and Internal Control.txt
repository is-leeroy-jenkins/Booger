SUBJECT: OMB Circular No. A-123, Management's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk 
Management and Internal Control 

The Administration has emphasized the importance ofhaving appropriate risk 
management processes and systems to identify challenges early, to bring them to the attention of 
Agency leadership, and to develop solutions. To that end, the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) is updating this Circular to ensure Federal managers are effectively managing risks an 
Agency faces toward achieving its strategic objectives and arising from its activities and 
operations. These expanded responsibilities reinforce the purposes of the Federal Managers' 
Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and the Government Performance and Results Act 
Modernization Act (GPRAMA), and support the Administration's commitment to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of Government. 

Since 1981, OMB Circular No. A-123 (A-123) and FMFIA have been at the center of 
Federal requirements to improve accountability in Federal programs and operations. Over the 
years, government operations have changed dramatically, becoming increasingly complex and 
driven by changes in technology. At the same time, resources are constrained and stakeholders 
expect greater program integrity, efficiency and transparency into government operations. 

The policy changes in this Circular modernize existing efforts by requiring agencies to 
implement an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) capability coordinated with the strategic 
planning and strategic review process established by GPRAMA, and the internal control 
processes required by FMFIA and Government Accountability Office (GAO)'s Green Book. 
This integrated governance structure will improve mission delivery, reduce costs, and focus 
corrective actions towards key risks. Implementation ofthis policy will engage all agency 
management, beyond the traditional ownership of OMB Circular No. A-123 by the Chief 
Financial Officer community. In particular, it will require leadership from the agency Chief 
Operating Officer and Performance Improvement Officer, and close collaboration across all 
agency mission and mission-support functions. 


Successful implementation of this Circular requires Agencies to establish and foster an 
open, transparent culture that encourages people to communicate information about potential 
risks and other concerns with their superiors without fear of retaliation or blame. Similarly, 
agency managers, Inspectors General (IG) and other auditors should establish a new set of 
parameters encouraging the free flow of information about agency risk points and corrective 
measure adoption. An open and transparent culture results in the earlier identification of risk, 
allowing the opportunity to develop a collaborative response, ultimately leading to a more 
resilient government. 

This revision ofthe Circular has gone through an extensive deliberative process with 
Agencies and their IG teams, and including consultation with the GAO and many outside groups 
who seek more efficient and effective delivery of governmental services. This revised Circular 
is effective for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 and supersedes all previous versions. Appendices A, B, C, 
and D of OMB Circular No. A-123 remain in effect. Updates to the GAO greenbook are 
effective for FY 2016. ERM implementation requirements are effective for FY 2017. OMB 
plans to work closely with the President's Management Council, Executive Councils, and the 
Council oflnspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) to provide further 
implementation guidance.

Internal Control 


ATTACHMENT 

OMB Circular No. A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management 
and Internal Control 

Purpose: This Circular defines management’s responsibilities for enterprise risk management 
(ERM) and internal control. The Circular provides updated implementation guidance to Federal 
managers to improve accountability and effectiveness of Federal programs as well as mission-
support operations through implementation of ERM practices and by establishing, maintaining, 
and assessing internal control effectiveness. The Circular emphasizes the need to integrate and 
coordinate risk management and strong and effective internal control into existing business 
activities and as an integral part of managing an Agency. 

Authority: This Circular is issued under the authority of the Federal Managers' Financial 
Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982 as codified in 31 U.S.C. 3512, and the Government Performance 
Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act, Public Law 111-352. 

Policy: Each Federal employee is responsible for safeguarding Federal assets and the efficient 
delivery of services to the public. Federal leaders and managers are responsible for establishing 
goals and objectives around operating environments, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and 
regulations, and managing both expected and unexpected or unanticipated events. They are 
responsible for implementing management practices that identify, assess, respond, and report on 
risks. Risk management practices must be forward-looking and designed to help leaders make 
better decisions, alleviate threats and to identify previously unknown opportunities to improve 
the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations. Management is also responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal controls to achieve specific internal control objectives 
related to operations, reporting, and compliance. Management must consistently apply these 
internal control standards to meet the internal control principles and related components outlined 
in this circular and to assess and report on internal control effectiveness at least annually. Risk 
management practices must be taken into account when designing internal controls and assessing 
their effectiveness. Annually, agencies must develop a risk profile coordinated with their annual 
strategic reviews. Further, management must provide assurances on internal control 
effectiveness in its Agency Financial Report (AFR) or the Performance and Accountability 
Report (PAR). Information regarding identified material weaknesses and corrective actions 
should be included in any of the three preceding reports. 

Requirements: Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123 requires agencies to 
integrate risk management and internal control functions. The Circular also establishes an assessment 
process based on the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) Standards for Internal Control 
in the Federal Government (known as the Green Book) that management must implement in 
order to properly assess and improve internal controls over operations, reporting, and 
compliance. The primary compliance indicators that management must consider when 
implementing OMB Circular No. A-123, include: 


• Management is responsible for the establishment of a governance structure to effectively 
implement, direct and oversee implementation of the Circular and all the provisions of a 
robust process of risk management and internal control. 
• Implementation of the Circular should leverage existing offices or functions within the 
organization that currently monitor risks and the effectiveness of the organization’s 
internal control. 
• Agencies should develop a maturity model approach1 to the adoption of an ERM 
framework. For FY 2016, Agencies are encouraged to develop an approach to implement 
ERM. For FY 2017 and thereafter Agencies must continuously build risk identification 
capabilities into the framework to identify new or emerging risks, and/or changes in 
existing risks (See Section II.C. for additional details). 
• Management must evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls annually using GAO’s 
Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. (The Green Book) 


1 See https://www.rims.org/resources/ERM/Pages/RiskMaturityModel.aspx for an example maturity model. 

Throughout the Circular, the terms “Must” and “Will” denote a requirement that management 
will comply with in all cases. “Should,” indicates a presumptively mandatory requirement 
except in circumstances where the requirement is not relevant for the Agency. “May” or 
“Could,” indicate best practices that may be adopted at the discretion of management. 

Effective Date: This Circular is effective upon publication. Appendices A, B, C, and D of OMB 
Circular No. A-123 remain in effect. 

Applicability: This Circular is applicable to each executive agency. All other non-executive 
agencies of the Federal government are encouraged to adopt the Circular. 

Inquiries: Further information concerning this Circular can be obtained from the Office of 
Federal Financial Management (202) 395-3993 or the Office of Performance and Personnel 
Management, (202) 395-5670 Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Federal leaders and managers are responsible for establishing and achieving goals and 
objectives, seizing opportunities to improve effectiveness and efficiency of operations, providing 
reliable reporting, and maintaining compliance with relevant laws and regulations. They are also 
responsible for implementing management practices that effectively identify, assess, respond, 
and report on risks. Risks arise from a variety of external and internal environments. Examples 
include economic, operational, and organizational change factors, all of which would negatively 
impact an Agency’s ability to meet goals and objectives if not resolved. 

Federal leaders and managers achieve these aims through a governance structure defined through 
a variety of sources, including laws enacted by the Congress and numerous Executive directives 
and Agency policies. Most relevant to this discussion, the Federal Government’s core 
governance processes are defined by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) budget 
guidance, such as OMB Circular No. A-11, which defines the processes by which the Executive 
Branch develops and executes Strategic Plans, compiles the President’s Budget request, 
assembles Congressional Budget Justifications, conducts performance reviews, and issues 
Annual Performance Plans and Annual Performance Reports. OMB Circular No. A-123 
provides guidance to Federal Managers on improving the accountability and effectiveness of 
Federal programs and operations by identifying and managing risks, establishing requirements to 
assess, correct, and report on the effectiveness of internal controls. 

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Internal Control are components of a governance 
framework. ERM as a discipline deals with identifying, assessing, and managing risks. Through 
adequate risk management, agencies can concentrate efforts towards key points of failure and 
reduce or eliminate the potential for disruptive events. Internal control is a processes effected by 
an entity’s oversight body, management, and other personnel that provides reasonable assurance 
that the objectives of an entity will be achieved. 

Leading international standards setters in the fields of risk management and internal control 
including both the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) incorporate internal control 
as part of the larger risk management process. ERM is viewed as a part of the overall 
governance process, and internal controls as an integral part of risk management and ERM. This 
relationship is depicted in the following COSO-based diagram in Figure 1. 


Figure 1 The Relationship Between Internal Controls and Enterprise Risk Management 











The remaining sections of this document is organized as follows: 

Section II of OMB Circular No. A-123 defines management’s responsibilities for ERM, and 
includes requirements for identifying and managing risks. Most importantly, it encourages 
agencies to establish a Risk Management Council (RMC), develop “Risk Profiles” which 
identify risks arising from mission and mission-support operations, and consider those risks as 
part of the annual strategic review process. It complements Section 270 of OMB Circular No. A-
11, which discusses agency responsibilities for identifying and managing strategic and 
programmatic risk as part of agency strategic planning, performance management, and 
performance reporting practices. Together, these two Circulars constitute the ERM policy 
framework for the Federal Government, with specific ERM activities integrated and 
operationalized by Federal agencies. 

Section III of OMB Circular No. A-123 includes guidance for establishing internal controls for 
those risks identified by management as requiring a formal system of internal control to provide 
reasonable assurance that objectives are achieved. For this subset of risks identified by 
management, this Circular prescribes requirements conforming with the Standards of Internal 
Control in the Federal Government established by the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO), more commonly known as the Green Book. This includes establishing and maintaining 
internal control to achieve specific objectives related to operations, reporting, and compliance; 
assessing and reporting effectiveness; and providing assurances on its Agency Financial Report 
(AFR), or the Performance and Accountability Report (PAR). Information regarding identified 
material weaknesses and corrective actions should be included in any of the three preceding 
reports. 

Section IV of OMB Circular No. A-123 discusses management’s responsibility to continuously 
monitor, assess, and improve the effectiveness of internal controls. Also discussed are 
documentation requirements, possible sources of information for use in the assessment on 
internal controls, identification of deficiencies and the internal control evaluation approach. 


Section V of OMB Circular No. A-123 provides guidance on correcting internal control 
deficiencies, corrective action plan requirements and audit follow up and resolution initiatives. 
An Agency’s corrective action process provides the ability for management to develop a plan for 
addressing the risk associated with a control deficiency. An Agency’s ability to correct control 
deficiencies is an indicator of the strength of its internal control environment. 

Section VI of OMB Circular No. A-123 provides guidance on annual assurance statements and 
reporting requirements in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3512, (that allows for a single assurance 
statement), Government Corporations and classified matters. This section also provides 
definitions for a control deficiency, significant deficiency, and a material weakness. 

Section VII of OMB Circular No. A-123 discusses additional considerations such as managing 
privacy risks, conducting acquisition assessments, managing risk to grants and managing 
Antideficiency Act risks. 

II.ESTABLISHING ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT INMANAGEMENT PRACTICES

There are several Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) models available to help organizations 
integrate risk management and internal control activities into a common framework. Section 
270.24 of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-11 defines “risk” as the 
effect of uncertainty on objectives. Risk management is a series of coordinated activities to 
direct and control challenges or threats to achieving an organization’s goals and objectives. 
ERM is an effective Agency-wide approach to addressing the full spectrum of the organization’s 
external and internal risks by understanding the combined impact of risks as an interrelated 
portfolio, rather than addressing risks only within silos. ERM provides an enterprise-wide, 
strategically-aligned portfolio view of organizational challenges that provides better insight 
about how to most effectively prioritize resource allocations to ensure successful mission 
delivery. While agencies cannot respond to all risks related to achieving strategic objectives and 
performance goals, they must identify, measure, and assess risks related to mission delivery. 
Effective risk management: 

•creates and protects value;
•is an integral part of all organizational processes;
•is part of decision-making;
•explicitly addresses uncertainty;
•is systematic, structured, and timely;
•is based on the best available information;
•is tailored and responsive to the evolving risk profile of the Agency;
•takes human and cultural factors into account;
•is transparent and inclusive;
•is dynamic, iterative, and responsive to change; and
•facilitates continual improvement of the organization.



ERM reflects forward-looking management decisions and balancing risks and returns so an 
Agency enhances its value to the taxpayer and increases its ability to achieve its strategic 
objectives. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 
ERM framework also includes the concepts of risk appetite, risk tolerance, and portfolio view: 

•Risk appetite-


is the broad-based amount of risk an organization is willing to 
accept in pursuit of its mission/vision. It is established by the 
organization’s most senior level leadership and serves as the 
guidepost to set strategy and select objectives. 

•Risk tolerance-


is the acceptable level of variance in performance relative to the 
achievement of objectives. It is generally established at the 
program, objective or component level. In setting risk tolerance 
levels, management considers the relative importance of the 
related objectives and aligns risk tolerance with risk appetite. 

•A portfolio view of risk- 


provides insight into all areas of organizational exposure to risk(such as reputational, programmatic performance, financial, 
information technology, acquisitions, human capital, etc.), thus 
increasing an Agency’s chances of experiencing fewer 
unanticipated outcomes and executing a better assessment of risk 
associated with changes in the environment. 



ERM is beneficial since it addresses a fundamental organizational issue: the need for information 
about major risks to flow both up and down the organization and across its organizational 
structures to improve the quality of decision-making. ERM seeks to open channels of 
communication so that managers have access to the information they need to make sound 
decisions. ERM seeks to encompass the range of major risks that threatens agencies’ ability to 
implement their missions, programs, and operations. Most agencies should build their 
capabilities, first to conduct more effective risk management, then to implement ERM, rating 
those risks in terms of impact, and finally building internal controls to monitor and assess the 
risk developments at various time points. To complete this circle of risk management the 
Agencies must incorporate risk awareness into the agencies’ culture and ways of doing business. 
While there are many approaches that can be taken to implement ERM, most include the 
following elements:3

Figure 2 Illustrative Example of an Enterprise Risk Management Model 



1.Establish the Context-


understanding and articulating the internal and external 
environments of the organization. 

2.Initial Risk Identification- 


using a structured and systematic approach to recognizingwhere the potential for undesired outcomes or 
opportunities can arise. 

3.Analyze and Evaluate Risks- 


considering the causes, sources, probability of the riskoccurring, the potential positive or negative outcomes, and 
then prioritizing the results of the analysis. 

4.Develop Alternatives-


systematically identifying and assessing a range of risk 
response options guided by risk appetite. 

5.Respond to Risks-


making decisions about the best options(s) among a 
number of alternatives, and then preparing and executing 
the selected response strategy. 

6.Monitor and Review-


evaluating and monitoring performance to determine 
whether the implemented risk management options 
achieved the stated goals and objectives. 

7.Continuous RiskIdentification-


must be an iterative process, occurring throughout the year 
to include surveillance of leading indicators of future risk 
from internal and external environments. 






The “extended enterprise” consists of interdependent relationships, parent-child relationships, 
and relationships external to an Agency. Thus, no Agency is self-contained, and risk drivers can 
arise out of organizations that extend beyond the enterprise. These relationships give rise to a 
need for assurance that risk is being managed in that relationship both appropriately and as 
planned. 

The risk environment is beyond the boundary of the “extended enterprise.” The environment 
generates risks that cannot be controlled, or constrain the way the organization is permitted to 
take on or address risk. 

A. Governance 

The responsibilities of managing risks are shared throughout the Agency from the highest levels 
of executive leadership to the service delivery staff executing Federal programs. Industry best 
practices suggest risk management functions generally have the following characteristics: 

•helping senior management develop and implement core policies and procedures withrespect to enterprise risk management, including developing a process to define riskappetite, and establish risk thresholds accordingly;
•ensuring the current risk levels and processes are consistent with the established risktolerance thresholds and policies;
•supporting implementation of effective controls;
•developing strong reporting systems and analysis that incorporate quantitative andqualitative information to provide effective portfolio views of risk;
•identifying emerging risks, concentrations of risk, and other situations that could beproperly assessed; and
•elevating critical issues to appropriate levels within an Agency in a timely fashion.


To provide governance for the risk management function, agencies may use a Risk Management 
Council (RMC) to oversee the establishment of the Agency’s risk profile, regular assessment of 
risk, and development of appropriate risk response. RMC structures will vary by Agency, and in 
some cases may be integrated with existing management structures. An effective RMC will 
include senior officials for program operations and mission-support functions to help ensure 
those risks are identified which have the most significant impact on the mission outcomes of the 
Agency. Should agencies choose to use an RMC, the RMC should be chaired by the Agency 
Chief Operating Officer (COO) or a senior official with responsibility for the enterprise. In 
cabinet-level Agencies this is the Deputy Secretary. 

To support this work, some agency governance structures are beginning to include a Chief Risk 
Officer (CRO), or equivalent function who champion agency-wide efforts to manage risk within 
the Agency and advise senior leaders on the strategically-aligned portfolio view of risks at the 
Agency. A CRO may serve as a strategic advisor to the COO and other staff on the integration 
of enterprise risk management practices into the day-to-day business operations and decision-
making. CROs generally work with business unit managers within their organizations to identify 


issues in a timely manner to allow for proactive management of the program and to facilitate 
informed, data-driven decision-making. 

Regardless of the governance structure developed, agency governance should include a process 
for considering risk appetite and tolerance levels. The concept of “risk appetite” is key to 
achieving effective ERM, and is essential to consider in determining risk responses. Although a 
formally documented risk appetite statement is not required, agencies must have a solid 
understanding of their risk appetite and tolerance levels in order to create a comprehensive 
enterprise-level risk profile. Risk appetite can be considered qualitatively and/or quantitatively 
and should be factored into the process of balancing risks with opportunities. Additionally, risk 
appetite and tolerance levels should be evaluated on a regular basis and adjusted accordingly to 
meet the needs of the organization. 

See OMB Circular No. A-11 Section 270.26, for a discussion of the broader risk management 
roles the RMC should fulfill with respect to strategic reviews. 

B. Risk Profiles4 

4 Based on The Orange Book, Management of Risk – Principles and Concepts, October 2004, HM Treasury. 

Agencies must maintain a risk profile. The primary purpose of a risk profile is to provide a 
thoughtful analysis of the risks an Agency faces toward achieving its strategic objectives arising 
from its activities and operations, and to identify appropriate options for addressing significant 
risks. The risk profile assists in facilitating a determination around the aggregate level and types 
of risk that the agency and its management are willing to assume to achieve its strategic 
objectives. The risk profile differs from a risk register in that it is a prioritized inventory of the 
most significant risks identified and assessed through the risk assessment process versus a 
complete inventory of risks. The risk profile must consider risks from a portfolio perspective 
and be approved by an Agency’s RMC or equivalent. Additionally, the profile must identify 
sources of uncertainty, both positive (opportunities) and negative (threats). 

The development of an Agency risk profile: 

• encourages open and candid conversations about risks facing an organization at all levels; 
• facilitates the ranking of risk priorities (in particular to identify and escalate the most 
significant risks of which senior management should be aware); 
• captures the reasons for decisions made about risk tolerances; 
• facilitates recording of the way in which it is decided to address risk; 
• allows leadership at all levels to understand the overall risk profile and how their areas of 
particular responsibility fit into it; and 
• facilitates the review and regular monitoring of risks. 



Agencies have discretion in terms of the appropriate content and format for their risk 
profiles; however, in general risk profiles should include the following seven components: 

1. Identification of Objectives 
2. Identification of Risk 
3. Inherent Risk Assessment 
4. Current Risk Response 
5. Residual Risk Assessment 
6. Proposed Risk Response 
7. Proposed Action Category 


Each of these seven components is illustrated in the table below, and further descriptions of each 
component, including guidance for each, follows the table. In completing their risk profiles, 
Agencies may consider reviewing and incorporating results from existing documentation such as 
GAO and OIG Audit Findings, OIG’s Annual Report on Top Performance and Management 
Challenges, FFMIA/FMFIA documentation, Employee Viewpoint Survey Results, external 
media, etc. 

Agencies should adhere to the general guidance provided for these components when making 
modifications to the content and format of their risk profiles. See Sections C1 though C7 
following the table below.

B1. Identification of Objectives 

Risk must be analyzed in relation to achievement of the strategic objectives established in the 
Agency strategic plan (See OMB Circular No. A-11, Section 230), as well as risk in relation to 
appropriate operational objectives. Specific objectives must be identified and documented to 
facilitate identification of risks to strategic, operations, reporting, and compliance. This process 
assists in the identification of formal internal controls and compliance with the FMFIA, as 
discussed in Section III. In summary, the risk profile must include the following objectives: 

• Strategic Objectives: 


relating to the strategic goals and objectives aligned with and 
supporting the Agency’s Mission (See OMB Circular No. A-
11, Section 230). 

• Operations Objectives: 


relating to the effective and efficient use of the Agency’s 
resources related to administrative and major program 
operations, including financial and fraud objectives (Refer to 
Section III, Establishing And Operating An Effective System 
Of Internal Control). 

• Reporting Objectives: 


relating to the reliability of the Agency’s reporting. 

• Compliance Objectives: 


relating to the Agency’s compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. 



In some cases there will be overlap across these categories, and agencies have discretion in terms 
of how to address this overlap. In addition, Agencies may find it useful to include additional 
subcategories of one or more objectives categories to facilitate communication on a narrower 
topic. One of the most common subcategories includes reputational risk. Reputational risk 
damages the reputation of an Agency or component of an Agency to the point of having a 
detrimental effect capable of affecting the Agency’s ability to carry out mission objectives. 
Examples of reputational risk include the loss of confidence and trust, which stakeholders have 
in an organization to deliver operational services, or the loss of an Agency’s financial statement 
opinion. Agencies may use their discretion in determining how to incorporate additional 
subcategories into their risk profile. 

B2. Identification of Risk 

Identifying risks is a critical step in building the Agency’s risk profile. The identification of risk 
can be separated into two distinct phases: 

1. Initial risk identification (for an Agency which has not previously identified its risks in a 
structured way, or for a new component of an Agency, or perhaps for a new project or 
activity within an Agency); and 


2. Continuous risk identification (which is necessary to identify new or emerging risks, 
and/or changes in existing risks). 

The identification of risk is a continuous and ongoing process. Once initial risks are identified, it 
is important to re-examine risks on a regular basis to identify new risks or changes to existing risks. 

Assessing risk is the next critical step in building the Agency’s risk profile, which includes three 
important principles: 

1. Ensure that there is a clearly structured process in which both likelihood and impact are 
considered for each risk; 

2. record the assessment of risk in a way which facilitates monitoring and the identification 
of risk priorities; and 

3. be clear about the difference between inherent and residual risk. 

Some risk is unavoidable and beyond an organization’s ability to reduce to a tolerable level. 
Nevertheless, the organization should make contingency plans and manage risks against those 
plans. For example, many organizations have to accept that risk arises due to natural disaster 
situations that they cannot control. 

B3. Inherent Risk Assessment 

Inherent risk is the exposure arising from a specific risk before any action has been taken to 
manage it beyond normal operations. The impact on the Agency’s ability to achieve its 
objectives if the risk occurred can be ranked by appropriate categories, as can the likelihood that 
each significant risk might occur. While agencies can design their own appropriate categories, 
for the purposes of this guidance the following illustrative definitions can be used: 

Impact 

• High: the impact could preclude or highly impair the entity’s ability to achieve one or 
more of its objectives or performance goals; 
• Medium: the impact could significantly affect the entity’s ability to achieve one or more 
of its objectives or performance goals; and 
• Low: the impact will not significantly affect the entity’s ability to achieve one or more of 
its objectives or performance goals. 


Likelihood 

• High: the risk is very likely or reasonably expected to occur; 
• Medium: the risk is more likely to occur than unlikely; and 
• Low: the risk is unlikely to occur. 


 


 

B4. Current Risk Response 

The action taken to manage the risk. It could involve one or more of the following: 

• Acceptance: 


No action is taken to respond to the risk based on the insignificance of 
the risk; or the risk is knowingly assumed to seize an opportunity. 

• Avoidance: 


Action is taken to stop the operational process, or the part of the 
operational process, causing the risk. 

• Reduction: 


Action is taken to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk. 

• Sharing: 


Action is taken to transfer or share risks across the entity or with 
external parties, such as insuring against losses.5 



5 Based on definitions outlined by GAO in the Green Book. 

Risk responses take many forms, including: avoidance of risk by development of a legislative 
proposal; reduction of risk by proposing to increase funding for the activity; acceptance of the 
risk of adopting a new technology in order to provide better services to customers. Formulation 
of risk responses should consider the organization’s risk appetite and tolerance levels. The 
development of risk responses should be used to inform decision-making through existing 
management processes including the strategic reviews, development of the legislative and policy 
agenda, operational planning, and budget formulation. 

As part of developing the risk profile, management must determine those risks for which the 
appropriate response includes implementation of formal internal control activities as described in 
Section III of this guidance and which conform to the standards published by GAO in the Green 
Book. These include those risks that meet each of the following criteria: 

• The Agency is working to reduce exposure to the risk. 
• The objective is related to reporting, compliance, or operations, including both 
administrative operations and the major operational components of programs. 
• The risk is identified in the Agency risk profile as at least medium impact and medium 
likelihood (i.e., the risk is greater than low). 
• Public reporting on the risk will not negatively impact services provided to the public, 
national security, or agency operations. 
• Control objectives can be clearly specified. 



 

B5. Residual Risk Assessment 

Residual risk is the exposure remaining from an inherent risk after action has been taken to 
manage it, using the same assessment standards as the inherent assessment. 

B6. Proposed Action 

Additional action proposed to further reduce the exposure remaining after the risk mitigation 
actions have been taken, for consideration by senior management, Proposed risk responses 
should use the same standards applied to the current risk response, as described above, including 
the identification of risks for which implementation of formal internal control activities is 
appropriate. 

B7. Proposed Risk Response Category 

Identification of the existing management process that will be used to implement and monitor 
proposed actions. Those proposed actions that will be discussed with OMB as part of the annual 
Strategic Review must be identified (See OMB Circular No. A-11, Section 270), as well as 
proposed actions to be considered during formulation of the President’s Budget. In particular, 
the RMC or other equivalent governance body, must categorize actions for the adoption of 
formal internal control activities (as described in Section III of this guidance and which conform 
to the standards published by GAO in the Green Book), when the criteria identified above under 
Current Risk Responses have been met. 

Risk Profile Disclosure. As explained above, the development of agency risk profiles 
requires candor, subjective evaluations, and frank discussions in identifying the likelihood and 
severity of internal vulnerabilities. In addition, risk profiles serve to inform the development of 
agency strategic plans as well as the President’s Budget. As such, agency risk profiles will often 
contain pre-decisional, deliberative, confidential, or sensitive information. Agencies are 
encouraged to consult with their Office of General Counsel if there are questions regarding the 
disclosure of such information. 

C. Implementation 

The management of risk must be regularly reviewed to monitor whether or not the risk profile 
has changed and to gain assurance that risk management is effective or if further action is 
necessary. In addition, processes must be put in place to review whether risks still exist, whether 
new risks have arisen, whether the likelihood and impact of risks have changed, to report 
significant changes that adjust risk priorities, and deliver assurance on the effectiveness of 
control. In addition, the overall risk management process must be subjected to regular review to 


deliver assurance that it remains appropriate and effective.At a minimum, management’sriskmanagement review processes must6:

•ensure that all aspects ofthe risk management process are reviewedat least once a year;
•ensure that risks themselves are subjected to review with appropriatefrequency; and
•make provisionsfor alerting the appropriate levelof management to new or emergingrisks,as well as changesin already identifiedrisks,so that the change can be 
appropriately addressed.
Federal agencies have diverse missions, and are at different levels of maturity in terms of theircapacity to fully implement ERM.TheAgency’s approach for developing risk profiles and 
implementing ERMshouldbe refinedand improved each year.This guidancerecognizesthat

weaknesses and corrective actions. Until an agency has 
fully implemented an ERM approach to risk 
management, it may continue to provide the existing risk 
assurance statements to their OIG and/or private 
accounting firms, as appropriate.

No less than annually, all agencies must prepare a 
complete risk profile and include required risk 
components and elements required by this guidance. 

CFO Act agencies, at a minimum, must complete their 
risk profiles in coordination with the agency Strategic 
Review. For these Agencies, key findings should be 
made available for discussion with OMB by June 3rd* as 
part of the agency Strategic Review meetings and/or 
FedStat. The final determination on information to be 
shared with OMB will be provided in advance of these 
discussions. The Risk Profile will help to inform 
changes to strategy, policy, operations, and the 
President’s Budget. 



* OMB Circular No. A-11, Part 6, is the authoritative policy guidance on deadlines for the Summary of Findings 
from the agency Strategic Reviews, including the timing of submissions to OMB. Agencies should consult OMB 
Circular No. A-11 as each prepares materials. 

After initial implementation, the agency’s risk profile must be discussed each year with OMB as 
a component of the summary of findings from the Agency strategic review and FedSTAT (See 
OMB Circular No. A-11, Section 270). For those objectives for which formal internal control 
activities have been identified as part of the Risk Profile, assurances on internal control processes 
must be presented in the Agency Financial Report (AFR) or Performance and Accountability 
Report (PAR), along with a report on identified material weaknesses and corrective actions. 

D. Role of Auditors in Enterprise Risk Management 

Management is responsible for Enterprise Risk Management systems. Internal or external 
auditors conduct independent and objective audits, evaluations, and investigations of an 
Agency’s programs and operations, which includes aspects of the internal control and risk 
management systems. Management uses the results of such evaluations, including 
accompanying findings and recommendations, to monitor the design or operating effectiveness 
of these systems at a specific time or of a specific function or process. Auditors are also 
responsible for keeping management informed about risks that it detects, including fraud risks, 
and thereby provides information to management for use in the identification and assessment of 
risks. Management and external auditors might have different interpretations of risks based on 
their respective roles and responsibilities. The agency risk function should seek to coordinate 
their roles so that the independence and scope of the external auditor’s role is preserved while 
ensuring the continuing flow of risk information to the risk management function. 

 


III. ESTABLISHING AND OPERATING AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF 
INTERNAL CONTROL 

The FMFIA requires the GAO to prescribe standards of internal control in the Federal 
Government, more commonly known as the Green Book. These standards provide the internal 
control framework and criteria Federal managers must use in designing, implementing, and 
operating an effective system of internal control. The Green Book defines internal control as a 
process effected by an entity’s oversight body, management, and other personnel that provides 
reasonable assurance that the objectives of an entity are achieved. These objectives and related 
risks can be broadly classified into one or more of the following categories: 

• Operations: Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 
• Reporting: Reliability of reporting for internal and external use; and 
• Compliance: Compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 


A subset of the categories of objectives are the safeguarding of all assets. Management designs 
an internal control system to provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or prompt 
detection and correction of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of an entity’s assets. 

FMFIA also requires OMB, in consultation with GAO, to establish guidelines for agencies to 
evaluate their systems of internal control to determine FMFIA compliance. Instead of 
considering internal control as an isolated management tool, agencies must integrate their efforts 
to meet the requirements of the FMFIA with the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
requirements discussed in Section II. Thus, internal control is an integral part of the entire cycle 
of strategic planning, goal and objective setting, budgeting, program management, accounting, 
and auditing. It must support the effectiveness and the integrity of every step of the process and 
provide continual feedback to management. 

Federal managers must carefully consider the appropriate balance between risk, controls, costs, 
and benefits in their mission-support operations. Too many controls can result in inefficiencies, 
while too few controls might increase risk to an unacceptable level. 

Management’s responsibility is to develop and maintain effective internal control that is 
consistent with its established risk appetite and risk tolerance levels. In addition, management is 
responsible for establishing and integrating internal control into its operations in a risk-based and 
cost beneficial manner, in order to provide reasonable assurance that the entity’s internal control 
over operations, reporting, and compliance is operating effectively. 

Achieving the objectives of external reporting and compliance, which are based largely on laws, 
rules, regulations, and standards established by Congress, GAO, and OMB, depends on how 
activities within the Agency’s control are performed. Generally, management and oversight 
bodies have greater discretion in setting internal reporting objectives that are not driven by 
external parties. However, Agency’s may choose to align its internal and external reporting 
objectives to allow internal reporting to better support the Agency’s external reporting. 


Achievement of some operations objectives – such as certain aspects of program outcomes or 
maintaining safe operations – are not always within the Agency’s control. An effective internal 
control system increases the likelihood that an entity achieves its objectives. However, no matter 
how well designed, implemented, or operated, an internal control system cannot provide absolute 
assurance that all of an organization’s objectives are met. Factors outside the control or 
influence of management can affect the entity’s ability to achieve all of its objectives. For 
example, a natural disaster can affect an organization’s ability to achieve its objectives. 
Therefore, once in place, effective internal control provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
that an organization achieves its objectives. 

The Green Book is organized by five components of internal control as shown in the exhibit 
below. In addition, the five components of internal control contain 17 required principles and 
each principle has important attributes which explain the principles in greater detail.

Federal managers must carefully consider the appropriate balance between controls and risk in 
their programs and operations. To emphasize, too many controls can result in inefficient and 
ineffective government; agency managers must ensure an appropriate balance between the 
strength of controls and the relative risk associated with particular programs and operations. 
The benefits of controls should outweigh the cost. Agencies should consider both qualitative 
and quantitative factors when analyzing costs against benefits. 

 

A. Governance. 

Agencies must have a Senior Management Council (SMC) to assess and monitor deficiencies in 
internal control. This SMC may be a subset of the Risk Management Council, however, 
agencies have discretion in determining the appropriate structure. A Senior Management 
Council may include the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Human Capital Officer, Chief 
Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Acquisition Officer, Senior 


Agency Official for Privacy, Designated Agency Ethics Official, and Performance Improvement 
Officer and the managers of other program offices, must be involved in identifying and ensuring 
correction of systemic material weaknesses relating to their respective programs. Such councils 
generally recommend to the Agency head which significant deficiencies are deemed to be 
material weaknesses to the Agency as a whole, and must therefore be included in the annual 
FMFIA assurance statement and reported in the Agency’s Annual Financial Report (AFR) or 
Performance Accountability Report (PAR). This council should be responsible for overseeing 
the timely implementation of corrective actions related to material weaknesses. Such a council is 
also useful in determining when sufficient action has been taken to declare that a significant 
deficiency or material weakness has been corrected (though the final official determination likely 
resides with the Agency Head and the OIG). The SMC should also include Senior Assessment 
Teams to lead assessments related to the objective of internal control over reporting (See 
Appendix A to OMB Circular No. A-123, Internal Control Over Reporting). 

B. Establish Entity Level Control 

Establishing Entity Level Control (ELC) is another primary step in operating an effective system 
of internal control. The Green Book defines ELCs as controls that have a pervasive effect on an 
entity’s internal control system and pertain to multiple components. ELCs are mostly within the 
Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Information and Communication, and Monitoring 
components of the Green Book. Control Activities are also considered a component of ELC and 
provide a link to an Agency’s processes as described in Section C below. Entity-level controls 
also include controls related to the entity’s use of service organizations or management override 
of internal control and fraud. 

B1. Service Organizations 

The Green Book provides internal control considerations for service organizations 
(shared service providers (SSP) are one example). Service organization internal control 
considerations include management’s responsibility for the performance of third party 
provided processes, establishing “user controls” at the Agency receiving services, and 
service organization oversight. 

• Management’s Responsibility for the Processes Performed by Third Party 
Service Organizations. Third party service providers perform activities for many 
agencies. Examples include, but are not limited to: accounting and payroll 
processing, employee benefit plan servicing, information technology services, 
protections for sensitive Agency data, acquisition or procurement services, security 
services, asset management, health care claims processing, and loan servicing. 
Agencies are ultimately responsible for the services and processes provided by third 
party service organizations as they relate to the Agency’s ability to maintain internal 
control over operations, reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations. 
• Management’s Responsibility for Establishing User Controls. If the processes 
provided by the third party service organization is significant to an Agency’s internal 
control objectives, then the Agency is responsible for establishing user Agency 
controls that complement the service organization’s controls. Management still 



retains overall responsibility and accountability for all controls related to the 
processes provided by the third party, and must monitor the process as a whole to 
make sure it is effective. Examples of user Agency controls include: 
o Input/ Output Controls: In most third party provider situations, the Agency 
must have access to the information processed by a service organization. In some 
cases, this information enables the Agency to compare the service organization’s 
results with the results of an independent source. For example, an Agency using a 
payroll service organization compares the data submitted to the service 
organization with reports or information received from the service organization 
after the data has been processed. 
o Performance Monitoring: Agencies must have a process for monitoring the 
service organization’s performance in relation to various metrics, as typically 
defined in a service-level agreement. Most of these metrics must be tailored to 
specific operations. For example, agencies regularly review the security, 
availability, and processing integrity of service-level agreements. 
o Process Controls: In some third party provider situations, the Agency’s user 
controls are closely tied to the service organization’s processes and provide direct 
assurance over their operation. For example, an Agency that has its IT 
development provided by a third party service organization chooses to document, 
track, approve, and test all application changes internally, thus retaining 
significant control over the IT development process. 
• Management’s Responsibility for Oversight of Service Organizations. The extent 
of an Agency’s oversight of a service organization depends on the nature of the 
contract or agreement terms and conditions. The use of a third party provider needs 
to be considered for management’s oversight and assessment of internal control based 
on risk and when the activity is significant to the Agency’s achievement of internal 
control objectives of operations, reporting, or compliance. Examples of services 
provided by the service organization that warrant oversight include: maintenance of a 
user Agency’s financial reporting and accounting records; safeguarding of a user 
Agency’s assets; services that involve personally identifiable information (PII); 
investments for employee benefit plans; mortgage services from servicers that service 
mortgages for others; or application services for technology environments that 
support operations. 
• Service Organization Responsibility. Service Organizations are responsible for 
providing assurances to their customers and assisting customers in understanding the 
relationship between the service provider’s controls and the customer’s user controls. 
Together, service organizations and customers manage the risks of third party 
provider activities typically through a Service Organization Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 



Report (more technically referred to as a Statement on Standards for Attestation 
Engagement No. 16 report7). SOC 1 report considerations include: 
o Ensuring the SOC report adequately addresses the relevant internal control 
objectives. 
o Determining the extent and adequacy of internal control testing performed on the 
operating effectiveness of internal controls throughout a specified period. 
o Ensuring the SOC Report(s) cover a substantial portion of the fiscal year and 
bridge or roll forward letters are considered. 
o Reviewing the SOC report opinion (e.g., Unmodified) and determining what 
impact any internal control deficiencies included in the SOC report have on the 
related control objectives. 
o Evaluating complementary user entity controls included in the SOC 1 report to 
determine that the appropriate controls are in place to support the activities of the 
service provider. 
o Considering any complementary subservice organization controls included in the 
SOC 1 report and the effectiveness of controls at subservice organizations. 


7 Effective for service auditors’ reports dated on or after May 1, 2017, service organization reports will be prepared 
under a new clarified attestation standard –AU-320.

B2. Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs 

The Green Book defines fraud as obtaining something of value through willful 
misrepresentation. Whether an act is fraud is a determination to be made through the 
judicial or other adjudicative system and is beyond management’s professional 
responsibility for assessing risk. Waste is the act of using or expending resources 
carelessly, extravagantly, or to no purpose. Abuse involves behavior that is deficient or 
improper when compared with behavior that a prudent person considers reasonable and 
necessary in operational practice given the facts and circumstances. This includes the 
misuse of authority or position for personal gain or for the benefit of another. Waste and 
abuse do not necessarily involve fraud or illegal acts. Green Book 
requires management to consider the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and 
responding to risks. 
8 Principle 8 of the 

OMB Circular No. A-123 Fraud Risk Profile Requirements. Fraud jeopardizes Agency 
missions by diverting scarce resources from their intended purpose. A single case of fraud can 
undermine programmatic mission, disrupt services, and force management to expend valuable 
time, resources, and staff-hours to resolve and recover property lost due to fraud. Reputational 
risks of fraud can damage the perception of an Agency, impact employee morale, and create 
distrust by the public, further hindering their efforts to provide services to the public. To the 
extent that Federal managers can effectively mitigate and prevent fraud from occurring, it can 


save time and resources spent in investigating and prosecuting fraud, and recovering lost money 
and property, thus avoiding the “pay and chase model.” 

Management has overall responsibility for establishing internal controls to manage the risk of 
fraud. This includes reporting to the Agency’s governance structure what actions have been 
taken to manage fraud risks and on the status of the Agency’s Risk Profile. The Agency’s Risk 
Profile as required by Section II of OMB Circular No. A-123 must include an evaluation of fraud 
risks and use a risk-based approach to design and implement financial and administrative control 
activities to mitigate identified material fraud risks. Refer to Appendix A of OMB Circular No. 
A-123, Internal Control over Reporting, for requirements related to reporting internal control 
objectives. The financial and administrative controls established through the Agency’s risk 
profile must also include: 

• controls to address identified fraud risks related to payroll, beneficiary payments, grants, 
large contracts, information technology and security, asset safeguards, and purchase, 
travel and fleet cards; 
• collecting and analyzing data from reporting mechanisms on detected fraud to monitor 
fraud trends and using that data and information to continuously improve fraud 
prevention controls; and 
• using the results of monitoring, evaluation, and investigations to improve fraud 
prevention, detection, and response. 


GAO Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs. To help managers to 
combat fraud and preserve integrity in government agencies and programs, GAO identified 
leading practices for managing fraud risks and organized them into a conceptual framework 
called the Fraud Risk Management Framework (the Framework, GAO-15-593SP). Managers 
should adhere to these leading practices as part of their efforts to effectively design, implement, 
and operate an internal control system that addresses fraud risks. Managers are responsible for 
determining the extent to which the leading practices in the Framework are relevant to their 
program and for tailoring the practices, as appropriate, to align with the program’s operations. 

The Framework encompasses control activities to prevent, detect, and respond to fraud, with an 
emphasis on prevention, as well as structures and environmental factors that influence or help 
managers achieve their objective to mitigate fraud risks. In addition, the Framework highlights 
the importance of monitoring and incorporating feedback, which are ongoing practices that apply 
to the following four components described below. 

• Commit to combating fraud by creating an organizational culture and structure conducive 
to fraud risk management. 
• Plan regular fraud risk assessments and assess risks to determine a fraud risk profile. 
• Evaluate outcomes using a risk-based approach and adapt activities to improve fraud risk 
management. 
• Design and implement a strategy with specific control activities to mitigate assessed 
fraud risks and collaborate to help ensure effective implementation. 



Establishing Risk Tolerances in Disaster Situations. Managers must balance their priorities to 
fulfill the program’s mission, such as effectively disbursing funds or providing services to 
beneficiaries, and taking actions to safeguard taxpayer dollars from improper use. For example, 
in disaster situations, fraud risks are higher than under normal circumstances because the need to 
provide services quickly can hinder the effectiveness of existing controls and creates additional 
opportunities for individuals to engage in fraud. As a result, managers face additional challenges 
balancing their mission to provide assistance quickly with implementing controls to address the 
increased risk of fraud. 

GAO’s Fraud Framework calls for managers to determine risk tolerances when assessing fraud 
risks and to use that determination as part of the basis for developing responses to identified 
fraud risks, including specific controls to address the risks. Risk tolerance reflects managers’ 
willingness to accept a higher level of fraud risks and vary depending on the circumstances of the 
program. When determining risk tolerance in disaster situations, managers weigh the program’s 
operational objective of expeditiously providing assistance against the objective of lowering the 
likelihood of fraud, because activities to lower fraud risks—such as the risk that ineligible 
individuals submit fraudulent applications for benefits—causing delays in service. As a result, 
managers are willing to accept a somewhat higher risk of fraud than under normal circumstances 
in order to provide emergency assistance in a timely manner. GAO’s Fraud Framework provides 
a basis for managers to make decisions about how to respond to fraud risks, including 
determining the specific controls to design and implement, given managers’ defined risk 
tolerances. 

Managers can find additional guidance provided in the Association of Government Accountants 
(AGA) Fraud Prevention Tool Kit useful when managing specific types of fraud risks in Federal 
programs. AGA’s Fraud Prevention Tool Kit provides current, state-of-the-art tools for Federal, 
state, local, and tribal government financial managers to use in preventing and detecting fraud. 

 


IV. ASSESSING INTERNAL CONTROL 

Agency managers must continuously monitor, assess, and improve the effectiveness of internal 
control associated with those internal control objectives identified as part of their risk profile. This 
continuous monitoring, and other periodic evaluations, provide the basis for the Agency Head’s 
annual assessment and report on internal control as required by the FMFIA. 

A. Documentation Requirements 

Agency management must determine the appropriate level of documentation needed to support 
this assessment. The Green Book provides documentation requirements that are a necessary part 
of an effective internal control system. The level and nature of documentation vary based on the 
size of the entity and the complexity of the operational processes the entity performs. 
Management uses judgment in determining the extent of documentation that is needed. 
Documentation is required to demonstrate the design, implementation, and operating 
effectiveness of an entity’s internal control system. The Green Book includes minimum 
documentation requirements as follows: 

• If management’s assessment determines that a principle is not relevant, management 
supports that determination with documentation that includes the rationale of how, in the 
absence of that principle, the associated component may be designed, implemented, and 
operated effectively. 
• Management develops and maintains documentation of its internal control system. 
• Management documents in policies the internal control responsibilities of the organization. 
• Management evaluates and documents the results of ongoing monitoring and separate 
evaluations to identify internal control issues. 
• Management evaluates and documents internal control issues and determines appropriate 
corrective actions for internal control deficiencies on a timely basis. 
• Management completes and documents corrective actions to remediate internal control 
deficiencies on a timely basis. 


B. Sources of Information 

The Agency’s assessment of internal control may be documented using a variety of information 
sources to include: 

• Management documentation of its internal control system, policies, procedures, and 
knowledge gained from the daily operation of Agency programs and systems. 
• Management reviews conducted (i) expressly for the purpose of assessing internal 
control, or (ii) for other purposes with an assessment of internal control as a by-product 
of the review. 
• Annual performance plans, reports, strategic reviews and program evaluations relevant to 
internal control pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act and OMB Circular No. A-11, 
Section 200, Federal Performance Framework. 



• Acquisition Assessments pursuant to OMB Memorandum: Conducting Acquisition 
Assessments under OMB Circular No. A-123, May 21, 2008. 
• Management reviews and annual evaluations and reports related to information 
technology, information security, and information resources pursuant to the Federal 
Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and OMB Circular No. A-130, 
Responsibilities for Protecting Federal Information Resources. 
• Outputs of governance mechanisms for information technology resources published by 
the Agency, pursuant to the “CIO Authorities” described in the Federal Information 
Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). 
• Office of Government Ethics Program Reviews and other internal Agency ethics program 
reviews. 
• Annual reviews and reports pursuant to the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, 
as amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 and the 
Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012. 
• Program reviews conducted pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-129, Policies for Federal 
Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables. 
• Single Audit Act Reports and program reviews conducted pursuant to the Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal 
Awards for grant-making agencies. 
• Antideficiency Act Reviews and Investigations. 
• Independent audit reports including Office of Inspectors General Management 
Challenges and GAO High Risk Reports. 
• Internal audit reports. 
• Reports and other information provided by the Congressional committees of jurisdiction. 
• Other reviews or reports relating to Agency operations or management controls. 
• Assessments of internal control over financial reporting and reviews of financial 
management systems pursuant to Appendix A of OMB Circular No. A-123, Internal 
Control Over Reporting, Appendix B to OMB Circular No. A-123, Improving the 
Management of Government Charge Card Program, Appendix C to OMB Circular No. 
A-123, Requirements for Effective Estimation and Remediation of Improper Payments, or 
Appendix D to OMB Circular No. A-123, Compliance with the Federal Financial 
Management Improvement Act. 


Use of information should take into consideration the completeness of the assessment and 
whether the process included an evaluation of internal control. Agency management should 
avoid duplicating reviews that assess internal controls, and should coordinate their efforts with 
other evaluations to the extent practical. 

C. Identification of Deficiencies 

Agency managers and employees should identify deficiencies in internal control from the 
sources of information described above and the results of their assessment process. The 
assessment process must include an assessment of compliance with each of the Green Book 
components and principles. In addition, the identification of deficiencies must include all 
management and operational functions and processes that support mission delivery. Agency 
employees and managers report control deficiencies, at a minimum to the next supervisory level, 


which allows the chain of command structure to determine the relative importance of each 
deficiency. Reporting of deficiencies should also include reporting deficiencies to the Agency’s 
Inspector General. Definitions of control deficiencies, significant deficiencies, and material 
weaknesses are provided in Section VI. 

Agency managers and staff are encouraged to identify control deficiencies, as this reflects 
positively on the Agency's commitment to recognizing and addressing management problems. 
Failing to report a known material weakness or significant deficiency reflects adversely on the 
Agency and continue to place the Agency’s mission support operations at risk. Agencies must 
carefully consider whether systemic weaknesses exist that adversely affect internal control across 
organizational or program lines. 

D. Internal Control Evaluation Approach 

Management is responsible for evaluating whether a system of internal control reduces the risk 
of not achieving the entity’s objectives related to operations, reporting, or compliance to an 
acceptable level. In evaluating internal control, management should follow a risk-based 
assessment approach:9 

9 Section based on COSO, Internal Control – Integrated Framework, Illustrative Tools for Assessing Effectiveness 
of a System of Internal Control (New York: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 2013). 

1. Conduct an Assessment of Internal Control. Management must conduct an evaluation 
of internal controls for each of the Green Book’s principles for each of the entity 
objectives. 
2. Prepare a Summary of Internal Control Deficiencies. Management should leverage 
an aggregated or summary log of all identified internal control deficiencies from the 
sources of information listed in Section B above and the results of their assessment 
process. The log may support the evaluation of the Green Book’s Internal Control 
Components and Principles. 
3. Conclude on Internal Control Principle Evaluation. Management must summarize its 
determination of whether each principle is designed, implemented, and operating 
effectively. That determination is a function of management judgment based on: 
a. the applicability of the principle to the Agency’s circumstances, 
b. whether the Agency has actually been able to implement, perform, and apply the 
principle, 
c. any internal control deficiency that may result, 
d. the extent of compensating internal controls within the principle, and 
e. the extent to which the remaining risk impacts on the Agency’s ability to achieve 
its objectives and meet its mission and goals. 






Evaluation of whether each principle is designed, implemented, and operating effectively 
must be of the “yes/no” type. 

4. Conclude on Internal Control Component Evaluation. Management must also 
summarize its determination of whether each component is designed, implemented, and 
operating effectively. Similar to item three above, evaluation of internal control 
components is a function of management judgment and qualitative determinations. If an 
internal control principle is not designed, implemented, and operating effectively, 
management is unable to conclude that the internal control component is operating 
effectively. 
5. Conclude on Overall Assessment of a System of Internal Control. Management 
must summarize its determination of whether each of the Green Book’s components and 
principles are designed, implemented, and operating effectively and components are 
operating together in an integrated manner. In addition, management must determine the 
severity of internal control deficiencies or combination of deficiencies when aggregated 
across the components. If one or more internal control components are not operating 
effectively, a material weakness must be reported. 


The following table illustrates how internal control principles within the control environment 
component roll up into the determination of whether the component is designed, implemented, 
and operating effectively, in addition to the overall assessment of a system of internal control. 
Examples below include illustrative summaries of control deficiencies.

The Agency doesnot have processes in place to detectandmitigate potential employee conflicts of interest.
Management concludes the principle isnotdesigned,
implemented, and operating effectively.
Principle 2: Exercise Oversight ResponsibilityInternal control deficiency noted because the SeniorManagement Council’s review of risk assessments andremediation plans are not documented.
Management concludes that the principle is designed,
implemented, and operating effectively despite internalcontrol deficiencies based on an evaluation of the 
severity of deficiencies and that compensating controlsare in place.
Principle 3: Establish Structure, Responsibility andAuthorityInternal control deficiency noted because oversight andcontrol structures havenot evolved to keep upwith 
changes in operations.
Management concludes that the principle is designed,
implemented, and operating effectively as the 
deficiencynoted only affect a small portion of the 
Agency.
Principle 4: DemonstrateCommitment to CompetenceNo internal control deficiencies noted.
Management concludes that the principle is designed,
implemented, and operating effectively.
Principle 5: Enforce AccountabilityInternal control deficiencies noted because 
management,with oversight from the SeniorManagement Council, does not take necessarycorrective actions.
Management concludes that the principle is notdesigned, implemented, and operating effectively.

The following table is anillustrativeexample of the results of management’s assessment of the 
control environment component:

In the table above, management concludes the Control Environment Component is not designed, 
implemented, and operating effectively since two principles are not designed, implemented, and 
operating effectively due to the identified deficiencies from the summary log. Each principle 
supports the design, implementation, operational effectiveness of the associated component. If 
one principle is ineffective, management is unable to conclude that the component is effective.10 
In the table below, since management concluded that the Control Environment is not operating 
effectively, it must conclude that the overall system of internal control was not operating 
effectively and an entity-level control material weakness must be reported.

V. CORRECTING INTERNAL CONTROL DEFICIENCIES 

A. Importance of Correcting Internal Control Deficiencies 

Correcting control deficiencies is an integral part of management accountability and must be 
considered a priority by the Agency. An Agency’s ability to correct control deficiencies is an 
indicator of the strength of its internal control environment. Effective remediation of control 
deficiencies is essential to achieving the objectives of the FMFIA, and uncorrected or 
longstanding control deficiencies must be considered in determining the overall effectiveness of 
internal control. The corrective action process provides the mechanism for management to 
present a comprehensive plan for addressing the risk associated with a control deficiency. 

B. Corrective Action Plan Requirements 

Agencies should perform a root-cause analysis of the deficiency to ensure that subsequent 
strategies and plans address the root of the problem and not just the symptoms. Identifying and 
developing an understanding of the root cause of control deficiencies is management’s 
responsibility. Management should incorporate IG and GAO audit findings as part of its 
identification process; however, auditors are not responsible for identifying root causes of 
control deficiencies. As a result, reliance on audit findings or recommendations alone may lead 
to incomplete corrective actions. Management should also consider alternative risk mitigation 
strategies and perform cost-benefit analysis to determine the best or most cost-effective solution. 

A summary of the corrective action plans for material weaknesses that have not been fully 
mitigated at the time of reporting must be included in the Agency’s AFR, PAR, or other 
management report. Also see Section VI for reporting on material weaknesses. The summary 
discussion must include a description of the material weakness, status of corrective actions, and 
timeline for resolution. 

Management must maintain more thoroughly detailed corrective action plans internally, which 
must be made available for OMB and audit review. Management’s process for resolution and 
corrective action of identified internal control deficiencies must: 

• Communicate corrective actions to the appropriate level of the Agency and delegate 
authority for completing corrective actions to appropriate personnel. 
• Determine the resources required to correct a control deficiency. The corrective action 
plan must indicate the types of resources needed (e.g., additional personnel, contract 
support, training, etc.), including non-financial resources, such as Senior Leadership 
support for correcting the control deficiency. 
• Include critical path milestones that affect the overall schedule and performance of the 
corrective actions needed to resolve the control deficiency. Critical path milestones must 
lead to a date certain of the correction of the control deficiency. 
• Require prompt resolution and internal control testing to validate the correction of the 
control deficiency. 
• Ensure that accurate records of the status of the identified control deficiency are 
maintained and updated throughout the entire process. 



• Ensure that the corrective action plans are consistent with laws, regulations, and Agency 
policy. 
• Ensure that performance appraisals of appropriate officials reflect effectiveness in 
resolving or implementing corrective action for identified material weaknesses. 
• Fully disclose uncorrected internal control weaknesses and highlight those that are 
material. 


A determination that a control deficiency has been corrected should be made by the Senior 
Accountable Official only when sufficient corrective actions have been taken and validated. 
This determination must be in writing, supported by appropriate documentation, and made 
available for review by appropriate officials, e.g., the Agency’s Senior Management Council or 
equivalent. 

C. Audit Follow Up and Cooperative Audit Resolution and Oversight Initiatives 

As managers consider Office of Inspectors General (OIG), GAO, and other investigative audit 
reports in identifying and correcting internal control deficiencies, they must be mindful of the 
statutory requirements included in the Inspector General Act, as amended, and OMB Circular 
No. A-50, Audit Follow-up. Management has a responsibility to complete action, in a timely 
manner, on audit recommendations on which agreement with the OIG has been reached. 
Management must make a decision regarding OIG audit recommendations within a six-month 
period after issuance of the audit report and implement management's decision within one year to 
the extent practicable. 

Some agencies use cooperative audit resolution and oversight initiatives (CAROI)11 to 
complement oversight of corrective actions and internal control efforts. In addition, the Uniform 
Grant Guidance encourages agencies to use cooperative audit resolution mechanisms as part of 
audit follow-up techniques that promote prompt corrective actions by improving communication, 
fostering collaboration, promoting trust, and developing a common understanding of audit 
findings to improve Federal program outcomes. The AGA has conducted research and has 
developed a framework to implement CAROI at Federal agencies. The AGA provides, “the 
CAROI is a tool for achieving: 1) alternative and creative approaches to resolving audit findings 
and their underlying causes, and 2) greater success in attaining program goals at all levels of 
government through the constructive use of monitoring and technical assistance (i.e., oversight 
activities).” While the establishment of a CAROI is not a requirement of this document, a 
CAROI or similar construct is encouraged.

VI. REPORTING ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 

A. Annual Assurance Statement. 

The assurance statement and summary information related to Section 2 and Section 4 of the 
FMFIA must be provided in a single report section of the annual AFR, PAR, or other 
management report labeled “Analysis of Entity’s Systems, Controls and Legal Compliance." 
The section must include the annual assurance statement, a summary of the Agency’s process for 
assessing internal control effectiveness and resulting material weaknesses and corrective action 
plans as of September 30 of a given fiscal year.12 The assurance statement is an accountability 
statement so only essential information must be included. Table 5 provides a summary of 
internal control reporting requirements, and Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 provide illustrative examples of 
assurance statements. 

12 Agencies may use roll forward procedures for timing differences in different types of internal control assessments 
(e.g., timing differences between June 30 and September 30). 

B. Reporting Pursuant to Integration of Enterprise Risk Management and Internal 
Control 

Management has discretion in determining the scope of operations, reporting, and compliance 
objectives based on the Agency’s risk profile as described in Section II of this document. 
Agencies are required to provide assurances on their process to identify risks and establish 
controls or integrate existing controls to the identified risk. Some of these internal control 
systems may have been operating effectively prior to integration of these risks. These assurances 
should be built out over time following a maturity model approach and reported in the AFR 
along with a report on identified material weaknesses and corrective actions. Until an Agency 
has fully implemented an ERM approach to risk management they may continue to provide the 
existing risk assurance statements to their OIG and/or private accounting firms. 

C. Reporting Pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix A 

Appendix A of OMB Circular No. A-123 provides a methodology for agency management to 
assess, document and report on internal controls over reporting. This document also encourages 
an integrated approach to assess the internal controls over reporting considering the current 
legislative and regulatory environment in which Federal entities operate. Management’s 
assessment of internal control over external financial reporting must follow the assessment 
methodology provided in Appendix A to Circular No. A-123, Internal Control Over Reporting. 

 


D. Reporting Pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-130, Appendix I 

Appendix I of OMB Circular No. A-130, Responsibilities for Protecting and Managing Federal 
Information Resources, establishes minimum requirements for Federal information security 
programs, assigns Federal Agency responsibilities for the security of information and 
information systems, and links Agency information security programs and Agency management 
control systems established in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-123. The appendix also 
establishes requirements for Federal privacy programs, assigns responsibilities for privacy 
program management, and describes how agencies must take a coordinated approach to 
implementing information security and privacy controls. 

E. Reporting Pursuant to Section 2—31 U.S.C. 3512(d) (2) 

Section 2-31 U.S.C 3512(d) (2), commonly referred to as Section 2 of the FMFIA requires that 
the head of each Executive Agency annually submit to the President and the Congress (i) a 
statement on whether there is reasonable assurance that the Agency's controls are achieving their 
intended objectives; and (ii) a report on material weaknesses in the Agency's controls. 

• Statement of Assurance. The statement of assurance represents the Agency head's 
informed judgment as to the overall adequacy and effectiveness of internal control within 
the Agency related to operations, reporting, and compliance. The statement must take 
one of the following forms: 
o unmodified statement of assurance (no material weaknesses or lack of compliance 
reported); 
o modified statement of assurance, considering the exceptions explicitly noted (one 
or more material weaknesses or lack of compliance reported); or 
o statement of no assurance (no processes in place or pervasive material 
weaknesses). 


In deciding on the type of assurance to provide, the Agency head should consider information 
from the assessment process described in Section IV of this Circular, with input from senior 
program and administrative officials. Management is precluded from concluding that the 
Agency’s internal control is effective (unmodified statement of assurance) if there are one or 
more material weaknesses. In support of a single assurance statement, a detailed summary of 
management assurances must also be provided in the “Other Information” section of the annual 
AFR, PAR, or other management report. The detailed assurances should mirror the single 
assurance statement and provide assurance over the effectiveness of internal controls in each 
supporting area of operations, reporting (including external financial reporting), and compliance. 

The Agency Head must sign the statement of assurance. 

F. Reporting Pursuant to Section 4—31 U.S.C. 3512(d) (2) (B) 

Section 4-31 U.S.C. 3512(d) (2) (B) commonly referred to as Section 4 of the FMFIA, requires 
CFO Act Agencies, a separate report on whether the Agency's financial management systems 
comply with government-wide requirements. These financial management systems requirements 


are mandated by Section 803 (a) of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act and 
Appendix D to OMB Circular No. A-123, Compliance with the Federal Financial Management 
Improvement Act of 1996. FFMIA Section 803(a) requirements include compliance with Federal 
Financial Management System Requirements, applicable Federal accounting standards, and the 
United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) at the transaction level. If the Agency’s 
systems do not comply with financial systems requirements, the statement must list the lack of 
compliance noted and discuss the Agency's plans for bringing its systems into compliance. 
Financial management systems include both financial and financially-related (or mixed) systems. 

G. Government Corporations 

For government corporations, Section 306 of the Chief Financial Officers Act established a 
reporting requirement related to the internal controls for corporations covered by the 
Government Corporation Control Act. These corporations must submit an annual management 
report to the Congress. This report must include, among other items, a statement on control 
systems by the head of the management of the corporation consistent with the requirements of 
the FMFIA. The corporation is required to provide the President, the Director of OMB, and the 
Comptroller General a copy of the management report when it is submitted to the Congress. 

H. Classified Matters 

The statement of assurance is made available to the public. However, relevant information that 
is specifically prohibited from disclosure by any provision of law, or specifically required by 
Executive Order to protect the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs, must 
not be included in the statement made available to the public. Descriptions of major 
vulnerabilities must be framed in such a way as to preclude an adverse party from exploiting the 
information.

Reporting 

Control Deficiency 

A control deficiency exists when the design, 
implementation, or operation of a control does not 
allow management or personnel, in the normal 
course of performing their assigned functions, to 
achieve control objectives and address related 
risks.13 

A deficiency in design exists when (1) a control 
necessary to meet a control objective is missing or 
(2) an existing control is not properly designed so 
that even if the control operates as designed, the 
control objective would not be met.14 

A deficiency in implementation exists when a 
properly designed control is not implemented 
correctly in the internal control system. 15 

A deficiency in operation exists when a properly 
designed control does not operate as designed, or 
when the person performing the control does not 
possess the necessary authority or competence to 
perform the control effectively.16 

Internal to the organization and not 
reported externally. Progress against 
corrective action plans must be 
periodically assessed and reported to 
agency management. 

Significant 
Deficiency 

A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control 
that is less severe than a material weakness yet 
important enough to merit attention by those 
charged with governance.17 

Internal to the organization and not 
reported externally. Progress against 
corrective action plans must be 
periodically assessed and reported to 
agency management.

revision of Government Auditing Standards defines those charged with governance as the person(s) or 
organization(s) with responsibility for overseeing the strategic direction of the entity and the obligations related to 
the accountability of the entity. This includes overseeing the financial reporting process, subject matter, or program 
under audit, including related internal controls.

Reporting 

Material Weakness 

A significant deficiency that the Agency Head 
determines to be significant enough to report 
outside of the Agency as a material weakness. In 
the context of the Green Book, non-achievement 
of a relevant principle and related component 
results in a material weakness.18 

A material weakness in internal control over 
operations might include, but is not limited to, 
conditions that: 

• impacts the operating effectiveness of 
Entity- Level Controls; 
• impairs fulfillment of essential 
operations or mission; 
• deprives the public of needed services; 
or 
• significantly weakens established 
safeguards against fraud, waste, loss, 
unauthorized use, or misappropriation of 
funds, property, other assets, or conflicts 
of interest. 


A material weakness in internal control over 
reporting is a significant deficiency, in which the 
Agency Head determines significant enough to 
impact internal or external decision-making and 
reports outside of the Agency as a material 
weakness. 

A material weakness in internal control over 
external financial reporting is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control, 
such that there is a reasonable possibility19 that a 
material misstatement of the entity’s financial 
statements will not be prevented, or detected and 
corrected, on a timely basis. 

A material weakness in internal control over 
compliance is a condition where management 
lacks a process that reasonably ensures preventing 
a violation of law or regulation that has a direct 
and material effect on financial reporting or 
significant effect on other reporting or achieving 
Agency objectives. 

Material weaknesses and a summary of 
corrective actions must be reported to 
OMB and Congress through the AFR, 
PAR, or other management reports. 
Progress against corrective action plans 
must be periodically assessed and 
reported to agency management. 



 

 


18 The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 no longer requires that a significant deficiency 
identified be reported as a material weakness for FMFIA. 

19 In this definition, a reasonable possibility exists when the likelihood of the event is reasonably possible or 
probable as those terms are used in AU-C 265, Communicating Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an 
Audit.

I. Agencies Obtaining Audit Opinions on Internal Control 

Agencies may be required or may at their choice elect to receive an audit opinion on internal 
control over external financial reporting. These Agencies must provide a separate assurance 
statement for internal control over external financial reporting. The Green Book and OMB 
Circular No. A-123 provide adequate criteria for management’s assessment of internal control 
and related management assurances. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
requirements for the private sector are not requirements of the Federal Government. 

 


VII. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 

A. Managing Privacy Risks in Federal Programs 

The Federal Government necessarily creates, collects, uses, processes, stores, maintains, 
disseminates, discloses, and disposes of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to carry out the 
missions mandated by Federal statute. The term PII, as defined by OMB, refers to information 
that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined 
with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Because there are many 
different types of information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, the 
term PII is necessarily broad. To determine whether information is PII, the agency must perform 
an assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified using the information with 
other information that is linked or linkable to the individual. In performing this assessment, it is 
important to recognize that information that is not PII can become PII whenever additional 
information becomes available – in any medium and from any source – that would make it 
possible to identify an individual. 

Once the agency determines that an information system contains PII, the agency must then 
consider the privacy risks and the associated risk to agency operations, agency assets, 
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. When considering privacy risks, the agency 
must consider the risks to an individual or individuals associated with the agency’s creation, 
collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal of their 
PII. In particular, the agency must evaluate the sensitivity of each individual data element that is 
PII, as well as all of the data elements together. The sensitivity level of the PII will depend on 
the context, including the purpose for which the PII is created, collected, used, processed, stored, 
maintained, disseminated, disclosed, or disposed. For example, the sensitivity level of a list of 
individuals’ names may depend on the source of the information, the other information 
associated with the list, the intended use of the information, how the information will be 
processed and shared, and the ability to access the information. In addition, when determining 
the privacy and associated risks, the agency must also consider the volume of PII. A higher 
volume of PII about a single individual or multiple individuals may pose increased privacy or 
associated risks. 

Agency Privacy Programs. In order to manage Federal information resources that involve PII, 
agencies must develop, implement, document, maintain, and oversee agency-wide privacy 
programs that include people, processes, and technologies. Agencies’ privacy programs are led 
by the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) and are responsible for ensuring compliance 
with applicable privacy requirements, developing and evaluating privacy policy, and managing 
privacy risks. Privacy programs’ review of privacy risks should begin at the earliest planning 
and development stages of agency actions and policies that involve PII, and should continue 
throughout the life cycle of the information. 

Privacy Impact Assessments. As a general matter, an agency must conduct a privacy impact 
assessment (PIA) under section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, absent an applicable 
exception under that section, when the agency develops, procures, or uses information 


technology to create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of 
PII.20 A PIA is an analysis of how PII is handled to ensure that handling conforms to applicable 
privacy requirements, determine the privacy risks associated with an information system or 
activity, and evaluate ways to mitigate privacy risks. A PIA is both an analysis and a formal 
document detailing the process and the outcome of the analysis. 

20 See 44 U.S.C. § 3501 note. Section 208(b) of the E-Government Act requires agencies, absent an applicable 
exception under this section, to conduct a PIA before: (i) developing or procuring IT that collects, maintains, or 
disseminates information that is in an identifiable form; or (ii) initiating a new collection of information that – (I) 
will be collected, maintained, or disseminated using IT; and (II) includes any information in an identifiable form 
permitting the physical or online contacting of a specific individual, if identical questions have been posed to, or 
identical reporting requirements imposed on, 10 or more persons, other than agencies, instrumentalities, or 
employees of the Federal Government. 

A PIA is one of the most valuable tools Federal agencies use to ensure compliance with 
applicable privacy requirements and manage privacy risks. Agencies must conduct and draft a 
PIA with sufficient clarity and specificity to demonstrate that the agency fully considered 
privacy and incorporated appropriate privacy protections from the earliest stages of the agency 
activity and throughout the information life cycle. In order to conduct a meaningful PIA, the 
agency’s SAOP must work closely with the program managers, information system owners, 
information technology experts, security officials, counsel, and other relevant agency officials. 

Moreover, a PIA is not a time-restricted activity that is limited to a particular milestone or stage 
of the information system or PII life cycles. Rather, the privacy analysis must continue 
throughout the information system and PII life cycles. Accordingly, a PIA must be considered a 
living document that agencies are required to update whenever changes to the information 
technology, changes to the agency’s practices, or other factors alter the privacy risks associated 
with the use of such information technology. 

In addition to serving as an important analytical tool for agencies, a PIA also serves as notice to 
the public regarding the agency’s practices with respect to privacy and information technology. 
All PIAs must be drafted in plain language and must be posted on the agency’s website, unless 
doing so would raise security concerns or reveal classified or sensitive information. Although 
PIAs are generally required by law, such as by the E-Government Act of 2002, agencies may 
also develop policies to require PIAs in circumstances where a PIA would not be required by 
law. 


Risk Management Framework. Agencies’ privacy programs have responsibilities under the 
Risk Management Framework.21 
The Risk Management Framework provides a disciplined and 
structured process that integrates information security, privacy, and risk management activities 
into the information system development life cycle. Agencies should refer to OMB Circular No. 
A-130 for more detailed guidance regarding the role of agencies’ privacy programs under the 
Risk Management Framework.

21 Traditionally, the Risk Management Framework was a framework to help agencies address information security 
and related risks in the authorization process for Federal information systems. NIST has published a suite of 
standards and guidelines that describe how to implement an agency-wide risk management framework. As of the 
date of this publication, many of the existing NIST standards and guidelines that detail how to implement an agency-
wide risk management framework do not fully address the role of privacy and agencies’ privacy programs. In the 
future, NIST may revise or develop standards and guidelines to further clarify how privacy and agencies’ privacy 
programs are integrated into the Risk Management Framework. 

 

B. Conducting Acquisition Assessments under OMB Circular No. A-123 

In May 2008, OMB’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued guidelines, including 
an assessment template, to (1) establish a standard approach for assessing acquisition activities 
and programs; and (2) integrate these efforts into existing agency internal control processes and 
practices required by OMB Circular No. A-123. The template was adopted from the 
Government Accountability Office (GAO) Framework for Assessing the Acquisition Function at 
Federal Agencies (Framework) (GAO-05-218G) and consists of four interrelated areas, i.e. 
cornerstones, that are essential to an efficient, effective and accountable acquisition process: (1) 
organizational alignment and leadership; (2) policies and processes; (3) human capital; and (4) 
information management and stewardship. Assessments conducted using this Acquisition 
Framework can continue to be leveraged in meeting the requirements of the current update to 
OMB Circular No. A-123. 

These guidelines are based on GAO’s Framework for Assessing the Acquisition Function at 
Federal Agencies (GAO-05-218G) and can continue to be leveraged in meeting the requirements 
of the current update to OMB Circular No. A-123. Each of the elements of OMB’s Acquisition 
Framework is reviewed below in relation to the Green Book. The critical factors contained in 
each element of the acquisition framework are used where possible to depict these similarities 
and differences. The following illustrative table is included in setting out concepts that are 
common to both OMB’s acquisition framework and the Green Book and required by the Green 
Book, but not part of the acquisition framework. 

 


Table 7 Comparison of OMB Acquisition Framework and GAO Green Book 

Common to Both 

Differences Required by the Green Book 

• Aligning Acquisition with Agency Mission and Needs 
• Commitment from Leadership 


None 

• Planning Strategically 
• Effectively Managing the Acquisition Process 
• Promoting Successful Outcomes of Major Projects 


Management Responsibility for considering 
Fraud Risks 

• Valuing and Investing in the Acquisition Workforce 
• Strategic Human Capital Planning 
• Acquiring, Developing, and Retaining Talent 
• Creating Results-Oriented Organizational Cultures 


Management Responsibility for considering 
Fraud Risks 

• Identify Data and Technology that Support Acquisition 
Management Decisions 
• Safeguarding the Integrity of Operations and Data 


None 



Agencies should continue their prior assessment activities under the acquisition framework to 
comply with the 2014 revision of the Green Book. For example, the framework describes the 
Commitment from Leadership element to include management providing clear, strong and 
ethical executive leadership, and effective communication, and continuous improvement. These 
activities align with the Green Book principles that require an entity to demonstrate commitment 
to integrity and ethical values, while ensuring that management should communicate the 
necessary quality information both internally and externally. 

One required Green Book principle that is absent from the current acquisition framework is 
management’s consideration for potential fraud when identifying, analyzing and responding to 
risks. Agencies must consider fraud risks in their strategic plans, and ensure agency 
professionals involved in planning for, reviewing, awarding, and managing deliverables under 
contract and throughout the acquisition lifecycle receive training on fraud indicators and risks. 
Additional guidance covering administrative actions and procedures for preventing fraud in 
emergency responses and contingency operations can be found in OMB’s emergency 
acquisitions guide22 and in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

C. Managing Grants Risks in Federal Programs 

On December 26, 2013, OMB published the final guidance, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (“Uniform 
Guidance”) 2 CFR 200. These new requirements set forth standards for obtaining consistency 
and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal 
awards. The requirements seek to effectively focus Federal resources, improve Federal grant 


award performance, and create a government-wide framework for ensuring effective fiscal 
management of Federal grants. In addition, the requirements in 2 CFR 200.501, Audit 
Requirements, reduce the administrative burden on recipients by increasing the single audit 
threshold to $750,000 in Federal award expenditures per year. The guidance in 2 CFR 200.205 
requires Federal awarding agency review of risk(s) posed by applicants, risk evaluation(s) 
whenever making new awards, and authorized use of a risk based approach. 

Within each Federal Agency, there is a shared interest for management and oversight of Federal 
grant dollars from both a financial management and grants management perspective. Leveraging 
the risk-based perspective, the internal controls framework should serve as a mechanism to 
ensure effective and efficient allocation and use of Federal grant dollars. Agencies must 
consider fraud risks in their strategic plans and ensure Federal officials involved in planning for, 
awarding, and managing grants and other forms of financial assistance receive training of fraud 
indicators and risk. 

In addition, the Federal Government has a number of complex inter-dependencies with State and 
local governments, and other recipients of Federal funding. From an ERM perspective, these 
inter-dependencies are called the “extended enterprise” impacts the Agency’s risk management, 
and give rise to certain additional risks, which need to be considered in the Agency’s risk profile. 
Finally, ERM and use of data analytics is an emerging best practice; examples include: 

• Pre-award Decision Support: 


Appropriate tools and data analytics made 
available to Federal awarding agencies to 
properly conduct risk analysis. 

• Pre/Post Award Monitoring Plans 
and Activities: 


Federal awarding agencies use of relevant data to 
determine risks and take appropriate action prior 
to making awards. 

• Award Grantee Risk Mitigation: 


Federal awarding agencies plan for and execute 
monitoring and mitigation activities meeting their 
specific needs. 

• Grant Policy Monitoring Standards: 


Federal awarding agencies manage grant 
portfolios using a common set of risk-based 
standards. 



D. Managing Antideficiency Act Risks 

The Antideficiency Act (ADA) imposes restrictions on the amounts of obligations or 
expenditures that agencies may make. ADA violations are ultimately reported to the President, 
Congress, and the Government Accountability Office. An ADA violation may be a symptom of 
an underlying control deficiency. OMB Circular No. A-11, Section 150, Administrative Control 
of Funds outlines requirements for the administrative control of funds under the ADA. Section 
150.3 explains the relationship between an agency’s internal controls and its fund controls. In 
addition, OMB Circular No. A-11, Section 145, Requirements for Reporting Antideficiency Act 


Violations, provides more information about the ADA, and also provides agencies with 
guidelines for reporting violations. The Agency’s risk profile as described in Section II must 
include a review of the agency’s budget authority, from sources such as appropriations 
legislation, and identify any areas in which there is a risk of violating the ADA.
