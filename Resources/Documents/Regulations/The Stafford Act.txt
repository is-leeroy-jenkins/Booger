Title I – Findings, Declarations and Definitions

Sec. 101. Congressional Findings and Declarations (42 U.S.C. 5121)

(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that -

 (1) because disasters often cause loss of life, human suffering, loss of income, and 
property loss and damage; and 

 (2) because disasters often disrupt the normal functioning of governments and 
communities, and adversely affect individuals and families with great severity; 
special measures, designed to assist the efforts of the affected States in expediting 
the rendering of aid, assistance, and emergency services, and the reconstruction 
and rehabilitation of devastated areas, are necessary.

(b) It is the intent of the Congress, by this Act, to provide an orderly and continuing means 
of assistance by the Federal Government to State and local governments in carrying 
out their responsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage which result from such 
disasters by -

 (1) revising and broadening the scope of existing disaster relief programs; 

 (2) encouraging the development of comprehensive disaster preparedness and 
assistance plans, programs, capabilities, and organizations by the States and by 
local governments; 

 (3) achieving greater coordination and responsiveness of disaster preparedness and 
relief programs; 

 (4) encouraging individuals, States, and local governments to protect themselves by 
obtaining insurance coverage to supplement or replace governmental assistance; 

 (5) encouraging hazard mitigation measures to reduce losses from disasters, including 
development of land use and construction regulations; and 

 (6) providing Federal assistance programs for both public and private losses sustained 
in disasters[.]

earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, 
regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, 
which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity 



and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this Act to supplement 
the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and disaster 
relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused 
thereby.

 (3) “United States” means the fifty States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the

 (9) “Federal agency” means any department, independent establishment,

Title V -- Emergency Assistance Programs 

Sec. 501. Procedure for Declaration (42 U.S.C. 5191)

(a) Request and Declaration - All requests for a declaration by the President that an 
emergency exists shall be made by the Governor of the affected State. Such a request shall 
be based on a finding that the situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective 
response is beyond the capabilities of the State and the affected local governments and 
that Federal assistance is necessary. As a part of such request, and as a prerequisite to 
emergency assistance under this Act, the Governor shall take appropriate action under 
State law and direct execution of the State’s emergency plan. The Governor shall furnish 
information describing the State and local efforts and resources which have been or 
will be used to alleviate the emergency, and will define the type and extent of Federal 
aid required. Based upon such Governor’s request, the President may declare that an 
emergency exists.

(b) Certain Emergencies Involving Federal Primary Responsibility - The President may 
exercise any authority vested in him by section 5192 of this title or section 5193 of 
this title [Sections 502 or 503] with respect to an emergency when he determines 
that an emergency exists for which the primary responsibility for response rests with 
the United States because the emergency involves a subject area for which, under 
the Constitution or laws of the United States, the United States exercises exclusive 
or preeminent responsibility and authority. In determining whether or not such an 
emergency exists, the President shall consult the Governor of any affected State, if 
practicable. The President’s determination may be made without regard to subsection 
(a) of this section.

(c) Indian Tribal Government Requests - 

 (1) In General - The Chief Executive of an affected Indian tribal government may 
submit a request for a declaration by the President that an emergency exists 
consistent with the requirements of subsection (a).

 (2) References - In implementing assistance authorized by the President under this 
subchapter in response to a request of the Chief Executive of an affected Indian 
tribal government for an emergency declaration, any reference in this subchapter 
or subchapter III (except sections 5153 and 5165d of this title [Sections 310 and 
326]) to a State or the Governor of a State is deemed to refer to an affected Indian 
tribal government or the Chief Executive of an affected Indian tribal government, 
as appropriate.

 (3) Savings Provision - Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an Indian tribal 
government from receving assistance under this subchapter through a declaration 
made by the President at the request of a State under subsection (a) if the President 
does not make a declaration under this subsection for the same incident.


Sec. 502. Federal Emergency Assistance (42 U.S.C. 5192)

(a) Specified - In any emergency, the President may -



(1) direct any Federal agency, with or without reimbursement, to utilize its authorities 
and the resources granted to it under Federal law (including personnel, equipment,

save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate severe damage, which may be 
provided in the absence of a specific request and in which case the President -

 (A) shall, to the fullest extent practicable, promptly notify and coordinate with a 
State in which such assistance or support is provided; and

 (B) shall not, in notifying and coordinating with a State under subparagraph 
(A), delay or impede the rapid deployment, use, and distribution of critical 
resources to victims of an emergency.

(b) General - Whenever the Federal assistance provided under subsection (a) of this section 
with respect to an emergency is inadequate, the President may also provide assistance 
with respect to efforts to save lives, protect property and public health and safety, and 
lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe, including precautionary evacuations. 

(c) Guidelines - The President shall promulgate and maintain guidelines to assist Governors 
in requesting the declaration of an emergency in advance of a natural or man-made 
disaster (including for the purpose of seeking assistance with special needs and other 
evacuation efforts) under this section by defining the types of assistance available 
to affected States and the circumstances under which such requests are likely to be 
approved.

§466. Sense of Congress 
reaffirming the continued 
importance and applicability of 
the Posse Comitatus Act

(a) Findings—Congress finds the following:


 (1) Section 1385 of title 18 (commonly 
known as the “Posse Comitatus 
Act”) prohibits the use of the 
Armed Forces as a posse comitatus 
to execute the laws except in cases 
and under circumstances expressly 
authorized by the Constitution or 
Act of Congress.

 (2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus 
Act was expressly intended 
to prevent United States Marshals, 
on their own initiative, from calling 
on the Army for assistance in enforcing 
Federal law.

 (3) The Posse Comitatus Act has 
served the Nation well in limiting 
the use of the Armed Forces to enforce 
the law.

 (4) Nevertheless, by its express 
terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is 
not a complete barrier to the use of 
the Armed Forces for a range of domestic 
purposes, including law enforcement 
functions, when the use 
of the Armed Forces is authorized 
by Act of Congress or the President 
determines that the use of the Armed 
Forces is required to fulfill the President’s 
obligations under the Constitution 
to respond promptly in time 
of war, insurrection, or other serious 
emergency.

 (5) Existing laws, including chapter 
15 of title 10 (commonly known 
as the “Insurrection Act”), and the 
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief 
and Emergency Assistance Act 
(42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), grant the 
President broad powers that may 
be invoked in the event of domestic 
emergencies, including an attack 
against the Nation using weapons 
of mass destruction, and these laws 
specifically authorize the President 
to use the Armed Forces to help restore 
public order.

(b) Sense of Congress—Congress 
reaffirms the continued importance of 
section 1385 of title 18, and it is the 
sense of Congress that nothing in this 
chapter should be construed to alter the 
applicability of such section to any use 
of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus 
to execute the laws.

§470. Disclosures regarding 
homeland security grants

(a) Definitions—In this section:

 (1) Homeland security grant—

natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and 
other man-made disasters—

 (1) the Department should administer 
a coherent and coordinated system 
of both terrorism-focused and 
all-hazards grants;

 (2) there should be a continuing and 
appropriate balance between funding 
for terrorism-focused and all-
hazards preparedness, as reflected in 
the authorizations of appropriations 
for grants under the amendments 
made by titles I and II, as applicable, 
of the Implementing Recommendations 
of the 9/11 Commission Act of 
2007; and

 (3) with respect to terrorism-focused 
grants, it is necessary to ensure 
both that the target capabilities 
of the highest risk areas are achieved 
quickly and that basic levels of preparedness, 
as measured by the attainment 
of target capabilities, are
