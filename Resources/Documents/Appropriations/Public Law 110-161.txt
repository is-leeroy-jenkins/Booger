    Sec. 517. Any funds provided in this Act used to implement E-

    Sec. 518. (a) Tracing studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are released without adequate 
disclaimers regarding the limitations of the data.
    (b) <<NOTE: Firearm traces.>> The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives shall include in all such data releases, 
language similar to the following that would make clear that trace data 
cannot be used to draw broad conclusions about firearms-related crime:
            (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement 
        authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale 
        and possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies 
        may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons 
        are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not all 
        firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced 
        are used in crime.
            (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for 
        purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of 
        firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected do 
        not constitute a random sample and should not be considered 
        representative of the larger universe of all firearms used by 
        criminals, or any subset of that universe. Firearms are normally 
        traced to the first retail seller, and sources reported for 
        firearms traced do not necessarily represent the sources or 
        methods by which firearms in general are acquired for use in 
        crime.

    Sec. 519. (a) <<NOTE: Audits. Reports. Deadlines.>> The Inspectors 
General of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science 
Foundation shall conduct audits, pursuant to the Inspector General Act 
(5 U.S.C. App.), of grants or contracts for which funds are appropriated 
by this Act, and shall submit reports to Congress on the progress of 
such audits, which may include preliminary findings and a description of 
areas of particular interest, within 180 days after initiating such an 
audit and every 180 days thereafter until any such audit is completed.

    (b) <<NOTE: Public information. Website.>> Within 60 days after the 
date on which an audit described in subsection (a) by an Inspector 
General is completed, the Secretary, Attorney General, Administrator, or 
Director, as appropriate, shall make the results of the audit available 
to the public on the Internet website maintained by the Department, 
Administration, or Foundation, respectively. The results shall be made 
available in redacted form to exclude--
            (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, 
        United States Code; and
            (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the 
        public access to which could be used to commit identity theft or 
        for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.

    (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by this Act 
may not be used for the purpose of defraying the costs of a banquet or 
conference that is not directly and programmatically related to the 
purpose for which the grant or contract was awarded, such as a banquet 
or conference held in connection with planning, training, assessment, 
review, or other routine purposes related to a project funded by the 
grant or contract.
    (d) <<NOTE: Certification.>> Any person awarded a grant or contract 
funded by amounts appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to 
the Secretary

[[Page 121 STAT. 1928]]

of Commerce, the Attorney General, the Administrator, or the Director, 
as appropriate, certifying that no funds derived from the grant or 
contract will be made available through a subcontract or in any other 
manner to another person who has a financial interest in the person 
awarded the grant or contract.

    (e) <<NOTE: Effective date.>> The provisions of the preceding 
subsections of this section shall take effect 30 days after the date on 
which the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in 
consultation with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, 
determines that a uniform set of rules and requirements, substantially 
similar to the requirements in such subsections, consistently apply 
under the executive branch ethics program to all Federal departments, 
agencies, and entities.

    Sec. 520. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available 
under this Act may be used to issue patents on claims directed to or 
encompassing a human organism.
    Sec. 521. <<NOTE: Torture.>> None of the funds made available in 
this Act shall be used in any way whatsoever to support or justify the 
use of torture by any official or contract employee of the United States 
Government.

    Sec. 522. (a) <<NOTE: Exports. Canada.>> Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law or treaty, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise 
made available under this Act or any other Act may be expended or

States to pay administrative expenses or to compensate an officer or 
employee of the United States in connection with requiring an export 
license for the export to Canada of components, parts, accessories or 
attachments for firearms listed in Category I, section 121.1 of title 
22, Code of Federal Regulations (International Trafficking in Arms 
Regulations (ITAR), part 121, as it existed on April 1, 2005) with a 
total value not exceeding $500 wholesale in any transaction, provided 
that the conditions of subsection (b) of this section are met by the 
exporting party for such articles.

    (b) The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export license--
            (1) does not exempt an exporter from filing any Shipper's 
        Export Declaration or notification letter required by law, or 
        from being otherwise eligible under the laws of the United 
        States to possess, ship, transport, or export the articles 
        enumerated in subsection (a); and
            (2) does not permit the export without a license of--
                    (A) fully automatic firearms and components and 
                parts for such firearms, other than for end use by the 
                Federal Government, or a Provincial or Municipal 
                Government of Canada;
                    (B) barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or 
                complete breech mechanisms for any firearm listed in 
                Category I, other than for end use by the Federal 
                Government, or a Provincial or Municipal Government of 
                Canada; or

Customs and postmasters shall permit the permanent or temporary export 
without a license of any unclassified articles specified in subsection 
(a) to Canada for end use in Canada or return to the United States, or 
temporary import of Canadian-origin items from Canada for end use in the 
United States or return to Canada for a Canadian citizen.

[[Page 121 STAT. 1929]]

    (d) <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication. President.>> The 
President may require export licenses under this section on a temporary 
basis if the President determines, upon publication first in the Federal 
Register, that the Government of Canada has implemented or maintained 
inadequate import controls for the articles specified in subsection (a), 
such that a significant diversion of such articles has and continues to 
take place for use in international terrorism or in the escalation of a 
conflict in another nation. The President shall terminate the 
requirements of a license when reasons for the temporary requirements 
have ceased.

    Sec. 523. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no department, 
agency, or instrumentality of the United States receiving appropriated 
funds under this Act or any other Act shall obligate or expend in any 
way such funds to pay administrative expenses or the compensation of any 
officer or employee of the United States to deny any application 
submitted pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)(B) and qualified pursuant to 
27 CFR section 478.112 or .113, for a permit to import United States 
origin ``curios or relics'' firearms, parts, or ammunition.

September 30, 1994; and (2) all requirements established under sections 
2325 and 2326 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 29 and 30) for vein or

subparagraph 6(f)(5)(A) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources 
Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)(A)) solely because more than 
15 years have passed without revision of the plan for a unit of the 
National Forest System. Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary 
from any other requirement of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable 
Resources Planning Act (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or any other law: 
Provided, That if the Secretary is not acting expeditiously and in good

    Sec. 411. <<NOTE: Timber. Alaska.>>  No timber sale in Region 10 
shall be advertised if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised 
using a residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values for 
western redcedar. Program accomplishments shall be based on volume sold. 
Should Region 10 sell, in the current fiscal year, the annual average 
portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current 
Tongass Land Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when 
appraised using a residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska 
values for western redcedar, all of the western redcedar timber from 
those sales which is surplus to the needs of domestic processors in 
Alaska, shall be made available to domestic processors in the contiguous 
48 United States at prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, 
in the current fiscal year, less than the annual average portion of the 
decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the Tongass Land 
Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a 
residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values for western 
redcedar, the volume of western redcedar timber available to domestic 
processors at prevailing domestic prices in the contiguous 48 United 
States shall be that volume: (1) which is surplus to the needs of 
domestic processors in Alaska; and (2) is that percent of the surplus 
western redcedar volume determined by calculating the ratio of the total 
timber volume which has been sold on the Tongass to the annual average 
portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current 
Tongass Land Management Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by 
Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is sold (for purposes of this 
amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the determination of how 
much western redcedar is eligible for sale to various markets shall be 
made at the time each sale is awarded). Western redcedar shall be deemed 
``surplus to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' when the 
timber sale holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation of 
the inability to sell western redcedar logs from a given sale to 
domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to or greater than the log 
selling value stated in the contract. All additional western redcedar 
volume not sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 United States domestic 
processors may be exported to foreign markets at the election of the 
timber sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at prevailing 
export prices at the election of the timber sale holder.

    Sec. 412. No funds provided in this Act may be expended to conduct

Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) within the boundaries of a National 
Monument established pursuant to the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 
et seq.) as such boundary existed on January 20, 2001, except where such 
activities are allowed under the Presidential proclamation establishing 
such monument.
    Sec. 413. In entering into agreements with foreign countries 
pursuant to the Wildfire Suppression Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 1856m) 
the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior are 
authorized to enter into reciprocal agreements in which the individuals 
furnished under said agreements to provide wildfire services are 
considered, for purposes of tort liability, employees of the country 
receiving said services when the individuals are engaged in fire 
suppression: Provided, That the Secretary of Agriculture or the 
Secretary of the Interior shall not enter into any agreement under this 
provision unless the foreign country (either directly or through its 
fire organization) agrees to assume any and all liability for the acts 
or omissions of American firefighters engaged in firefighting in a 
foreign country: Provided further, That when an agreement is reached for 
furnishing fire fighting services, the only remedies for acts or 
omissions committed while fighting fires shall be those provided under 
the laws of the host country, and those remedies shall be the exclusive 
remedies for any claim arising out of fighting fires in a foreign 
country: Provided further, That neither the sending country nor any 
legal organization associated with the firefighter shall be subject to 
any legal action whatsoever pertaining to or arising out of the 
firefighter's role in fire suppression.
    Sec. 414. <<NOTE: Contracts.>>  In awarding a Federal contract with 
funds made available by this Act, notwithstanding Federal Government 
procurement and contracting laws, the Secretary of Agriculture and the 
Secretary of the Interior (the ``Secretaries'') may, in evaluating bids 
and proposals, give consideration to local contractors who are from, and 
who provide employment and training for, dislocated and displaced 
workers in an economically disadvantaged rural community, including 
those historically timber-dependent areas that have been affected by 
reduced timber harvesting on Federal lands and other forest-dependent 
rural communities isolated from significant alternative employment 
opportunities: Provided, That notwithstanding Federal Government 
procurement and contracting laws the Secretaries may award contracts, 
grants or cooperative agreements to local non-profit entities, Youth 
Conservation Corps or related partnerships with State, local or non-
profit youth groups, or small or micro-business or disadvantaged 
business: Provided further, That the contract, grant, or cooperative 
agreement is for forest hazardous fuels reduction, watershed or water 
quality monitoring or restoration, wildlife or fish population 
monitoring, or habitat restoration or management: Provided further, That 
the terms ``rural community'' and ``economically disadvantaged'' shall 
have the same meanings as in section 2374 of Public Law 101-624: 
Provided further, <<NOTE: Guidance.>>  That the Secretaries shall 
develop guidance to implement this section: Provided further, That 
nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving the Secretaries 
of any duty

[[Page 121 STAT. 2148]]

        2008 for programs, projects, and activities for which funds are 
        appropriated by this Act.
            (2) None of the funds made available by this or any other 
        Act may be used in fiscal year 2008 for competitive sourcing 
        studies and any related activities involving Forest Service 
        personnel.

    (b) Competitive Sourcing Study Defined.--In this section, the term 
``competitive sourcing study'' means a study on subjecting work 
performed by Federal Government employees or private contractors to 
public-private competition or on converting the Federal Government 
employees or the work performed by such employees to private contractor 
performance under the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 or 
any other administrative regulation, directive, or policy.
    (c) Competitive Sourcing Exemption for Forest Service Studies 
Conducted Prior to Fiscal Year 2006.--The Forest Service is hereby 
exempted from implementing the Letter of Obligation and post-competition 
accountability guidelines where a competitive sourcing study involved 65 
or fewer full-time equivalents, the performance decision was made in 
favor of the agency provider, no net savings was achieved by conducting 
the study, and the study was completed prior to the date of this Act.
    (d) In preparing any reports to the Committees on Appropriations on 
competitive sourcing activities, agencies funded in this Act shall 
include all costs attributable to conducting the competitive sourcing 
competitions and staff work to prepare for competitions or to determine 
the feasibility of starting competitions, including costs attributable 
to paying outside consultants and contractors and, in accordance with

shall--
            (1) determine whether any of the employees concerned are 
        also qualified to participate in wildland fire management 
        activities; and
            (2) take into consideration the effect that contracting with 
        a private sector source would have on the ability of the 
        Department of the Interior to effectively and efficiently fight 
        and manage wildfires.

        droughts, and wildfires;
            (2) there is a growing scientific consensus that human 
        activity is a substantial cause of greenhouse gas accumulation 
        in the atmosphere; and
            (3) mandatory steps will be required to slow or stop the 
        growth of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.

    (b) It is the sense of the Congress that there should be enacted a 
comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory, market-based 
limits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse gases that slow, stop, 
and reverse the growth of such emissions at a rate and in a manner that: 
(1) will not significantly harm the United States economy; and (2) will 
encourage comparable action by other nations that are major trading 
partners and key contributors to global emissions.

        the

        paragraph (3) by the amounts authorized to be appropriated for 
        each such program for such fiscal year; and
            (6) distribute the obligation limitation provided for

obligate amounts in addition

[[Page 121 STAT. 2387]]

to those previously distributed during that fiscal year, giving priority 
to those States having large unobligated balances of funds apportioned

owned or has a mortgage held by the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, the Secretary shall maintain any rental assistance payments 
under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and other 
programs that are attached to any dwelling units in the property. To the 
extent the Secretary determines, in consultation with the tenants and 
the local government, that such a multifamily property owned or held by 
the Secretary is not feasible for continued rental assistance payments 
under such section 8 or other programs, based on consideration of (1) 
the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property and all available 
Federal, State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under 
section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability 
Act of 1997 (``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be 
remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in consultation 
with the tenants of that property, contract for project-based rental 
assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing 
properties, or provide other rental assistance. The Secretary shall also 
take appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts remain in 
effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual 
abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major 
threats to health and safety. After disposition of any multifamily 
property described under this section, the contract and allowable rent 
levels on such properties shall be subject to the requirements under 
section 524 of MAHRAA.

foreclosure mitigation activities, under the following terms and 
conditions:
            (1) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (``NRC''), 
        shall make grants to counseling intermediaries approved by the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or the NRC 
        (with match to be determined by the NRC based on affordability 
        and the economic conditions of an area; a match also may be 
        waived by the NRC based on the aforementioned conditions) to 
        provide mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance primarily to 
        States and areas with high rates of defaults and foreclosures 
        primarily in the sub prime housing market to help eliminate the 
        default and foreclosure of mortgages of owner-occupied single-
        family homes that are at risk of such foreclosure. Other than 
        areas with high rates of defaults and foreclosures, grants may 
        also be provided to approved counseling intermediaries based on 
        a geographic analysis of the Nation by the NRC which determines 
        where there is a prevalence of sub prime mortgages that are 
        risky and likely to fail, including any trends for mortgages 
        that are likely to default and face foreclosure. A State Housing 
        Finance Agency may also be eligible where the State Housing 
        Finance Agency meets all the requirements under this paragraph. 
        A HUD- or NRC-approved counseling intermediary shall meet 
        certain mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance counseling 
        requirements, as determined by the NRC, and shall be approved by 
        HUD or the NRC as meeting these requirements.
            (2) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance shall only be 
        made available to homeowners of owner-occupied homes

[[Page 121 STAT. 2442]]

        with mortgages in default or in danger of default. These 
        mortgages shall likely be subject to a foreclosure action and 
        homeowners will be provided such assistance that shall consist 
        of activities that are likely to prevent foreclosures and result 
        in the long-term affordability of the mortgage retained pursuant 
        to such activity or another positive outcome for the homeowner. 
        No funds made available under this paragraph may be provided 
        directly to lenders or homeowners to discharge outstanding 
        mortgage balances or for any other direct debt reduction 
        payments.
            (3) The use of Mortgage Foreclosure Mitigation Assistance by 
        approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing Finance 
        Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the borrower's 
        financial situation, an evaluation of the current value of the 
        property that is subject to the mortgage, counseling regarding 
        the assumption of the mortgage by another non-Federal party, 
        counseling regarding the possible purchase of the mortgage by a 
        non-Federal third party, counseling and advice of all likely 
        restructuring and refinancing strategies or the approval of a 
        work-out strategy by all interested parties.
            (4) <<NOTE: Grants. Deadline.>> NRC shall award $50,000,000 
        in mortgage foreclosure mitigation grants for States and areas 
        with the greatest needs within 60 days of enactment. Additional 
        funds may be awarded once the NRC certifies that HUD- or NRC-
        approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing Finance 
        Agencies have the need for additional funds in States and areas 
        with high rates of mortgage foreclosures, defaults, or related 
        activities and the expertise to use these funds effectively. The 
        NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds under this 
        paragraph to its own charter members with expertise in 
        foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a certification by 
        the NRC that the procedures for selection do not consist of any 
        procedures or activities that could be construed as an 
        unacceptable conflict of interest or have the appearance of 
        impropriety.
            (5) NRC- or HUD-approved counseling entities and State 
        Housing Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph 
        shall have demonstrated experience in successfully working with 
        financial institutions as well as borrowers facing default, 
        delinquency and foreclosure as well as documented counseling 
        capacity, outreach capacity, past successful performance and 
        positive outcomes with documented counseling plans (including 
        post mortgage foreclosure mitigation counseling), loan workout 
        agreements and loan modification agreements.
            (6) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to $5,000,000 may be made available to build the mortgage 
        foreclosure and default mitigation counseling capacity of 
        counseling intermediaries through NRC training courses with HUD- 
        or NRC-approved counseling intermediaries and their partners, 
        except that private financial institutions that participate in 
        NRC training shall pay market rates for such training.
            (7) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to 4 percent may be used for associated administrative 
        expenses for the NRC to carry out activities provided under this 
        section.
            (8) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance may include a 
        budget for outreach and advertising, as determined by the NRC.

[[Page 121 STAT. 2443]]

            (9) <<NOTE: Reports. Deadline.>> The NRC shall report bi-
        annually to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations as 
        well as the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial 
        Services Committee on its efforts to mitigate mortgage default. 
        Such reports shall identify successful strategies and methods 
        for preserving homeownership and the long-term affordability of 
        at-risk mortgages and shall include recommended efforts that 
        will or likely can assist in the success of this program as well 
        as an analysis of any policy and procedures that failed to 
        result in successful mortgage foreclosure mitigation. The report 
        shall include an analysis of the details and use of any post 
        mitigation counseling of assisted borrowers designed to ensure 
        the continued long-term affordability of the mortgages which 
        were the subject of the mortgage foreclosure mitigation 
        assistance.
