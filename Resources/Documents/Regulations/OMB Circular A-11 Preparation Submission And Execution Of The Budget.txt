MEMORANDUM FOR USERS OF OMB CIRCULAR NO. A-11 

FROM: Hee Jun 
Chief, Budget Concepts Branch 
SUBJECT: Revisions to OMB Circular No. A-11 dated June 28, 2019 

We have updated the electronic version of OMB Circular No. A-11 to reflect some technical revisions. 

The revised guidance: 

• 
Adds a reference to Executive Order 13893, “Increasing Government Accountability for 
Administrative Actions by Reinvigorating Administrative PAYGO,” which was released in 
October 2019 and OMB Memorandum M-20-06 (section 31.3). 
• 
Removes the prohibition on effectuating recurring discretionary changes in mandatory programs 
(“CHIMPs”) on an apportionment during a continuing resolution to make Circular A-11 
consistent with guidance in OMB CR Bulletin 19-04 (section 120.60). 
• 
Updates the Federal Sustainability Appendix to be consistent with Executive Order 13834, 
“Efficient Federal Operations,” which was released in May 2018 to direct Federal agencies to 
meet statutory requirements in a manner that increases efficiency, optimizes performance, 
eliminates unnecessary use of resources, and protects the environment (Appendix 10 of Capital 
Programming Guide). 
The updated Circular is available at the following internet address:

REVISED 
Transmittal Memorandum No. 93

SUBJECT: Preparing, Submitting, and Executing the Budget 

0MB Circular No. A-11 provides guidance on preparing the FY 2021 Budget and 
instructions 
on budget execution. 

Your budget submission to 0MB should build on the President's commitment to advance 
the 
vision of a Federal Government that spends taxpayer dollars more efficiently and 
effectively 
and to provide necessary services in support of key National priorities while 
reducing deficits . 
0MB looks forward to working closely with you in the 
coming 
months to develop a budget 
request that supports the President's vision. 

Most of the changes in this update 
are technical revisions and clarifications, 
and the 
policy requirements are largely unchanged. The summary of changes 
to the 
Circular highlights 
the 
changes made since last year. This Circular supersedes all previous versions.

GUIDE TO OMB CIRCULAR NO. A–11 

What is the purpose of the Circular? 

Part 1: Provides an overview of the budget process. It discusses the basic laws that regulate the budget 
process and the terms and concepts you need to know to understand the budget process and this Circular. 
(Sections numbered 10 through 22) 

Part 2: Covers development of the President's Budget and tells you how to prepare and submit materials 
required for OMB and Presidential review of agency requests and for formulation of the FY 2021 Budget, 
including development and submission of performance budgets for FY 2021. A significant portion of this 
part focuses on the preparation of the Budget Appendix and the related database. Detailed instructions for 
a number of requirements not directly related to the preparation and production of the budget are accessible 
through electronic links that are provided in section 25. (Sections numbered 25 through 95) 

Part 3: Discusses sequestration, supplementals and amendments, deferrals and Presidential proposals to 
rescind or cancel funds, and investments. (Sections numbered 100 through 113) 

Part 4: Provides instructions on budget execution, including guidance on the apportionment and 
reapportionment process, a report on budget execution and budgetary resources (SF 133), and a checklist 
for fund control regulations. (Sections numbered 120 through 150) 

Part 5: Covers Federal credit programs, including requirements related to the preparation of budget 
estimates and to budget execution. (Section number 185) 

Part 6: Describes requirements under GPRA Modernization Act, the Program Management Improvement 
Accountability Act, and the Administration's approach to performance management and program/project 
management including a) requirements for agency strategic plans, annual performance plans and reports on 
a central website; b) Agency Priority Goals and Cross-Agency Priority Goals; c) reviews of agency 
performance and portfolios of programs; d) program and project management; e) managing customer 
experience and improving service delivery; and f) elimination of unnecessary agency plans and reports. 
(Sections numbered 200 through 290) 

Part 7: Contains supplementary materials. (Appendices numbered A through K and the Capital 
Programming Guide) 

How do I find information in the Circular? 

The Circular groups related requirements together and presents requirements chronologically, where 
appropriate (e.g., instructions related to budget formulation are included in Part 2, and instructions related 
to budget execution are included in Part 4). 

The information in each part is divided into chapters and, in some cases, subchapters. The chapters are 
organized into a series of sections that consist of consecutively numbered subsections. Section numbers 
are not repeated between parts. We reserved certain section numbers for future use, so there are gaps in the 
numbering scheme. Page numbers identify the section number and page within that section. 

At the beginning of the Circular, there is a table of contents that identifies all the parts, chapters, sections 
and associated page numbers. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page xxiii 


PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION 
Guide to OMB Circular No. A–11 OF BUDGET ESTIMATES 

There is also a table of contents at the beginning of each section that identifies the subsections and exhibits 
contained in that section. We summarize major changes in policies and requirements at the beginning of 
the Circular. In addition, we describe the changes that affect each section at the beginning of that section 
and use vertical revision bars in the margins to highlight new requirements and significant changes. At the 
end of the Circular, there is an index. 

OMB circulars, memoranda, and bulletins, including Circular No. A–11, are available for viewing or 
downloading at the following address:

Presidential Executive Orders are available for viewing or downloading at the following address: 

http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/numeric-executive-orders.html 

The Circular contains a number of hyperlinks that link the various parts of A–11 with each other and other 
websites. 

Normally, A–11 is fully revised annually. In addition, the guidance is usually updated in the fall to reflect 
changes and clarifications since the full revision. 

What agencies are covered by the Circular? 

This Circular applies to all Executive departments and establishments. In addition, some of the 
requirements apply to the Legislative and Judicial Branches, to the District of Columbia, and to 
Government-sponsored enterprises. 

If you want an exception to the requirements in this Circular, you must get OMB approval in advance (see 
section 25.2). 

What common conventions does this Circular use? 

When the Circular refers to a specific year, assume it is a calendar year unless otherwise noted. The 
following phrases and abbreviations are used to identify specific fiscal years: 

Fiscal Year Description 
Past year – 1 (PY–1) The fiscal year immediately preceding the past year. 
Past year (PY) The fiscal year immediately preceding the current year; the last 
completed fiscal year. 
Current year (CY) The fiscal year immediately preceding the budget year. 
Budget year (BY) The next fiscal year for which estimates are submitted. 
Budget year + 1 (BY+1) through budget year The fiscal year following the budget year through the ninth fiscal

10.1 What is the budget? 
In this Circular, the term budget means the President's Budget—The Budget of the United States 
Government. The budget consists of several volumes that set forth the President's financial proposal with 
recommended priorities for allocating resources. The main Budget volume contains the President's Budget 
message and other broad statements of policy. The Appendix contains detailed information by agency, 
bureau or program group, budget accounts, programs, and activities. Other volumes, such as Analytical 
Perspectives and Historical Tables, provide complementary views of the budget. Most of the information 
contained in the budget is, or is based on, information you submit for your agency and programs in response 
to this Circular. 

The term "budget" can mean other things in other contexts. It often refers to the full receipt and outlay 
proposals rather than the volumes in which these amounts are published. Some people refer collectively to 
the budget resolution and revenue and spending bills that the Congress passes, which we describe below, 
as the "congressional budget." Ultimately, the Congress and the President enact many laws that control the 
Government's receipts and spending, which we sometimes refer to collectively as the budget, as in "enacting 
the budget." 

This section provides a broad overview of the budget process. You can read more about the budget process 
in the section of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the most recent budget, "Budget Concepts and 
Budget Process." To view or download budget documents, go to the budget website: 

https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/ 

10.2 What is the legal requirement to prepare the budget? 
The Budget and Accounting Act requires the President to submit a budget (see section 15.2). The President 
formally transmits his proposals for allocating resources to the Congress through the budget. The Congress 
considers the recommendations and uses the information included in the budget as it drafts and passes laws 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 10 


SECTION 10—OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PROCESS 

that affect spending and receipts. Through this process the Government decides how much money to spend, 
what to spend it on, and how to raise the money it has decided to spend. 

10.3 What kinds of information does the budget provide? 
The budget focuses primarily on the budget year—the upcoming fiscal year for which the Congress needs 
to make appropriations. However, it includes data for the most recently completed year, the current year, 
and nine years following the budget year (outyears) in order to reflect the effect of budget decisions over 
the longer term. In addition to proposed appropriations for the budget year, the budget may include 
proposed changes to appropriations for the current year (supplementals and rescissions), and legislative 
proposals that would affect the current year, the budget year, or the outyears. 

The budget provides actual or estimated data (stated in millions or billions of dollars, depending on the 
context) for the following: 

• 
The amount by account that each agency may obligate the Government to pay (budget authority) 
and estimates of payments (outlays) by agency and account; 
• 
The amount of receipts each agency collects from various sources; 
• 
Budget authority, outlays, and receipts by major function of the Government, such as national 
defense; (This is why we assign each budget account a functional classification code(s).) 
• 
Total budget authority, outlays, and receipts for the Government; and 
• 
The actual or estimated surplus (when receipts exceed outlays) or deficit (when outlays exceed 
receipts). 
The budget divides the Government totals for budget authority, outlays, and receipts into "on-budget" 
amounts and "off-budget" amounts. The off-budget amounts include the transactions of the Social Security 
trust funds and the Postal Service, which are excluded by law from the on-budget totals. 

The budget arrays data in many different ways. For example, one section of the budget focuses solely on 
Federal investment spending. Also, while the budget focuses primarily on dollars, it also includes data on 
other resources, such as Federal employment levels. 

10.4 Which agencies does the budget cover? 
The budget covers the agencies of all three branches of Government—Executive, Legislative, and 
Judicial—and provides information on Government-sponsored enterprises. In accordance with law or 
established practice, OMB includes information on agencies of the Legislative Branch, the Judicial Branch, 
and certain Executive Branch agencies as submitted by those agencies without change. By longstanding 
practice, the budget presents information about the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System but 
does not include amounts for the Board in the budget totals, even though it is a Government agency, because 
of the independent status of the System. The budget includes information about the Government-sponsored 
enterprises, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), but does not include them in 
the budget totals because they are privately owned. (Section 25 discusses the applicability of Part 2 of this 
Circular to various agencies.) 

The budget also includes the estimated budgetary effects of certain entities that may not report to the 
Department of Treasury. In such cases, the included activities are considered budgetary and occur because 
of authorities conferred or control exerted by the Government. For more information on capturing the full

SECTION 10—OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PROCESS 

effect of governmental activity in the Budget, see Chapter 10, Coverage of the Budget, in the Analytical 
Perspectives volume of the Budget. 

10.5 What happens during the Federal budget process and when? 
The budget process occurs in three main phases: 

• 
Formulation. During this phase, the Executive Branch prepares the President's Budget. OMB and 
the Federal agencies begin preparing the next budget almost as soon as the President has sent the 
last one to the Congress. OMB officially starts the process by sending planning guidance to 
Executive Branch agencies in the spring. The President completes this phase by sending the budget 
to the Congress on the first Monday in February, as specified in law, although occasionally 
Presidents have sent it later for various reasons. For example, in a year with a transition between 
outgoing and incoming Administrations, the timing of the President's Budget transmittal changes. 
• 
Congressional. This phase starts in late January or February, when the Congress receives the 
President's Budget. The Congress does not vote on the President's Budget itself, and it does not 
enact a budget of its own, as such. It considers the President's Budget proposals, passes an overall 
revenue and spending plan called a "budget resolution," and enacts the regular appropriations acts 
and other laws that control spending and receipts. 
• 
Execution. This phase lasts for at least five fiscal years and includes two parts. 
• 
The apportionment part pertains to funds appropriated for that fiscal year and to balances of 
appropriations made in prior years that remain available for obligation. At the beginning of the 
fiscal year, and at such other times as necessary, OMB apportions funds—that is, specifies the 
amount of funds that an agency may use by time period, program, project, or activity—to 
Executive Branch agencies. Throughout the year, agencies hire people, enter into contracts, and 
enter into grant agreements, etc., in order to carry out their programs, projects, and activities. 
These actions use up the available funds by obligating the Federal Government to make outlays, 
immediately or in the future. 
• 
The reporting and outlay part lasts until funds are canceled (one-year and multiple-year funds 
are canceled at the end of the fifth year after the funds expire for new obligations) or until funds 
are totally disbursed (for no-year funds). Note: the canceled phase of annual and multi-year 
authority (see section 20.4(c)) or cancellations of budgetary resources in no-year accounts 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1555 should not be confused with cancellations as a type of reduction (see 
section 20.4(i)). 
The following tables highlight the major events in each of the phases of the budget process. These tables 
show the planned timing or, when applicable, the timing specified in law. The actual timing may vary from 
the plan. For example, the Congress frequently does not enact all appropriations acts by the start of the 
fiscal year, and on several occasions the President has submitted the budget later than specified for various 
reasons, including late enactment of appropriations for the previous fiscal year or a change in 
Administrations. Since budget cycles overlap, we must begin the next cycle before completing the last one.

SECTION 10—OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PROCESS 

MAJOR STEPS IN THE FORMULATION PHASE 

What happens? When? 
OMB issues spring planning guidance to Executive Branch agencies for the upcoming 
budget. The OMB Director issues a letter to the head of each agency providing policy 
guidance for the agency's budget request. Absent more specific guidance, the outyear 
estimates included in the previous budget serve as a starting point for the next budget. 
This begins the process of formulating the budget the President will submit the 
following February. 
Spring 

OMB and the Executive Branch agencies discuss budget issues and options. OMB Spring and Summer 
works with the agencies to: 

• 
Identify major issues for the upcoming budget; 
• 
Develop and analyze options for the upcoming fall review; and 
• 
Plan for the analysis of issues that will need decisions in the future. 
OMB issues Circular No. A–11 to all Federal agencies. This Circular provides detailed June 
instructions for submitting budget data and materials. 

Executive Branch agencies (except those not subject to Executive Branch review) September* 
make budget submissions. See section 25. 

Fiscal year begins. The just completed budget cycle focused on this fiscal year. It was October 1 
the "budget year" in that cycle and is the "current year" in this cycle. 

OMB conducts its fall review. OMB staff analyzes agency budget proposals in light of October–November 
Presidential priorities, program performance, and budget constraints. They raise issues 
and present options to the Director and other OMB policy officials for their decisions. 

OMB opens the MAX A-11 Data Entry (MAX) application for all agencies to submit November 
their past year budget data. 

OMB briefs the President and senior advisors on proposed budget policies. The OMB Late November 
Director recommends a complete set of budget proposals to the President after OMB 
has reviewed all agency requests and considered overall budget policies. 

Passback. OMB usually informs all Executive Branch agencies at the same time about Late November 
the decisions on their budget requests. 

All agencies, including Legislative and Judicial Branch agencies, enter all MAX Late November to 
budget schedule data and text materials. This process continues until OMB must early January * 
"lock" agencies out of the database in order to meet the printing deadline. 

Executive Branch agencies may appeal to OMB and the President. An agency head December * 
may ask OMB to reverse or modify certain decisions. In most cases, OMB and the 
agency head resolve such issues and, if not, work together to present them to the 
President for a decision. 

Agencies prepare and OMB reviews congressional budget justification materials. January 
Agencies prepare the budget justification materials they need to explain their budget 
requests to the responsible congressional subcommittees. 

President transmits the budget to the Congress. First Monday in 
February 

*OMB provides specific deadlines for this activity.

Agencies continue to record obligations and outlays pursuant to administrative control 
of funds procedures, report to Treasury, and prepare financial statements. 
10.6 What is the Mid-Session Review? 

The law requires the President to send a report to the Congress updating budget estimates on or before July 
15th. This report contains revised budget estimates resulting from changes in economic assumptions, 
technical reestimates, Presidential initiatives, and completed congressional actions that have occurred since 
transmittal of the budget. Your OMB representative will provide guidance on the development of these 
estimates at the appropriate time. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 5 of Section 10 


SECTION 10—OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PROCESS 

10.7 What are the central financial agencies? 
The central financial agencies are: 

• 
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in the Executive Office of the President; 
• 
The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service); 
• 
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in the Legislative Branch; and 
• 
The Government Accountability Office (GAO), in the Legislative Branch. 
10.8 What are the responsibilities and functions of OMB? 
OMB's predominant mission is to assist the President in overseeing the preparation of the President’s 
Budget and to supervise its administration by the Executive Branch agencies. OMB evaluates the 
effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures, assesses competing funding demands among 
agencies, and sets funding priorities. OMB ensures that agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed 
legislation are consistent with the President's Budget and with Administration policies. 

In addition, OMB oversees and coordinates the Administration's procurement, financial management, and 
information and regulatory policies. In each of these areas, OMB's primary role is to improve 
administrative management, develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms, and 
reduce any unnecessary burdens on the public. 

For further information, refer to the OMB web site. 

10.9 What are the responsibilities and functions of the Treasury? 
Treasury, acting through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, gathers and publishes Government-wide financial 
information that is used by the public and private sectors to monitor the Government's financial status and 
establish fiscal and monetary policies. These publications include: the Daily Treasury Statement; the 
Monthly Treasury Statement; the Treasury Bulletin; the Combined Statement; and the Financial Report of 
the U.S. Government. The Financial Report of the U.S. Government is the Federal Government's set of 
audited financial statements, a requirement of the Government Management and Reform Act of 1994. 

For further information, refer to the Fiscal Service web site. 

10.10 What are the responsibilities and functions of CBO? 
CBO was created by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. CBO's mission is 
to provide the Congress with the objective, timely, non-partisan analyses needed for economic and budget 
decisions and with the information and estimates required for the congressional budget process. CBO 
prepares analyses and estimates relating to the budget and the economy and presents options and 
alternatives for the Congress to consider but does not make recommendations on policy. CBO’s services 
can be grouped into four categories: helping the Congress formulate a budget plan; helping it stay within 
that plan; helping it assess the impact of Federal mandates; and helping it consider issues related to the 
budget and economic policy. 

For further information, refer to the CBO web site.

SECTION 10—OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PROCESS 

10.11 What are the responsibilities and functions of GAO? 
GAO is the investigative arm of the Congress. GAO helps the Congress meet its Constitutional 
responsibilities and helps improve the performance and accountability of the Federal Government for the 
American people. GAO examines the use of public funds, evaluates Federal programs and activities, and 
provides analyses, options, recommendations, and other assistance to help the Congress make effective 
oversight, policy, and funding decisions. In this context, GAO works to continuously improve the 
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Federal Government through financial audits, program 
reviews and evaluations, analyses, legal opinions, investigations, and other services. GAO's activities are 
designed to ensure the Executive Branch's accountability to the Congress under the Constitution and the 
Government's accountability to the American people. GAO is dedicated to good government through its 
commitment to the core values of accountability, integrity, and reliability. 

For further information, refer to the GAO web site. 

10.12 How do OMB, CBO, the Fiscal Service, and GAO responsibilities overlap? 
Here are a few examples: 

• 
After OMB submits the President's Budget, CBO is responsible for re-estimating the budget. 
• 
Both OMB and CBO score the costs of legislation (both appropriations and direct spending included 
in authorization bills). While Budget Committees have the ultimate responsibility for determining 
the scoring effects of legislation for Congressional enforcement, they typically rely on CBO 
estimates during congressional consideration of individual bills to ensure that they are consistent 
with the budget resolution totals. The President uses OMB estimates to determine the costs of 
budget-related legislation. OMB reconciles or explains differences between the two sets of 
discretionary estimates. 
• 
OMB and Fiscal Service work together to establish any new Treasury accounts, both during the 
preparation of the Budget and after bills become laws. 
• 
OMB provides its scoring to Fiscal Service to assist in Fiscal Service’s responsibility to prepare 
warrants. 
• 
OMB and Fiscal Service work together to estimate actual outlays during the course of a year. 
• 
Fiscal Service gathers financial information through the Government-wide Treasury Account 
Symbol Adjusted Trail Balance System (GTAS), that allows agencies to submit one set of 
accounting data (mostly budgetary, some proprietary) that fulfills the needs of the SF 133 Report 
on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, the Fiscal Service 2108 Year-End Closing 
Statement, and the prior-year column of the Program and Financing schedule in the President's 
Budget. 
• 
OMB and Fiscal Service worked together to develop the GTAS systems. Fiscal Service develops 
U.S. Standard General Ledger guidance to comply with OMB definitions. 
• 
Both Fiscal Service and GAO provide guidelines used by financial managers as they account for 
Federal finances. 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 7 of Section 10

15.1 What laws govern the budget cycle? 
15.2 Why is the Budget and Accounting Act important? 
15.3 How does the Congress enact the budget and how is the budget enforced? 
15.4 What laws govern the budget execution process when funds are actually spent? 
15.5 What does the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 require? 
15.6 What do I need to know about the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990? 

15.1 What laws govern the budget cycle? 
The Federal budget cycle can be divided into three distinct phases that are generally sequential and yet 
intertwined. The first phase, which culminates in the transmittal of the President's Budget proposals to the 
Congress, is called the budget formulation phase. In the next phase, the Congress acts upon laws that 
together constitute the enacted budget. Once the laws have been enacted, executive agencies carry out the 
laws in the budget execution phase. The Federal budget cycle is governed mainly by the following laws, 
which we describe below: 

• 
Budget and Accounting Act. 
• 
Congressional Budget Act. 
• 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as amended (BBEDCA). 
• 
Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act. 
• 
Antideficiency Act. 
• 
Impoundment Control Act. 
• 
GPRA Modernization Act (formerly Government Performance and Results Act). 
• 
Federal Credit Reform Act. 
15.2 Why is the Budget and Accounting Act important? 
Before enactment of this law in 1921, there was no annual centralized budgeting in the Executive Branch. 
Federal Government agencies usually sent budget requests independently to congressional committees with 
no coordination of the various requests in formulating the Federal Government's budget. The Budget and 
Accounting Act required the President to coordinate the budget requests for all Government agencies and 
to send a comprehensive budget to the Congress. It created the Bureau of the Budget, now the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), to help the President implement these requirements. It also required the 
President to include certain information in the budget. The Congress has amended the requirements many 
times and has codified them as Chapter 11, Title 31, U.S. Code. These are some of the requirements: 

• 
"On or after the first Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year, 
the President shall submit a budget of the United States Government for the following fiscal year." 
• 
"Each budget shall include a budget message and summary and supporting information. The 
President shall include in each budget the following...." The provision goes on to list about thirty 
items, such as expenditures and receipts for the past year through the fourth year following the 
budget year, information on debt, financial information, and information on employment levels. 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 15 


SECTION 15—BASIC BUDGET LAWS 

• 
"Under regulations prescribed by the President, each agency shall provide information required by 
the President in carrying out this chapter. The President has access to, and may inspect, records of 
an agency to obtain information." 
• 
"Estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations for the legislative branch and the judicial 
branch...shall be submitted to the President before October 16 of each year and included in the 
budget by the President without change." 
15.3 How does the Congress enact the budget and how is the budget enforced? 
The Congress does not enact a budget, as such. The Congress reviews the President's Budget and develops 
its budget by approving three distinct kinds of measures: 

• 
The Congress adopts a concurrent resolution in the spring that specifies total receipts and outlays 
and major categories of spending. 
• 
Next, legislation authorizing changes in direct spending programs and in taxes are enacted consistent 
with the budget resolution. 
• 
Finally, the Congress enacts discretionary appropriations in the regular appropriations bills for the 
upcoming fiscal year. 
The current congressional budget process was established by the enactment of the Congressional Budget 
Act (CBA). Before the CBA, which was enacted in 1974, there was no annual centralized budgeting in the 
legislative branch. Each of the regular annual appropriations bills was acted on separately by the Congress 
and changes in taxes were authorized in another process. In addition, there was no established process to 
add up the total receipts and total spending in all the bills to reach the Federal Government's bottom line, 
whether it was a surplus or a deficit. 

The CBA established the concurrent resolution on the budget, also known as the budget resolution, the 
House and Senate Budget Committees, the Congressional Budget Office, and procedures for relating 
individual appropriation actions to the budget totals. Also, the CBA defines some key budget terms, such 
as budget authority, that are used in all phases of the President's Budget formulation process and the 
congressional budget process. 

The CBA was amended extensively by a series of laws. BBEDCA, one of these amendments, had as its 
central feature a series of declining deficit targets. BBEDCA was amended by the Budget Enforcement 
Act, which applied a statutory pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) process to direct spending and revenue legislation 
and discretionary spending limits to annual appropriations acts. The statutory PAYGO process and 
discretionary spending limits expired in 2002. Recently enacted laws, however, have reinstated the 
statutory budget enforcement mechanisms for mandatory spending and revenues and discretionary 
spending. 

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 established a statutory procedure to enforce a rule of deficit 
neutrality on new revenue and mandatory spending legislation. The law requires that new legislation 
changing revenues or mandatory expenditures, taken cumulatively, must not increase projected deficits. If 
such legislation does increase projected deficits, the law requires automatic across-the-board cuts, known 
as sequestration, in non-exempt mandatory programs. BBEDCA specifies limits ("caps") on the amount of 
discretionary budget authority that can be provided through the annual appropriations process for 2012 

Page 2 of Section 15 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 15—BASIC BUDGET LAWS 

through 2021. If the amount of appropriations provided in appropriations acts for a given year exceeds the 
caps, the law requires the President to cancel discretionary budgetary resources in non-exempt accounts by 
the excess amount. 

Section 21 provides more information on the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act and BBEDCA and their 
enforcement mechanisms. 

15.4 What laws govern the budget execution process when funds are actually spent? 
Chapters 13, 15, and 33 of Title 31, United States Code, govern the process of budget execution. Among 
these, the major laws are the Antideficiency Act, the Impoundment Control Act, the provisions known as 
the Economy Act which are found in section 1535, the provisions that govern the closing of accounts which 
are found in sections 1551 through 1555, and provisions of the "Miscellaneous Receipts Act," which is 
found in section 3302. 

The Antideficiency Act requires OMB to apportion the accounts and to monitor spending; prohibits 
agencies from spending more than the amounts appropriated or apportioned, whichever is lower; requires 
that agencies control their spending; and provides penalties for overspending. 

Specifically, agencies may not: 

• 
Purchase services and merchandise before appropriations are enacted and accounts are apportioned; 
• 
Enter into contracts that exceed the appropriation for the year or the amount apportioned by OMB, 
whichever is lower; or 
• 
Pay bills when there is no cash in the appropriation or fund account. 
The head of each agency is required to establish, by regulation, a system of administrative control of funds 
that: 

• 
Restricts obligation and expenditure (outlays or disbursements) from each account to the lower of 
the amount apportioned by OMB or the amount available for obligation and/or expenditure. 
• 
Enables the head of the agency to identify the person(s) responsible for violating the Act. 
There are administrative and criminal penalties for violating the Antideficiency Act. Also, the agency head 
is required to report any violations to the President, through the OMB Director; to the Congress; and to the 
Comptroller General. See section 145 for instructions on reporting violations. 

The Impoundment Control Act, which was enacted in 1974, requires that the President notify Congress 
whenever an official of the Executive Branch impounds (i.e. withholds) budget authority. There are two 
types of impoundments: the temporary deferral of funds and rescission proposals to permanently reduce 
spending. The Act also prescribes the rules that must be followed whenever the executive branch impounds 
funds. See section 112 for instructions on reporting deferrals and rescission proposals and the rules that 
must be followed.

SECTION 15—BASIC BUDGET LAWS 

15.5 What does the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 require? 
The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 updates the Federal Government's performance management 
framework, retaining and amplifying some aspects of the Government Performance and Results Act of 
1993 (GPRA) while also addressing some of its weaknesses. The GPRA in 1993 had established strategic 
planning, performance planning, and reporting as a framework for agencies to communicate progress in 
achieving their missions. The GPRA Modernization Act establishes some important changes to existing 
requirements that move toward a more useful approach to performance planning and reporting on a central 
website. The GPRA Modernization Act serves as a foundation for helping agencies to focus on their highest 
priorities and creating a culture where data and empirical evidence play a greater role in policy, budget, and 
management decisions. A central program inventory, also required by the Act, has the potential to facilitate 
coordination across programs by making it easier to find programs that can contribute to a shared goal, as 
well as improve public understanding about what Federal programs do. 

15.6 What do I need to know about the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990? 
This law governs Federal credit programs—ones that make direct loans and loan guarantees. The Act 
(FCRA) prescribes a special budget treatment for direct loans and loan guarantees that measures the net 
present value of cash flows to and from the Government, i.e., subsidy cost, rather than budgeting for credit 
programs on a cash basis. For most credit programs, the Congress must provide budget authority equal to 
the subsidy cost in annual appropriations acts before the program can make direct loans or loan guarantees. 
Section 185 of this Circular addresses the requirements of this law, which was enacted as an amendment of 
Title V of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

performance plans, and annual program performance reports. 
20.3 What special terms must I know? 
Advance appropriation means appropriations of new budget authority that become available one or more 
fiscal years beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation act was passed. (See section 20.4(c).) 

Advance funding means appropriations of budget authority provided in an appropriations act to be used, 
if necessary, to cover obligations incurred late in the fiscal year for benefit payments in excess of the amount 
specifically appropriated in the act for that year, where the budget authority is charged to the appropriation 
for the program for the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the appropriations act is passed. (See 
section 20.4(c).) 

Agency means a department or establishment of the Government for the purposes of this Circular. 
(Compare to bureau.) 

Allowance means a lump-sum included in the budget to represent certain transactions that are expected to 
increase or decrease budget authority, outlays, or receipts but that are not, for various reasons, reflected in 
the program details. For example, the budget might include an allowance to show the effect on the budget 
totals of a proposal that would affect many accounts by relatively small amounts, in order to avoid 
unnecessary detail in the presentations for the individual accounts. The President doesn't propose that 
Congress enact an allowance as such, but rather that it modify specific legislative measures as necessary to 
produce the increases or decreases represented by the allowance. 

Amendment means a proposed action that revises the President's budget request and is transmitted prior to 
completion of action on the budget request by the Appropriations Committees of both Houses of Congress. 
(See section 110.2.) 

Apportionment is a plan, approved by OMB, to spend resources provided by one of the annual 
appropriations acts, a supplemental appropriations act, a continuing resolution, or a permanent law 
(mandatory appropriations). Resources are apportioned by Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol (TAFS). 
The apportionment identifies amounts available for obligation and expenditure. It specifies and limits the 
obligations that may be incurred and expenditures made (or makes other limitations, as appropriate) for 
specified time periods, programs, activities, projects, objects, or any combination thereof. An apportioned 

Page 2 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

amount may be further subdivided by an agency into allotments, suballotments, and allocations. (See 
Appendix H.) 

Appropriated entitlement—See entitlement. 

Appropriation means a provision of law (not necessarily in an appropriations act) authorizing the 
expenditure of funds for a given purpose. Usually, but not always, an appropriation provides budget 
authority. (See section 20.4.) 

Appropriation account—See Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol. 

Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) refers to legislation that 
shaped the budget process, first by setting fixed targets for annual deficits and then by replacing those with 
a Pay-As-You-Go requirement for new tax or mandatory spending legislation and with caps on annual 
discretionary funding. Most of these requirements expired in 2002. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 
2010, which did not amend BBEDCA, reinstated a statutory pay-as-you-go rule for revenues and mandatory 
spending legislation. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which amended BBEDCA, reinstated 
discretionary caps on budget authority. (See section 21.3.) 

Balances of budget authority means the amounts of budget authority provided in previous years that have 
not been outlayed. 

Baseline means a projection of the estimated receipts, outlays, and deficit or surplus that would result from 
continuing current law or current policies through the period covered by the budget. (See section 80.) 

Borrowing authority is a type of budget authority that permits obligations and outlays to be financed by 
borrowing. (See section 20.4(b).) 

Budget means the Budget of the United States Government, which sets forth the President's comprehensive 
financial plan and indicates the President's priorities for the Federal Government. (See section 10.1.) 

Budget authority (BA) means the authority provided by law to incur financial obligations that will result 
in outlays. The specific forms of budget authority are appropriations, borrowing authority, contract 
authority, and spending authority from offsetting collections. (See section 20.4.) 

Budget Control Act of 2011 refers to legislation that, among other things, amended BBEDCA to reinstate 
discretionary spending limits on budget authority through 2021 and restored the process for enforcing those 
spending limits; increased the statutory debt ceiling; and established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit 
Reduction that was instructed to develop a bill to reduce the Federal deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over a 
10-year period. It also provided a process to implement alternative spending reductions in the event that 
legislation achieving at least $1.2 trillion of deficit reduction was not enacted. (See section 21.3.) 

Budget totals means the totals included in the budget for budget authority, outlays, receipts, and the surplus 
or the deficit. Some presentations in the budget distinguish on-budget totals from off-budget totals. On-
budget totals reflect the transactions of all Federal Government entities, except those excluded from the 
budget totals by law. Off-budget totals reflect the transactions of Government entities that are excluded 
from the on-budget totals by law. Under current law, the off-budget totals include the Social Security trust 
funds and the Postal Service. The budget combines the on-and off-budget totals to derive unified (i.e. 
consolidated) totals for Federal activity. 

Budget year (BY) refers to the fiscal year for which the budget is being considered, that is, with respect to 
a session of Congress, the fiscal year of the Government that starts on October 1 of the calendar year in 
which that session of Congress begins. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 3 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Budgetary resources mean amounts available to incur obligations in a given year. Budgetary resources 
consist of new budget authority and unobligated balances of budget authority provided in previous years. 

Bureau means the principal subordinate organizational units of an agency. 

Cancellation means a proposal by the President to reduce budget resources (new budget authority or 
unobligated balances of budget authority) that is not subject to the requirements of Title X of the 
Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Resources that are proposed by the President 
for cancellation cannot be withheld from obligation pending Congressional action on the proposal. The 
term is sometimes used more broadly to refer to any legislative action taken by the Congress to reduce 
budgetary resources, including rescissions proposed by the President. Cancellations can either be 
temporary or permanent. (See section 20.4(i).) 

Cancellations as a type of reduction should not be confused with the canceled phase of annual and multi-
year authority (see section 20.4(c)) or cancellations of budgetary resources in no-year accounts pursuant to 
31 U.S.C. 1555 (See Appendix F). 

Cap means the legal limits for each fiscal year under BBEDCA on the budget authority and outlays (only 
if applicable) provided by discretionary appropriations. 

Cap adjustment means either an increase or a decrease that is permitted to the statutory cap limits for each 
fiscal year under BBEDCA on the budget authority and outlays (only if applicable) provided by 
discretionary appropriations only if certain conditions are met. These conditions may include providing for 
a base level of funding, a designation of funds by the Congress (and in some circumstances, the President), 
or a change in concepts and definitions of funding under the cap. Changes in concepts and definitions 
require consultation with the Congressional Appropriations and Budget Committees. 

Cash equivalent transaction means a transaction in which the Government makes outlays or receives 
collections in a form other than cash or in which the outlays or receipts recorded in the budget differ from 
the cash because the cash does not accurately measure the value of the transaction. (See section 20.8.) 

CHIMP is an acronym for a "CHange (either a cost or a savings) In a Mandatory Program" that is proposed 
or enacted in an appropriations bill rather than in authorizing legislation. The term applies only to provisions 
in appropriations acts that change mandatory budget authority, outlays, offsetting collections, or offsetting 
receipts relative to the baseline. For the purposes of scoring those appropriations acts, such changes are 
scored as discretionary. After enactment, these changes are no longer considered discretionary, and they 
again become part of the mandatory baseline in the subsequent Budget. In the MAX budget database, 
proposed CHIMPs are separately identified with a specific budget enforcement subcategory classification 
known as a "discretionary change in a mandatory program" until they are enacted in full-year appropriations 
bills (see section 81.2). This classification only applies to policy estimates—not baseline estimates. 

Under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, the outlay effects of CHIMPs that alter mandatory budget 
authority in an outyear are classified as PAYGO (mandatory) impacts except when their net outlay 
effect is zero over a six-year period beginning with the current year. All changes in revenues in any year 
are classified as PAYGO, and are not scored as discretionary, even if they are included in an 
appropriations bill. 

Collections mean money collected by the Government that the budget records as a governmental receipt, 
an offsetting collection, or an offsetting receipt (see section 20.7). 

Page 4 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Contract authority is a type of budget authority that permits you to incur obligations in advance of an 
appropriation, offsetting collections, or receipts to make outlays to liquidate the obligations. Typically, the 
Congress provides contract authority in an authorizing statute to allow you to incur obligations in 
anticipation of the collection of receipts or offsetting collections that will be used to liquidate the 
obligations. (See section 20.4(b).) 

Cost means the price or cash value of the resources used to produce a program, project, or activity. This 
term is used in many different contexts. When used in connection with Federal credit programs, the term 
means the estimated long-term cost to the Government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, calculated on a 
net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts 
or outlays (see section 185). For specific instructions on estimating costs, refer to the pertinent OMB 
instructions: for cost principles for educational institutions, see Circular No. A–21; for estimating costs for 
user charges, see Circular No. A–25; for rental and construction costs of Government quarters, see Circular 
No. A–45; for allowable costs for audits, see Circular No. A–50; for cost estimates in performing 
commercial activities, see Circular No. A–76; and for cost principles for State, local, and Indian Tribal 
Governments, see Circular No. A–97. The term also refers to legislation or administrative actions that 
increase outlays or decrease savings. 

Credit program account means a budget account that receives and obligates appropriations to cover the 
subsidy cost of a direct loan or loan guarantee and disburses the subsidy amount to a financing account. 
(See section 185.) 

Current services estimates—See baseline. 

Deferral means any executive branch action or inaction that temporarily withholds, delays, or effectively 
precludes the obligation or expenditure of budgetary resources. The President reports deferrals to the 
Congress by special message. They are not identified separately in the budget. (See section 112.) 

Deficit means the amount by which outlays exceed receipts in a fiscal year. It may refer to the on-budget, 
off-budget, or unified budget deficit. (See budget totals.) 

Deposit fund means an account established to record amounts held temporarily by the Government until 
ownership is determined (for example, earnest money paid by bidders for mineral leases) or held by the 
Government as an agent for others (for example, State and local income taxes withheld from Federal 
employees' salaries and not yet paid to the State or local government). (See section 20.11.) 

Direct loan means a disbursement of funds by the Government to a non-Federal borrower under a contract 
that requires the repayment of such funds with or without interest. The term also includes certain equivalent 
transactions that extend credit. (See section 185.) (Compare to loan guarantee.) 

Direct spending—See mandatory spending. 

Disaster funding means a discretionary appropriation that is enacted that the Congress designates as being 
for disaster relief. Such an appropriation results in a cap adjustment to the limits on discretionary spending 
under BBEDCA. The total adjustment for this purpose cannot exceed a ceiling for a particular year that is 
defined as the total of the average funding provided for disaster relief over the previous 10 years (excluding 
the highest and lowest years) and the unused amount of the prior year's ceiling (excluding the portion of 
the prior year's ceiling that was itself due to any unused amount from the year before). Disaster relief is 
defined as activities carried out pursuant to a determination under section 102(2) of the Robert T. Stafford 
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. 

Discretionary spending means budgetary resources (except those provided to fund mandatory spending 
programs) provided in appropriations acts. (See section 21.3.) (Compare to mandatory spending.) 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 5 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Where obligation limitations set in appropriations acts limit permanent budget authority, except trust fund 
accounts in the Department of Transportation, we define the budget authority for the account as 
discretionary in an amount equal to the limit. For the Transportation trust funds, the budget authority 
remains mandatory, although the funds' outlays are discretionary. 

Emergency requirement means an amount that the Congress has designated as an emergency requirement 
in statute and, for discretionary appropriations, designated on an account by account basis. Such amounts 
are not included in the estimated budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation under the requirements of the 
Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, if they are mandatory or receipts. Such a discretionary 
appropriation that is subsequently designated by the President as an emergency requirement results in a cap 
adjustment to the limits on discretionary spending under BBEDCA. 

Entitlement refers to a program in which the Federal Government is legally obligated to make payments 
or provide aid to any person who, or State or local government that, meets the legal criteria for eligibility. 
Entitlements are generally provided by an authorizing statute, and can include loan and grant programs. 
Examples include benefit payments for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance, 
as well as grants to States for CHIP and TANF. Some programs, such as veteran's compensation, Medicaid, 
SSI, and Child Nutrition, are entitlements even though they are funded by appropriations acts because the 
authorizing statutes for the programs unconditionally obligate the United States to make payments. These 
are referred to as appropriated entitlements. (See mandatory spending, section 21.3.) 

Expenditure transfer—See transfers. 

Federal funds group refers to the moneys collected and spent by the Government through accounts other 
than those designated as trust funds. Federal funds include general, special, public enterprise, and 
intragovernmental funds. (See section 20.11.) (Compare to trust funds group.) 

Financing account means a non-budgetary account (an account whose transactions are excluded from the 
budget totals) that records all of the cash flows resulting from post-1991direct loan obligations or loan 
guarantee commitments. At least one financing account is associated with each credit program account. 
For programs that make both direct loans and loan guarantees, separate financing accounts are required for 
direct loan cash flows and for loan guarantee cash flows. (See section 185.) (Compare to liquidating 
account.) 

Fiscal year means the Government's accounting period. It begins on October 1 and ends on September 30, 
and is designated by the calendar year in which it ends. 

Forward funding means appropriations of budget authority that become available for obligation in the last 
quarter of the fiscal year for the financing of ongoing grant programs during the next fiscal year. (See 
section 20.4(c).) 

Full-time equivalent (FTE) employment is the basic measure of the levels of employment used in the 
budget. It is the total number of hours worked (or to be worked) divided by the number of compensable 
hours applicable to each fiscal year. (See section 85.) 

Functional classification means the array of budget authority, outlays, and other budget data according to 
the major purpose served—for example, agriculture, national defense, and transportation. 
(See section 79.3.) 

General fund means the accounts for collections not earmarked by law for a specific purpose, the proceeds 
of general borrowing, and the expenditure of these moneys. It is part of the Federal funds group. 

Page 6 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) mean private enterprises that were established and chartered 
by the Federal Government for public policy purposes. They are classified as non-budgetary and not 
included in the Federal budget because they are private companies, and their securities are not backed by 
the full faith and credit of the Federal Government. However, the budget presents statements of financial 
condition for certain Government sponsored enterprises such as the Federal National Mortgage Association. 
(Compare to off-budget.) 

Governmental receipts mean collections that result from the Government's exercise of its sovereign power 
to tax or otherwise compel payment. They are compared to outlays in calculating a surplus or deficit. 
Receipts and revenues are common terms used in place of governmental receipts. (See section 20.7.) 
(Compare to offsetting collections and offsetting receipts.) 

GTAS means the Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System. Agency 
staff uses this system to electronically submit the accounting data that: (a) support the SF 133 Report on 
Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, and (b) are used for much of the initial set of past year data in 
MAX schedule P. (See sections 82.15 and 130.2). This system replaced the Treasury Federal Agencies' 
Centralized Trial Balance System II (FACTS II). 

Impoundment means any executive action or inaction that temporarily or permanently withholds, delays, 
or precludes the obligation or expenditure of budgetary resources. 

Intragovernmental fund—See revolving fund. 

Liquidating account means a budget account that records all cash flows to and from the Government 
resulting from pre-1992 direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments. Unlike financing 
accounts, these accounts are included in the budget totals. (See section 185.) (Compare to financing 
account.) 

Loan guarantee means any guarantee, insurance, or other pledge with respect to the payment of all or a 
part of the principal or interest on any debt obligation of a non-Federal borrower to a non-Federal lender. 
The term does not include the insurance of deposits, shares, or other withdrawable accounts in financial 
institutions. (See section 185.) (Compare to direct loan.) 

Mandatory appropriation—See entitlement authority. 

Mandatory spending means spending controlled by laws other than appropriations acts (including 
spending for entitlement programs) and spending for the food stamp program. Although the Statutory Pay-
As-You-Go Act of 2010 uses the term direct spending to mean this, mandatory spending is commonly used 
instead. (See section 21.3.) (Compare to discretionary spending.) 

Means of financing refers to borrowing, the change in cash balances, and certain other transactions that 
are involved in financing a deficit. The term is also used to refer to the debt repayment, the change in cash 
balances, and certain other transactions involved in using a surplus. By definition, the means of financing 
are not treated as receipts or outlays and so are non-budgetary. (See section 20.7(h).) 

Nonbudgetary transactions means transactions of the Government that do not belong in the budget 
because they do not represent net budget authority or outlays, but rather are a means of financing (such as 
deposit funds, direct loan and loan guarantee financing accounts, and seigniorage). (Compare to off-budget 
and means of financing.) 

Non-expenditure transfer—See transfer. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 7 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Obligated balance means the cumulative amount of budget authority that has been obligated but not yet 
outlayed. As prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 1551, it is the amount of unliquidated obligations in an account less 
the amounts collectible as repayments to the account. In other words, it is unpaid obligations net of 
uncollected customer payments from Federal sources. (See section 20.4(g).) 

Obligation means a binding agreement that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future. Budgetary 
resources must be available before obligations can be incurred legally. (See section 20.5.) 

Obligation limitation means a type of budgetary resource appropriated to accounts in a manner similar to 
budget authority that limits the amount of contract authority already made available for obligation by 
another law. The obligation limitation is effectively the amount of new budget authority available for 
obligation for that period. Obligation limitations are used in certain Transportation programs. 

Off-budget refers to transactions of the Federal Government that would be treated as budgetary had 
Congress not designated them by statute as "off-budget." Currently, transactions of the Social Security 
trust funds and the Postal Service are the only sets of transactions that are so designated. The term is 
sometimes used more broadly to refer to the transactions of private enterprises that were established and 
sponsored by the Government, most especially "Government sponsored enterprises" such as the Federal 
Home Loan Banks. (Compare to on-budget.) 

Offsetting collections mean payments to the Government that, by law, are credited directly to expenditure 
accounts and deducted from gross budget authority and outlays of the expenditure account, rather than 
added to receipts. Usually, they are authorized to be spent for the purposes of the account without further 
action by Congress. They usually result from business-like transactions with the public, including payments 
from the public in exchange for goods and services, reimbursements for damages, and gifts or donations of 
money to the Government and from intragovernmental transactions with other Government accounts. The 
authority to spend offsetting collections is a form of budget authority. (See sections 20.4(b) and 20.7.) 
(Compare to governmental receipts and offsetting receipts.) 

Offsetting receipts mean payments to the Government that are credited to offsetting receipt accounts and 
deducted from gross budget authority and outlays, rather than added to receipts. Usually they are deducted 
at the level of the agency and subfunction, but in some cases they are deducted at the level of the government 
as a whole. They are not authorized to be credited to expenditure accounts. The legislation that authorizes 
the offsetting receipts may earmark them for a specific purpose and either appropriate them for expenditure 
for that purpose or require them to be appropriated in annual appropriations acts before they can be spent. 
Like offsetting collections, they usually result from business-like transactions with the public, including 
payments from the public in exchange for goods and services, reimbursements for damages, and gifts or 
donations of money to the Government, and from intragovernmental transactions with other Government 
accounts. (See section 20.7.) (Compare to governmental receipts and offsetting collections.) 

On-budget refers to all budgetary transactions other than those designated as off-budget. (Compare to off-
budget.) 

Outlay means a payment to liquidate an obligation (other than the repayment of debt principal or other 
disbursements that are "means of financing" transactions). Outlays generally are equal to cash 
disbursements but also are recorded for cash-equivalent transactions, such as the issuance of debentures to 
pay insurance claims, and in a few cases are recorded on an accrual basis such as interest on public issues 
of the public debt. Outlays are the measure of Government spending. (See section 20.6.) 

Outyear estimates mean estimates presented in the budget for the years beyond the budget year of budget 
authority, outlays, receipts, and other items (such as debt).

SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) means a discretionary 
appropriation that is enacted that the Congress and, subsequently, the President have so designated on an 
account by account basis. Such a discretionary appropriation that is designated as OCO/GWOT results in 
a cap adjustment to the limits on discretionary spending under BBEDCA. Funding for these purposes has 
most recently been associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) refers to the requirements of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 that 
result in a sequestration if the estimated combined result of new legislation affecting direct spending or 
revenue increases the on-budget deficit relative to the baseline, as of the end of a congressional session. 
(See section 21.3.) 

Public enterprise fund—See revolving fund. 

Reappropriation means an extension of the availability of unobligated balances of budget authority that 
have expired or would otherwise expire as a result of legislation enacted subsequent to the law that provided 
the budget authority. (See section 20.4(h), section 120.66.) 

Receipts—See governmental receipts or offsetting receipts. 

Reduction in budgetary resources means a rescission (see section 20.4(i)); cancellation (see section 
20.4(i)); across-the-board reduction; or sequestration (see section 100). 

Refund means the return of excess payments to or by the Government. (See section 20.9.) 

Reimbursable obligation means an obligation financed by offsetting collections credited to an expenditure 
account in payment for goods and services provided by that account. (See section 83.5.) 

Rescission means a proposal by the President to reduce budgetary resources (new budget authority or 
unobligated balances of budget authority) pursuant to the requirements of Title X of the Congressional 
Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Resources that are proposed by the President for rescission 
may be withheld from obligation for 45 calendar days of continuous session of the Congress (excluding an 
adjournment of more than three days on which either House is not in session) pending congressional action 
on the proposal. The term is often used more broadly to refer to any legislative action taken by the Congress 
to reduce budgetary resources, including reductions that were not proposed pursuant to the Impoundment 
Control Act. Rescissions can either be temporary or permanent. (See section 20.4(i).) 

Revolving fund means a fund that conducts continuing cycles of business-like activity, in which the fund 
charges for the sale of products or services and uses the proceeds to finance its spending, usually without 
requirement for annual appropriations. There are three types of revolving funds: Public enterprise funds, 
which conduct business-like operations mainly with the public, intragovernmental revolving funds, which 
conduct business-like operations mainly within and between Government agencies, and trust revolving 
funds, which conduct business-like operations mainly with the public and are designated by law as a trust 
fund. (See section 20.11) 

Scorekeeping means measuring the budget effects of legislation in terms of budget authority, governmental 
receipts, and outlays, for purposes of measuring adherence to the President's Budget, other budget targets, 
or budget enforcement laws. (See section 21.) 

Sequestration means the cancellation of budgetary resources. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 
requires such cancellations if revenue or direct spending legislation is enacted that, in total, increases 
projected deficits or reduces projected surpluses relative to the baseline. BBEDCA requires annual acrossthe-
board cancellations to selected mandatory programs through 2025 and would require cancellations if 
discretionary appropriations exceed the statutory limits on discretionary spending. (See section 100.) 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 9 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Special fund means a Federal fund account for receipts earmarked for specific purposes and the expenditure 
of these receipts. (See section 20.11.) 

Spending authority from offsetting collections is a type of budget authority that permits obligations and 
outlays to be financed by offsetting collections (see section 20.4(b)). (Compare to offsetting collections.) 

Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 refers to legislation that reinstated a statutory pay-as-you-go 
requirement for new tax or mandatory spending legislation. The law is a stand-alone piece of legislation 
that cross-references BBEDCA but does not directly amend that legislation. 

Subsidy means the estimated long-term cost to the Government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, 
calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on 
governmental receipts or outlays. (See section 185.) 

Supplemental appropriation means an appropriation enacted subsequent to a regular annual 
appropriations act, when the need for funds is too urgent to be postponed until the next regular annual 
appropriations act. (See section 110.2.) 

Surplus means the amount by which receipts exceed outlays in a fiscal year. It may refer to the on-budget, 
off-budget, or unified budget surplus. (See budget totals.) 

Third scorecard is sometimes used to refer to the effects of a mandatory or revenue proposal that are not 
subject to PAYGO (see sections 79.2 and 81.2 for more information on reporting these effects in MAX.) 

These non-PAYGO effects may include: 

• 
The PAYGO-exempt portions of mandatory or revenue proposals that require authorizing 
legislation, such as off-budget or emergency legislation; 
• 
The indirect effect of mandatory or revenue proposals, including proposals that require authorizing 
legislation, which are not subject to PAYGO. Indirect effects include the effects on interest; 
• 
The mandatory or revenue savings or costs that result from discretionary policies, such as the 
savings associated with an increased level of anti-fraud or enhanced compliance effort achieved by 
additional administrative or program management funding. 
Transfer means to move budgetary resources from one budget account to another. Depending on the 
circumstances, the budget may record a transfer as an expenditure transfer, which means a transfer that 
involves an outlay, or as a nonexpenditure transfer, which means a transfer that doesn't involve an outlay. 
(See section 20.4(j).) 

Transfer in the estimates means a proposal to stop funding an activity through one budget account and 
begin funding it through another account. A transfer in the estimates doesn't involve a transfer of budgetary 
resources between the accounts. (See section 20.4(k).) 

Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) refers to the account identification codes assigned by the Department 
of the Treasury to individual appropriation, receipt, or other fund accounts. All financial transactions of 
the Federal Government are classified by TAS for reporting to the Department of the Treasury and the 
Office of Management and Budget. TAS includes all the component pieces of Treasury Appropriation 
Fund Symbol plus any sub-accounts established by Treasury. 

Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol (TAFS) refers to the separate Treasury accounts for each 
appropriation title based on the availability of the resources in the account. The TAFS is a combination of 

Page 10 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Federal agency; allocation agency, when applicable; account symbol; and availability code (e.g., annual, 
multi-year, or no-year). (See section 20.4(c)). 

Trust fund refers to a type of account, designated by law as a trust fund, for receipts or offsetting receipts 
dedicated to specific purposes and the expenditure of these receipts. Some revolving funds are designated 
as trust funds, and these are called trust revolving funds. Trust revolving funds have no receipt account and 
the collections are credited directly to the expenditure account. (See section 20.11.) (Compare to special 
funds and revolving funds.) 

Trust funds group refers to the moneys collected and spent by the Government through trust fund 
accounts. (See section 20.11.) (Compare to Federal funds group.) 

Unexpended balance means the sum of the unobligated and obligated balances. 

Unobligated balance means the cumulative amount of budget authority that remains available for 
obligation under law in unexpired accounts. The term "expired balances available for adjustment only" 
refers to unobligated amounts in expired accounts. (See section 20.4(f).) 

User charges are charges assessed for the provision of Government services and for the sale or use of 
Government goods or resources. The payers of the user charge must be limited in the authorizing legislation 
to those receiving special benefits from, or subject to regulation by, the program or activity beyond the 
benefits received by the general public or broad segments of the public (such as those who pay income 
taxes or customs duties). User charges are defined and the policy regarding user charges is established in 
OMB Circular A–25, "User Charges" (July 8, 1993). The term encompasses proceeds from the sale or use 
of Government goods and services, including the sale of natural resources (such as timber, oil, and minerals) 
and proceeds from asset sales (such as property, plant, and equipment). (See section 20.7(g).) 

Warrant means an official document issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to law, that 
establishes the amount of appropriations approved by the Congress that can be obligated and disbursed. 

20.4 What do I need to know about budget authority? 
(a) Definition of budget authority 
Budget authority (BA) means the authority provided by law to incur financial obligations that will result in 
outlays. This definition is the same as the one contained in section 3(2) of the Congressional Budget and 
Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which the Congress uses in the congressional budget process. You 
violate the law if you enter into contracts, issue purchase orders, hire employees, or otherwise obligate the 
Government to make a payment before a law has provided budget authority for that purpose (see section 
145.1). 

(b) Forms of budget authority 
Most laws provide budget authority in the form of appropriations, but some laws provide budget authority 
in the form of contract authority, borrowing authority, or spending authority from offsetting collections. 
The following table summarizes the characteristics of each form of budget authority, and the text following 
the table discusses them in more depth. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 11 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

FORMS OF BUDGET AUTHORITY 

Form of budget authority Summary of Characteristics 

Appropriation • 
Authorizes obligations and outlays using 
general funds, special funds, or trust funds. 

• 
Provided in appropriations acts and other laws. 
• 
May authorize the use of cash-equivalent 
payments. 
• 
Not all appropriations provide budget 
authority. 
Contract authority • 
Authorizes obligations but not outlays. 

• 
Typically provided in authorizing laws with 
variations in the way obligations are 
liquidated. 
Borrowing authority • 
Authorizes obligations with outlays to be 
financed by borrowing, usually from Treasury. 

• 
Typically provided in laws that authorize 
business-like operations and require the 
borrowing to be repaid, with interest, out of the 
business proceeds. 
Spending authority from offsetting collections • 
Authorizes obligations and outlays using 
offsetting collections. 

• 
Typically provided in authorizing laws. 
• 
Appropriations acts limit obligations in some 
cases. 
• 
Budget authority may be recorded and 
obligations incurred against orders from other 
Federal accounts only if an obligation is 
recorded by the paying account; obligations 
normally cannot be incurred against orders 
from the public without an advance. 
(1) Appropriations, as a type of budget authority, permit you to incur obligations and make outlays 
(payments). (Not all appropriations provide budget authority, as explained below.) The Congress enacts 
appropriations in annual appropriations acts and other laws. An appropriation may make funds available 
from the general fund, special funds, or trust funds. An appropriations act may also authorize the spending 
of offsetting collections, which are credited to expenditure accounts (including revolving funds) (see 
spending authority from offsetting collections below). 
A law that authorizes you to incur obligations and liquidate them through cash-equivalent payments (see 
section 20.8) constitutes an appropriation of budget authority. 

Some appropriations are not recorded as new budget authority because they relate to obligations that have 
already been legally incurred and do not provide the authority to incur new obligations. Amounts 
appropriated to liquidate contract authority provide the cash needed to liquidate obligations incurred against 
contract authority in advance of collections or an appropriation to liquidate; amounts appropriated to 
liquidate debt provide the cash needed to repay money borrowed from Treasury to liquidate obligations 
incurred against borrowing authority. 

Page 12 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

In contrast, deficiency appropriations, which allow agencies to liquidate obligations that were incurred in a 
prior fiscal year without sufficient budget authority to legally cover such obligations, are recorded as new 
budget authority but deducted from the total budgetary resources available for obligation. Deficiency 
appropriations reduce or eliminate the negative balance that results from obligating amounts in excess of 
an account's budgetary resources (see section 82.18 and Appendix F). This treatment helps ensure that any 
obligations that were incurred without sufficient budget authority, particularly in cases where the obligation 
has yet to be liquidated, are still recognized in the budget authority totals as a current cost. If these costs 
are not recognized as new budget authority, then the total budget authority available to enter into new 
obligations in a given fiscal year will have effectively been allowed to increase without scoring the impact 
of that increase. See section 145.10 for guidance on when to request a deficiency appropriation. 

For purposes of the Antideficiency Act, the definition of the term "appropriations" is broader. As defined 
by the Act, it means all new budget authority and balances of budget authority as described here. 

(2) Contract authority permits you to incur obligations in advance of an appropriation, offsetting 
collections, or receipts that enable you to make outlays to liquidate the obligations. Typically, the Congress 
provides contract authority in an authorizing statute to allow you to incur obligations in anticipation of the 
collection of receipts or offsetting collections that will be used to liquidate the obligations. When you 
receive the appropriated receipts or the collections, you replace the contract authority with the appropriation 
or the spending authority from the offsetting collections to cover the obligations and subsequently liquidate 
the obligations. 
For some programs, the law authorizes you to use offsetting collections to liquidate the obligations incurred 
against the contract authority without further appropriation action. In a few cases, such as the foreign 
military sales program, the law that provides the contract authority also appropriates the receipts without 
further appropriation action. For other programs, such as certain highway and airport and airway programs, 
the Congress as a matter of custom requires you to seek an appropriation of receipts to liquidate the 
obligations. 

In some instances, if the program does not have sufficient collections to liquidate the obligations incurred 
against contract authority, the Congress may enact a general fund appropriation. 

(3) Borrowing authority permits you to incur obligations and authorizes you to borrow funds to liquidate 
the obligations. Usually, the law authorizing the borrowing specifies that you must borrow from the 
Treasury, but in a few cases it authorizes borrowing directly from the public. Laws usually authorize 
borrowing for business-like operations, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, which generates and sells 
electrical power. Such laws require the program to repay the borrowing, with interest, out of business 
proceeds. 
(4) Spending authority from offsetting collections, usually provided in permanent law, permits you to 
credit offsetting collections to an expenditure account (see section 20.7(d)), to incur obligations, and to 
make payments using the offsetting collections. 
You record spending authority from offsetting collections and the offsetting collections in the program and 
financing schedule of an account (see section 82.18). In the simplest case, you record gross budget authority 
equal to the cash collections for the year (lines 1700 and 1800) and record the cash collections as an offset 
to the budget authority (lines 4030-4034 and 4120-4124). Net budget authority equals zero in such cases. 
In other cases, you must adjust spending authority from cash collections to yield the amount available as 
budget authority. We describe these adjustments in section 82.18 (lines 1701-1728 and 1801-1827). We 
discuss some of these adjustments (offsetting collections credited to expired accounts, changes in 
uncollected customer payments from Federal sources, and amounts precluded from obligation)—in more 
detail below. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 13 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Offsetting collections credited to expired accounts. For annual and multi-year accounts that perform 
reimbursable work, the spending authority from the offsetting collections belongs to the Treasury account 
that filled the order. (See section 20.11 for the distinction between Treasury accounts (TAFS) and budget 
accounts.) The availability of the spending authority is generally the same as the Treasury account to which 
it belongs. If the annual or multi-year Treasury account has expired, then you should NOT record the 
collection as new spending authority (schedule P lines 1700 and 1800) because it is not available to incur 
new obligations. It is not new budget authority. However, collections that belong to expired Treasury 
accounts are available to pay old bills, until the authority is canceled. You record collections in expired 
accounts as offsetting collections along with the collections in unexpired accounts (schedule P lines 40304034 
and 4120-4124). You report the portion credited to expired accounts only on schedule P lines 4052 
or 4142. For more information on determining the period of availability of budget authority, see section 
20.4(c). As discussed in section 20.11, each budget account covers all the Treasury accounts with the same 
appropriation title. The program and financing schedule covers: 

• 
Unexpired accounts (annual, multi-year and no-year); and 
• 
Expired accounts. 
You subtract all offsetting collections (unexpired and expired) from gross outlays to yield net outlays so 
that the contribution of the budget account to the Federal Government's bottom line (the surplus or deficit) 
can be determined. 

For no-year accounts, you record gross new budget authority (spending authority from offsetting 
collections) equal to the collections for the year and record the collections as an offset to the budget 
authority. 

Because offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are deducted from gross budget authority, they are 
referred to as negative budget authority for some purposes, such as Congressional Budget Act provisions 
that pertain to budget authority. 

Amounts precluded from obligation. A law may preclude you from using some of the offsetting 
collections to incur obligations. In these cases, the precluded amounts are not counted as budget authority. 
However, you always deduct the full amount of offsetting collections (cash) from gross budget authority 
and gross outlays in the year you collect them, even where a law precludes you from obligating all or a 
portion of the collections in that year. For this reason, an account can have negative net budget authority 
or outlays. As a general rule, you record obligations first against new offsetting collections. To the extent 
that the new offsetting collections are not adequate to cover obligations, you record new budget authority 
from previously unavailable balances of offsetting collections, but you may not exceed the new obligation 
limitation, if any. 

Changes in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources. You need to adjust the spending 
authority from cash collections if the account is authorized to perform reimbursable work for another 
Federal account and you incur obligations against receivables from Federal sources and unfilled customer 
orders from Federal sources without an advance—that is, before receiving the cash. The law allows you to 
incur such obligations as long as the paying account is a Federal account and an obligation is recorded 
against resources available to the paying account. For example, a financing account can obligate against a 
subsidy accounts receivable from the program account before the cash is received from the program account 
if the program account has recorded an obligation in the form of a subsidy accounts payable to the financing 
account. (You cannot incur obligations against customer orders received from non-Federal sources without 
an advance, unless a law specifically allows it.) 

Page 14 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

In these cases, you must add any net increase in such amounts for the year to the spending authority from 
cash collections, or subtract any net decrease in such amounts for the year from the spending authority from 
cash collections, to yield the gross budget authority available to the account from offsetting collections. 
You also add (or subtract) the same amount to offsetting collections (cash) to yield the amount of the offset 
applied to gross budget authority when calculating net budget authority (see section 82.18). 

When program levels remain relatively stable, the amount of reimbursements from other Federal 
Government accounts that is earned but not collected should remain relatively stable and any changes in 
uncollected customer payments from Federal sources should net to zero. Therefore, unless an account is 
projecting significant increases or decreases in program level, there should be no outyear estimates of 
changes in uncollected customer payments. 

(c) Period of availability of budget authority 
When a law appropriates budget authority, it sets the period during which you can use it to incur new 
obligations. We call this the period of availability for new obligations of the budget authority, and the 
period normally is specified in the law providing the budget authority. The period of availability for 
incurring new obligations is shorter than the period of availability for making disbursements, which is 
covered by a general law. Each is described below. 

Period of availability for incurring new obligations: 

• 
Annual budget authority. This term refers to budget authority that is available for obligation 
during only one fiscal year or less. One year is the default period of availability for annual 
appropriations acts (including an appropriation that provides indefinite authority such as "such sums 
as may be necessary…"), because a general provision in each of the acts specifies that the amounts 
provided in the act are available for one year, unless the act expressly provides otherwise. Even if 
there were not such a provision, the preamble of an appropriations act says that it is for a specific 
fiscal year. For example, the following language in an appropriation act would provide one-year 
budget authority: "For expenses of the Office of the Secretary, $1,500,000." 
• 
Multi-year budget authority. The language for a specific appropriation of budget authority in an 
appropriations act or the authorization of the appropriation may make all or some portion of the 
amount available for obligation for a specified period of time in excess of one fiscal year. Usually, 
the period covers two or more whole fiscal years, but it may cover a period that includes part of the 
second fiscal year. We refer to such budget authority as multi-year budget authority or, specifically, 
as two-year budget authority, three-year budget authority, etc. For example, if the following 
language appeared in an appropriations act for 2011, it would provide two-year budget authority: 
"For research and development, $1,500,000, to remain available until September 30, 2012." 
• 
No-year budget authority. The language for a specific appropriation of budget authority or the 
authorization of the appropriation may make all or some portion of the amount available until 
expended. That means you can incur obligations against it indefinitely. We refer to this as no-year 
budget authority. For example, the following language provides no-year budget authority: 
"For construction, improvements, repair or replacement of physical facilities, $1,500,000, to remain 
available until expended." Authorizing laws that make appropriations seldom limit the period of 
availability, so most budget authority provided in authorizing laws is no-year budget authority. 
31 U.S.C. 1555 provides for the closing of appropriation accounts that are available for indefinite 
periods if the agency head or the President determines that the purposes of the appropriation have 
been carried out and no disbursement has been made for two consecutive fiscal years. See 
Appendix F for a description of line 1029, other balances withdrawn. 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 15 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Usually an appropriations act makes budget authority available beginning on October 1 of the fiscal year 
for which the appropriation act is passed. However, there are three types of appropriations where that is 
not the case. 

• 
Advance appropriation, as defined by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (31 U.S.C. 
1105(a)(17)), means appropriations of new budget authority provided in an annual appropriations 
Act that become available one or more fiscal years beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation 
Act was passed. For example, if the following language appeared in an appropriations act for fiscal 
year 2013, it would provide an advance appropriation for fiscal year 2014: "For operating expenses, 
$1,500,000, to become available on October 1, 2013." The term “advance appropriation” applies 
only to discretionary funding in appropriations Acts or to mandatory funding provided in 
appropriations Acts and classified as "appropriated entitlements" or "appropriated mandatories" by 
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (see section 21.3(c)). 
Under current scoring guidelines, new discretionary budget authority for advance appropriations is 
scored in the fiscal year in which the funds become available for obligation and must be 
accommodated within the statutory discretionary spending caps for that year (see section 21.3 (g)). 
In this example, you would record the budget authority in fiscal year 2014. 

• 
Advance funding means appropriations of budget authority provided in an appropriations act to be 
used, if necessary, to cover obligations incurred late in the fiscal year for benefit payments in excess 
of the amount specifically appropriated in the act for that year, where the budget authority is charged 
to the appropriation for the program for the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the 
appropriations act is passed. When such budget authority is used, the budget records an increase in 
the budget authority for the fiscal year in which it is used and a reduction in the budget authority for 
the following fiscal year. The following language, when added to regular appropriation language, 
provides advance funding: "...together with such sums as may be necessary to be charged to the 
subsequent year appropriation for the payment of compensation and other benefits for any period 
subsequent to August 15 of the current year." 
• 
Forward funding means appropriations of budget authority that are made available for obligation 
in the last quarter of the fiscal year for the financing of ongoing grant program during the next fiscal 
year. The budget records the budget authority in the fiscal year in which it is appropriated. The 
following language, if it appeared in an appropriation act for 2014, would provide forward funding, 
which would be recorded in fiscal year 2014: "... of which $2,000,000,000 shall become available 
on July 1, 2014 and shall remain available through September 30, 2015 for academic year 2014– 
2015." 
Period of availability for making disbursements: 

Under a general law, annual budget authority and multi-year budget authority may disburse during the first 
two phases of the following three phases that make up the life cycle of the budget authority. 

• 
Unexpired phase. During this time period the budget authority is available for incurring "new" 
obligations. You may make "new" grants or sign "new" contracts during this phase and you may 
make disbursements to liquidate the obligations. This phase lasts for a set number of years. Annual 
budget authority lasts for up to one fiscal year. Multi-year authority lasts for longer periods, 
currently from over one fiscal year up to 15 fiscal years, and no-year authority lasts indefinitely. 
• 
Expired phase. During this time period, the budget authority is no longer available for new 
obligations but is still available for disbursement. This phase lasts five years after the last unexpired 
year unless the expiration period has been lengthened by legislation. Specifically, you may not 
incur new obligations against expired budget authority, but you may liquidate existing obligations 
by making disbursements. 
Page 16 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

However, you may use the expired budget authority to make certain adjustments to obligations that 
were incurred before the budget authority expired. For example, you could make an upward 
adjustment in previously recorded obligations for transportation charges, under an agreement to pay 
actual transportation charges, if they turned out to be greater than originally estimated. Unless there 
is an exception in law, you may use expired authority to make adjustments to obligations or 
disbursements only during a period of five years after the last unexpired year. The expired period 
can be lengthened by legislation. If you have a program with a legitimate need to disburse funds 
for more than five years after the authority expires for obligation—for example, to make 
disbursements over many years under direct loan contracts, to pay termination costs under a 
contract, or to make payments under a lease—and your OMB representative approves, you may 
propose special language to disburse over a period longer than five years (see section 95.8). You 
may disburse during the longer period only if the special language is enacted in law. 

• 
Canceled phase. After the last expired year, the account is closed, and the balances are canceled. 
The authority to disburse is canceled and is no longer available for any purpose. Any offsetting 
collections credited to the account at the time the account is canceled or subsequently must be 
transferred to miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury. Any old bills with valid obligations that show 
up after the account is closed must be obligated against and disbursed from budget authority that is 
available for the same general purpose but still in the unexpired phase. For example, an old bill 
from obligations incurred against an FY 2006 annual salaries and expense (S&E) account that 
arrives after the authority is canceled must be obligated and disbursed against the corresponding FY 
2012 annual S&E account. 
No-year authority usually stays in the unexpired phase until fully obligated and disbursed. When the 
purposes for which the authority was made available have been achieved, the account may be closed and 
the authority canceled. 

(d) Determining the amount of budget authority 
If a law provides budget authority in a specific amount, we refer to it as definite budget authority. We 
consider the budget authority definite when the language provides a ceiling, for example "not to exceed" a 
specified amount. You record the specified amount as budget authority. For example, this language would 
provide definite budget authority of $100 million: "For salaries and expenses, not to exceed $100,000,000." 

If a law doesn't specify an amount of budget authority, but, instead, specifies a variable factor that 
determines the amount, or a floor, for example "not less than" a specified amount, we refer to the budget 
authority as indefinite. If the law provides "such sums as may be necessary" to cover the obligations 
resulting from an entitlement (such as unemployment insurance), record budget authority in the past year 
equal to the amount obligated and in other years equal to your estimate of obligations. If a law authorizes 
you to obligate all of the receipts from a specified source, record budget authority equal to the amount of 
receipts you collected in the past year and equal to amounts you estimate you will collect in other years. 

If a law appropriates a specific amount to be derived from receipts, it limits the amount of budget authority 
actually provided to the lower of the actual receipts or the amount specified. For example, if the language 
read, "... and, in addition, $75,000,000 of the amounts collected under section 101 of the Authorization Act 
of 2005," you could obligate only the amount actually collected, up to $75,000,000. Similarly, if a law 
appropriates an amount to be derived from a special or trust fund, it limits the amount of budget authority 
actually provided to the lower of the amount of the balances in the fund or the specified amount. For 
example, language that reads, "For necessary expenses, $1,500,000, to be derived from the Land 
Restoration Trust Fund," allows you to obligate only the amount actually in the fund and no more than 
$1,500,000. If a law authorizes you to obligate all of the receipts credited to a fund, record budget authority 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 17 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

equal to the amount of receipts collected by the fund in the past year and equal to the amounts you estimate 
you will collect in other years. 

Some laws that provide borrowing authority limit the amount of debt that may be outstanding at any one 
time. This may limit your ability to incur obligations indirectly, because you must consider your ability to 
borrow the cash needed to liquidate the obligations that will become due, but it doesn't determine the level 
of obligations directly. Instead, these laws act much like a revolving line of credit where you may 
repeatedly borrow up to a limit, make repayments, and borrow again up to the limit, so that over time your 
total borrowing exceeds the limit on credit outstanding at any point in time. In such cases, treat the budget 
authority as indefinite and record the amount that you obligated in the past year or estimate you will obligate 
in other years. Balances of indefinite borrowing authority may not be carried forward in excess of amounts 
needed to cover obligations. Under the scorekeeping guidelines used by OMB and congressional 
scorekeepers, OMB will score legislation that imposes or changes a limit of this type only to the extent that 
we estimate that it will alter the amount of obligations that will be incurred (see Appendix A, scorekeeping 
guideline no. 16). 

Most budget authority provided in appropriations acts is definite, and most budget authority provided in 
other laws is indefinite. 

The Congress may enact laws that preclude agencies from using all of their potential budget authority. For 
example, in some cases the Congress enacts limitations on obligations or program levels in appropriations 
acts that limit the authority to use offsetting collections or receipts provided in authorizing legislation. In 
other cases, the authorizing law may itself limit the amount of obligations you may incur, such as through 
a benefit formula that determines the amount of benefits that may be obligated. 

For special and trust funds with indefinite budget authority whose obligations are constrained by a limitation 
on obligations or benefit formula, the collections in excess of such limitations or benefit formulas are not 
counted as budget authority. Similarly, offsetting collections that are precluded from obligation are not 
counted as budget authority. In these cases, you reduce the spending authority by the precluded amount. 
The precluded amounts are considered to be unavailable and are not included in the account's unobligated 
balances. You record new budget authority in the year the amounts become available for obligation under 
the law. 

(e) Discretionary or mandatory and current or permanent budget authority 
BBEDCA requires us to classify budget authority (and outlays) as either discretionary spending or 
mandatory spending, and applies a different set of rules to each type of spending. We explain this further 
in section 21.3. 

Sometimes, budget authority is characterized as current or permanent. Current authority requires 
congressional appropriations action on the request for new budget authority for the year involved. 
Permanent authority becomes available pursuant to standing provisions of law without further 
appropriations action by the Congress after transmittal of the budget for the year involved. Generally, 
budget authority is current if an annual appropriations act provided it and permanent if authorizing 
legislation provides it. By and large, the current/permanent distinction has been replaced by the 
discretionary/mandatory distinction, which is similar but not identical. 

(f) Unobligated balance 
An unobligated balance consists of the cumulative amount of budget authority that remains available for 
obligation under law in unexpired accounts. This means that, unless the law expressly provides otherwise, 
rescissions and cancellations of unobligated balances apply only to unexpired amounts. In cases where 

Page 18 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

rescissions or cancellations are determined to apply to expired amounts, such amounts would not count as 
discretionary offsets for appropriations. 

In budget execution, both the unexpired, unobligated balances of budget authority at the start of the year, 
(which is available for new obligations) and the expired amounts (which are only available to cover upward 
adjustments to prior year obligations) are reported as budgetary resources. 

In budget formulation, only the unexpired, unobligated balances brought forward are reported; expired 
balances available for adjustment only are not included. Unobligated balances carried forward must meet 
all of the following conditions: 

• 
They are balances of budget authority that have never been obligated or that have been obligated 
and deobligated; 
• 
They are balances of budget authority that do not expire at the end of the fiscal year; 
• 
They do not include any amounts for: (1) indefinite appropriations, except available special and 
trust fund receipts; (2) indefinite borrowing authority; or (3) indefinite contract authority; and 
• 
The amount can be quantified by subtracting the obligations to date from the amount of budget 
authority provided (new budget authority and unobligated balances carried forward at the start of 
the year from the previous fiscal year). That is, the law providing the budget authority must have 
specified a definite amount or an indefinite amount based on the appropriation of collections from 
a specified source. "Such sums as may be necessary" cannot be quantified. 
Unavailable special and trust fund receipts or unavailable offsetting collections should not be counted as 
budget authority and, therefore, there should be no unobligated balances as a result of them. Unavailable 
receipts are included in the special and trust fund receipts schedule (see section 86.4); unavailable offsetting 
collections are presented as a memorandum entry in the program and financing schedule (see section 82.18). 

In budget schedules, such as the program and financing schedule, the unobligated balance carried forward 
at the end of a year is equal to the unobligated balance at the start of the next year. 

The unobligated balances you report for the start and end of the past year must be consistent with the 
amounts reported in GTAS (see sections 82.11 and 82.12). 

(g) Obligated balance 
The term obligated balance is a term of art that is defined in law as a "net" concept. It is not the unpaid 
obligations. The obligated balances are calculated as follows: 

• 
Take the unpaid obligations (which is the sum of the accounts payable and the undelivered orders); 
and 
• 
Subtract the uncollected customer payments from Federal sources (i.e., accounts receivable and the 
unpaid, unfilled orders from Federal sources). 
(h) Reappropriation 
A reappropriation is an extension of the availability of unobligated balances of budget authority that have 
expired or would otherwise expire as a result of legislation enacted subsequent to the law that provided the 
budget authority. The term does not apply to extensions of the availability of unobligated balances of 
budget authority that result from standing provisions of law, enacted before the budget authority was 
provided, or from provisions of law included in the same law that appropriated the funds. An example of 
an extension included in the same law that appropriated the funds is section 511 of the Treasury and General 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 19 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Government Appropriations Act, 2003, which allows agencies to extend the period of availability (expired 
to unexpired) of unobligated balances of appropriations (annual or multi-year) provided in the same act. 
The Act states: 

"... not to exceed 50 percent of unobligated balances remaining available at the end of fiscal year 2002 
from appropriations made available for salaries and expenses for fiscal year 2002 in this Act, shall 
remain available through September 30, 2003, ..." 

Reappropriations of expired balances that are newly available for obligation in the current or budget year 
will be recorded as new budget authority (reappropriations) in the year they are newly available, in the full 
amount of the potential extension. Likewise, reappropriations of amounts that would expire before the 
legislation takes affect (e.g., a reappropriation of funds that would expire at the end of FY 2014 included 
in an FY 2015 appropriations act enacted in August, 2014) would be treated as new budget authority 
(reappropriations). An example of this type of extension is found in section 137 (Division F) of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2003, which states: 

"….the funds provided in Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act of 2002, Public Law 107–116, for the National Museum of African American 
History and Culture Plan for Action Presidential Commission shall remain available until expended." 

In this example the FY 2002 appropriated funds were annual and therefore would have expired at the end 
of September 30, 2002. The language in the FY 2003 appropriation reappropriated the expired funds to 
unexpired no-year funds. 

Reappropriations of unexpired balances or reappropriations of expired balances that cannot take effect until 
a fiscal year beyond the budget year will be reported as balance transfers in the year they are newly available 
for obligation. 

Similar to reappropriations of unexpired balances, extensions in availability resulting from standing 
provisions of law or from provisions of law included in the same law that appropriated the funds will be 
shown as balance transfers. See section 120.66 for a complete discussion on reporting for all types of 
extensions in availability. 

(i) Rescissions and cancellations 
Rescissions and cancellations are reductions in law of budgetary resources. Reductions are recorded as 
negative budget authority in the year the reduction takes effect, regardless of whether the action reduces 
new budget authority or unobligated balances. If a law that precludes the obligation of budgetary resources 
in one year and authorizes their obligation in a subsequent year, you record negative budget authority in 
year of the reduction and new budget authority in the subsequent year. 

Proposed cancellations and all enacted reductions should be included in the regular budget schedules under 
transmittal code 0 (see section 79.2). Proposed rescissions, which are subject to the requirements of Title 
10 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, require separate schedules under transmittal 
code 5 (see section 112). 

The Congress can enact reductions in many ways. For example, the language can specify a dollar or 
percentage reduction and can pertain to a specific account or multiple accounts. Sequestration is also 
cancellation of budgetary resources (see section 100 for complete guidance on sequestration). Rescissions 
and cancellations can impact all types of budget authority and can be permanent or temporary subject to 
the underlying availability of the funds and to the specific statutory authority for the reduction. 

Page 20 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Rescissions and cancellations of general fund appropriations are considered to be permanent reductions 
unless the legislation clearly indicates that the reduction is temporary. Permanent reductions of general 
fund appropriations revert to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Reductions of contract authority and 
borrowing authority are also usually permanent. 

Rescissions and cancellations of amounts appropriated from special and trust fund receipts, as well as 
spending authority from offsetting collections from non-Federal sources, are usually temporary reductions. 
For rescissions and cancellations of spending authority from offsetting collections from Federal sources, 
the original source of the funding needs to be considered to determine whether the reduction is temporary 
or permanent. The reduction amounts are reported as balances of unappropriated receipts (see section 86.4) 
or as unavailable offsetting collections (see section 82.18). If the reduced amount is permanently 
appropriated, it becomes available in the following year, but if it is subject to appropriations, it is not 
available again until further appropriations action has occurred. An exception is when the legislation makes 
clear that the amounts are permanently canceled or rescinded, in which case the amounts are returned to the 
General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. 

Rescissions and cancellations of amounts that have been designated as emergency requirements are not 
counted as PAYGO offsets for the purposes of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. In addition, 
rescissions and cancellations of amounts that have been designated pursuant to a Concurrent Resolution on 
the Budget or BBEDCA as emergency requirements, as appropriations for Overseas Contingency 
Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO), or as disaster funding are not counted as discretionary offsets 
for appropriations of non-emergency, non-OCO, or non-disaster funds. 

(j) Transfer 
(1) Definition. Transfer means to reduce budgetary resources (budget authority and unobligated balances) 
in one account and increase them in another, by the same amount. 
(2) Authority. You can't make a transfer unless a law authorizes it. The law may specify a particular 
transfer or provide general transfer authority within specified limits. 
(3) Expenditure transfer or nonexpenditure transfer. A transfer is recorded as either an expenditure 
transfer, which involves an outlay, or a nonexpenditure transfer, which does not involve an outlay. Which 
you record usually depends on the purpose of the transfer, as explained in the following table, except that 
nonexpenditure transfers are limited to transactions in which both accounts are within the same fund group 
(i.e., trust-to-trust or Federal-to-Federal). See also exhibit 20. 
If the transfer... Record as...

(4) Recording transfers in the budget: 
• 
Expenditure transfers. Record an expenditure transfer as an obligation (against new budget 
authority or unobligated balances) and an outlay in the transferring account and as an offsetting 
collection or offsetting receipt in the receiving account (see section 20.7). If the receiving account 
is a general fund appropriation account or a revolving fund account (including a trust revolving 
fund), credit the amount as an offsetting collection to the appropriation or revolving fund account. 
If the receiving account is a special fund or trust fund account, you would normally credit the amount 
as an offsetting receipt to a receipt account of the fund. 
• 
Nonexpenditure transfers. Do not record an obligation or an outlay or an offsetting collection or 
offsetting receipt. Record nonexpenditure transfers as a decrease either in budget authority or 
unobligated balances in the transferring account and as an increase either in budgetary authority or 
unobligated balances in the gaining account. Whether you record the reduction and increase as a 
change in budget authority or unobligated balances, depends on the circumstances, as described in 
the following table.

authority in the gaining 
account. 

(k) Transfer in the estimates 
A transfer in the estimates means the budget proposes to stop funding an activity under one budget account 
and start funding the activity under another budget account, beginning in the budget year. This does not 
involve a transfer of budgetary resources like that discussed in subsection (j). You simply stop showing 
budget authority in the one account and start showing it in the other. A transfer in the estimates usually 
reflects a proposal to do one of the following in the budget year: 

• 
Transfer the funding of an activity from one account to another. 
• 
Consolidate funding for related activities from two or more accounts into a single account. 
• 
Disaggregate the funding for an activity from one account between two or more accounts. 
See section 82.15 for guidance on presenting these amounts in the program and financing schedules for the 
transferring and receiving accounts. 

(l) Allocation 
Allocation means a delegation, authorized in law, by one agency to another agency, of its authority to 
obligate budget authority and outlay funds. When an agency makes such a delegation, the Treasury 
Department establishes a subsidiary account called a "transfer appropriation account", and the receiving 
agency may obligate up to the amount included in the account. The budget doesn't show the transfer 
appropriation account separately. The budget schedules for the parent account include the obligations by 
the other agency against the subsidiary account. Allocations are appropriate where the receiving agency is 
acting as the agent for the allocating agency. 

20.5 When should I record obligations and in what amounts? 
(a) The general rule 
Obligation means a legally binding agreement that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future. When 
you place an order, sign a contract, award a grant, purchase a service, or take other actions that require the 
Government to make payments to the public or from one Government account to another, you incur an 
obligation. It is a violation of the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341(a)) to involve the Federal 
Government in a contract or obligation for payment of money before an appropriation is made, unless 
authorized by law. This means you cannot incur obligations in a vacuum; you incur an obligation against 
budget authority in a Treasury account that belongs to your agency. It is a violation of the Antideficiency 
Act to incur an obligation in an amount greater than the amount available in the Treasury account that is 
available. This means that the account must have budget authority sufficient to cover the total of such 
obligations at the time the obligation is incurred. In addition, the obligation you incur must conform to 
other applicable provisions of law, and you must be able to support the amounts reported by the 
documentary evidence required by 31 U.S.C. 1501. Moreover, you are required to maintain certifications 
and records showing that the amounts have been obligated (31 U.S.C. 1108). The following subsections 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 23 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

provide additional guidance on when to record obligations for the different types of goods and services or 
the amount. 

(b) Personnel compensation and benefits 
For personnel compensation and benefits the issue is usually the "timing" of the obligation and not the 
"amount" of the obligation. The amount is prescribed by laws that cover the civil service and the uniformed 
service and determined by well-established personnel procedures. As for the timing of the obligation, the 
amounts generally are recorded as obligations as the amounts are earned during the reporting pay period, 
with the following exceptions:

fund to another revolving 
fund, you obligate the 
employee's share of 
funded annual leave and 
you pay it to the fund to 
which the employee is 
transferred 

The revolving fund to 
which the employee is 
transferred will pay the 
employee's salary and 
wages when the employee 
takes the annual leave or 
will pay the lump sum 
terminal leave for any 
annual leave not taken.

(c) Contractual services and supplies 
Services and supplies that are purchased by contract are recorded as obligations at the time there is a binding 
agreement, which is usually when the contract is signed. As a general rule, the amount of the obligation is 
the maximum liability to the Federal Government. The maximum liability to the Government is normally 
limited by the terms of the contract (e.g., cancellation clauses).

(d) Intragovernmental services and supplies 
Obligations are incurred for services when they are rendered. For example, obligations for GSA rental 
payments are incurred in the year in which the premises are occupied, whether or not a bill has been 
rendered. Obligations are incurred for supplies when the order is placed. 

(e) Land and structures 
Contracts for lands and structures generally follow the same rules as for contracts specified above with the 
following exceptions. 

In the case of condemnation proceedings, the amount obligated is the estimated amount for the price of the 
land, adjusted to the amount of the payment to be held in escrow where there is a declaration of a taking. 
It is obligated at the time when you ask the Attorney General to start condemnation proceedings. 

In the case of lease purchases and capital leases covered by the scorekeeping rules developed under the 
Budget Enforcement Act, see the requirements in Appendix B. 

(f) Grants and fixed charges 
Discretionary grants will be obligated after the amounts are determined administratively and recorded at 
the time the grant award is signed. The grant award is normally the documentary evidence that the grant 
has been awarded. Letters of credit are issued after the grant awards are made and generally are not 
obligating documents. 

For grants and fixed charges with formulas in law that automatically fix the amount of the charges, record 
the amount determined by the formula or, if there is an appropriation, then record the amount appropriated, 
whichever is smaller. The obligation is reported at the time the grantee is awarded the grant and is liquidated 
when the payment is made to the grantee. To the extent that a grant awarded in a previous year is no longer 
valid, you will record a recovery of prior year obligations.

20.6 What do I need to know about outlays? 
Outlay means a payment to liquidate an obligation (other than the repayment to the Treasury of debt 
principal). Outlays are a measure of Government spending. As required by law, the budget presents some 
outlays as "on-budget" and some as "off-budget." Total outlays for the Federal Government include both 
on-budget and off-budget outlays. Government-wide outlay totals are stated net of refunds, offsetting 
collections, and offsetting receipts. Function, subfunction, and agency outlay totals are stated net of related 
refunds, offsetting collections, and offsetting receipts for most budget presentations. In contrast, offsetting 
receipts generally are not netted against gross outlays at the bureau level, but when general fund payments 
are used to finance trust fund outlays to the public, the associated trust fund offsetting receipts are netted 
against the bureau totals to prevent double-counting budget authority and outlays at the bureau level. 
(Offsetting receipts from a few sources do not offset any specific function, subfunction, or agency, but only 
offset Government-wide outlay totals.) Outlay totals for accounts with offsetting collections are stated both 
gross and net of the offsetting collections credited to the account. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 27 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

The Government usually makes payments in the form of cash (currency, checks, or electronic fund 
transfers), and you record outlays equal to the disbursement at the time of the disbursement. Normally the 
amount of cash disbursed appropriately measures the value of the transaction. In other cases, however, the 
cash disbursed does not accurately measure the value of the transactions. In these cases, we require you to 
record the cash-equivalent value of the transactions (see section 20.8). 

Not every disbursement is an outlay because not every disbursement liquidates an obligation. You don't 
record outlays for the following: 

• 
Repayment of debt principal because we treat borrowing and the repayment of debt principal as a 
means of financing. 
• 
Disbursements to the public by Federal credit programs for direct loan obligations and loan 
guarantee commitments made in fiscal year 1992 or later (and those made prior to that year if they 
have been modified) because we treat the cash flows to and from the Government for credit 
programs as a means of financing. We record outlays equal to the subsidy cost of direct loans and 
loan guarantees when the underlying direct or guaranteed loans are disbursed. Disbursements from 
liquidating accounts for direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments made prior to fiscal 
year 1992 are treated as outlays (see section 185). 
• 
Disbursements from deposit funds because these funds are on deposit with the Government, but are 
not owned by the Government and are therefore excluded from the budget (see section 20.7). 
• 
Refunds of receipts that result from overpayments because they are recorded as decreases in receipts, 
rather than as increases in outlays (see section 20.9). 
The timing for recording outlays for interest payments varies. Treasury records outlays for the interest on 
the public issues of Treasury debt securities as the interest accrues, not when it pays the cash. However, 
most Treasury debt securities held by Government accounts are in the Government account series. Treasury 
normally records the interest payments on these securities when it pays the cash, and you normally record 
an offsetting collection or receipt on a cash basis. The Department records interest as the amortization 
occurs. We discuss the budget treatment of investment transactions in section 113. 

Outlays during a fiscal year may liquidate obligations incurred in the same year or in prior years. 
Obligations, in turn, may be incurred against budget authority provided in the same year or against 
unobligated balances of budget authority provided in prior years. Outlays, therefore, flow in part from 
budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent and in part from budget authority 
provided in prior years. The ratio of the outlays resulting from budget authority enacted in any year to the 
amount of that budget authority is referred to as the spendout rate for that year. 

Outlays for the past year must agree with amounts reported in the Treasury Combined Statement, unless 
OMB approves an exception. 

20.7 What do I need to know about governmental receipts, offsetting collections, and offsetting 
receipts? 
(a) Overview 
The money collected by the Federal Government and its accounts that is counted as income in the budget 
is classified as either governmental receipts (also known as receipts or revenues) or as offsets to budget 
authority and outlays. We sometimes use the generic term collections when referring to all of this money. 
Collections result from the following transactions: 

Page 28 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

• 
Sovereign power—payments from the public that result primarily from the Government's exercise 
of its sovereign power to tax or otherwise compel payment. 
• 
Business-like transactions with the public, including payments from the public in exchange for 
goods and services; reimbursements for damages; and gifts or donations of money to the 
Government. 
• 
Intragovernmental transactions—payments from other Federal Government accounts. 
The universe of money collected also includes the proceeds of borrowing and the other means of financing 
which are not treated as collections in the budget. Means of financing are discussed in section 20.7 (h). 

The Federal Government normally receives payments in the form of cash and normally records amounts 
equal to the amount of cash received at the time of collection. Usually the amount of cash collected 
appropriately measures the value of the transaction. In some cases, the cash collected does not accurately 
measure the value of the transaction. In these cases, you record the cash equivalent value of the transactions 
(see section 20.8). 

As recommended by the 1967 President’s Commission on Budget Concepts, the budget records money 
collected by Government agencies in one of two ways—depending on the nature of the activity generating 
the collection and the law that established the collection: 

Governmental receipts, which are compared in total to outlays (net of offsetting collections and offsetting 
receipts) to calculate the surplus or deficit; or 

Offsets to budget authority and outlays (classified as either offsetting collections or offsetting receipts), 
which are deducted from gross budget authority and outlays to produce net budget authority and outlay 

figures. 
(b) Governmental receipts 
Governmental receipts are collections that result from the Government's exercise of its sovereign power to 
tax or otherwise compel payment. Sometimes they are called receipts, Federal receipts, or revenues. They 
consist mostly of individual and corporation income taxes and social insurance taxes, but also include excise 
taxes, compulsory user charges, regulatory fees, custom duties, court fines, certain license fees, and deposits 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 29 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

of earning by the Federal Reserve System. Governmental receipts are deposited in receipt accounts. See 
section 20.7(f) for more detail on receipt accounts. 

The types of governmental receipts are summarized in the diagram below. Total governmental receipts for 
the Federal Government include both on-budget and off-budget receipts. 

For more information on collections, see chapters 11 and 12, "Federal Receipts" in the Analytical 

Perspectives volume of the Budget. 
(c) General information about offsets to budget authority and outlays 
Offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are recorded as offsets to spending, not as additions to the 
receipt side of the budget. They are recorded as offsets to spending so that the budget totals represent 
governmental rather than market activity and to prevent double counting from intragovernmental 
transactions. This ensures that the budget totals measure the transactions of the Government with the public. 
They are recorded in the budget in one of two ways, based on interpretation of laws and longstanding budget 
concepts and practice. They are offsetting collections when the collections are authorized to be credited to 
expenditure accounts. Otherwise, they are deposited in receipt accounts and called offsetting receipts. See 
section 20.7(f) for more detail on receipt and expenditure accounts. 

Offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are classified according to the type and source of the money 
collected and how it is treated in the budget. Offsetting collections and offsetting receipts result from one 
of the following types of transactions: 

Business-like transactions with the public—these include voluntary collections from the public in 
exchange for goods or services; reimbursements for damages (e.g., recoveries by the Hazardous Substance 
Superfund); and gifts of money to the Government. The budget records these amounts as offsetting 
collections from non-Federal resources for offsetting collections or as proprietary receipts for offsetting 
receipts. The amounts are deducted from gross budget authority and gross outlays, rather than added to 
receipts. This produces budget totals for receipts, budget authority, and outlays that represent governmental 
rather than market activity. 

Page 30 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Intragovernmental transactions—collections from other Federal Government accounts. The budget 
records collections by one Government account from another as offsetting collections from Federal sources 
for offsetting collections or as intragovernmental receipts for offsetting receipts. Intragovernmental 
offsetting receipts can be further divided into two categories: 

• 
Interfund receipts, which involve transactions between Federal and trust fund accounts; and 
• 
Intrafund receipts, which involve transactions between the same types of fund groups (i.e., from 
Federal fund to Federal fund or from trust fund to trust fund. 
The amounts are deducted from gross budget authority and gross outlays so that the budget totals measure 
the transactions of the Government with the public. 

Offsetting governmental transactions—collections from the public that are governmental in nature (e.g., 
tax receipts, regulatory fees, compulsory user charges), but required by law to be misclassified as offsetting. 
The budget records amounts from non-Federal sources that are governmental in nature as offsetting 
governmental collections for offsetting collections or as offsetting governmental receipts for offsetting 
receipts. 

(d) Offsetting collections 
Some laws authorize agencies to credit collections directly to the account from which they will be spent. 
Most revolving funds operate with such authority. Offsetting collections credited to expenditure accounts 
automatically offset outlays and budget authority at the expenditure account level. Where accounts have 
offsetting collections, the budget shows the budget authority and outlays of the account both gross (before 
deducting offsetting collections) and net (after deducting offsetting collections). Totals for the agency, 
subfunction, and budget are net of offsetting collections. 

Line codes are used to identify the source of the collections in OMB's budget database. See section 82.18 
for the offsetting collection line entries and the definitions. The offsets are used to arrive at net budget 
authority and outlays for the account and are presented in the program and financing (schedule P) in the 
Appendix to the President's Budget. 

The following chart summarizes the types of offsetting collections and the associated line codes reported 
in MAX: 


OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 31 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

(e) Offsetting receipts 
Collections that are offset against gross outlays and budget authority but are not authorized to be credited 
to expenditure accounts are credited to receipt accounts and are called offsetting receipts. They are deducted 
from budget authority and outlays in arriving at total budget authority and outlays. However, unlike 
offsetting collections that are credited to expenditure accounts, offsetting receipts do not offset budget 
authority and outlays at the account level. Most offsetting receipts deposited in receipt accounts are offset 
at the agency and subfunction levels, and the offsetting receipts of certain general fund payments are offset 
at the bureau levels. We call these distributed offsetting receipts. A few offsetting receipts are offset at 
government-wide totals. We call these undistributed offsetting receipts. For more information on the 
magnitude of undistributed offsetting receipts see Table 25-1 in the Analytical Perspectives volume of the 
President's Budget. 

Within OMB's budget database, offsetting receipts are coded to identify the types of offsetting receipt (e.g., 
proprietary, offsetting governmental, intragovernmental) and to identify how they are treated (e.g., offset 
at the agency and function level). Each offsetting receipt type also has a number of unique and associated 
source category codes that enable MAX to produce tables needed for the Budget. These are assigned by 
OMB when the account is established (see exhibit 79B). 

The following chart summarizes the receipt types, with associated receipt type codes in parentheses, for the 
various types of offsetting receipts. 


(f) Receipt accounts and expenditure accounts 
The placement of collections in receipt accounts or expenditure accounts is based on the interpretation of 
laws and long-standing budget concepts and practice. 

Page 32 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Receipt accounts.—A general law requires that, except as provided by another law, an official or agent of 
the Government who receives money for the Federal Government from any source shall deposit the money 
in the Treasury as soon as practicable. This law (31 U.S.C. 3302) is generally referred to as the 
"Miscellaneous Receipts Act." The Department of the Treasury, in consultation with OMB, interprets this 
law as requiring all collections to be deposited in general fund receipt accounts, which as a group comprise 
part of "the general fund." 

Some laws earmark collections from a certain source for a specific purpose. Depending on the legal 
requirements, Treasury deposits these collections in special fund receipt accounts, trust fund receipt 
accounts, or credits the collections directly to expenditure accounts, including revolving fund accounts. 
The legislation also specifies whether the earmarked receipts are (i) available for obligation and outlay 
without further appropriations action by the Congress (i.e., available), or (ii) not available for obligation or 
outlay until the Congress makes the amounts available in annual appropriations or other acts (i.e., 
unavailable). However, in some cases, receipts are considered to be unavailable because a benefit formula 
or limitation precludes their use. These amounts of receipts may become available subsequently without 
appropriations action. See section 20.4(b) for more information about amounts precluded from obligation. 

When the collections in the receipt accounts are available for obligation and outlay, the amounts are 
appropriated to general fund, special fund, trust fund, or other expenditure accounts, as discussed below. 

Expenditure accounts.—Some laws override the requirement to first deposit collections in receipt 
accounts. These collections are credited directly to expenditure accounts, where the collections are 
generally available for obligation and outlay without further action by the Congress. These collections are 
called offsetting collections. Most revolving funds operate under such authority. These include public 
enterprise, intragovernmental, and trust revolving funds. In addition, the Economy Act allows Federal 
agencies or bureaus within agencies to do work for each other. When one account reimburses another 
account for this work, the Act authorizes the collections to be credited directly to the expenditure account 
that provided the goods and services. 

(g) User charges 
User charge means a fee, charge, or assessment the Government levies on a class of the public directly 
benefiting from, or subject to regulation by, a Government program or activity. We record user charges as 
governmental receipts, offsetting collections, or offsetting receipts using the criteria described above. The 
authorizing law must limit the payers of the charges to those benefiting from, or subject to regulation by, 
the program or activity. 

User charges include: 

• 
Collections from non-Federal sources for goods and services provided (for example, the proceeds 
from the sale of goods by defense commissaries, electricity by power marketing administrations, 
stamps by the Postal Service; fees charged to enter national parks; and premiums charged for flood 
and health insurance); 
• 
Voluntary payments to social insurance programs, such as Medicare Part B insurance premiums; 
• 
Miscellaneous customs fees (for example, United States Customs Service merchandise processing 
fees); 
• 
Proceeds from asset sales (property, plant, and equipment); 
• 
Proceeds from the sale of natural resources (such as timber, oil, and minerals); 
• 
Outer Continental Shelf receipts; 
• 
Spectrum auction proceeds; 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 33 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

• 
Many fees for permits, and regulatory and judicial services; 
• 
Specific taxes and duties on an exception basis; and 
• 
Credit program fees deposited into the credit program account and recorded in the budget on a 
current basis. 
User charges do not include: 

• 
Collections from other Federal accounts; 
• 
Collections associated with credit programs, except for credit program fees deposited into credit 
program accounts and recorded in the budget on a current basis; 
• 
Realizations upon loans and investments; 
• 
Interest, dividends, and other earnings; 
• 
Payments to social insurance programs required by law; 
• 
Excise taxes; 
• 
Customs duties; 
• 
Fines, penalties, and forfeitures; 
• 
Cost-sharing contributions; and 
• 
Federal Reserve System deposits of earnings. 
(h) Means of financing 
These are monies received or paid by the Government that are not counted in the budget totals as either 
collections (governmental receipts, offsetting collections, or offsetting receipts) or outgo (outlays). 
Borrowing and the repayment of debt are the primary means of financing. Others are listed below. These 
monies finance outlays when there is a deficit—that is, when outlays (net of offsetting collections and 
offsetting receipts) exceed receipts. When there is a surplus—that is, when receipts exceed outlays (net of 
offsetting collections and offsetting receipts)—the means of financing may be used, together with the 
surplus, to retire debt. 

Most of the individual means of financing represent changes in assets or liabilities and therefore can either 
be a source of financing for the Government or require financing themselves. For example, if the 
disbursements from credit financing accounts exceed their collections, which is normal, the difference must 
be financed by receipts or the other means of financing; if the disbursements are less than the collections, 
the difference may be used to reduce borrowing or to provide any financing required by the other means of 
financing. The means of financing other than borrowing and repayment of debt include: 

• 
Net financing disbursements by direct loan and guaranteed loan financing accounts; 
• 
Seigniorage (the profit from coining money) and profits on the sale of gold (a monetary asset); 
• 
Certain exchanges of cash, such as deposits by the U.S. in the International Monetary Fund; 
• 
Changes in Treasury's operating cash balance, uninvested deposit fund balances, and checks 
outstanding; and 
• 
Treasury debt buyback premiums and discounts (see section 113). 
For more information on the means of financing, see the section on Budget Deficit or Surplus and Means 
of Financing in Chapter 9, "Budget Concepts" of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the President's 
Budget.

SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

20.8 What do I need to know about cash-equivalent transactions? 
Normally the amount of cash disbursed or collected is the appropriate measure of the value of the 
transaction, and you record outlays or collections equal to the cash that changes hands. In other cases, 
however, the cash disbursed or collected doesn't accurately measure the value of the transactions. In these 
cases, you should record the cash-equivalent value of the transactions in the budget. The following are 
some examples of cash-equivalent transactions: 

• 
Federal employee salaries. You record an outlay for the full amount of an employee's salary, even 
though the cash disbursement is net of Federal and state income taxes, retirement contributions, life 
and health insurance premiums, and other deductions. We record collections for the deductions that 
are payments to the Government. 
• 
Debt instruments. When the Government receives or makes payments in the form of debt 
instruments (such as bonds, debentures, monetary credits, or notes) in lieu of cash, we record 
collections or outlays in the budget on a cash-equivalent basis. The Government can borrow from 
the public to raise cash and then outlay the cash proceeds to liquidate an obligation, or, if authorized 
in law, it may liquidate the obligation by issuing securities in lieu of the cash. The latter method 
combines two transactions into one—borrowing and an outlay. Combining these transactions into 
one does not change the nature of the transactions. Since the two methods of payment are 
equivalent, we require you to record the same amount of outlays for both cases. Similarly, when 
the Government accepts securities in lieu of cash from the public in payment of an obligation owed 
to the Government, we record offsetting receipts or collections. In one program, for example, a 
Government agency may choose whether to pay default claims against it in cash or by issuing 
debentures in lieu of cash; the agency records the same amount of outlays in either case. In turn, a 
recipient of these debentures may choose to pay the fees that it owes to the Government either in 
cash or by returning debentures of equivalent value that it holds. The agency records the same 
amount of offsetting receipts or collections in either case. 
• 
Lease-purchases. We require you to record an outlay for the acquisition of physical assets through 
certain types of lease-purchase arrangements as though the transaction was an outright purchase or 
direct Federal construction. Lease-purchase transactions in which the Government assumes 
substantial risk are equivalent to the Government raising cash by borrowing from the public and 
purchasing the asset directly by disbursing the cash proceeds. You must report outlays over the 
period that the contractor constructs, manufactures, or purchases the asset that will be leased to the 
Government, not when the Government disburses cash to the developer for lease payments. Because 
the Government pays no cash up front to the nominal owner of the asset, the transaction creates a 
Government debt. In such cases, we treat the subsequent cash lease payments as the equivalent of 
interest outlays on that debt and principal repayments. (See Appendix B). 
The scorekeeping effect of cash-equivalent transactions applies to budget authority, as well as to outlays 
and collections. You record the authority to incur obligations that will be liquidated through cash-
equivalent payments as budget authority. 

The use of cash-equivalents often results in an increase or decrease in Federal debt. In the previous example 
of the Government using debentures to pay claims, we record the issuance of a debenture as an increase in 
debt, and we record the Government's acceptance of a debenture for payment of fees as a decrease in debt. 
We also record an increase in debt as the means of financing the cash-equivalent outlays of lease-purchase 
arrangements in which the Government assumes substantial risk.

20.9 What do I need to know about refunds? 
Refunds are the repayments of excess payments. The amounts are directly related to previous obligations 
incurred and outlays made against the appropriation. Refunds received are deposited to the credit of the 
appropriation or fund account charged with the original obligations as explained in the following table:

SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Record refunds paid as follows: 

• 
Record refunds paid by an expenditure account as an obligation and an outlay of the account. 
• 
Record refunds of receipts that result from overpayments (such as income taxes withheld in excess 
of a taxpayer's income tax liability) as reductions of receipts, rather than as outlays. This does not 
include payments to a taxpayer for credits (such as an earned income tax credit) that exceed the 
taxpayer's income tax liability. Record these as outlays, not as refunds. 
20.10 What do I need to know about advances? 
Advances are amounts of money prepaid to a Federal Government account for the later receipt of goods, 
services, or other assets, or as matching funds. 

When an advance is required, the budgetary resource provided by the order is equal to the cash 
accompanying the order. The advance, per se, is not available for obligation. If both the order and the 
advance were available for obligation, budgetary resources would be double-counted. 

Deposit advances with orders in the appropriate appropriation/fund or receipt account. 

Deposit advances without orders as follows: 

If the advance is from... Deposit the advance in... 
A non-Federal source Deposit fund account (6500) 
A Federal source An intragovernmental clearing account (F3885) 

When a reimbursable agreement with another Federal account is accompanied by a cash advance, you may 
disburse to pay obligations associated with that advance. However, if you are authorized to incur 
obligations against customer orders from other Federal accounts without an advance, the order establishes 
obligational authority only and you may not disburse the account into a negative position (see section 145.2 
on Antideficiency Act violations). 

If you return a cash advance or other offsetting collection or special or trust fund receipts received in a prior 
fiscal year, you must record an obligation and an outlay in the current fiscal year. 

20.11 What do I need to know about accounts and fund types? 
(a) Accounts 
The term account may refer to a receipt or expenditure account. Governmental receipts and offsetting 
receipts are deposited into receipt accounts (see section 20.7). Receipt accounts are not available for 
incurring obligations or making outlays. Expenditure accounts are provided with budget authority (e.g., 
appropriations or offsetting collections) and are used to incur obligations and make outlays. Receipt and 
expenditure accounts are further classified into fund types (e.g., general funds and special funds). Fund 
types are discussed in subsections 20.12(b) through 20.12(f) below. 

The term account may also refer to Treasury accounts and budget accounts. When the Congress provides 
budget authority for a particular purpose or under a particular title, it also provides a specific period of time 
for which the budget authority is available for obligation. This time period of availability (POA) may be 
annual, multi-year, or no-year. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 37 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

Treasury establishes expenditure accounts based on the POA of the resources in the account. That is, 
Treasury establishes separate accounts with separate Treasury appropriation fund symbols (TAFS) for each 
POA, i.e., annual, multi-year, or no-year amount. For budget execution, which is governed largely by the 
Antideficiency Act, you must report data for each of the TAFS expenditure accounts established by 
Treasury (see section 130). 

A budget account generally covers an organized set of activities, programs, or services directed toward a 
common purpose or goal. For budget formulation, the appropriations and other budget authority provided 
to TAFS accounts with the same appropriation title for the years covered by the budget are combined and 
presented as a single account under a single title, e.g., "Salaries and expenses." As an illustration, the FY 
2017 column of the program and financing schedule for a "Salaries and expenses" account in the 2019 
Appendix would include, as appropriate, outlays made in FY 2017 from the FY 2017 appropriation, the FY 
2015–2017 multi-year appropriation, the no-year appropriation, and the five expired annual appropriations 
(FY 2012 through FY 2016). 

For receipt accounts, the budget and Treasury accounts are usually the same. 

For information on account identification codes, see section 79.2. 

(b) Overview of fund types 
Agency activities are financed through general funds, special funds, and revolving funds (public enterprise 
revolving funds, intragovernmental revolving funds, credit financing accounts), which constitute the 
Federal funds group, and trust funds and trust revolving funds, which constitute the trust funds group. 
General, special, and trust fund collections and disbursements may be held temporarily in clearing accounts 
pending clearance to the applicable account. Agencies account for amounts that are not Government funds 
in deposit funds. The following table summarizes the characteristics of these funds. The text following the 
table discusses the types of funds in more depth.

Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund) are excluded from the on-budget totals. 

Page 40 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

The budget documents present these amounts as "off-budget" and adds them to the budget totals to show totals for 
the Federal Government (sometimes called unified budget totals). 

(c) Federal funds 
Federal funds comprise several types of accounts or funds. A general fund receipt account records receipts 
not earmarked by law for a specific purpose, such as individual income tax receipts. A general fund 
expenditure account records appropriations from the general fund and the associated transactions, such as 
obligations and outlays. General fund appropriations draw from general fund receipts collectively and, 
therefore, are not specifically linked to receipt accounts. 

The Federal funds group also includes special funds and revolving funds, both of which earmark collections 
for spending on specific purposes. We establish a special fund where the law requires us to earmark 
collections from a specified source to finance a particular program, and the law neither authorizes the fund 
to conduct a cycle of business-type operations (making it a revolving fund) nor designates it as a trust fund. 
For example, a law established the Land and water conservation fund, earmarking a portion of rents and 
royalties from Outer Continental Shelf lands and other receipts to be used for land acquisition, conservation, 
and recreation programs. The receipts earmarked to a fund are recorded in one or more special fund receipt 
accounts. More than one receipt account may be necessary to distinguish different types of receipts 
(governmental, proprietary, etc.) and receipts from significantly different types of transactions (registration 
fees vs. fines and penalties, for example). The fund's appropriations and associated transactions are 
recorded in a special fund expenditure account. Most funds have only one expenditure account, even if 
they have multiple receipt accounts. However, a large fund, especially one with appropriations to more 
than one agency (such as the Land and water conservation fund), may have more than one expenditure 
account. The majority of special fund collections are derived from the Government's power to impose 
taxes, fines, and other compulsory payments, and they must be appropriated before they can be obligated 
and spent. 

Revolving funds conduct continuing cycles of business-like activity. They charge for the sale of products 
or services and use the proceeds to finance their spending. Instead of recording the collections in receipt 
accounts (as offsetting receipts), the budget records the collections and the outlays of revolving funds in 
the same account. The laws that establish revolving funds authorize the collections to be obligated and 
outlayed for the purposes of the fund without further appropriation. The law of supply and demand is 
expected to regulate such funds. However, in some cases, the Congress enacts obligation limitations on the 
funds in appropriations acts as a way of controlling their expenditures (for example, a limitation on 
administrative expenses). There are two types of revolving funds in the Federal funds group. Public 
enterprise funds, such as the Postal Service Fund, conduct business-like operations mainly with the public. 
Intragovernmental funds, such as the Federal Buildings Fund, conduct business-like operations mainly 
within and between Government agencies. 

(d) Trust funds 
Trust funds account for the receipt and expenditure of monies by the Government for carrying out specific 
purposes and programs in accordance with the terms of a statute that designates the fund as a trust fund 
(such as the Highway Trust Fund) or for carrying out the stipulations of a trust agreement where the Nation 
is the beneficiary (such as any of several trust funds for gifts and donations for specific purposes). Like 
special funds and revolving funds, trust funds earmark collections for spending on specific purposes. Many 
of the larger trust funds finance social insurance payments for individuals, such as Social Security, 
Medicare, and unemployment compensation. Other major trust funds finance military and Federal civilian 
employees' retirement, highway and mass transit construction, and airport and airway development. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 41 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

A trust fund normally consists of one or more receipt accounts to record receipts and an expenditure account 
to record the appropriation of the receipts and associated transactions. Some trust funds have multiple 
receipt accounts for the same reasons that special funds have them. Also, like special funds, large trust 
funds (such as the Highway Trust Fund) may have multiple expenditure accounts. A few trust funds, such 
as the Veterans Special Life Insurance fund and the Employees Life Insurance Fund, are established by law 
as revolving funds. These funds operate the same way as revolving funds in the Federal funds group, and 
we call them trust revolving funds. They conduct a cycle of business-type operations. The collections are 
credited to the expenditure account as offsetting collections and their outlays are displayed net of collections 
in a single expenditure account. 

The Federal budget meaning of the term "trust", as applied to trust fund accounts, differs significantly from 
its private sector usage. In the private sector, the beneficiary of a trust usually owns the trust's assets, which 
are managed by a trustee who must follow the stipulations of the trust. In contrast, the Federal Government 
owns the assets of most Federal trust funds, and it can raise or lower future trust fund collections and 
payments, or change the purposes for which the collections are used, by changing existing laws. There is 
no substantive difference between these trust funds and special funds or between trust revolving funds and 
public enterprise revolving funds. Whether a particular fund is designated in law as a trust fund is, in many 
cases, arbitrary. For example, the National Service Life Insurance Fund is a trust fund, but the Servicemen's 
Group Life Insurance Fund is a Federal fund, even though both are financed by earmarked fees paid by 
veterans and both provide life insurance payments to veterans' beneficiaries. There are a few Federal trust 
funds that are managed pursuant to a trust agreement. These are identified in the budget as "gift funds". In 
addition, the Government does act as a true trustee on behalf of some entities outside of the Government 
where it makes no decisions about the amount of these deposits or how they are spent. For example, it 
maintains accounts on behalf of individual Federal employees in the Thrift Savings Fund, investing them 
as directed by the individual employee. The Government accounts for such funds in deposit funds (see the 
section after next). 

In cases where the law provides an appropriation from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury to a 
trust fund, a general fund expenditure account and an associated trust fund receipt account are 
used to 
record the financial transaction that moves resources between fund types. 

(e) Clearing accounts 
You use clearing accounts to temporarily account for transactions that you know belong to the Government 
while you wait for information that will allow you to match the transaction to a specific receipt or 
expenditure account. For example: 

• 
To temporarily credit unclassified transactions from the public when there is a reasonable 
presumption that the amounts belong to a Federal Government account other than miscellaneous 
receipts in the Treasury. 
• 
To temporarily credit unclassified transactions between Federal agencies, including 
Intragovernmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) transactions. 
You should not use clearing accounts to mask an overobligation or overexpenditure of an expenditure 
account. 

(f) Deposit funds 
You use deposit funds to account for monies that do not belong to the Government. This includes monies 
held temporarily by the Government until ownership is determined (such as earnest money paid by bidders 
for mineral leases) or held by the Government as an agent for others (such as State and local income taxes 

Page 42 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

withheld from Federal employees' salaries and not yet paid to the State or local government). We exclude 
deposit fund transactions, as such, from the budget totals because the funds are not owned by the 
Government. Therefore, the budget records transactions between deposit funds and budgetary accounts as 
transactions with the public. For example, when the mineral leasing process has been completed, the 
winning bidder's earnest money is transferred from the deposit fund to the appropriate receipt account and 
the budget records a receipt. Similarly, outlays are recorded in an agency's salaries and expense account 
when a Federal employee is paid, even though some of the amount is transferred to a deposit fund for State 
and local income taxes withheld and paid later to the State and local government. Deposits and associated 
disbursements are recorded in the same account. 

20.12 What do I need to know about reimbursable work? 
Agencies can perform reimbursable work for the public or other Federal agencies. The types of laws that 
allow you to use advances or reimbursements in return for providing others with goods and services are: 

• 
Laws that establish revolving funds, including franchise funds and working capital funds; 
• 
Provisions in appropriations or substantive laws that allow agencies to use the amounts they collect; 
and 
• 
The Economy Act (31.U.S.C. 1535). 
Generally speaking, laws that authorize an agency to enter into a "reimbursable agreement" with non-
Federal transaction partners only provide authority to deposit collections into the agency's account, rather 
than the Miscellaneous Receipts Account (31 U.S.C. 3302). One such example is the Intergovernmental 
Cooperation Act of 1969 (31 U.S.C. 6501). Authority to enter into a "reimbursable agreement" is not 
sufficient to allow you to record a budgetary resource against account receivable absent additional express 
statutory authority to do so. 

(a) Revolving funds 
You may use a revolving fund when a law establishes the revolving funds and authorizes you to credit 
payments to the revolving fund that performs the work. Revolving funds operate on a reimbursable basis 
when working capital (undisbursed cash) is available. Otherwise, advance payments must accompany 
orders. You may not disburse revolving funds into a negative cash position in anticipation of Federal or 
non-Federal reimbursements because of the Antideficiency Act. 

(b) Payments from non-Federal entities 
If the law authorizes an expenditure account to perform work for the public and to credit collections from 
non-Federal entities as spending authority, you may cover obligations incurred by the account by: 

• 
Advances collected up to the amount of accompanying orders (see section 20.10 for treatment of 
advances); and 
• 
Working capital that is available for this purpose. 
(c) Economy Act 
The Act authorizes the head of an agency or major organizational unit within an agency to place an order 
with a major organizational unit within the same agency or another Federal agency for goods or services 
provided that: 

• 
The ordering agency has enough money to pay for the order; 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 43 of Section 20 


SECTION 20—TERMS AND CONCEPTS 

• 
The head of the ordering agency or unit decides the order is in the best interest of the United States 
Government; 
• 
The agency or unit to fill the order is able to provide or get by contract the ordered goods or services; 
• 
The head of the ordering agency decides that the ordered goods or services cannot be provided by 
contract as conveniently or cheaply by a commercial enterprise; and 
• 
Transactions authorized by the Economy Act are limited by the statutory requirement that the 
amount obligated by the ordering appropriation is required to be deobligated to the extent that the 
agency or unit filling the order has not incurred obligations before the end of the period of 
availability of the ordering appropriation. 
Under the Economy Act, payment (via expenditure transfer) may be made in advance or reimbursements 
may be made. Advances and reimbursements from other Federal Government appropriations are available 
for obligation—but not disbursement until received—when the ordering appropriation records a valid 
obligation to cover the order. The Act states that the providing (servicing) agency shall charge the ordering 
(requesting) agency "on the basis of the actual cost of goods or services provided" as agreed to by the 
agencies. Specific questions about Economy Act requirements should be directed to the agency's Chief 
Financial Officer and/or Office of General Counsel.

21.1 What is scoring? 
Scoring is the process of estimating the change in Government spending and collections resulting from 
enacted or proposed legislation, compared to what would happen in the absence of that legislation. These 
estimates are prepared both to inform policy makers of the budgetary effects of proposed legislation, and 
to inform congressional and statutory budget enforcement procedures. 

21.2 When does scoring occur during the budget process? 
Scoring occurs typically during budget formulation, the consideration of proposed legislation, and after a 
law has been enacted. 

Budget formulation. As part of the budget formulation process, agencies submit baseline program levels 
and discretionary, mandatory, and governmental receipt proposals to OMB for consideration. Agencies 
work with OMB to determine the effect of proposals on budget authority, collections, and outlays based on 
the Administration's economic and technical assumptions. The scored level of budget authority, collections, 
and outlays for each approved budget proposal and the baseline for all programs create an overall picture 
of the President’s proposed fiscal path. 

Congressional process and enactment. During the congressional legislative process, CBO is required by 
statute to score legislation. Such scoring advises congressional committees on compliance with 
congressional budget enforcement procedures. During a legislative session, pursuant to statute, OMB 
updates the Congress on its estimates of the costs of the annual appropriations bills and publishes PAYGO 
scorecards that include estimates of enacted legislation that affects mandatory spending or governmental 
receipts. A sequestration is triggered at the end of a legislative session if OMB's scoring of appropriations 
Acts determines a breach of the discretionary caps has occurred or if OMB's PAYGO scorecards show a 
debit in the budget year. See section 100.3 for more information on sequestration, section 100.4 for the 
budget enforcement reports issued by OMB, and section 15.3 for more information on the congressional 
budget process.

SECTION 21—OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION 

21.3 What are the basic concepts I need to know to score legislation? 
(a) Overview of budget laws 
The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) divides spending into two 
categories—discretionary and mandatory. The Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference for 
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA of 1997) classified all accounts under the Appropriations 
Committee's jurisdiction at the time as discretionary, mandatory, or split between discretionary and 
mandatory. The "scorekeepers" (House and Senate Budget Committees, CBO, and OMB) consult on the 
classification of spending, determine the classification of new accounts, and may reclassify the designation 
of an existing account. 

Discretionary and mandatory spending are controlled by different statutory enforcement procedures. The 
Budget Control Act of 2011 amended BBEDCA, and instituted limits ("caps") on the amount of 
discretionary budget authority for 2012 through 2021. For mandatory spending, the Statutory Pay-As-You-
Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) reestablished and made permanent a statutory procedure to enforce deficit 
neutrality on new revenue and mandatory spending legislation. 

For more information on these statutes and budget enforcement, see chapters 9 and 11, "Budget Concepts" 
and "Budget Process" in the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget. For detailed information on 
how sequestration is applied for purposes of budget enforcement, see section 100. 

(b) Definition of discretionary spending 
Discretionary spending is the budget authority provided by annual appropriations Acts and the outlays that 
result from that budget authority. For example, the budget authority and outlays for the salaries and 
expenses of Federal personnel and other operating expenses of Government agencies are usually provided 
by annual appropriations Acts and, therefore, are usually discretionary. 

(c) Definition of mandatory spending 
Mandatory spending, also referred to as "direct spending," is budget authority and outlays provided by 
permanent laws. For example, permanent laws authorize payments for Medicare, unemployment insurance 
benefits, and farm price supports, so the budget authority and outlays for these programs are mandatory. 

In addition, budget authority provided in annual appropriations Acts for certain programs, such as Medicaid, 
is treated as mandatory. Such accounts are called "appropriated entitlements" or "appropriated 
mandatories." The BBA of 1997 classified these accounts as such, predominantly because the authorizing 
legislation directs that the Government make or beneficiaries receive payments. While mandatory and 
discretionary classifications are used for measuring compliance with BBEDCA and PAYGO, they do not 
determine whether a program provides legal entitlement to a payment or benefit or the availability of 
funding. You should address questions about BBEDCA classifications and legal entitlements to your OMB 
representative. 

(d) Committee of jurisdiction 
When scoring legislative language or a Budget proposal, it is important to know which congressional 
committees have jurisdiction over the proposal and whether the affected spending is mandatory or 
discretionary, or whether the proposal would affect governmental receipts. While most scoring concepts 
apply to each type of spending and to governmental receipts, the budget enforcement laws differ. 
Authorizing committees have jurisdiction over mandatory (or "direct") spending and governmental receipts, 
and budget enforcement for this spending is governed by PAYGO. The Appropriations Committees have 

Page 2 of Section 21 OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) 


SECTION 21—OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION 

jurisdiction over discretionary spending, and budget enforcement is governed by the spending limits (caps) 
set in BBEDCA. 

In some cases, legislative action by an appropriations committee may affect spending or receipts under the 
jurisdiction of an authorizing committee, and vice versa. In these cases, the budgetary effects are scored 
against the committee taking the legislative action. 

Explicit OMB approval is required to include authorizing language in the Budget Appendix, either as 
account-specific appropriations language or as a general provision. Please consult first with your OMB 
representative if your agency has such a proposal. Both scoring and jurisdictional issues will be part of the 
consideration for inclusion of a proposal in the Budget. See section 95.5 and 95.6 for guidance on the 
legislative language included in the Budget Appendix. 

(e) How are scoring estimates measured? 
Authorizing legislation is measured as a change to outlays or governmental receipts from the President's 
Budget baseline, updated for enacted legislation and certain other actions. See section 80 for how to 
construct the baseline. Scoring for discretionary programs is generally measured in terms of budget 
authority provided in appropriations Acts. For both authorizing legislation and discretionary programs, 
offsetting collections and offsetting receipts net against both budget authority and outlays in the year they 
are collected. 

(f) Economic and technical assumptions 
BBEDCA requires agency and OMB scoring to use the economic and technical assumptions underlying the 
most recently released President's Budget. OMB provides agencies with economic assumptions to be used 
for Budget estimates. Examples of economic assumptions include interest rate projections, housing price 
projections, and projections of inflation. Technical assumptions are assumptions that are not determined by 
economic factors, such as outlay rates, caseload projections, fee collection, and loan volume. For more 
information on the economic and technical assumptions underlying baseline and policy estimates see 
section 80 and section 31. 

For Mid-Session Review, OMB normally provides revised economic assumptions to agencies, and asks 
agencies to update their technical assumptions. Updates of economic and technical assumptions for the 
Mid-Session Review are not used for scoring, which is based on the economic and technical assumptions 
from the most recently released President's Budget. For more information on Mid-Session Review, see 
section 10.6. 

(g) Scoring timeframes 
The budgetary effects of authorizing legislation and discretionary appropriations are scored over different 
timeframes. Authorizing legislation is scored as the change to outlays or governmental receipts from the 
President's Budget baseline in each year of the budget window (the current year, the budget year, and the 
nine subsequent years). Discretionary appropriations are scored in the current and budget year only, and 
the overall score for those years includes discretionary amounts provided for those years in previous 
appropriation Acts (i.e., advance appropriations). 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) Page 3 of Section 21 


SECTION 21—OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION 

21.4 What are the budget enforcement mechanisms for discretionary and mandatory spending? 
(a) Caps on discretionary budget authority 
BBEDCA specifies spending limits or "caps," on discretionary budget authority for 2012 through 2021. 
The caps are divided between a "revised security category" and a "revised nonsecurity category." The 
revised security category (or defense category) includes discretionary budget authority in the defense 
budget function 050, which primarily consists of the Department of Defense. The "revised nonsecurity 
category" (or non-defense category) includes all discretionary budget authority not included in the defense 
budget function 050. 

BBEDCA includes requirements for OMB to adjust the caps for changes in concepts and definitions and 
for appropriations designated by the Congress and the President as either emergency requirements or for 
Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. BBEDCA also specifies adjustments to the 
caps for appropriations for continuing disability reviews and redeterminations by the Social Security 
Administration; the health care fraud and abuse control program at the Department of Health and Human 
Services; and appropriations designated by the Congress as being for disaster relief. 

BBEDCA requires OMB to provide cost estimates of each appropriations Act in a report to the Congress 
within seven days of enactment of such Act and to publish three sequestration reports—a "preview" report 
when the President submits the Budget, an "update" report in August, including a preview estimate of the 
adjustment for disaster funding for the upcoming fiscal year, and a "final" report within 15 days after the 
end of a session of Congress (see section 100.4). 

If OMB's final discretionary sequestration report for a given fiscal year indicates that the amount of 
discretionary budget authority provided in appropriations Acts for that year exceeds the cap for that 
category in that year, the President must issue a sequestration order to eliminate the breach. See section 100 
for guidance on sequestration. 

(b) Pay-as-you-go for mandatory spending 
PAYGO requires that new legislation changing governmental receipts or mandatory spending or collections 
must be enacted on a "pay-as-you-go" basis; that is, that the cumulative effects of such legislation must not 
increase projected on-budget deficits. The PAYGO statute established special scorekeeping rules, 
scorecards, an annual report, and a sequestration requirement. 

The enforcement requirements in PAYGO are permanent, unlike the budget enforcement mechanism for 
discretionary programs, and do not impose a cap on spending or a floor on governmental receipts. Instead, 
PAYGO requires that bills reducing governmental receipts or increasing mandatory spending must be fully 
offset by enacting revenue increases or mandatory spending reductions. This requirement of deficit 
neutrality is not enforced on a bill-by-bill basis, but is based on two scorecards that tally the cumulative 
budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation over the course of a congressional session. 

The PAYGO rules also apply to the outlays resulting from changes in outyear budget authority for 
mandatory programs made in appropriations Acts (CHIMPs) and to all changes to governmental receipts 
made in appropriations Acts. 

The PAYGO rules do not apply to increases in mandatory spending or decreases in governmental receipts 
that result automatically under existing law. For example, mandatory spending for benefit programs, such 
as unemployment insurance, rises when the population of eligible beneficiaries rises, and many benefit 
payments are automatically increased for inflation under existing laws. Note, however, that increases in 
mandatory spending that result from regulations and other administrative actions are subject to 

Page 4 of Section 21 OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) 


SECTION 21—OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION 

Administrative PAYGO under OMB Memorandum M-20-06, as explained in section 31.3. Also, if the 
Congress designates a provision of mandatory spending or governmental receipts legislation as an 
emergency requirement, the effect of the provision is not scored as PAYGO. 

Over the course of a congressional session, all PAYGO legislation is scored to determine the budgetary 
effects—costs and savings—except if exempted in law. The score for each bill is recorded by OMB on two 
PAYGO scorecards in which costs or savings are averaged over rolling five-year and 10-year periods (see 
section 100.4). OMB is required to update the scorecards on a continuous basis. 

In addition, within 14 business days after the end of a congressional session, OMB is required to issue an 
annual PAYGO report and determine whether a violation of the PAYGO requirement has occurred. If costs 
exceed savings in the budget year column of either scorecard, the President is required to issue a 
sequestration order implementing across-the-board cuts to nonexempt mandatory programs by an amount 
sufficient to offset the net costs on the PAYGO scorecard. This sequestration process is separate from that 
described above for a breach of the discretionary caps. 

(c) Congressional enforcement procedures 
Congress has procedural requirements for bills to advance through the legislative process. Agencies may 
be asked to develop cost estimates to inform the Congress of the budgetary effects of potential legislation. 
For more information on congressional enforcement procedures see section 10.5 in this circular and the 
section on Congressional Action in the "Budget Concepts" chapter in the Analytical Perspectives volume 
of the Budget. 

21.5 What resources are available to help me score legislation? 
The general concepts used by scorekeepers are found throughout Circular A-11, including the resources 
cited below. Your OMB representative can provide assistance in applying the concepts, rules, and 
conventions for scoring legislation. 

Appendix A, Scorekeeping Guidelines, is used by the House and Senate Budget Committees, CBO, and 
OMB in measuring compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA), as amended; the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), as amended; and the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. 

Appendix B, Budgetary Treatment of Lease-Purchases and Leases of Capital Assets, is also used to assist 
in scoring legislative authority to enter into a variety of leasing contracts. 

Section 20.4 addresses a variety of scoring concepts, including reappropriations, cancellations and 
rescissions, and transfers. 

Additional information on PAYGO and the special rules for certain PAYGO estimates can be found on the 
OMB website. 

21.6 When are scores of legislation due to OMB? 
Mandatory and governmental receipt proposals for the Budget. OMB requires that all proposals included 
in the Budget be scored and included in the appropriate transmittal code in MAX A-11 Data Entry by the 
deadlines provided in the annual budget season guidance. See section 79.3 for information on transmittal 
codes. The schedule for the 2021 Budget can be found in section 25. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) Page 5 of Section 21 


SECTION 21—OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION 

Enacted authorizing legislation. Agencies should work with their OMB representative to finalize PAYGO 
estimates by no more than two weeks after legislation is signed into law. Agencies should follow legislation 
affecting their programs as it moves through the congressional process in order to identify difficult scoring 
issues as soon as possible and to be prepared to provide scores in a timely manner to meet the requirements 
outlined in section 21.4(b). 

Discretionary appropriations. The annual budget formulation schedule requires the annual appropriations 
request in time to complete the President's Budget. In addition, throughout the appropriations season, and 
particularly upon enactment of full-year appropriations Acts, agencies are required to work with their OMB 
representatives to resolve any questions on scoring effects so that OMB can meet the statutory reporting 
requirements as outlined above in section 21.4(a).

Government Act (section 22.6). 

Requires agency congressional budget justification summary tables to be machine readable (section 
22.6). 

Reminds agencies to post congressional budget justifications at a vanity URL (section 22.6). 

22.1 Confidentiality of budget deliberations 
The nature and amounts of the President's decisions and the underlying materials are confidential. Do not 
release the President's decisions outside of your agency until the Budget is transmitted to the Congress. 
The materials underlying those decisions may not be released at any time, except in accordance with this 
section. In addition, outyear discretionary data is considered pre-decisional and may not be released without 
prior OMB approval. (For additional information on the confidentiality of pre-decisional budget 
information, please consult OMB Memorandum M–01–17 of April 25, 2001.) 

Presidential decisions on current and budget year estimates (other than forecasts of items that will be 
transmitted formally later), both in total and in detail, become the "proposed appropriations" as that term is 
used in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended, and must be justified by your agency. Do 
not release agency justifications provided to OMB and any agency future year plans or long-range estimates 
to anyone outside the Executive Branch, except in accordance with this section. 

Section 51.16 confirms and clarifies the application of this section to pre-decisional, deliberative budget 
information relating to the Inspectors General. 

22.2 Congressional testimony and communications 
The Executive Branch communications that led to the President's budgetary decisions will not be disclosed 
either by the agencies or by those who have prepared the budget. In addition, agency justifications provided 
to OMB and any agency future year plans or long-range estimates will not be furnished to anyone outside 
the Executive Branch, except in accordance with this section. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 22 


SECTION 22—COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC 
AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS 

When furnishing information on appropriations and budgetary matters, you (and your agency 
representatives) must be aware of the following limitation on communications: 

"...An officer or employee of an agency may submit to Congress or a committee of Congress an 
appropriations estimate or request, a request for an increase in that estimate or request, or a 
recommendation on meeting the financial needs of the Government only when requested by either 
House of Congress" (31 U.S.C. § 1108(e)). 

You must also be aware of restrictions on communications to influence legislation that are not conducted 
through proper official channels (18 U.S.C. § 1913). 

After formal transmittal of the budget, an amendment, or a supplemental appropriations request, the 
following policies apply when testifying before any congressional committee or communicating with 
Members of the Congress: 

• 
Witnesses will give frank and complete answers to all questions. 
• 
Witnesses will avoid volunteering personal opinions that reflect positions inconsistent with the 
President's program or appropriation request. 
• 
If statutory provisions exist for the direct submission of the agency budget request to the Congress, 
OMB may provide you additional materials supporting the President's Budget request that you will 
forward to the Congress with the agency testimony. Witnesses will be prepared to explain the 
agency submission, the request in the President's Budget, and any justification material. 
• 
When responding to specific questions on program and appropriations requests, witnesses will not 
provide the agency's request to OMB or plans for the use of appropriations that exceed the 
President's request. Typically, witnesses are responsible for one or a few programs, whereas the 
President is responsible for all the needs of the Federal Government. Where appropriate, witnesses 
will explain this difference in perspective and that it is therefore not appropriate for them to support 
appropriations above the President's request. 
• 
When asked to provide a written response that involves a statement of opinion on program and 
appropriations requests, witnesses will provide a reply through the agency head. 
• 
Do not let your communications be perceived as an "appropriations estimate or request ... or an 
increase in that estimate or request" (31 U.S.C. § 1108). You are expected to support the President's 
budgetary decisions and seek adjustments to those decisions only through established procedures if 
your agency head determines such action is necessary. 
22.3 Clearance of materials for the Congress and the media 
Policy consistency between the President's Budget and the budget-related materials prepared for the 
Congress and the media is essential. To ensure this consistency, you are required to submit budget-related 
materials to OMB for clearance prior to transmittal to congressional committees, individual Members of 
the Congress or their staff, or the media. Unless a specific exemption is approved by OMB, materials 
subject to OMB clearance include: 

• 
All budget justifications and budget-related oversight materials; 
• 
Testimony before and letters to congressional committees; 
Page 2 of Section 22 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 22—COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC 
AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS 

• 
Written responses to congressional inquiries or other materials for the record; 
• 
Materials responding to committee and subcommittee reporting requirements; 
• 
Capability statements; 
• 
Appeals letters; 
• 
Reprogramming requests; 
• 
Related cost information; 
• 
Financial management documents addressing budget and policy issues (e.g., some accountability 
reports or transmittal documents for audited financial statements); and 
• 
Proposed press releases relating to the President's Budget. 
Provide this information to OMB as far in advance as feasible and no less than five working days in advance 
to allow adequate review time. Performance and Accountability Reports must be provided 10 days in 
advance unless a shorter period is approved by OMB. OMB review of reprogramming requests may take 
longer in some circumstances (e.g., if the request has not been coordinated or if supporting materials have 
not been provided concurrently). In exceptional circumstances, where the response time is very short, 
agencies may request oral clearance or make other arrangements for expedited review. Immediately after 
the budget transmittal and after subsequent transmittals, provide OMB with a schedule of anticipated 
congressional reviews that require agency oral and written participation. Revise this schedule as 
appropriate. 

Address any questions you have about this subsection to the OMB representatives whom you normally 
consult on budget-related matters. 

22.4 Clearance of changes to the President's Budget 
If you want to propose changes to the President's Budget (e.g., appropriations language, limitations, balance 
sheets required by the Government Corporation Control Act, and dollar amounts), you must follow the 
confidentiality and clearance guidance provided in this section and submit a written request as described in 
section 110.3. OMB will notify you whether a formal transmittal of the change will be made. 

When it is possible to reduce the amount of an appropriations request before action has been taken by the 
Appropriations Committee of either House, the head of your agency must inform OMB promptly. Before 
your agency head decides to request restoration of a reduction, the reasons for the reduction, the 
circumstances under which it was made, and its significance to the President's program should be carefully 
considered. 

22.5 Information available to the public 
Agency budget documents that are subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) may be exempt from 
mandatory release pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). Depending on the nature of the record requested, other 
FOIA exemptions may apply. When deciding whether to withhold a budget document that is exempt from 
mandatory release, follow the FOIA memorandum issued by the President on January 21, 2009 and the 
FOIA guidance issued by the Attorney General on March 19, 2009. Any discretionary decision by an 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 3 of Section 22 


SECTION 22—COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC 
AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS 

agency to disclose protected information should be made only after full and deliberate consideration of the 
institutional interests that could be implicated by disclosure, as well as after consultation with OMB. 
Agency heads are responsible for determining the propriety of record releases under FOIA. 

Certain agencies headed by a collegial body are required to hold their meetings open to public observation 
unless the agency properly determines that the matter to be discussed warrants the closing of those meetings 
for reasons enumerated in the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. § 552b). Some meetings covered 
by that Act may pertain to budgetary information discussed in this Circular. Although, as with the FOIA, 
it is not possible to determine merely by the generic category of such information whether such an agency 
would be authorized to close a particular meeting covered by the Act, agencies must review those situations 
that involve budgetary information under the guidelines in the paragraph above and 5 U.S.C. § 552b(c). 
Such agencies are responsible for the propriety of determinations under these guidelines and provisions. 

22.6 Congressional budget justifications 
Congressional budget justification materials must include or be structured as the performance plan 
submission (section 240). In addition, agencies must include the additional information described below, 
as well as detailed descriptions of agencies' activities and proposals at the program, project, and activity 
level. 

(a) Materials for performance plan submission to the Congress 
Consult with your congressional representatives to agree on the performance plan format prior to submitting 
your congressional justification. Please also note the applicable public posting and notification 
requirements that apply to performance plans as detailed in section 22.6(c). Your OMB representative 
should be included in those consultations as appropriate. Accordingly, your OMB representative should be 
provided with your proposed justification to the Congress with sufficient time for review. 

(b) Material to be included in congressional budget justifications 
Consistent with 41 U.S.C. § 1703(h), identify funding levels requested for education and training of the 
acquisition workforce in your budget justifications to the Congress. 

Consistent with 42 U.S.C. § 8255, identify funds requested for energy conservation measures in your budget 
justifications to the Congress. 

Agencies should develop, for online posting in FY 2021, machine-readable (CSV, XML, TSV, or JSON) 
file(s) for the budget summary table(s) that normally accompany the congressional budget justification, 
including footnotes (please see section 220.22 for a definition of machine-readable format). Please work 
with your OMB representative on timelines and plans for preparing this machine readable information. 

Agencies are reminded of the reporting requirements of the Good Accounting Obligation in Government 
Act (Public Law 115-414). This Act requires agencies to include, in their congressional budget 
justifications, information on recommendations from the Government Accountability Office and the Office 
of Inspector General of the agency. Information on outstanding GAO and IG recommendations is available 
from agency Offices of Inspectors General, GAO.gov, or oversight.gov. 

Provide the Congress with information to assess current and proposed capital projects that is consistent with 
the Administration's budget proposals, including: appropriate information on planning; budgeting, 
including the current or proposed use of incremental or full funding; acquisition; and management of the 
projects.

SECTION 22—COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC 
AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS 

You must submit all budget justification materials to OMB for clearance before transmitting them to the 
Congress. 

(c) Availability of congressional budget justifications 
Make your full congressional budget justification materials, including your performance plan submission, 
available to the public and post the materials on the Internet at a vanity URL (for example 
agencyXYZ.gov/CJ) within two weeks after transmittal of those materials to the Congress. Release of these 
materials must be done in accordance with the requirements of this section and any relevant provisions of 
law. Materials will not be released if disclosure is prohibited by statute, the materials are classified or must 
be kept secret in the interest of national security or foreign policy, or the materials are otherwise exempt 
from release pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).

Summary of Changes 

Removes the reference to R&D crosscut data; this information continues to be collected via BDR in 
the spring (section 25.5). 


25.1 Does Part 2 (Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates) apply to me? 
By law (31 U.S.C. 1104), the President's budget must include information on all agencies of all three 
branches of the Federal Government. Therefore, the instructions in Part 2 generally apply to all Government 
agencies. In addition, these instructions apply to the District of Columbia, which must submit information 
in support of Federal payments to the District. OMB includes the information submitted by certain agencies 
in the budget without change. In addition, Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) submit some of the 
information required of Government agencies on a comparable basis, and OMB includes it in the budget 
for information purposes. 

If your agency appears in the following list, it is not subject to Executive Branch review by law or custom. 
That means that the requirements for submitting materials in support of your budget request do not apply 
to you. However, you do need to submit the information required for inclusion in the budget database and 
documents, which OMB incorporates without revision. 

• 
Legislative Branch agencies. 
• 
Judicial Branch agencies. 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) Page 1 of Section 25 


SECTION 25—SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS

• 
Federal home loan banks. 
• 
Financing Corporation. 
• 
Resolution Funding Corporation. 
Contact your OMB representative if you have questions about the applicability of these instructions. 

25.2 How do I get an exception? 
For the sake of comparability among the budget data and presentations, OMB does not grant many 
exceptions to the specific requirements in this Part. However, if you believe special circumstances warrant 
an exception in your case, submit a written request detailing the circumstances and the specific exception 
needed to your OMB representative by August 1. If OMB approves the exception, it is valid only for the 
specified budget. 

25.3 For what items do I need advance approval? 
You must get advance approval from your OMB representative for the items shown in the table below. 

Item See section... Timing 
(1) Form and content of justification materials. 51.2 To be determined in consultation with 
your OMB representative. 
(2) Program activity structure in the program and 
financing schedule. 
82.5 By October 1. 
(3) Changes in functional and receipt classifications. 79.4 By October 1. 
(4) Changes in budget account structure (new 
accounts, merged accounts, changes in account titles, 
etc.). 
79.4 By October 1 or as soon as possible 
thereafter for changes dependent on 
congressional action or other 
circumstances beyond agency control. 

25.4 How do I submit information to OMB? 
You generally submit information in two stages: 

(1) As part of your budget request. Both Executive Branch agencies that are subject to Executive 
Branch review and the District of Columbia must prepare information and materials supporting their 
budget request. Your OMB representative will work with you to determine the specific form, content, 
Page 2 of Section 25 OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) 


SECTION 25—SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS 

and timing of this information. Agencies that are not subject to Executive Branch review are not 
required to submit this information. 

(2) After passback. Passback usually occurs around the end of November. In early-mid November, 
OMB issues detailed guidance and deadlines to complete CY and BY information. This stage includes 
MAX computer data, print materials, and additional information used to prepare the budget documents 
and supporting database. Also, you may need to revise and resubmit some materials included in the 
budget request to reflect the effects of final decisions. Agencies that are not subject to Executive Branch 
review need to submit information for inclusion in the budget documents and the budget database. 
In the following sections, we tell you more about each stage, the items required, the criteria for determining 
whether the item applies to your agency, and where to find more detailed guidance on the item. 

25.5 What do I include in the budget request to OMB? 
You should include the information described below. In addition, your OMB representative may require 
you to include other materials (for example, information about your budget request by account and Budget 
Enforcement Act (BEA) category).

to Executive Branch review (see section 25.1). 
2 If final decisions require changes to this information, revised materials must be submitted. 

25.6 How do I build the MAX database? 
(a) Overview 
After the President has considered the estimates and made his decisions, you will be notified. You submit 
two types of information after passback, as explained in more detail in the following sections: 

• 
MAX data, submitted through the MAX budget data system (see sections 79-86). 
• 
Print materials, which OMB uses to prepare parts of the budget Appendix (see section 95). 
If the decisions affect other budget accounts (such as the amount of transfers), you need to coordinate these 
changes with whomever is responsible for the budget submission of those other accounts. 

When you are informed of the President's decisions, your agency head will determine the best and most 
appropriate distribution of amounts that have been left flexible. This Circular does not address the process 
by which you appeal passback decisions. We issue separate guidance on the appeals process at the time of 
passback. 

(b) Timing 
The core information in the PY column must be completed by mid-November (see Key Dates). In mid-
early November OMB issues detailed guidance and deadlines for completing all MAX database schedules. 
These deadlines are based on the very tight schedule that OMB must maintain in order to transmit the 
budget in a timely manner. In order to meet the deadlines, you must begin providing the required 
information based on passback decisions. Do not wait until you have resolved appeals. Appeals generally 
affect very little of the information you submit, and you will have an opportunity to change the information 
as necessary to reflect the appeal resolution. Unless your OMB representative agrees, do not submit 

Page 4 of Section 25 OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) 


SECTION 25—SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS 

information that assumes an appeal resolution different from passback. When an appeal results in changes 
to passback decisions, the changes often differ from the agency proposal. 

(c) MAX data 
You must submit the MAX computer data described below for each applicable budget account. In addition, 
if the criterion listed in the first column of the table applies to you, submit the data described in the second 
column for each applicable budget account. We indicate the MAX data schedule or schedules involved and 
tell you where to find guidance on the requirement.

OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) Page 5 of Section 25 


SECTION 25—SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS 

Print materials include these items printed in the Budget Appendix: 

• 
Appropriations language. You must submit language for each account for which appropriations or 
limitation language was enacted in the CY or is proposed in the CY or BY, including supplemental 
appropriations requests. You must also submit any general provisions that pertain to you (see 
section 95). 
• 
Narrative statements, footnotes, and tables. You must provide a narrative statement for each 
account with activity in the current or budget year and separate statements for supplemental requests, 
rescission proposals, and items proposed for later transmittal. You may be required to provide tables 
and footnotes that are not generated by MAX under certain circumstances (see section 95).

31.1 Basic policies and assumptions 
(a) What should be the basis for my proposals? 
• 
Your proposals should result from a comprehensive system that integrates analysis, planning, 
evaluation, and budgeting and should reflect the results of the agency's annual strategic reviews 
as appropriate (see section 270 for more on strategic reviews). In developing the estimates, 
consider the effect that demographic, economic, or other changes can have on program levels 
beyond the budget year. Be prepared to discuss the impact that program levels and changes in 
methods of program delivery, including advances in technology, will have on program 
operations and administration. Also consider the appropriate roles for Federal, State, and local 
governments, as well as the private sector, in conducting the covered activities.

SECTION 31—POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES 

• 
(b) What is the scope of the policy estimates? 
(1) Presidential policy estimates for CY and BY. 
(i) Regular annual estimates. Your regular annual estimates must reflect all requirements anticipated 
at the time of budget submission and should cover: 
• 
Continuing activities, including those that must be reauthorized for the budget year; 
• 
Authorized activities that are proposed for the budget year; 
• 
Amounts necessary to meet specific financial liabilities imposed by law; and 
• 
Decreases for activities proposed for termination or reduction. 
(ii) Supplemental proposals. You should make every effort to conduct your programs within the 
amounts appropriated for the current year and to postpone actions that require supplemental 
appropriations. OMB will only consider supplemental requests that meet the criteria provided in 
section 110. 
(2) Presidential policy outyear estimates. 
Policy estimates for the nine years following the budget year (BY+1 through BY+9) enable an analysis 
of the long-term consequences of proposed program or tax policy initiatives. When you develop 
outyear policy estimates, they should be consistent with the general policies and information required 
for the budget year and indicate the degree to which specific policy decisions made for the budget year 
or any subsequent year affect budget authority, outlay, and receipt outyear levels. For mandatory 
estimates, take into consideration changes in spending trends, economic assumptions, and other actions 
or events when you prepare estimates of budget authority, outlays, and receipts for BY+1 through 
BY+9. For discretionary budget authority estimates, unless directed otherwise, assume that MAX will 
generate the outyears using current inflation factors. 

(b) What economic assumptions should I use when I develop estimates? 
All budget materials, including those for the outyear policy and baseline estimates, must be consistent with 
the economic assumptions provided by OMB. The specific guidance below applies to outyear policy 
estimates. 

OMB policy permits consideration of price changes for goods and services as a factor in developing 
estimates. However, this does not mean that you should automatically include an allowance for the full 
rate of anticipated inflation in your request. 

For mandatory programs, reflect the full inflation rate where such an allowance is required by law and there 
has been no decision to propose less than required. For discretionary programs, you may include an 
allowance for the full rate of anticipated inflation, an allowance for less than the full rate, or even no 
allowance for inflation. In many cases, you must make trade-offs between budgeting increases for inflation 
versus other increases for programmatic purposes. Unless OMB determines otherwise, you must prepare 
your budget requests to OMB within the budget planning guidance levels provided to you, regardless of the 
effect of inflation. 

Economic assumptions may be revised shortly before final budget decisions are made. These revisions will 
not usually result in changes to the previous budget guidance on your agency totals. 

See sections 32 and 85 for personnel assumptions and costs.

SECTION 31—POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES 

31.2 Advance appropriations 
Do not request advance appropriations if the only purpose is to shift budget authority for a program that 
would normally be provided in the budget year. For example, if you would normally request budget 
authority in the budget year to cover a cohort of obligations for a grant program, even though some of the 
obligations will not be incurred until the following fiscal year, you may not request an advance 
appropriation to cover the obligations expected to be incurred in the following fiscal year. 

31.3 Administrative PAYGO 
Administrative PAYGO is a budget neutrality requirement for executive branch discretionary 
administrative actions affecting net mandatory spending. This requirement is established in Executive Order 
13893 Increasing Government Accountability for Administrative Actions by Reinvigorating Administrative 
PAYGO and additional implementation guidance is available to agencies in OMB Memorandum M-20-06 
and Budget Procedures Memorandum 986. 

E.O 13893 requires agencies to submit proposed administrative actions to OMB for Administrative 
PAYGO review. In addition, you are required to include with your budget submission a list of all planned 
or anticipated administrative actions that would increase mandatory spending (see section 25.5). 
31.4 Equal opportunity 
Your estimates should reflect the Administration's commitment to programs designed to ensure or promote 
equal opportunity regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including pregnancy and gender 
identity), disability, age, sexual orientation, genetic information, or any other non-merit-based factor. These 
activities include the following: implementation of statutes or regulations requiring fair housing; 
nondiscrimination in federally assisted or conducted programs; equal credit opportunity; full voting rights; 
civil and Constitutional rights; equal employment opportunity (including nondiscrimination by Federal 
agencies); and efforts to increase Federal contracting and subcontracting opportunities for minorities, 
women, and disadvantaged entrepreneurs. 

31.5 Full funding 
Requests for acquisition of capital assets must propose full funding to cover the full costs of the project or 
a useful segment of the project, consistent with the policy stated in the Capital Programming Guide. 
Specifically, requests for procurement programs must provide for full funding of the entire cost. In addition, 
requests for construction programs must provide for full funding of the complete cost of construction. You 
should not submit estimates for construction funds for major construction projects unless planning will 
reach a point by the end of the current year that will ensure that a contract for construction could be awarded 
during the budget year. Remember that Administration policy and the Antideficiency Act require you to 
have sufficient budget authority or other budgetary resources to cover the full amount of unconditional 
obligations under any contract. Additionally, agencies must comply with the Recording Statute (31 U.S.C. 
1501). 

For policies related to leases of capital assets and lease-purchases, see section 31.9 and Appendix B. For 
guidance on budget submissions for capital asset acquisitions, see section 51.19. For guidance on principles 
and techniques of planning, budgeting, procurement, and management of capital assets, see the supplement 
to this Circular, the Capital Programming Guide. 

31.6 Government perquisites 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) Page 3 of Section 31 


SECTION 31—POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES 

Your estimates should reflect Administration policy to limit the use of Government vehicles, Government 
aircraft, travel, executive dining facilities, conferences, real property, and fleet management in accordance 
with Bulletin No. 93-11 "Fiscal Responsibility and Reducing Perquisites." 

31.7 Multi-year appropriations 
Consider whether it is appropriate to request appropriations with multi-year availability, particularly for 
buildings, equipment, and other types of fixed capital assets, including major computer and 
telecommunications systems, with long acquisition cycles. Where multi-year appropriations requests are 
appropriate, you should match the period of availability to the expected length of the acquisition cycle. 

31.8 Management improvement initiatives and policies 
Your estimates should reflect your efforts and planned action to strengthen management and improve 
program performance. Guidance on specific areas is provided below. 

• 
Capital planning and investment control. Agency estimates should reflect the Administration's 
commitment to information technology (IT) investments that directly support agency missions as 
identified in the agency's Information Resources Management (IRM) Strategic Plan, specified in OMB 
Circular A-130, which should fully describe all IT resources at the agency, be prepared in a manner 
consistent with the CIO role and CIO review described on page 11 of OMB memorandum M-15-14

Data Policy – Managing Information as an Asset." Your estimates should also reflect work necessary 
to meet the requirements of OMB Memorandum M-12-18 "Managing Government Records Directive," 
OMB Circular A-130, the E-Government Act, and OMB's guidance. Initiatives should create a 
customer-centered electronic presence (maximizing the reuse of current assets) and advancing the 
strategy identified in the IRM plan. 
• 
Security. Your estimates should reflect a comprehensive understanding of OMB security policies, such 
as OMB Circular A-130, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance, 
including compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, and OMB 
Memorandum M-17-05, "Fiscal Year 2016-2017 Guidance on Federal Information Security and 
Privacy Management Requirements," by: 
• 
Reflecting the cost considerations used to calculate IT security costs (see section 51.19); 
• 
Demonstrating that the costs of security controls are understood and are explicitly incorporated in 
the life-cycle planning of the overall system, including the additional costs of employing standards 
and guidance more stringent than those issued by NIST; 
• 
Demonstrating how the agency ensures that risks are understood and continually assessed;

externally accessible systems, and those that are interconnected with systems over which program 
officials have little or no control; and 
• 
Demonstrating how the agency ensures the effective use of security and privacy controls, as well 
as authentication tools to protect privacy for those systems that promote or permit public access. 
• 
Privacy. Your estimates should reflect the Administration's commitment to privacy and consistent with 
OMB Circular A-130, should include a description of your agency's privacy program and the resources 
required to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements, develop and evaluate privacy 
policy, and manage privacy risks. At a minimum, your estimate should: 
• 
Demonstrate that your agency is aware of applicable privacy requirements and has fully assessed 
the cost to the agency for ensuring compliance with those requirements and managing privacy risks; 
• 
Reflect the consideration of your agency's inventory of information systems that create, collect, 
use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of personally identifiable 
information; and 
• 
Reflect the consideration of your privacy continuous monitory strategy and the resources and 
associated costs required to ensure that privacy controls are effectively monitored on an ongoing 
basis at an assessment frequency sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable privacy 
requirements and to manage privacy risks. 
• 
Improper Payments. Your estimates should reflect anticipated reductions in improper payments as 
reported in the Performance and Accountability Report pursuant to the Improper Payments Information 
Act of 2002, as amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) 
and the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA). 
• 
Systems Modernization Projects. For either implementation or planning activities for areas in which 
there is a pre-designated/designated Quality Service Management Office, specifically, core financial 
management, grants management, cybersecurity, and civilian human resources transaction services,

Page 6 of Section 31 OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) 


SECTION 31—POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES 

(c) Construction in the District of Columbia 
You must consult the Commission of Fine Arts regarding plans for the construction of buildings and other 
structures in the District of Columbia that may affect in any important way the appearance of the city, and 
other questions involving artistic considerations with which the Federal Government is concerned. 

(d) Acquisition of land in the National Capital Area 
You must consult with the National Capital Planning Commission in advance regarding proposed 
developments and projects or commitments for the acquisition of land in the National Capital area, in 
accordance with 40 U.S.C. 8723(a) (see http://www.ncpc.gov). 

(e) Leasing capital assets 
If you propose to lease capital assets rather than purchase them, you should check the requirements in OMB 
Circular A–94. For additional information on the budgetary treatment of leases, see Appendix B. 

(f) Real property acquisition 
If you plan to acquire real property, you must: 
• 
Include estimates consistent with the policies of Executive Orders 13327 and 13834 in your 
budget submission; and 
• 
Make sure that estimates for acquisition of real property under contract are consistent with 
obligations reported in object class 32 (see section 83.7). 
31.10 Hospital costs 
If you are developing estimates for hospital costs: 

• 
Use data based on the use of resources allocated by diagnosis-related groups and compare these 
data with payment rates of other payers using similar groupings; 
•

allocation method underlying the data; and 
• 
Identify the amount of reimbursement collected from third parties and Federal agencies if you 
provide hospital care on a reimbursable basis. 
If you provide estimates for inpatient care facilities and medical care services, make sure they are consistent 
with Executive Order 12372. 

31.11 Advisory committees and interagency groups 
If you have advisory committees and interagency groups: 

• 
Reflect the results of the committee reviews required by Executive Order 12838, which requires 
agencies to reduce the number and cost of non-statutory advisory committees; 
• 
Use the ceilings established by OMB Circular A–135; and 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) Page 7 of Section 31 


SECTION 31—POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES 

• 
Separately identify the costs of advisory committees established by statute that you are 
proposing for termination. 
You are prohibited from financing interagency groups (including boards (except Federal Executive Boards), 
commissions, councils, committees, and similar groups) by contributions from member agencies' 
appropriations by a Government-wide general provision unless such financing is specifically authorized by 
statute. Therefore, you must propose financing for such groups in the budget in one of the following forms: 

• 
Appropriations specifically for the interagency group. 
• 
Specific language authorizing interagency funding. 
31.12 Radio spectrum-dependent communications-electronics systems 
The value of radio spectrum required for radio spectrum-dependent communications-electronics systems 
should be considered, in economic analyses of alternative systems/solutions.1 In some cases, greater 
investments in systems could enhance Federal spectrum efficiency (e.g., purchase of more expensive radios 
that use less bandwidth); in other cases, the desired service could be met through other forms of supply 
(e.g., private wireless services or use of land lines). Therefore, to identify solutions that have the highest 
net benefits, agencies should consider greater investment to increase spectrum efficiency along with cost 
minimizing strategies. To this end, section 6411 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act 
directed that A–11 be updated with sections (a) and (c). Subsection (b) provides a methodology for 
determining a baseline to evaluate improvements in spectrum efficiency. 

(a) Guidance for Determining Value of Spectrum-Dependent Assets 
To ensure the Federal Government demonstrates proper stewardship of the spectrum resource in its 
procurement decisions, and thus yield improvements in overall Federal spectrum management and use, 
agencies must include in the development of their budget justifications for procurement of major radio 
spectrum-dependent communications-electronics systems consideration of the economic value of the 
spectrum being used.2 The extent of economic and budget analysis required will depend upon the nature 
and value of the systems and spectrum involved, and agencies should work with their OMB contacts to 
ensure a proper level of analysis is conducted.3 

To demonstrate consideration of the value of the relevant spectrum, agencies should indicate whether the 
system procured was the most spectrum "efficient" solution among those qualified bids (i.e., that met 
specified mission/operational requirements); if an agency is unable to so indicate, then the agency should 
indicate the investment difference between the solution chosen and the more spectrum "efficient" qualified 
solution. To further advance Federal stewardship of the spectrum resource, agencies should also include 
the following in their budget justifications for procurement of major radio spectrum-dependent 
communications-electronics systems: 

1 Circular A–11 reflects language recommended by the Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee, pursuant to 

section 6411 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. 

2 Agencies should work with their OMB contacts to identify the new and/or existing systems that will use the A–11 methodology 

to determine the economic value of spectrum use. Agencies should give priority to systems that operate or plan to operate in 

frequencies below 3 Gigahertz that have been identified by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 

for potential repurposing to commercial use and those that have primary status within a particular band. 

3 As a starting point, agencies should estimate the economic value of spectrum utilized by a system using the methodology 
included in subsection (b). 

Page 8 of Section 31 OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) 


SECTION 31—POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES 

• 
In a Request for Proposal (RFP)4 to procure the system, the requirement that respondents 
address spectrum "efficiency" factors (e.g., greater adjacent band compatibility, less use of 
bandwidth, etc.) and assess trade-offs between investment in equipment and spectrum 
requirements. 
• 
Whether the system will share spectrum with other Federal or non-Federal systems/operations 
and, if so, the nature and extent of the sharing relationship. 
• 
When proposing a new system, whether using an existing or alternative Federal system to meet 
the capability requirement is possible, or whether using capabilities of similar Federal users has 
been considered. 
• 
When replacing systems, what improvements in spectrum "efficiency" and "effectiveness" exist 
compared to the prior system. 
• 
Certification of consideration of non-spectrum dependent or commercial alternatives to meet 
mission/operational requirements. 
Spectrum should be considered to have value and be included, to the extent practical, in economic analyses 
of alternative systems/solutions. In some cases, greater investments in systems could enhance Federal 
system spectrum efficiency (e.g., purchase of radios that use less bandwidth); in other cases, the desired 
service can be met with other forms of supply (e.g., private wireless services or use of land lines). In addition 
to considering cost minimizing strategies, agencies are encouraged to consider whether the investment 
would provide net benefits. 

(b) Methodology for Determining a Baseline to Evaluate Improvements in Efficiency 
The purpose of this section is to provide a methodology to evaluate relative spectrum efficiency when 
considering alternatives for procuring systems, as called for by subsection (a), or when evaluating spectrum 
usage generally. The methodology does not attempt to measure or judge the overall benefits of a Federal 
activity that utilizes spectrum-dependent systems to achieve mission functions nor does it attempt to 
establish a dollar value or auction price. Instead, the method outlined in this section provides agencies a 
way to evaluate improvements in spectrum efficiency in implementing their required and essential 
activities. Also, agencies may develop alternative methods for measuring spectrum efficiency and submit 
them to OMB for approval. 

One method for determining spectrum efficiency when assessing procurement of Federal systems is to 
develop a baseline that measures: 1) the technical characteristics of the frequency used by the system, 2) 
the population of an area where spectrum is utilized, 3) the size of the spectrum frequency band or bands 
used, and 4) the percentage of overall spectrum capacity utilized within that band or bands. The following 
method can be used to determine a score in these terms that agencies may use in their procurement processes 
and budget documents as required in subsection (a)5: 

1. Determine a weighting factor to assign to frequency used. Agencies should use Table 1 to 
assign a weighting factor to the frequency utilized by the system. 
Table 1: Example Frequency Weighting Factors 

4 Any efficiency factors included in RFP respondents' proposal that are selected should also be included as terms of the final 

contracts. 
5 Subsection (a) reflects language recommended by the Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee, which is being 
included in A–11 pursuant to section 6411 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) Page 9 of Section 31 


SECTION 31—POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES 

Frequency (MHz) Weighting Factors 
0-500 0.05 
500-2999 1.00 
3000-5999 0.50 
6000 and above 0.10 

2. Estimate population impacted by Federal use. Agencies should estimate the U.S. population in 
the service area where the Federal system will be used. Agencies should use U.S. Census Bureau 
population information by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or other relevant designation for 
non-metropolitan areas to develop estimates. Systems that operate partially in the U.S. should only 
count the U.S. population impacted. For example, a system that only operates in Denver and does 
not utilize spectrum outside of the Denver MSA, should only use the population information for 
the Denver MSA in estimating population affected. Conversely, agencies should use population 
information for the entire country, if a system is assigned or utilizes spectrum nationwide. 
3. Estimate percentage of the spectrum frequency band used by a Federal system. Agencies 
should identify the percentage of bandwidth utilized by a Federal system. This percentage should 
include the total amount of bandwidth needed to operate the system in terms of megahertz divided 
by the total available spectrum (in megahertz) available for the system, regardless of whether that 
spectrum is necessary to support transmitting or receiving equipment. If more than one band will 
be used, the percentage should include the total amount of bandwidth needed in each band, divided 
by the total available spectrum across all bands used. To the extent possible this calculation should 
include necessary guard bands. 
Estimate percentage of overall spectrum capacity utilized. Within those spectrum bands used 
by a Federal system, agencies should identify the percentage of overall spectrum capacity utilized. 
This may be done by estimating the average percentage of time in a day when the Federal system 
is expected to operate, by estimating the average percentage of the total data capacity within that 
band the Federal system is expected to use, or both. For each frequency assignment agencies are 
required to provide estimated time of use based on the guidance provided in Table 2. 

Table 2: Guidance on Time of Use 
Frequency of Actual Use Percentage of Time Used per Day 
Constant or nearly constant 50 to 100 
Regular/Frequent 10 to 50 
Intermittent 1 to 10 
Sporadic/occasional Less than 1 

Multiply the frequency weighting factor by population, frequency bandwidth, and utilization. 
To calculate the baseline to evaluate spectrum efficiency improvements, multiply together the 
preceding four factors. The product provides a baseline that can be used to evaluate the extent of 
efficiency gains, as discussed in subsection (a). When comparing to systems with the same 
capability, a higher weighting would be considered less efficient. 

(c) Spectrum Certification 
Page 10 of Section 31 OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) 


SECTION 31—POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES 

You must obtain a certification by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(NTIA) of the Department of Commerce, or your agency as designated by NTIA, that the radio frequencies 
required can be made available before you submit estimates for the development or procurement of major 
radio spectrum-dependent communication-electronics systems. The NTIA, which is responsible for 
assigning spectrum to Federal users, may also review these analyses, during the assignment process.6 

31.13 Spectrum Relocation Fund 
Relocation or modification of systems subject to Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act. For agencies 
that are affected by the reallocation of certain frequencies from Federal to commercial use, the Commercial 
Spectrum Enhancement Act (CSEA, P.L. 108–494, as amended by P.L. 112-96) streamlines the process for 
funding the relocation or modification of systems and, for certain reallocations after February 2012, for 
funding spectrum sharing (as well as relocation). Auction receipts from the sale of eligible frequencies will 
be deposited into the Spectrum Relocation Fund (SRF), unless otherwise directed by statute, and these 
funds will be used to facilitate Federal agencies' relocation or sharing. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) concluded an auction in January 2015 for licenses in the 
1695-1710 MHz and 1755–1780 MHz bands, which are eligible frequency bands under the CSEA, as 
amended, along with the non-Federal 2155-2180 MHz band (collectively, the AWS-3 bands). Under the 
amended CSEA, agency reimbursements from the SRF for these bands are proceeding in a similar manner 
as occurred for previous eligible bands, with two main changes. First, agencies may recover for certain 
pre-auction costs, including through pre-auction transfers, if identified in the agency's transition plan. 
Agencies' requests for AWS-3 pre-auction funds were submitted to the Congress in September 2014, and 
agencies became eligible for transfers from the SRF for pre-auction costs in October 2014. Second, 
agencies may recover costs for spectrum sharing, in addition to relocating or modifying systems. 

Spectrum relocation funds have no-year authority, though agencies are expected to adhere to the timeframes 
approved by OMB. In accordance with section 120, these funds must be apportioned at least annually prior 
to obligation, unless specifically exempted. Agencies that receive funds from the SRF will report their 
expenditures to OMB, concurrent with input into an annual report to the Congress to be submitted by the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce. 
Further guidance will be forthcoming on reporting requirements. 

If potential cost over-runs or delays become apparent in any spectrum relocation project, OMB and NTIA 
should be notified in order to facilitate further review. Under the terms of the CSEA, agencies may receive 
more than one transfer from the SRF, subject to prior review and approval by OMB, in consultation with 
NTIA. If the subsequent transfer or transfers exceed 10 percent of the original transfer, OMB will notify 
Congress and the Government Accountability Office, in accordance with the requirements of the CSEA. If 
transferred amounts exceed actual relocation costs, excess amounts will be returned to the SRF immediately 
after NTIA has notified the FCC that the agency's relocation is complete. 

As pertains to other frequency bands to which the CSEA applies, the FCC will notify NTIA at least 18 
months prior to the auction of eligible frequencies. Upon such notification, CSEA relocation processes will 
commence consistent with the Act, as with the above implementation. 

31.14 Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
As required by Executive Order 13532, which establishes the White House Initiative on Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), affected agencies and executive departments must produce an annual 

6 NTIA may review the economic analyses of alternative systems/solutions at any point in the NTIA authorization processes. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (REVISED—DECEMBER 2019) Page 11 of Section 31 


SECTION 31—POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES 

plan that establishes clear goals for how the agency or department intends to increase the capacity of 
HBCUs to effectively compete for grants and contracts and to encourage HBCUs to participate in Federal 
programs. 

31.15 Controlled Unclassified Information 
Agency estimates should reflect consideration of Executive Order 13556, Controlled Unclassified 
Information (CUI), and the policies issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), 
32 CFR part 2002, "Controlled Unclassified Information," with an effective date of November 14, 2016, 
and CUI Notice 2016-01, "Implementation Guidance for the Controlled Unclassified Information 
Program," September 14, 2016. The Information Security Oversight Office within NARA was designated 
as the Executive Agent to implement the CUI program that will eventually replace all existing SensitiveBut-
Unclassified (SBU) information handling regimes ("For Official Use Only, " etc.) across the Executive 
Branch. 

Agency estimates should reflect: 

• 
The hiring of full-time employees and/or contractor support to implement and manage the CUI 
Program at headquarters, regional locations, and within component agencies; 
• 
The development and deployment of automated marking tools that will ensure the uniform 
application of CUI Markings as well as ensure the timely dissemination of CUI to authorized 
recipients; 
• 
Development of internal policies to phase-in and transition to the CUI program; 
• 
The modification of agency incident reporting mechanisms and systems to include CUI categories 
and requirements; 
• 
The modification and issuance of contracts and agreements to reflect the standards of the CUI 
Program; 
•

Subsidies for Medicare Part D eligible individuals for 
qualified prescription drug coverage 

Do not assume that agency prescription drug costs for 
the agency's retirees and/or dependents will be reduced 
by the Part D program. Federal entities will not receive 
subsidies for Part D eligible individuals for qualified 
prescription drug coverage through the Retiree Drug 
Subsidy (RDS) and Federal entities will not 
administer—or have a third party administer—a 
Prescription Drug Plan or Medicare Advantage 
Prescription Drug Plan for their retirees and/or their 
dependents. 

Administration policy is that Federal Government 
entities should not receive the Medicare Part D drug 
subsidies because this would result in the Medicare 
Trust Fund cross-subsidizing other Federal programs. 
The primary rationale for creating the Part D RDS was 
to encourage employers and unions to continue to 
provide prescription drug coverage to their Medicare 
eligible retirees and their qualified dependents after the 
implementation of the Part D Program. These

Summary of Changes 

Provides guidance on the provisional pay raise estimate (section 32.1). 

Updates awards guidance (section 32.1) 

32.1 How should I estimate personnel compensation in my budget request? 
Personnel compensation 

(a) Pay scales, bonuses, allowances, and awards. For the purpose of planning agency budget requests for 
the 2021 Budget, agencies should not include a provisional estimate of the civilian pay raise for January 
2021. Agencies should consult with their OMB representative on the provisional estimate for the military 
pay raise for January 2021. In making their final estimates for the 2021 Budget, agencies should anticipate 
revising pay raise amounts after the President makes a pay raise decision. Your OMB representative will 
provide additional guidance during Budget season. The pay guidance above will apply to the statutory pay 
systems (General Schedule, Foreign Service, and Veterans Health Administration), the Executive Schedule, 
the Senior Executive Service (SES), and wage grade employees. You should be prepared to provide 
supporting detail on calculating pay costs, including separate identification of the wage base reflected in 
the submission. For compensation costs, you must explicitly justify any increases in average compensation 
for the budget year. 
In FY 2021 budget requests, agencies must provide the following information on agency-wide salary and 
awards spending: (1) an estimate of FY 2020 salary spending, excluding salary spending for Senior 
Executive Service (SES), Senior Level (SL), and Scientific or Professional (ST) positions, (2) an estimate 
of FY 2020 awards spending as a percent of FY 2020 non-SES/SL/ST salary spending, and (3) the amount 
requested for FY 2021 non-SES/SL/ST salary spending. 

Further, agency budget requests must reflect an increase in awards spending, as a percent of non-SES/SL/ST 
salary spending, from FY 2020 to FY 2021. This increase in awards spending should be no less than 1 
percentage point of FY 2021 non-SES/SL/ST salary spending. 

For example, if an agency estimates that awards spending in FY 2020 will equal 1.25 percent of FY 2020 
non-SES/SL/ST salary spending, that agency must allocate an amount towards awards equal to no less than 

2.25 percent of requested non-SES/SL/ST salary spending in FY 2021. 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 32 


SECTION 32—PERSONNEL COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND RELATED COSTS 

Consistent with these directions, agency budget requests must clearly denote: (1) the amount allocated for 
awards spending in FY 2021, and (2) the amount allocated for awards spending in FY 2021 as a percent of 
requested FY 2021 non-SES/SL/ST salary spending. 

Awards spending is defined as the sum of: (1) individual performance awards for non-SES/SL/ST 
employees (Nature of Action 840) and, (2) individual contribution awards (e.g., special act awards) for nonSES/
SL/ST employees (Nature of Action 849). 

Agencies should be prepared to supply additional information on planned and actual expenditures upon 
request by OMB. Consistent with forthcoming guidance, this increased level of awards spending will enable 
agencies to strategically plan incentive awards, bonuses, relocation, recruitment, and retention allowances 
toward rewarding high-performing employees and those with critical skill sets. 

(b) Hourly rates. For all employees (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5504(b)), use hourly rates of compensation 
determined by dividing the annual rate of basic pay by 2,087, in accordance with section 15203(a) of the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–272). 
(c) Within-grade increases. Offset the net cost, if any, of within-grade salary increases (i.e., costs after 
turnover, downgrades, and other grade or step reducing events are taken into account) by savings due to 
greater productivity and efficiency. 
(d) Vacancies. For vacancies expected to be filled in the budget year, use the entrance salary for the 
vacancies involved. 
(e) Savings in personnel compensation. Give full consideration to savings in personnel compensation due 
to personnel reductions, delay in filling vacant positions, leave without pay, lag in recruitment for new 
positions, filling vacancies at lower rates of pay, part-time employment, and grade reduction actions. 
Identify terminal leave payments, including those for SES, as offsets against such savings. 
(f) Positions above grade GS/GM–15. Reflect these positions, including SES, only to the extent that 
positions have been authorized in those grades by OPM or other authority, or are specifically authorized in 
substantive law. 
(g) Executive selection and development programs. Include in your estimates provisions for reasonable 
amounts for such programs, as required under Title IV of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and by 
implementing guidelines issued by the Office of Personnel Management. 
(h) Premium pay and overtime. Fully justify increases over amounts for the preceding year for premium 
pay. In preparing estimates for overtime, you should analyze the use of overtime to ensure that it is used 
in a prudent and efficient manner; explore all reasonable alternatives to overtime (such as improved 
scheduling); and ensure that adequate approval, monitoring, and audit procedures are in place to avoid 
overtime abuses. 
(i) Special rates for experts and consultants. Reflect these positions and rates only to the extent that they 
are authorized per 5 U.S.C. 3109. 
(j) Severance pay. Estimate severance pay at the amount needed for the fiscal year. However, obligations 
will be incurred on a pay-period by pay-period basis, notwithstanding the fact that a liability arises at the 
time of an employee's separation. Your estimates must include changes in severance pay and personnel 
compensation that would occur upon any reduction in force. 
Page 2 of Section 32 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 32—PERSONNEL COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND RELATED COSTS 

(k) Physicians comparability allowance. Reflect in your estimates approved plans to pay physicians 
comparability allowance under 5 U.S.C. 5948. Instructions for reporting on the physicians comparability 
allowance program are issued separately. 
(l) Bonuses and allowances. Reflect in your estimates approved agency plans for paying recruitment and 
relocation bonuses and retention allowances. You should be prepared to supply information on planned and 
actual expenditures upon request by OMB. 
(m) Retirement costs. Reflect in your estimates the cost effects of changes in the distribution of employees 
between the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System 
(FERS). Note that FERS contributions have changed as described in section 32.3. 
32.2 How do I treat agency benefit payments under the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act? 
For accounts subject to appropriations action, include in your budget year estimates the amount billed by 
the Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs of the Department of Labor for benefits paid on behalf of 
employees of your agency in the past year under the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act. 

For accounts not subject to appropriations action, you must pay the bill in the current year. 

32.3 How do I budget for Federal employee retirement costs? 
Agency contributions to the large retirement receipt accounts, including those managed by the Departments 
of Defense, State, Treasury, the Social Security Administration, and the Office of Personnel Management, 
should reflect the effects of changes to the agency contribution rates for employee retirement and of civilian 
and military pay raises using the provisional pay raise assumptions specified for these accounts in section 
32.1. 

Contribution rates for CSRS employees remain unchanged. 

Agencies may need to adjust estimates when final pay assumptions for the budget are released. This applies 
to: 

1. Governmental receipt accounts containing Federal employee contributions to Federal employee 
retirement; 
2. Offsetting receipt accounts (employer share, employee retirement) containing employing agency 
contributions to Federal employee retirement and Federal agency share of Social Security and 
Medicare payroll taxes; and 
3. General fund contributions to Federal employee retirement. 
FERS Contribution Rates 

Agency FERS contribution rates that became effective beginning FY 2016 can be found in Benefits 
Administration Letter 15-303 at this link: http://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publicationsforms/
benefits-administration-letters/2015/15-303.pdf. Also, see FY 2020 and FY 2021 contribution rates

SECTION 32—PERSONNEL COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND RELATED COSTS 

32.4 How do I budget for unemployment compensation? 
In general, you should not budget for the costs of unemployment compensation for former Federal civilian 
and military personnel. The congressional intent is that such unemployment compensation be paid from 
appropriations available to the employing agencies. The liable agencies must absorb these reimbursements 
when they are required to be paid. 

If you do not employ large numbers of temporary employees or other personnel expected to lead to 
significant unemployment compensation claims, your estimates for the current and budget year will not 
contain any special provisions for the costs of reimbursing the unemployment trust fund for such payments. 

If you employ large numbers of temporary employees to meet part-year workload, you may request 
approval from OMB to budget for unemployment compensation costs for your temporary employees. OMB 
will consider such requests if you can demonstrate that you have a sound administrative control system for 
unemployment compensation claims. 

32.5 How do I budget for Uniformed Services health care? 
• 
For Uniformed Services post-retirement medical care. Post-retirement medical care for "Medicareeligible" 
retirees and their dependents/survivors was funded on an accrual basis beginning in FY 
2003. Budget estimates must assume inclusion of all Medicare-eligible retirees and families. 
Agencies must calculate the following estimates for their budget submission: 
• 
Accrual contribution to the Department of Defense Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. 
• 
Estimate of the health care dollars to be expended for all retirees. 
• 
Accrual contribution to the Department of Defense Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. 
To develop appropriate annual accrual contribution estimates, agencies must use the per-capita rates 
set by the Department of Defense Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Board of Actuaries. Every 
summer, the Board sends a letter to the agencies promulgating the annual per-capita rates. Agencies 
must multiply these rates by the estimated average number of current uniformed service personnel. 
The resulting calculation is the accrual contribution, which should be budgeted in the agency’s 
personnel account. 

• 
Estimate of the health care dollars to be expended for all retirees. Agencies must estimate 
expenditures for retiree health care. (Separate estimates must be provided for Medicare-eligible 
retirees and non-Medicare-eligible retirees). The Medicare-eligible estimates are needed to develop 
the Trust Fund outlays for uniformed service health care and the non-Medicare eligible estimates to 
be included in agency budgets. To prevent double counting Medicare-eligibles, each agency must 
ensure that their health care account request does not include any amount for Medicare-eligible 
retiree health care other than the accrual contribution amounts. 
32.6 Are there other places in A–11 where I can find related guidance? 
Yes. Please see the table below for additional guidance on Federal employment.

Summary of Changes 

Updates IT Resource Statement and budget submission requirements to include CIO collaboration 
with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) and a corresponding review of IT budget data 
for privacy requirements (section 51.3). 

Requires all agencies to explain solicitations for new or modernized technologies or services that 
deviate from M-19-16 (section 51.3). 

Clarifies that Agency IT Resource Statements should be updated and submitted whenever an agency 
submits an update to its Agency IT Portfolio Summary data (section 51.3). 

Requires agencies to report on progress towards meeting requirements of the Foundations for 
Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (section 51.9). 

51.1 General requirements 
Your initial budget submission to OMB (due in September) should begin with a summary statement from 
the head of your agency and include: 

• 
The broad policies and strategies proposed and the total amounts of discretionary and mandatory 
budgetary resources requested; 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 51 


SECTION 51—BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS 

• 
The relationship of the policies, strategies, and resources requested to the planning guidance for 
budgetary resources provided by OMB; 
• 
Significant proposed differences, if any, from current Administration policies; 
• 
A thorough discussion of the evidence, both positive and negative, for major proposed policies. 
This evidence includes evaluation results, program performance indicators and performance goals, 
and other relevant data analytics and research studies; 
• 
Any significant proposals for changes in the current year budget and the relationship of such changes 
to the budget year and outyear requests; 
• 
Any significant proposals or changes in spending patterns for the 5-to 10-year period beyond the 
budget year and their relationship to outyear planning guidance and the policies proposed for the 
current and budget year; 
• 
A separate submission that proposes and justifies (if your agency so determines) the need for 
additional funding for individual programs in excess of the budget year guidance levels to meet the 
President's priorities. This separate submission should also identify potential discretionary offsets 
in lower priority programs within your agency's budget; 
• 
A separate submission of the Agency Reform Plan per OMB memo M-17-22. Where agency reform 
proposals have a budgetary or legislative impact, agencies should reflect those impacts in their 
FY 2021 budget submission to OMB. Where agencies are proposing major changes to account or 
organizational structures, agencies should discuss changes with their RMO prior to submission; and 
• 
Significant changes in full-time equivalent (FTE) employment. Provide justification for changes in 
relationship to projected workload, strategic planning initiatives, and reengineering efforts. 
Other sections in this Circular that address budget justification materials include sections 25 through 54, 
and sections 200-290. Budget submissions to OMB should be in the form of a performance plan to the 
greatest extent possible. Section 230, 240 and 210 provide detailed instruction on developing and 
submitting an updated agency strategic plan and performance plan as required by GPRA Modernization 
Act of 2010. 

51.2 Requirements for program justification 
You must provide a written justification when you submit your budget. You should determine specific 
informational requirements and timing of submissions in consultation with your OMB representative. 

Where possible, you should include the full cost of a program, and you should align budget accounts and 
program activity lines with programs or the components of the programs that contribute to a single strategic 
objective. 

Your request should be consistent with the funding levels included in policy guidance. If the request is not 
consistent with policy guidance, you must provide a summary of what your budget request would be at the 
policy guidance levels and the reasons why a budget request consistent with the guidance is not appropriate. 
In addition, you may be asked by your OMB representative to identify and discuss the implications of other 
funding levels. 

Page 2 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 51—BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS 

Prepare your justification in concise, specific terms and cover all programs and activities of your agency. 
Use tables, charts, and graphs in lieu of or to supplement text. Prepare materials in a manner designed to 
provide all of the information that you and OMB have agreed is necessary for OMB to understand and 
evaluate your agency's request and make its determinations. 

Where programs are jointly administrated by or impact multiple agencies, information on shared program 
budgets should be coordinated through OMB. 

Your request should include any new appropriations language provisions or changes to complex 
appropriations language, including general provisions. Any change to appropriations language with a 
budgetary impact, including changes to general provisions, requires OMB approval. See section 95 for 
additional information on appropriations language. 

At the discretion of OMB, you should include the following information for legislative proposals: 

• 
Your estimates of the costs of implementing or administering proposed legislation. 
• 
The assumptions underlying your estimates, including new work years, program outputs, and costs 
of inputs such as materials, contract costs or personnel costs. You should also include a discussion 
of alternative implementation strategies considered (e.g., contracting out versus in-house), and a 
discussion of any models used to develop your estimates. 
• 
The budget classification (mandatory or discretionary) of the costs of implementing and 
administering the legislative proposal along with a written justification for your selection. 
• 
Productivity savings and/or offsets for these costs. You should also provide a discussion of the 
methods and assumptions underlying your estimates for productivity savings and offsets. 
You should also include the following: 

• 
A comparison of total program benefits and total program costs, using quantitative, objective data 
to the maximum extent possible, as well as qualitative or judgmental material. 
• 
A comparison of the marginal benefits and the marginal costs associated with the additional funds 
or reduced funding proposed. 
• 
Supporting information that takes into consideration agency and outside (e.g., think tanks, GAO, 
CBO, universities, interest groups) program evaluations and related analytic studies, whether or not 
they agree with the proposed policy. 
At the discretion of your OMB representative, these requirements may be modified or alternative 
justification materials specified. It should be emphasized that late decisions on proposed law provisions 
for the budget will require flexibility in this process. Other materials may be requested by your OMB 
representative. 

51.3 Analysis of resources 
Use a tabular presentation to identify the financial and personnel resources required at the program levels 
under consideration. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 3 of Section 51 


SECTION 51—BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS 

For all Information Technology (IT) budgetary resources include a breakout of resources (financial, and if 
available, personnel) within each program level for the entire agency, inclusive of all components and 
programmatic IT investments. The tabular presentation should include in its title the phrase "IT Table" and 
identify obligations (PY, CY, and BY) for each TAFS that funds IT throughout the entire agency. 
Additionally, provide a narrative summary of the agency’s FY 2021 IT investment priorities and any new 
IT investments included in the request. The narrative should include, but is not limited to, the following 
information: 

• 
For each new IT investment, include in the narrative whether it is a cybersecurity investment or a 
High Value Asset system. 
• 
For each TAFS/Account Code, the purpose and justification for any increase in funding relative to 
enacted PY levels. 
• 
For each TAFS/Account Code, an explanation of change for any decrease in funding relative to 
enacted PY levels. 
• 
For each TAFS/Account Code, where applicable, an explanation of why funding levels are different 
from the information submitted through the IT Budget – Capital Planning reporting process. 
The submission should include the following tabular data to capture all Agency IT spending by 
TAFS/Account Code: 

TAFS/Account # FTE PY PY Total $ # FTE CY CY Total $ # FTE BY BY Total $ 
Code In Millions In Millions In Millions 

Your justification materials should include a section beginning with the words "IT Resource Statements" 
that provides the following: 

a) A statement that the CIO collaborated with all component CIOs, the Senior Agency Official for 
Privacy (SAOP), and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) on the IT Budget submissions, and that IT 
includes appropriate estimates of all IT resources included in the budget request/President’s 
Budget. 
b) A statement from the CIO indicating the extent to which the CIO has reviewed and had significant 
input in approving IT Investments included in this budget request. For example, if the CIO has 
reviewed and approved all the Investments from Bureau/Component/Operating Division/Mode A, 
B, and C, but not D, then the statement must identify that the CIO reviewed and approved 
Investments from Bureau/Component/Operating Division/Mode A, B, and C. 
c) A joint statement from the CFO and CIO identifying the extent to which the CIO had a significant 
role in reviewing planned IT support for major programs and significant increases and decreases in 
IT resources reflected in this budget. 
d) An update of the CIO's common baseline rating for Element D ("D1. CIO reviews and approves 
major IT Investment portion of budget request") to show whether the desired development outcome 
is: 
a. Incomplete – Agency has not started development of a plan describing the changes it will 
make to ensure that all baseline FITARA responsibilities are in place. 
b. Partially Addressed – Agency is working to develop a plan describing the changes it will 
make to ensure that all baseline FITARA responsibilities are in place. 
Page 4 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 51—BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS 

c. Fully Implemented – Agency has developed and implemented its plan to ensure that all 
common baseline FITARA responsibilities are in place. 
e) The extent to which the CIO can certify the use of incremental development. For example, if the 
CIO can certify that all the Investments from bureau/component/Operating Division/Mode A, B, 
and C, but not D, are using incremental development practices then the statement must identify that 
the CIO certifies that Investments from bureaus/components/Operating Divisions/Modes A, B, and 
C are using incremental development practices. 
f) A statement that the SAOP has reviewed the IT Budget submission and that privacy requirements, 
as well as any associated costs, are explicitly identified and included with respect to any IT 
resources that will be used to create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or 
dispose of personally identifiable information (PII). 
g) A statement explaining any planned deviation, if applicable, from the requirements specified in 
M-19-16 regarding agency solicitation of new or modernized technology or services for which a 
Quality Service Management Office (QSMO) has been pre-designated. 
The development of the above statements and discussion should be integrated and coordinated with ongoing 
risk management and internal control efforts described in OMB Circular No. A-123 Management’s 
Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control and your agency’s public 
Congressional Justification materials. Agencies should update and submit their IT Resource Statements 
with every updated Agency IT Portfolio Summary submission. Additional details on ERM requirements

• 
June 2020 (Specific dates TBD) 
o Optional FY 2021 Mid-Session Review submission; 
o FY 2021 IT Resource Statements as applicable. 
To the extent possible, you should attempt to align your budget accounts with programs, distinguishing 
among components that contribute to different strategic objectives. This should relate program objectives 
(see section 240) and budget accounts or sub-accounts. 

In addition, you should include the full cost of a program where possible. In some cases, you may want to 
consider requesting budgetary resources to cover all indirect costs in the budget account or program activity 
that funds the program, and paying for all central services as they are used. In other cases, you may want 
to request appropriations for some central accounts providing support services; in these cases, you should 
include a table showing the full cost of resources used by each program, whether paid from its budget 
account or not. 

Present resources required for PY and CY, as well as the estimated requirements for each funding option 
for BY through BY+9, where applicable. If CY cancellations or supplementals are pending or proposed, 
identify these separately. A subsidiary breakdown of such items as personnel compensation, capital outlay, 
or other categories of special concern would be useful. 

Generally, present financial data in terms of budgetary resources by year. However, your OMB 
representative may require additional measures, such as unobligated balances and offsetting collections. 

Describe budgetary resources requests in the context of your management plan for the programs and 
activities. Describe resources requested for IT investments in the context of your program requirements. 
For IT expenditures proposed, demonstrate that all opportunities for coordination with Administration goals 
and eliminating redundant activities have been explored. Explain the analysis used to determine the 
resources needed to accomplish program and Administration goals, and demonstrate that all opportunities 
for making more efficient and effective use of resources have been explored. 

51.4 Relationship of justification to account structure 
To the extent possible, you should attempt to align your budget accounts with programs, distinguishing 
among components that contribute to different strategic objectives. Where the major programs in your 
justification materials do not coincide with the budget account structure, prepare a table to show the 
relationship. Arrange this table by program, with all relevant accounts and parts of accounts listed, showing 
budgetary resources (usually budget authority) in millions of dollars and FTE. Include breakouts of 
financial resources within each account activity line for total IT expenditures. Report programs that are 
mainly grants, contracts or other transfers of funds to entities other than your agency, related salaries and 
expense accounts and parts of accounts, including allocations of overhead amounts. Where it is helpful to 
explain the coverage of the table or the relationship among accounts, prepare a short narrative to accompany 
the table. This requirement only applies to major programs and activities. You should consult your OMB 
representative to ensure that you provide tables for appropriate activities and that you avoid unnecessary 
paperwork. 

51.5 Agency restructuring or work process redesign 
You should identify restructuring or process reengineering activities resulting from proposed and current 
investments in IT and other areas that yield budgetary savings. Indicate how these activities allow your 
agency to utilize existing resources better while improving program management and service delivery. 

Page 6 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 51—BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS 

51.6 Information on grant programs and infrastructure investment 
Include copies of systematic economic analyses of expected benefits and costs completed in accordance 
with Executive Order 12893. 

51.7 Performance goals, measures, and indicators 
Agency budget submissions for the FY 2021 Budget may be structured as the performance plan 
required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (see also 31 U.S.C. 1115). Therefore, you need not 
submit a separate performance plan to comply with the Act. Your budget submission should cover 
all of your agency's programs and should address all statutory requirements of the "annual performance 
plan" required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. Sections 240 and 210 contain detailed 
information on performance plan requirements. Additional details on applicable public posting 
and notification requirements are also included in section 22. 

51.8 Other analytical information 
Additional information may be required in budget justifications on the following: 

• 
Workload analyses; 
• 
Unit costs; 
• 
Productivity trends; 
• 
Enterprise Risk Management Profiles; and 
• 
Impact of capital investment proposals on productivity. 
Use productivity measurement, unit costs, enterprise risk management, and organizational performance 
standards to the maximum extent possible in justifying staffing and other requirements. 

Include as a specific element in productivity improvement for activities of Federal staff the gains planned 
or being realized from streamlining, including reduction of unnecessary overhead, creative use of 
technology, and elimination of low priority tasks and programs. 

You should also be prepared to provide information on the basis for distributing funds (e.g., formulas or 
principles for allocation, matching, policies regarding the awarding of loans, grants, or contracts, etc.) and 
data on resulting geographic distribution (e.g., by State, etc.), with identification of any issues. 

51.9 Evidence and evaluation 
Agencies should strengthen the use of data and evidence (defined in section 200.22) to drive better 
decision-making and achieve greater impact and efficiencies. To further these efforts, agencies are 
required to submit an Evidence Template as part of their FY 2021 budget submissions. This template is 
designed to provide OMB with required updates on: 

• 
The agency’s progress towards meeting requirements of the Foundations for Evidence-Based 
Policymaking Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-435), including development and use of a learning 
agenda (evidence-building plan), annual evaluation plan, and capacity assessment. In addition, 
agencies should reference and describe evidence-building proposals accounted for in their budget 
request, including but not limited to efforts to meet the requirements of the Foundations for 
Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018; and 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 7 of Section 51 


SECTION 51—BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS 

• 
The agency’s progress in implementing monitoring and evaluation policies and practices aligned 
with the guidelines issued in M-18-04 as required by the Foreign Aid Transparency and 
Accountability Act of 2016 (as applicable). 
51.10 Explanations relating to supplemental appropriations requests 
If you request a supplemental, explain why the request was not included in the regular estimates for the 
period concerned and the reasons why it is considered essential that the additional appropriation be granted 
during the year. Submit proposals for offsets to be made elsewhere in your agency for both mandatory and 
discretionary resources and indicate related FTE savings or requirements and appropriate financing 
changes. Show the effect of requested supplementals in the appropriate portions of the justification material 
for the program elements affected. 

51.11 Taxes and tax expenditures 
Reflect full and explicit consideration of the resources made available by the Federal Government through 
tax expenditures and other tax incentives. Tax expenditures are attributable to provisions of the Federal 
income tax laws that allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or that provide 
a special credit, rate of tax, or deferral of tax (2 U.S.C. 622). Tax expenditures include subsidies provided 
through the income tax system. 

You must consult with the Office of Tax Analysis, Department of the Treasury on all proposals for new 
taxes or modifications of existing taxes whether or not the modification results in a tax expenditure. After 
consulting with the Office of Tax Analysis submit a justification of the proposal to OMB. The justification 
should include the views of the Office of Tax Analysis and address the following items: 

• 
The nature and extent of the problem addressed by the proposal. 
• 
The reason a subsidy is needed. 
• 
The non-tax alternatives. 
• 
The reason a tax change is preferable to the non-tax alternatives. 
In addition, you should be prepared to submit justifications for continuing or reenacting existing taxes and 
tax expenditures in the program areas for which you have primary responsibility. Such justifications will 
contain the information described above. 

In general, tax expenditures are subject to the same degree of performance reviews as spending and 
regulatory programs. Tax expenditures often complement or substitute for agencies' spending or regulatory 
programs that contribute to strategic objectives, and the resources and incentives provided through tax 
expenditures can be substantial. Work with the Office of Tax Analysis, which has lead responsibility for 
tax policy and analysis of tax expenditures, to develop data and methods to evaluate the effects of tax 
expenditures that affect (or are directed at the same goals as) your programs. You should be prepared to 
furnish, upon request, problem analyses, estimates of economic effects, and other materials that will provide 
explicit quantitative information on the relationship of existing or proposed tax expenditures to proposed 
budget expenditures. 

51.12 Major changes in receipts estimates 
Provide narrative explanations for major changes from one fiscal year to the next in the amounts of receipts 
reported for any account, trends in receipt estimates for the related programs, and any other unusual 
circumstances relating to the estimates. 

Page 8 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 51—BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS 

Advise OMB of increases in amounts reported to the Treasury Department accounts 1435.00 (General fund 
proprietary interest receipts, not otherwise classified) and 3220.00 (All other general fund proprietary 
receipts) when you expect that the amounts collected from a single source will exceed $10 million in any 
year or when legislation is proposed that will affect any receipts reported to those accounts. 

Make your explanations of legislative proposals consistent with your legislative program and outyear policy 
estimates. Cover the expected timing of enactment and the annual level of receipts anticipated. 

51.13 User Charges 
Your budget request should reflect the results of your biennial review of existing user charges and of the 
potential for establishing user charges, as required by section 8 of OMB Circular A-25. If you propose new 
user charges that require authorizing legislation, provide a clear explanation of the new user charge and the 
legislation that will be required to authorize it. Include a detailed discussion of plans for achieving 
enactment of the legislation and the administrative actions planned for collecting the charges if the 
legislation is enacted. Assess the proposal's chances of enactment and explain why the President should 
propose it in the Budget, taking into account the likely reaction to the proposal by the Congress and the 
users. Describe the basis for your assessment in detail. 

Refer to OMB Circular A-25 for additional information and requirements regarding user charges. You 
may also find GAO's Federal User Fees: A Design Guide useful. 

51.14 Unobligated balances in liquidating accounts 
All unobligated balances in liquidating accounts must be transferred to the general fund at the end of the 
fiscal year unless an exemption has been granted by OMB. You must submit information justifying any 
unobligated balances you expect to carry forward into the current year (see section 185.3(l)). 

51.15 Direct loan and loan guarantee programs 
Proposed changes to technical assumptions must be included with justification materials for all credit 
programs unless another date is agreed upon by OMB. Required materials include any proposed changes 
to technical assumptions, methodology, or source data underlying the credit subsidy cost estimate 
cash flows, and justification for such changes. Consult with your OMB representative and refer to OMB 
Circular A-129 regarding other requirements for direct loan and loan guarantee programs, including policy 
proposals for new or existing programs (see section 185). 

51.16 Information on funding for Inspectors General 
If your agency is covered by the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), your 
justification materials must include the following information required by section 6(f) of the Act: 

1. Information submitted by the Inspector General to the head of the agency under section 6(f)(1) of the 
Act: 
• 
The budget estimate and request of the Inspector General to the head of the agency; 
• 
The portion of the budget amount requested by the Inspector General for training, including a 
certification that the amount requested satisfies all training requirements for that fiscal year; and 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 9 of Section 51 


SECTION 51—BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS 

• 
The portion of the budget amount sought by the Inspector General as necessary to support the 
Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. 
2. Information required to be submitted by the head of the agency under section 6(f)(2) of the Act: 
• 
An aggregate request by the head of the agency for the Office of Inspector General (OIG); 
• 
Amounts requested by the head of the agency for OIG training; 
• 
Amounts requested by the head of the agency for support of the Council of the Inspectors General 
on Integrity and Efficiency; and 
• 
Any comments of the affected Inspector General with respect to the overall Inspector General 
request by the head of the agency. 
Prior to the submission of the President's Budget to the Congress, all of the above categories of predecisional 
deliberative information are subject to the confidentiality provisions of section 22. 

The Act requires some of the above categories of information to be included in the President's Budget 
submitted to the Congress. All of the other categories of information listed above continue to remain 
subject to the confidentiality provisions of section 22 even after submission to the Congress of the 
President's Budget. 

51.17 Information on agency's tribal consultation process 
Your agency's initial budget submission to OMB must include a description of the tribal consultation 
process that the agency conducted related to budget development, and the input that was received. If the 
agency has no programs with tribal implications, the section should indicate that no consultation is required. 
Please confer with your agency lead on tribal consultation in developing an appropriate and effective 
approach to consultation, in light of your agency's programs. This requirement is based on Executive Order 
13175 (November 2000) and the Memorandum of November 5, 2009, directing agencies to develop plans 
to implement the Executive Order. 

51.18 Radio spectrum-dependent communications-electronics systems 
Agencies must provide a narrative that: 1) states whether the system will share spectrum with other Federal 
or non-Federal existing systems/operations and, if so, the nature and extent of the sharing relationship; 2) 
states whether sharing of an existing Federal system to meet the capability requirement is possible, or 
whether sharing capabilities of similar Federal users has been considered; 3) describes, compares, and 
evaluates the spectrum efficiency and effectiveness for various alternatives considered utilizing the 
methodology described in section 31.12, or another methodology developed by the agency and approved 
by OMB; and 4) certifies consideration of non-spectrum dependent or commercial alternatives to meet 
mission/operational requirements. 

51.19 Budgeting for the acquisition of capital assets 
(a) Overview 
The Government should have a high level of assurance that the funds dedicated to capital acquisitions 
support the agency mission and provide value to the taxpayer. In addition, agencies should be able to justify 

Page 10 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 51—BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS 

the acquisition and operation of an asset. The generation of a sound business case is a best practice for 
providing that justification and assurance. A business case should include the rationale for the investment 
and reference any supporting analysis. 

The Capital Programming Guide provides guidance on the principles and techniques for effective capital 
programming. Additionally, budget terms and definitions are included in Appendix J, "Principles of 
Budgeting for Capital Asset Acquisitions." Other references related to capital assets are included in 
Appendix K, "Selected OMB Guidance and Other References Regarding Capital Assets." 

The policy, budget justification, and reporting requirements for capital assets apply to all agencies of the 
Executive Branch of the Government subject to Executive Branch review. Agency business cases are due 
at the same time as your agency's annual budget submission (see Table 1 in section 25). 

(b) Information Technology (IT) 
Required data for all IT investments is provided by agencies reporting through the IT Dashboard addressing 
both overall IT investment spending (the agency's IT portfolio), and the information required for major IT 
investments, as described at: 

https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/egov/ 


Agencies not reporting data to the IT Dashboard are also accountable for adhering to the guidance provided 
to all agencies on how to conduct IT capital planning internally, as addressed in the above guidance, and 
also in Circular A-130, and the Capital Programming Guide. Budget process guidance is communicated to 
such agencies individually, regarding the data to be submitted as part of their agency budget submissions 
in the fall, based on the requirements of OMB RMO with agency oversight responsibility, and other 
considerations. 

(c) Non-Information Technology (Non-IT) 
In general, business cases are required for the acquisition and operation of non-IT capital assets. The 
definition of capital asset can be found in Appendix 1 of the Capital Programming Guide. Links to the 
template and instructions for the business case are provided in section 25, Table 1. The instructions include 
submission requirements, deadlines, and exemptions. 

(i) Aircraft 
An aircraft is a type of non-IT capital asset. A business case template tailored to the needs of the aircraft 
community is available. Links to the template and instructions are provided in section 25, Table 1. The 
instructions include submission requirements, deadlines, and exemptions. 

(ii) Facilities 
Facilities are a type of non-IT capital asset. When justifying a major investment in a facility, including new 
construction, full and partial building or modernization, or facility investments that meet the agency's 
capital threshold, you should be prepared to provide the materials identified in section 31.9(a) if requested 
by your OMB representative.

54.1 Do I need to report on rental payments? 
If your agency obligates more than $5 million annually for rental payments to the General Services 
Administration (GSA) or to others (e.g., other Federal agencies or commercial landlords) for rental of 
space, structures and facilities, and land and building services, you must submit a space budget 
justification in the format of exhibit 54 at the same time as your agency's annual budget submission (see 
section 54.2 for the e-mail address for the submission, which must be coordinated with all relevant agency 
officials). OMB uses this information to evaluate your budget request for rent in the context of personnel 
and program changes (e.g., downsizing). GSA uses this information to refine its estimates of rental costs. 
You should use this information to analyze your space requirements and rental costs. 

For reporting purposes, include amounts for the services covered by the basic rental charge assessed by 
GSA as obligations for rental payments to GSA, but exclude amounts above standard services, such as 
overtime utility services. From GSA's monthly bill, use line D, "Total Annual Rental" plus, in some 
cases, line 14a "Billing Adjustments and Corrections, Current Year" to compare to the amount on the line 
"GSA rent estimate" of exhibit 54. These amounts are already net of obligations for the cost of operations 
in buildings where GSA has delegated authority for building operations. The cost of building operations 
in buildings whose operational authority is delegated should be budgeted in the appropriate object classes, 
such as 25.4, operations and maintenance of facilities. These costs should appear on exhibit 54. 

Make your obligations for rental payments to GSA (Part 1 of exhibit 54) and your obligations for other 
space services paid to non-GSA entities (Part 2) consistent with data reported as rental payments under 
the appropriate object classes (see section 54.4). 

54.2 What materials must I provide? 
You must submit an overall summary report in the format of exhibit 54 for the agency as a whole. This 
report provides a justification of your agency's budget request for rent. In addition, you must submit a 
separate report for each bureau or subordinate organization that makes rental payments. Submit a single 
agency-wide summary report if these costs are paid for centrally from one account. 

You must complete exhibit 54 using an electronic Excel spreadsheet available from GSA. The spreadsheet 
format includes inflation factors to calculate outyear estimates automatically and it generates total 
obligations for rental costs and funding sources. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 54 


SECTION 54—RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR SPACE AND LAND 

The report contains information for PY through BY+1 on: 

• 
Rental payments to GSA, which reconciles the GSA rent estimate with actual, planned, and 
requested changes in inventory. 
• 
Funding sources for these rental payments to GSA. 
• 
Rental payments to others, both non-Federal and Federal sources. 
• 
Supporting detail on all changes from the GSA rent bill or GSA estimates of rental costs (see 
section 54.5). 
Your submission must support your budget year request and list all applicable appropriations and/or other 
funding sources by account. 

Report space requirements to the nearest square foot; state obligations in thousands of dollars and round 
to the nearest thousand. Where an amount falls exactly halfway in between, round to the nearest even 
figure (for example, both $11,500 and $12,500 round to $12). Do not identify amounts of $500 or less. 

In addition to the materials provided with your budget submission, submit electronic versions of these 
materials both to GSA and OMB by sending e-mails to the following addresses: 

OMBExhibit54@gsa.gov and exhibit54@omb.eop.gov 

Exhibit 54 is due with the budget submission. Before sending the completed spreadsheet, verify that the 
subject line has the three-digit CGAC agency code (see Appendix C) and the full agency name. 

54.3 What terms do I need to know? 
Agency means departments and establishments of the Government, and bureau means the principal 
subordinate organizational units of an agency. 

GSA bureau code means the agency/bureau code(s) recorded on the GSA rent bills or GSA budget 
estimates for each bureau making rental payments. (This number is not the same as the 2–digit OMB 
bureau code described in section 79.2 and Appendix C.) 

GSA rent estimate means a document developed by GSA and sent to customer agencies once a year. 
This document provides budget year data on estimated assigned space and the associated costs of that 
space. It is used by GSA's customers for planning and budgeting purposes. You should use this year's 
GSA budget estimate (available this summer) to report the GSA rent estimate for the CY and BY. 

OMB-approved inflation factor means the inflation factor used in the GSA budget estimate. Mid-
Session Review inflation factors will be used for CY through BY+1. The electronic spreadsheet format 
provided to you will use these factors to automatically inflate certain outyear estimates. 

Chargeback (or adjustments to the bill) means the process by which GSA's customers contest a GSA 
billing. If you claim a chargeback, you are required to complete a Standard Form 2972 if you are an 
IPAC Agency and a form 2992 if you are a non-IPAC Agency and provide supporting chargeback data 
justifying your claim. 

Total Workplace FIT (Furniture, Information Technology) Program Budget Request will be included 
on the exhibit 54, if you intend to classify those charges as object class 23.1, rental payments to GSA. 

Page 2 of Section 54 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 54—RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR SPACE AND LAND 

The FIT estimate should be entered on the SUM worksheet in row 33 for the BY "Budget Year" (column 

N) and BY+1 (column Q). More information can be found on the GSA web site 
http://www.gsa.gov/exhibit 54 by downloading the PDF file "Total Workplace FIT (Furniture and IT) 
Booklet–GSA". 
54.4 How do I prepare the space budget justification? 
The following table explains the information needed to prepare the space budget justification (see exhibit 
54). Exhibit 54 illustrates the summary page of the submission. There are five worksheets that contain 
the detail for the chargebacks, planned changes to inventory and the requested program changes. One 
worksheet is for the chargebacks, and there is one for each year in which to detail planned changes to 
inventory and the requested program changes (i.e., PY, CY, BY and BY+1). The summary justification 
consists of two parts: 

• 
Rental payments to GSA (Part 1). (With the exception of the lines "Other adjustments," 
"Statutorily-imposed rent caps," and "Funding sources for Rental Payments to GSA," data in this 
part is derived by formula from five back-up worksheets); and 
• 
Rental payments to others (Part 2). 
Subtotals, totals, and certain other entries indicated in boldface will be automatically calculated (see 
exhibit 54).

55.1 Overview 
Agencies must submit information on their respective information technology (IT) investment portfolios, 
using the required formats, as applicable, as stated in the FY 2021 IT Budget – Capital Planning 
Guidance. This section provides general guidance related to reporting on IT and the templates used to 
collect that information. Section 25.5 provides electronic links to the definitions and specific reporting 
instructions and exhibits related to budgeting for investments in IT. 

OMB Circular No. A-11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 55 


SECTION 55—INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS 

This Administration is maintaining a continued focus on strengthening IT Portfolio management and 
remains firmly committed to assessing the effectiveness of current IT management practices in order to 
address opportunities to improve management of IT resources. IT and business leaders must have access 
to authoritative data in order to effectuate data-driven discussions about cost and value of IT to best 
support business goals. 

Provide more granular data for IT spending. 

To gain increased granularity about IT spending across the Federal IT Portfolio, agencies will be asked to 
provide the following data for each investment: 

• 
Development, Modernization, and Enhancement (DME) and Operations and Maintenance (O&M); 
• 
IT Cost Pools; and 
• 
IT Towers. 
The FY 2021 cycle will complete the phased implementation of more granular IT cost reporting. While 
there is no expectation that agencies will change authoritative data systems at this time, agencies should 
continue to categorize costs into IT Cost Pools and IT Towers. Over time, OMB will work with agencies 
to determine how to automate authoritative data collection. 

Completed implementation of Standard Investment types to promote Government-wide consistency. 

Through the FY 2020 cycle, the Platform, Output, Application, and Delivery Standard Investments were 
optional. These four Standard Investment categories are now required for the FY 2021 reporting cycle. 
This will enable Government-wide comparisons and improve benchmarking metrics. 

• 
Some Standard Investments will have corresponding reports, relevant to their investment type. 
• 
All Standard Investments will enable agency CIOs to compare like costs, capabilities and 
functions across organizational components and support FITARA implementation. 
55.2 Why must I report on information technology investments? 
As part of the Budget process, OMB is required to develop and oversee a process for IT budgeting and 
portfolio management, with a detailed focus on all major capital investments, to include "analyzing, 
tracking, and evaluating the risks, including information security risks, and results of all major capital 
investments made by an executive agency for information systems." 40 U.S.C. 11302. OMB also is 
responsible for IT Portfolio oversight (44 U.S.C. 3602), i.e. the use of information technologies to 
enhance access of information and delivery of services; and to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, 
service quality, or transformation of government operations. 

Agencies must provide required data on total IT funding using the formats specified in the FY 2021 IT 
Budget – Capital Planning Guidance. IT funding information should be consistent with the overall 
agency budget submission (see section 51.19), and your agency's enterprise architecture (EA), Agency IT 
Portfolio Summary components, and Agency IT Portfolio Detail components. 

IT investment costs must include funding from all Federal budgetary resources (e.g., direct appropriation, 
collections, transfers, and unobligated balances) and must: 

• 
ensure security of Federal information systems and data and account for a modernization process 
to secure information systems by design; 
• 
account for regular software and product lifecycle refreshment; and 
Page 2 of Section 55 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2019) 


SECTION 55—INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS 

• 
leverage best practices from other organizations to increase agility and flexibility in technology 
programs. 
55.3 What specific guidance applies to FY 2021, and when is the information required? 
Submissions should be consistent with OMB Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Guidance. Timing details for IT 
budget submission requirements are outlined in the FY 2021 IT Budget – Capital Planning Guidance. 

Additional updates to the Agency IT Portfolio Summary, Major IT Business Cases, and Standard 
Investment Reports may be applicable after final Budget release in order to reflect changes in funding 
levels due to enactment of appropriations. Specific instructions and deadlines for submitting updates, 
corrections, and final submissions of exhibits will be available on the OMB MAX Federal Community. 

Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Senior Agency Officials for Privacy (SAOPs), Chief Financial 
Officers (CFOs), and budget officers must coordinate to ensure that IT budget data is consistent with the 
agency's budget submission, and must complete "IT Resources Statements" described in section 51.3. 

The annual E-Gov MAX collection of information on expected agency contributions to E-Government 
and Line-of-Business initiatives for FY 2021. This data collection for the FY 2021 Budget includes: 

• 
the collection of three years of contribution levels (PY, CY and BY) in MAX; 
• 
a requirement that by September 9, 2019, CFOs certify that required contribution levels are being 
included in the agency's budget planning to OMB; and 
• 
each agency managing or contributing to E-Government and Line-of-Business initiatives must 
report as a distinct investment within their IT Portfolio Summary. 
55.4 How should agencies align IT investments with their strategic plans? 
An agency's IT investment management and reporting of IT investments must clearly demonstrate that 
each investment is needed to help meet the agency's strategic goals and mission and show how 
governance processes are used to plan, select, develop, implement, and operate those IT investments. 
Furthermore, each IT investment should demonstrate the enabling and improvement of mission and 
program performance by providing meaningful data. Agencies demonstrate the IT Investment 
requirements and governance processes through Agency Major IT Business Cases, supporting 
documentation, Information Resources Management Strategic Plan, Enterprise Roadmap, and Agency IT 
Portfolio Summary submissions. The agency must further demonstrate how the investment supports a 
business line or enterprise service performance goal as documented in the agency's enterprise architecture 
(EA), and annual Enterprise Roadmap submission to OMB. In particular, Investments should indicate 
when they include spending on Geospatial-related costs through alignment with Federal Enterprise 
Architecture (FEA) Business Reference Model (BRM) code. Documents used to manage the planning, 
development, implementation, and operation of IT investments and documents that demonstrate the 
outcomes of agency, branch, and bureau governance decisions should be maintained and made readily 
available if requested by OMB. Agency strategic planning should incorporate the requirement for regular 
software and product lifecycle refresh. 

The individual agency's Agency IT Portfolio Summary submissions are used to create an overall "Federal 
IT Portfolio," which is published as part of the President's Budget. Agency and OMB portfolio reviews 
and Budget processes will ensure the selection of IT investments that support the agency's strategic 
objectives or performance goals, as captured in the agency's Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan. 

Agencies are required to submit Information Resources Management (IRM) Strategic Plans which should 
fully align with the current Agency Strategic Plan and shall be reviewed annually alongside the Annual 

OMB Circular No. A-11 (2019) Page 3 of Section 55 


SECTION 55—INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS 

Performance Plan Reviews, required by the GPRA Modernization Act, to determine if there are any 
performance gaps or changes to mission needs, priorities, or goals. IRM Strategic Plans should be 
updated to align with Agency Strategic Plans as specified in A-11 section 230.4. Agencies should 
identify where they are making investments and performing activities in support of 44 U.S.C. 3506. At a 
minimum, agencies should include Open Data Plans to demonstrate how they are supporting priority data 
improvements that support agency goals and missions. Open Data Plans support agency compliance 
with the statutory requirements described in 44 U.S.C. 3506 per the Foundations for Evidence-Based 
Policymaking Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-435). Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506, agencies are required to 
describe how information resources management activities help accomplish agency missions; this 
includes but is not limited to developing an open data plan that is updated annually and made publicly 
available on the website of the agency. 

55.5 Do these requirements apply to me? 
Agencies must submit information on the Agency IT Portfolio Summary (including the Budget Account 
Summary), and Agency IT Portfolio Detail, using the format specified in this guidance, as applicable, for 
Agency annual, quarterly, and regular reporting of their IT budget and IT Management information. This 
requirement applies to any agency subject to Executive Branch review (see section 25.1), unless 
otherwise directed. 

The following agencies must adhere to these IT reporting requirements: 


Department of Agriculture 
Department of Commerce 
Department of Defense 
Department of Education 
Department of Energy 
Department of Health and Human Services 
Department of Homeland Security 
Department of Housing and Urban Development 
Department of the Interior

Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Office of Personnel Management 
Small Business Administration 
Social Security Administration 
Separate guidance may be issued amending the above specifications regarding agency submissions, for 
non-CIO Council agencies. 

55.6 What do I need to know about an agency's IT Budget and Management Requirements? 
The agency's IT Budget and Management information is composed of three parts: 

1. Agency IT Portfolio Summary – which includes: 
• 
Agency IT Investment Portfolio Summary - includes IT investment budget, management, and 
architecture information; 
• 
Budget Account Summary – includes a summarized view of IT funding levels associated with 
budget accounts. This summary is derived from the Funding Sources table in the Agency IT 
Portfolio Summary; and 
Page 4 of Section 55 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2019) 


SECTION 55—INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS 

• 
CIO Evaluation Report – includes IT Investment CIO evaluations and comments for all Major IT 
Investment (required), and any other investments within the Agency's IT Portfolio that the CIO 
has a particular focus on. 
• 
Submission Confirmation – includes validation of the data submitted to ensure that all required 
Investments have been submitted and closes the reporting window. 
2. Agency IT Portfolio Detail – which includes: 
• 
Systems Inventory List – includes detailed system and product component information for all 
Investments that fund one or more IT systems. 
• 
Contracts Report – which includes PIID and planned acquisition information for Major and Part 3 
Investments. 
• 
Major IT Business Cases – includes detailed IT investment budget and management information 
for major IT investments within Part 1 (Mission) and Part 2 (Administrative Services and 
Support Systems). 
• 
Standard IT Investment Reports– which includes: 
o Detailed and relevant IT investment budget and management information for 
Standard Investments in Part 3 (IT Infrastructure, IT Security, and IT Management). 
o Standard Investment Reports for IT Security and Compliance, Data Center and Cloud, 
Network, End User, Application, and Delivery Investments which are required for FY 
2021. 
• 
Submission Confirmation – includes validation of the data submitted to ensure that all required 
Business Cases and Standard Investment Reports have been submitted and closes the reporting 
window. 
3. IT Resource Statements 
Pursuant to the requirements in Circular A-11, section 51.3, your justification materials should 
include a section entitled "IT Resource Statements" that provides the following: 
(a) A statement that the CIO collaborated with all component CIOs, the Senior Agency Official 
for Privacy (SAOP), and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) on the IT budget submissions, 
and that IT includes appropriate estimates of all IT resources included in the Budget 
request/President's Budget. 
(b) A statement from the CIO indicating the extent to which the CIO has reviewed and had 
significant input in approving IT Investments included in this Budget request. For example, if 
the CIO has reviewed and approved all the Investments from Bureau/Component/Operating 
Division/Mode A, B, and C, but not D, then the statement must identify that the CIO 
reviewed and approved Investments from Bureau/Component/Operating Division/Mode A, 
B, and C. 
(c) A joint statement from the CFO and CIO identifying the extent to which the CIO had a 
significant role in reviewing planned IT support for major programs and significant increases 
and decreases in IT resources reflected in this Budget. 
(d) An update of the CIO's common baseline rating for Element D ("D1. CIO reviews and 
approves major IT Investment portion of budget request") to show whether the desired 
development outcome is: 
1) Incomplete – Agency has not started development of a plan describing the changes it will 
make to ensure that all baseline FITARA responsibilities are in place. 
2) Partially Addressed – Agency is working to develop a plan describing the changes it will 
make to ensure that all baseline FITARA responsibilities are in place. 
3) Fully Implemented – Agency has developed and implemented its plan to ensure that all 
common baseline FITARA responsibilities are in place. 
OMB Circular No. A-11 (2019) Page 5 of Section 55 


SECTION 55—INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS 

(e) The extent to which the CIO can certify the use of incremental development. For example, if 
the CIO can certify that all the Investments from bureau/component/Operating 
Division/Mode A, B, and C, but not D, are using incremental development practices then the 
statement must identify that the CIO certifies that Investments from 
bureaus/components/Operating Divisions/Modes A, B, and C are using incremental 
development practices. 
(f) A statement that the SAOP has reviewed the IT budget submission and that privacy 
requirements, as well as any associated costs, are explicitly identified and included with 
respect to any IT resources that will be used to create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, 
disseminate, disclose, or dispose of personally identifiable information (PII). 
Agencies should update and submit their IT Resource Statements with every updated agency IT Portfolio 
Summary submission. The development of the above statements and discussion should be integrated and 
coordinated with ongoing risk management and internal control efforts described in OMB Circular A-123 
Management's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control and your agency's 
public Congressional Justification materials. Additional details on Enterprise Risk Management 
requirements are also included in section 270. 

Agency reporting of its IT Portfolio should include all of an agency's annual IT costs. The agency's 
complete IT portfolio must be reported, including all major, non-major, migration related, funding 
contributions, standard and non-standard IT investments. For the FY 2021 Budget submission, IT 
funding levels reported in the Agency IT Portfolio Summary should be consistent with your agency's 
budget materials and should be categorized based upon the following three parts: 

Category 
Part 1 IT Investments for Mission Delivery 
Part 2 IT Investments for Administrative Services and Mission Support Systems 
Part 3 IT Investments for Commodity IT Infrastructure and IT Management 

Funding levels in the agency's Agency IT Portfolio Summary should reflect budgetary resources and be 
provided for PY, CY, and BY, as outlined below: 

For: 
Budgetary Resources in Agency IT 
Portfolio Summary for preliminary 
agency requests 
Budgetary Resources in Agency IT Portfolio 
Summary for President's Budget request to 
the Congress 
PY (2019) FY 2019 Estimated/Enacted actual level FY 2019 actual level 
CY (2020) Estimated/Enacted for FY 2020 Estimated/Enacted for FY 2020 
BY (2021) Agency request for FY 2021 President's Budget request for FY 2021 

For each of PY, CY, and BY, Investment funding levels should reflect budgetary resource amount by 
year, including appropriations, borrowing authority, contract authority, spending authority from offsetting 
collections, transfers from other accounts, and carryover of unobligated balances. Funding levels should 
be consistent with program-level funding and branch, bureau, and agency summary funding tables, as 
provided to OMB in the agency budget submission. 

Investment funding sources must include all Federal budgetary sources of funding used (e.g., budget 
authority provided in direct appropriations, amounts available for obligation through collections of fees or 
other receipts, transfers from trust funds or other Federal sources, or via reimbursement, including 
payments for services). 

Page 6 of Section 55 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2019) 


SECTION 55—INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS 

55.7 What do I need to know about Major IT Business Cases? 
OMB provides specific policy, procedural, and analytic guidelines for planning, budgeting, acquisition, 
and management of major IT capital investments, which is defined within the FY 2021 IT Budget – 
Capital Planning Guidance Appendix C, in addition to general guidance issued in OMB Circular A-11 
and OMB Circular A-130. 

An agency's Major IT Business Cases describe the justification, planning, implementation, and operations 
of individual capital assets included in the Agency IT Portfolio Summary and serve as key artifacts of the 
agency's EA and IT capital planning processes. The Major IT Business Case is comprised of two 
components: 

1) The Major Business Case itself, which provides key high-level investment information to 
inform budget decisions, including general information and planning for resources such as 
staffing and personnel. 
2) The regular information updates to the Major IT Business Case, which provides more 
temporal information, related to tracking management of an investment, such as projects and 
activities, risks, and operational performance of the investment. This includes the CIO's 
responsibility to assess each Major IT Investment pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 11315(c)(2). 
55.8 What do I need to know about Standard IT Investment Reports? 
Standard IT Infrastructure Investments were introduced in FY 2018's guidance. This year's guidance 
completes the phased implementation of Standard Investment Reports with relevant reporting 
requirements for each Standard IT Infrastructure and Management Investment. Agencies shall complete 
their realignment of costs represented in their IT Portfolio Summary Part 3: IT Infrastructure, IT Security 
and IT Management Non-Standard Investments into Standard Investments that will be consistent 
throughout and across each agency. The updated reporting requirements are intended to provide more 
visibility to agency CIOs. The Standard Investments are related to costs associated with all agencies. 
Each Standard Investment will have its own reporting requirements and frequency. 

Complete details on specifications for completing Agency IT Portfolio Summary and Major IT Business 
Cases are provided in the FY 2021 IT Budget – Capital Planning Guidance.

79.1 What is the MAX system and how do I report data in MAX? 
MAX A-11 Data Entry (MAX) is a computer system used to collect and process most of the information 
required for preparing the budget. MAX compiles the budget data using a series of schedules, or sets of 
data, within the MAX database. Each schedule describes a view of the President's Budget. An overview 
of all the schedules is provided in section 79.5. 

To submit the data to populate the budget schedules, appropriations language, and narrative text, use this 
web address to access MAX: 

https://a11de.max.gov 

Consult the MAX A–11 Home community page for resources about how to use MAX. 

You report data at the budget account level in MAX (see section 20.11(a)). This information is aggregated 
to provide the totals presented in many of the tables in the President's Budget. Most amounts are reported 
in millions of dollars. The preferred method of rounding numbers is to the nearest even million (for 
example, both $11,500,000 and $12,500,000 would round to 12); however, use of standard off-the-shelf 
packages that round up when a number is exactly mid-way between two whole numbers is acceptable (for 
example, $11,500,000 would round to 12 and $12,500,000 would round to 13). 

You must use MAX to submit your budget data. If data has already been entered for a particular account 
and transmittal code, you can retrieve and change the data using MAX. For a new account or transmittal 
code, you must create new shells of schedules before you can enter data. The community page provides 
instructions on how to insert and edit schedules. You can also use MAX to generate several diagnostic 
reports. 

MAX contains information on budget account titles and classifications and controls data entry. Before you 
can submit your budget data, an account must be present in OMB’s database. Section 79.4 provides 
information on how to request new accounts or request changes to existing accounts. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 79 


SECTION 79—THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM 

MAX contains numerous crosschecks or error messages ("edit checks") to help ensure the consistency of 
the data. You can see all of the error messages in the MAX Edit Checks report on the Budget Season 
Reports page. 

79.2 What should I know about account identification codes? 
OMB, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, assigns account identification codes. These 
codes are used to store and access data in MAX, run reports, and identify accounts in OMB and Treasury 
documents and MAX reports. While you can access your accounts in MAX without knowing the account 
number, you are required to perform several steps that can be eliminated if you do know it. Each account 
can be identified in several ways. For example, you can access your accounts in MAX by entering either 
the OMB account number or the Treasury account number. Regardless of which number you use, 
familiarity with the following coding options is helpful. See exhibit 79D for examples of various account 
code combinations, and appendix C for a list of OMB agency and bureau codes, and Treasury and CGAC 
agency codes. 

• 
OMB agency code—Each department or independent agency has a unique three-digit number 
assigned by OMB. 
• 
OMB bureau code—Each bureau within each department or major agency has an agency-unique 
two-digit number assigned by OMB. Agencies that do not have distinct bureaus have a bureau code 
of "00". Most receipt accounts do not have a distinct bureau and have a bureau code of "00". 
• 
Treasury agency code—Each agency also has a two-digit number assigned by Treasury. The use of 
these two-digit codes is being phased out. 
• 
Common Government-wide Accounting Classification (CGAC) agency code—Each department or 
independent agency has a unique three-digit agency identifier assigned by Treasury. Agencies and 
OMB are in the process of transitioning from the two-digit Treasury agency code to the three-digit 
CGAC agency code. In most cases, the CGAC agency code for departments and major independent 
agencies is equal to zero followed by the old two-digit Treasury agency code. For other independent 
agencies, it is usually equal to the OMB agency code. 
• 
Account symbol—Each account has a four-digit main account code assigned by Treasury (or, in the 
case of merged accounts, by OMB) that corresponds to the fund type (e.g., general, special). For 
receipt accounts, OMB combines this account symbol with the sub-account code to create an 
agency-unique six-digit symbol for display. 
• 
Transmittal code—Each account in MAX has a one-digit code that identifies the nature or timing of 
the associated schedules as described in section 79.3. 
• 
Fund code—Section 20.11 explains fund codes and the account symbols associated with each fund 
type. 
• 
Subfunction code—OMB assigns each account a three-digit code that corresponds to the account's 
subfunctional classification (e.g., national defense, income security, agriculture). (See section 
79.4(d) for further explanation of subfunctions and exhibit 79A for a list of functional 
classifications.)

SECTION 79—THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM 

79.3 Which transmittal code should I use? 
The following codes are used to identify the nature or timing of the request. 

Most requests that are transmitted to the Congress in the President's Budget are for appropriations for the 
upcoming fiscal year. These requests are normally reported under transmittal code 0. 

Transmittal 
Code 
Title and description 
0 Regular budget schedules. 
1 Supplemental proposal. Use only for requesting supplemental CY 
amounts. 
2 Legislative proposal, not subject to PAYGO. Use for the effects of 
proposals requiring authorizing legislation where those effects are not 
subject to PAYGO. These include both discretionary proposals that 
are contingent on the enactment of authorizing legislation, as well as 
mandatory and revenue proposals that do not have a PAYGO impact, 
e.g., new interfund payments. Do not use for routine reauthorization 
of ongoing programs. 
3 Appropriations language to be transmitted later. Use only with prior 
approval of OMB when language for a significant policy proposal 
cannot be transmitted in the budget. 
4 Legislative proposal, subject to PAYGO. Use for the effects of 
proposals requiring authorizing legislation that are subject to 
PAYGO. Do not use for routine reauthorization of ongoing 
discretionary programs or for an extension of a mandatory program 
assumed to be continued in the baseline (transmit 0). 
5 Rescission proposal pursuant to Title 10 of the Congressional Budget 
and Impoundment Control Act. Use only for requesting rescission of 
CY amounts. 
7 Reserved for OMB use. 
8 Overseas contingency operations. Use only for amounts requested for 
BY through BY+9. 
9 Reserved for OMB use. 

Separate schedules using non-zero transmittal codes are required to identify proposed authorizing 
legislation, supplementals requested in the budget, and items proposed for later transmittal under either 
existing or proposed authorizing legislation or their effect on the information presented in the regular 
schedule for the account. The combination of the regular schedule and the non-zero transmittal code 
schedule should display the condition of the account as it would exist if the Congress enacts the proposals. 

When a supplemental proposal or legislative proposal involves a transfer between accounts, omit the 
transaction from the regular (transmittal code 0) schedules and display it in separate schedules for each of 
the affected accounts. See exhibit 79C for help in determining if your legislative proposal should be coded 
as a transmittal code 0, 2, or 4.

SECTION 79—THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM 

79.4 How do I request new accounts, changes to existing accounts in MAX? 
The MAX database contains information on budget account titles and classifications and controls data entry. 
Among other things, it contains information on: 

• 
The account title, as it will be printed in the Budget; 
• 
The Treasury and OMB identification codes; 
• 
Fund type; 
• 
Subfunctional classification; 
• 
Budget enforcement (BEA) category; 
• 
Congressional subcommittee assignment; 
• 
Type of account (e.g., expenditure, receipt, trust, special, revolving); 
• 
Whether more than half of the collections are user charges; 
• 
Whether the account will finance payments for individuals; 
• 
Whether the account has obligation limitations; 
• 
Citation of legal authority to establish the account; 
• 
For receipt accounts, the receipt type and source category; and for offsetting receipts, character 
classification (see section 84.3(d)); and 
• 
Where the account will be printed in the budget (see section 95.3). 
(a) General 
If you need to request a new account or make changes to an existing account, please contact your OMB 
budget representative. If requesting a new account, you will need to provide information on all the items 
in the bulleted list above except for the identification codes. These classifications are discussed further 
below. 

For new deposit funds, only a subset of the information above is required, as deposit funds are not included 
in OMB’s MAX database. Provide the citation of legal authority and any proposed account number and 
title. 

OMB collaborates with Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service to assign Treasury Account Symbols (TAS) 
and titles. Fiscal Service establishes new Treasury appropriation fund symbols (TAFS)—which include the 
expenditure account period of availability along with the account symbol—derived from the annual 
appropriation bills without an agency request. For new account actions pursuant to other legislation, 
agencies must send a letter of request to Fiscal Service. For more information about the letter of request, 
see the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM). 

When you request a new account, OMB will coordinate with Treasury, as required; make the necessary 
changes; and notify you when the change is complete. 

If you want to propose new financing methods, reorganizations, account mergers, or changes to the program 
activity structure in the program and financing schedule, OMB approval is required. You should submit 
requests for such changes by October 1, unless OMB specifies another date. If a change is dependent on 
pending decisions or results from late congressional action or other circumstances beyond your control, 
submit the request as soon as possible after October 1. If prospective internal reorganizations are likely to 
require budget structure changes, obtain OMB approval prior to implementing the reorganization. 

Until requests are approved, base budget materials on the existing structure. If changes are approved, you 
must revise budget schedules and other materials accordingly.

SECTION 79—THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM 

(b) Fund type and code 
OMB and Treasury will assign identification codes based on the type of fund involved and other 
characteristics of the proposed new account. The account symbol is based on the fund type. See section 

20.11 for a detailed discussion of fund types.

6000–6999 Deposit fund N/A 
90xx Assigned by OMB to designate allowances 
991x–998x Assigned by OMB for certain merged accounts 

(c) BEA category 
For each expenditure or receipt account, OMB assigns a BEA category (e.g., discretionary, mandatory) that 
designates how the budgetary resources of the account will be classified for budget enforcement purposes 
(see section 81.2 for a summary of budget enforcement data classifications). In cases where the account 
will contain resources classified in more than one BEA category, OMB will identify the account as a "split" 
account. 

(d) Functional and subfunctional classification 
OMB normally assigns each expenditure and offsetting receipt account a single subfunction code (see 
exhibit 79A for a list of functional classifications). In rare cases, an appropriation account may be split 
between two or more subfunctions. If the subfunctions are in the same function, the code of the function is 
used (e.g., 500, 550, etc.). If two or more functions are involved, the code "999" is used. Annually, OMB 
consults with CBO and other relevant budget and appropriation committee staff members regarding 
functional and subfunctional classification. This process, which is required by statute, typically occurs 
from October through December (see section 25.3). 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 5 of Section 79 


SECTION 79—THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM 

(e) User charge classification 
OMB designates whether any collections related to the account are user charges, as defined in section 
20.7(g). Governmental receipts, offsetting receipts, and offsetting collections may be classified as user 
charges. 

(f) Receipt type 
Receipt accounts are classified either as governmental receipts or offsetting receipts. If the receipts 
associated with a particular program have more than one classification, separate receipt accounts must be 
established (see section 20.7 for a full discussion of receipts). 

(g) Source category code 
Each receipt type has a number of unique source category codes that enable MAX to produce tables needed 
for the budget. OMB assigns the codes when a new receipt account is established by determining the receipt 
type for the account and selecting an appropriate program category within that receipt type (see exhibit 79B 
for a list of source category codes). 

(h) Payments for individuals 
An account finances payments for individuals if it pays for Federal Government spending programs designed 
to transfer income (in cash or in kind) to individuals or families. To the extent feasible, this category 
does not include reimbursements for current services rendered to the Government (e.g., salaries and 
interest). The payments may be in the form of cash paid directly to individuals or they may take the form 
of the provision of services or the payment of bills for activities generally financed from personal income. 

(i) Account mergers 
Two or more Treasury accounts may be merged into a single budget account with a single set of budget 
schedules: 

• 
When two or more appropriation accounts are replaced by a single appropriation. Sometimes the 
amounts in the old accounts are merged by law into the successor account. 
• 
When the budget proposes to merge several appropriations into a single account and request budget 
year appropriations on that basis. The objective of such proposed mergers is to permit greater 
flexibility in achieving program goals by managing and budgeting at a higher level of aggregation. 
This objective must be balanced against other needs, including the need for public disclosure and 
review and control by the President and the Congress. 
• 
For revolving fund feeder accounts, which are appropriation accounts whose budgetary resources 
are available only for transfer to specified revolving fund accounts. They should be merged into the 
revolving funds to which they relate, and the amounts included in the feeder accounts should not be 
separately identified. 
• 
In some situations, OMB may choose to merge two or more Treasury accounts for presentation 
purposes. In the case of mergers involving trust funds and Federal funds, a trust fund may be merged 
into a Federal fund presentation (and vice versa) only if the amounts in the trust fund (or in the 
Federal fund) are too small to round to at least a million dollars.

80.1 What are the basic requirements? 
80.2 What general rules do I need to know? 
80.3 What rules apply to discretionary spending and collections? 
80.4 What rules apply to mandatory spending and collections? 
80.5 What rules apply to mandatory supplemental requests? 
80.6 What rules apply to governmental receipts? 
80.7 What materials must I provide in support of baseline estimates? 

80.1 What are the basic requirements? 
OMB baseline estimates follow the rules in section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
Control Act of 1985, as amended (BBEDCA). The baseline rules were reinstated through amendments to 
BBEDCA enacted in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). 

Each agency, including the legislative and judicial branches, must submit estimates of budgetary resources, 
outlays, and receipts that project the CY levels into BY through BY+9, except: 

• 
For credit financing accounts, baseline data is required only for net financing disbursements; and 
• 
Government-sponsored enterprises do not have to submit baseline estimates. 
Section 82 provides detailed information on entering baseline data into MAX. 

BBEDCA provides explicit instructions on how to develop the baseline estimates. Some apply to all 
baseline estimates. However, most rules are specific to two categories of collections and spending: 

• 
Those that are controlled through annual appropriations acts (discretionary spending); and 
• 
Those that are controlled through authorizing legislation (mandatory spending and receipts). 
The classification of collections and spending as discretionary or mandatory spending generally follows the 
criteria specified in BBEDCA. Consult your OMB representative if you have questions concerning the 
classification. 

OMB may work with affected agencies to make adjustments to the estimates to produce an adjusted baseline 
to be used in the budget documents. 

80.2 What general rules do I need to know? 
The baseline is a projection of the budgetary resources, outlays, and receipts for mandatory programs and 
governmental receipts based generally on current law, and a projection of the current year (CY) levels of 
budgetary resources, outlays, and receipts into the outyears for discretionary programs. Below are general 
rules that apply to the baseline estimates: 

• 
Legislative proposals. Legislative proposals are considered to be changes from the baseline 
projection. Do not reflect their budgetary effects in the baseline estimates. 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 80 


SECTION 80—DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE ESTIMATES 

• 
Supplementals. Include only supplementals associated with mandatory programs that would finance 
obligations required by current law in the baseline. 
• 
Regulations, management initiatives, and administrative actions. Include the effects of these 
actions, including planned regulations that are not final, in the baseline estimates, as long as they 
can be implemented without further legislation. 
• 
Credit programs. Base the estimates for credit programs on enacted appropriations of subsidy 
budget authority for direct loans and guaranteed loan commitments. In addition, see section 
185.11(d) for baseline requirements for net financing disbursements in liquidating and financing 
accounts (Schedule Y). 
80.3 What rules apply to discretionary spending and collections? 
Follow the BBEDCA guidelines and base the baseline estimates for discretionary spending and collections 
on the levels provided in the most recent appropriations act or full-year continuing resolution (CR). If a 
part-year CR is in effect, base the estimates on the annualized level of the CR. Except for advance 
appropriations, the most recent appropriations act or full-year CR is normally for the current year. 

(a) Current year base 
Estimates will equal the enacted current year amounts reported in MAX under transmittal code 0. You 
must separate discretionary budgetary resources, except those related to spending authority from offsetting 
collections, into portions related to civilian pay and benefits, military pay and benefits, or not related to pay 
and benefits. See section 81.2 for pay and non-pay definitions. 

(b) BY through BY+9 baseline estimates 
In most cases, baseline estimates of budgetary resources are calculated by MAX to be equal to the most 
recent full year appropriation (generally the CY level) adjusted for anticipated pay and non-pay inflation 
using factors supplied by OMB. 

For the four BBEDCA-specified accounts with social insurance administrative expenses (the Federal 
hospital insurance trust fund, the supplementary medical insurance trust fund, the unemployment trust fund, 
and the rail industry pension fund), you must report estimates of the beneficiary population (see explanation 
of line 5150-00 in section 82.9). 

For programs financed by the Highway and Mass Transit trust fund and controlled by annual obligation 
limitations, projections of discretionary outlays are derived from a projection with inflation of the CY level 
of the obligation limitation. 

Outlays from budgetary resources provided prior to the budget year should be the same in the baseline and 
in the Presidential policy estimates. Baseline budgetary resources in the CY and beyond generally should 
outlay at a rate that is consistent with Presidential policy spendout rates. Section 82.6 describes outlays 
more fully. 

(c) Advance appropriations 
If an account is completely funded through advance appropriations, the last year of the enacted advance 
appropriation is the base for calculating the baseline estimate for the remaining years. However, if the 
Congress discontinues an advance appropriation and provides the funding for that advance in the current 

Page 2 of Section 80 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 80—DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE ESTIMATES 

appropriations instead, the last year of the advance appropriation should be assumed to be zero, and the 
regular appropriation should be inflated accordingly. 

If an account is funded with both current and advance appropriations, inflate the current appropriation as 
described in (b) above; for the advance appropriation, follow the guidance in the paragraph above. 

(d) Discretionary credit accounts 
MAX inflates CY subsidy budget authority using the annual adjustment factor for non-pay costs from the 
economic assumptions for the Budget. The estimated policy subsidy rate for the BY should be a separate 
and distinct calculation from that done for the CY. The OMB credit subsidy calculator computes the 
subsidy rate using the economic assumptions for the Budget. (See section 185.5 for instructions on 
calculating baseline subsidy estimates, including programs with negative subsidies.) OMB does not collect 
baseline information on direct loan obligations and guarantee commitments. 

(e) Discretionary offsetting collections and receipts 
The baseline estimates should be consistent with the levels of budgetary resources assumed for the account 
conducting the activity that generates the collections. When the level of collections is independent of the 
appropriated level, reflect collections consistent with the level of activity anticipated under current law. 

(f) Multi-account appropriations 
If an appropriation covers more than one account and does not specify the amount provided for each 
account, such as the limitation on administrative expenses under the Social Security Act, the distribution of 
the budget authority by account in the CY is the base for subsequent years. MAX inflates the CY amount 
by account to derive the budget authority for BY through BY+9. 

(g) Accounts with negative budget authority in the CY 
• 
If the account has net negative budget authority in the CY as a result of a rescission, reduction, or 
transfer of balances, estimate the budget authority for BY through BY+9 as zero. Prior to setting the 
budget authority for BY through BY+9 to zero, contact your OMB representative to request that the 
MAX automatic calculator be turned off for this row. 
• 
If the account has negative budget authority because the offsetting collections credited to the account 
exceed the spending authority from those offsetting collections (e.g., as a result of limitations on 
administrative expenses or repayments of debt), provide your best estimate of the offsetting 
collections under current law, and 
• 
If the spending authority is controlled by appropriations, project the authority using the 
guidance in section 80.3(b). 
• 
If the spending authority from offsetting collections is indefinite, reflect the level of activity 
anticipated under current law. 
80.4 What rules apply to mandatory spending and collections? 
Section 257 of BBEDCA requires the estimates for budgetary resources provided in authorizing law and 
for appropriated entitlements to reflect the level of activity anticipated under current law, using the Budget’s 
economic and technical assumptions. Include the effect of changes to programs and activities directed by 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 3 of Section 80 


SECTION 80—DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE ESTIMATES 

previously enacted legislation (such as a change in a benefit formula that becomes effective in BY+2) in 
the year that the changes become effective. The following special rules apply: 

• 
Expiring authorizations. Assume that a program explicitly designated as temporary will expire in 
the baseline if the program was enacted after the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Assume that 
programs scheduled to expire under current law (even if not explicitly designated as temporary) will 
expire in the baseline if current year outlays for the program are $50 million or less. Assume that 
all other expiring programs will continue in the baseline if current year outlays exceed $50 million. 
For programs with definite BA, extend the BA at the same level authorized in the last full year, and 
for programs with indefinite BA, project future BA and outlays based on the program’s eligibility 
criteria, benefit formulas, and other provisions in effect at the point of expiration. Assume an 
expiring provision of law (in contrast to an expiring program) will expire if that assumption does 
not have the effect of terminating the basic program. When extending an expiring program in the 
baseline, exclude the effects of future sequestration from BY through BY+9. 
• 
Veterans' compensation cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA). Assume enactment of a COLA for 
veterans' compensation that is equal to the COLA required by law for veterans' pensions. 
Agencies affected by these special rules should contact their OMB representative for guidance. 

You should base collections affected by Federal pay rates on rates used for Presidential policy, not on the 
levels of compensation assumed in the baseline for the pay-related portion of discretionary accounts. If a 
pay increase for the current year has not been enacted, you should assume a current year pay increase equal 
to the pay increase proposed for the current year in the previous President’s Budget, unless otherwise 
directed by OMB. Similarly, if a Presidential policy decision on the pay increase for the budget year has 
not been made, you should use the provisional pay increase for the budget year from section 32.1, unless 
otherwise directed. 

Certain substantive changes to or restrictions on entitlement law or other mandatory spending law contained 
in appropriations laws (including changes in offsetting receipts or collections) shall be treated as changes 
in discretionary spending for the purposes of scoring those appropriations laws (see section 21 and 
Appendix A). However, in the subsequent budget, OMB can decide to reclassify such changes, especially 
in accounts that are generally mandatory. If advised by OMB to reclassify the change, the mandatory 
spending entries for the account should reflect the change made in appropriations law. 

Sequestration of mandatory resources should be reflected in MAX for sequestration taking effect up through 
the current year (that is, through the 2020 sequestration order for purposes of the estimates in the 2021 
President’s Budget). Sequestration for the budget year and beyond (which will be ordered in sequestration 
reports filed with the upcoming and future President’s Budgets) will be handled centrally by OMB and 
should not be reflected in the baseline. Temporary reductions of budgetary resources sequestered in 
revolving, trust, or special fund accounts, or offsetting collections sequestered in appropriations accounts, 
that are determined by OMB to become available in a subsequent fiscal year without further legislative 
action should be included in the baseline for the fiscal year in which they become available. See section 

100.14 for more information on showing these resources in budgetary reporting. 
80.5 What rules apply to mandatory supplemental requests? 
Baseline estimates for mandatory supplemental requests will reflect current year baseline estimates of 
budget authority and the related outlays insofar as that budget authority will finance obligations that exist 
under current law. Budget authority estimates for BY through BY+9 will be zero. However, you should 
reflect the spendout of current year budget authority, as appropriate, over the period BY through BY+9. 

Page 4 of Section 80 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 80—DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE ESTIMATES 

80.6 What rules apply to governmental receipts? 
Governmental receipts should be projected based on provisions of the tax code under current law, except 
that excise taxes dedicated to trust funds are assumed to continue after their scheduled expirations. (These 
receipts will not necessarily be carried over in policy if the trust fund spending is assumed to expire.) Thus, 
estimates should include the effect of changes to governmental receipts directed by previously enacted 
legislation (such as a change in a tax rate, deduction, or credit that becomes effective in BY+2) in the year 
that the changes become effective. 

80.7 What materials must I provide in support of baseline estimates? 
After final budget decisions, you may be required to submit a table showing the impact on the baseline of 
estimates for some or all of the following: 

• 
Major regulations; 
• 
Expiring provisions of law or programs assumed to be extended in the baseline; 
• 
Expiring provisions of law or programs not extended in the baseline; 
• 
Caseloads for major mandatory programs; 
• 
Management initiatives; 
• 
Administrative actions; and 
• 
Other major program assumptions included in the baseline. 
Show the budgetary impact of each major assumption separately. For example, a change in outlays due to 
a regulatory change should be shown separately from a change due to the expiration of a provision of law. 
Consult with your OMB representative on the format and content of this table.

81.1 What are the basic requirements? 
MAX contains detailed information on budgetary resources, outlays, and receipts for presidential policy 
(schedules A and R) and baseline (schedules S and K). You will enter the data for schedules A and S in 
the combined schedule X in MAX. The system will copy the appropriate entries from schedule X into 
schedules A and S. 

• 
Baseline and policy data cover the period PY through BY+9. 
• 
Schedules A and S include information on budget authority, limitations and outlays. 
• 
Schedules R and K include information on receipts. 
For all accounts, except credit financing accounts and Government-sponsored enterprises, you must: 

• 
Submit policy data (all transmittal codes). 
• 
Submit baseline data for the regular budget schedule (transmittal code "0"). 
• 
Submit baseline data for supplemental requests (transmittal code "1") that are classified as 
mandatory and finance obligations that exist under current law (such as payments under entitlement 
programs). 
• 
Do not provide baseline estimates for discretionary supplemental requests. 
• 
Do not provide baseline estimates for other transmittals (e.g., codes "2", "4", "8") unless 
specifically requested by OMB. 
Use the guidance in section 31 and section 32 to develop the policy estimates. Use the guidance in section 
80 to develop the baseline estimates. 

81.2 What data classifications do I use to enter data into MAX? 
Report data using the classifications specified below. Multiple entries are required when more than one 
classification applies to a budgetary resource, limitation, offset, or outlay. When inserting or revising data 
in MAX, choose the appropriate line number, subfunction, budget enforcement subcategory, and other 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 81 


SECTION 81—POLICY AND BASELINE ESTIMATES OF BUDGET AUTHORITY, 
OUTLAYS, AND RECEIPTS (SCHEDULES A, S, R, AND K) 

classifications from a list provided on the screen. For more on inserting data classifications in MAX, see 
exhibit 81. 

DATA CLASSIFICATIONS FOR SCHEDULES X (A and S), R, AND K 

Classification 

Description 

LINE NUMBER Line numbers for schedules A, S, R and K consist of a four-digit number and a two-digit 
suffix (xxxx–xx). For schedules A and S, the first four digits describe the type of data 
being reported and the last two digits distinguish between policy and baseline data or 
describe the types of outlays (see section 82.4). For schedules R and K, the six-digit 
number (xxxx–xx) indicates the character classification (see section 81.3 and 84.4). 

SUBFUNCTION For accounts with a single subfunctional classification (see section 79.2), you can enter 
data without specifying the subfunction; MAX automatically provides the subfunction 
designation. For accounts with multiple subfunctions, you must enter data for each 
subfunction separately. 

CIVILIAN PAY Indicates whether amounts are used to fund personnel compensation and benefits ("pay") 
AND BENEFITS/ or other activities ("non-pay"). This is entered in schedule X on line xxxx–50. 
MILITARY PAY 

Applies to baseline budget authority (other than spending authority from offsetting 

AND BENEFITS/ 

collections) and limitations. 

NON-PAY 
The requirement to distinguish baseline pay and benefits from other amounts applies only 
to discretionary budget authority and limitations. For mandatory amounts, you may choose 
to make the distinction, or just to code all amounts as non-pay. 

Civilian pay and benefits means the amount of new budgetary resources used to fund 
personnel compensation and benefits for civilian personnel, consistent with the definitions 
for object classes 11.1 through 11.5 and 12.1. 

Military pay and benefits means the amount of new budgetary resources used to fund 
personnel compensation and benefits for military personnel, consistent with object classes 
11.6, 11.7 and 12.2. 

Other than pay and benefits means the amount of new budgetary resources not used to 
fund personnel compensation. 

BUDGET 
ENFORCEMENT 
CATEGORY/ 

SUBCATEGORY/ 

JURISDICTION/ 

Indicates: 

• 
Budget enforcement category. (i.e., discretionary, mandatory, net interest, 
governmental receipt) As a general rule, for offsetting collections from 
Federal sources, you should classify any spending authority from offsetting 
collections, the offsetting collections from which they are derived, and the 
associated outlays as mandatory or discretionary based on the activities for 
which the offsetting collections are spent in the receiving account. This means 
the classification will have the same classification as the funding provided for 
similar activities being carried out by the account. For offsetting collections 
from non-Federal sources (e.g. user fees), amounts should be classified as 
mandatory if the legislative language that creates the collection is in 
authorizing legislation or discretionary if the legislative language is in an 
appropriations act. 
• 
Subcategory. Includes subcategories from before discretionary enforcement 
expired in 2002 (e.g. third scorecard, highway, mass transit, non-emergency 
supplemental funding, and discretionary change in a mandatory program), as 
well as the cap adjustments included in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA)

SECTION 81—POLICY AND BASELINE ESTIMATES OF BUDGET AUTHORITY, 
OUTLAYS, AND RECEIPTS (SCHEDULES A, S, R, AND K) 

Classification 

Description 

(e.g., overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism, emergency 
funding, program integrity, and disaster relief). Report data by the categories 
listed in the next table, "Summary of Budget Enforcement Data 
Classifications." Use multiple entries if more than one classification applies to 
the budgetary resources and outlays in an account. 

• 
Jurisdiction. (appropriations or authorizing committee) All discretionary 
resources are under the jurisdiction of appropriations committees. The 
classification for mandatory resources differentiates between appropriations 
and authorizing committee jurisdiction. Only accounts that have been approved 
by OMB should include mandatory resources under the jurisdiction of the 
appropriations committees. 
• 
Rescissions and cancellations. Use an emergency, overseas contingency 
operations/global war on terrorism (OCO/GWOT), or disaster relief 
subcategory to classify rescissions and cancellations of amounts that have been 
designated as emergency, OCO/GWOT, or as disaster relief appropriations, 
respectively. Reductions of funds that have been designated as emergency 
requirements will not be counted as PAYGO offsets for the purposes of the 
Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. Reductions of funds that have been 
designated as emergency requirements, as OCO/GWOT appropriations, or as 
disaster relief will not be counted as discretionary offsets for appropriations of 
non-emergency funds. 
• 
Other. The above rules apply to all line entries except the number of 
beneficiaries (line 5250-00).

81.3 What information do I need to report? 
(a) Expenditure accounts 
Report all budgetary resources, limitations, outlays, and offsets in schedule X and MAX will automatically 
copy the data to schedules A and S. For more information about schedule X, see 
section 82. 

The following rules apply to expenditure accounts: 

• 
For PY through BY, the sum of amounts for total policy BA (lines xxxx-40) and offsets (lines xxxx41)
must equal the amounts entered for schedule P (four-digit line numbers). 
• 
For discretionary CY amounts in transmit 0, baseline BA; limitations; and offset amounts must equal 
policy amounts. You will enter data in the baseline lines, and MAX will copy it to policy and lock 
the policy amount. 
• 
For mandatory amounts in CY through BY+9 in transmit 0, all baseline amounts must equal policy 
amounts. You will enter data in the baseline lines, and MAX will copy it to policy and lock the 
policy amounts. 
• 
For discretionary baseline BA and limitations (except spending authority from offsetting 
collections), you will enter a CY amount and MAX will generate and lock BY through BY+9. For 
mandatory baseline BA and limitations, you will enter all amounts. 
• 
For discretionary policy BA and limitations (except spending authority from offsetting collections), 
you will enter a BY amount and MAX will generate and lock BY+1 through BY+9. In some cases, 
OMB will unlock BY+1 through BY+9 so you can overwrite the amounts in 
the outyears. 
• 
For discretionary offsets and spending authority from offsetting collections, you will enter data for 
CY in baseline and BY in policy, and MAX will generate the outyears. You may overwrite these 
generated amounts. 
• 
For discretionary outlays, you will enter in policy: 
o Outlay amounts in PY. 
o Outlay amounts in all years for outlays from balances (both obligated and unobligated) of 
budget authority brought forward from PY (end of PY balances). 
o Outlay rates that apply to BA or limitations provided in the CY and beyond. You may use 
different outlay rates for the CY than you use for BY and beyond. 
MAX will copy PY amounts, all outlay rates, and end of PY balance outlay amounts to baseline. 

• 
For mandatory outlays, you may choose to enter all amounts by hand, or use the outlay rates where 
applicable. MAX will copy outlay amounts and rates to baseline.

SECTION 81—POLICY AND BASELINE ESTIMATES OF BUDGET AUTHORITY, 
OUTLAYS, AND RECEIPTS (SCHEDULES A, S, R, AND K) 

(b) Receipt accounts 
Report data on all collections deposited in receipt accounts (i.e., governmental receipts and offsetting 
receipts) in schedules R and K. The line numbers for offsetting receipts are also used to designate receipt 
character classification (see section 84.3(d)). Only one character classification (line number) is valid for 
each receipt account, and that information must be specified in advance in OMB's database of account 
information before you can report the character classification data for the applicable account. 

The following rules apply to receipts: 

• 
Past year data will be loaded into schedule R from agency data reported to Treasury. These amounts 
cannot be overridden but can be changed by OMB when agencies provide valid justification, to 
include coordination with Treasury (see section 82.12). 
• 
MAX automatically calculates discretionary policy receipts in schedule R through BY+9 for the 
years that are subject to across-the-board rules. You may overwrite these amounts, if necessary. 
• 
MAX also automatically calculates discretionary baseline receipts in schedule K for BY through 
BY+9 based on the CY budgetary resources entered by the agency and inflation factors entered by 
OMB. You may overwrite these amounts, if necessary. 
• 
MAX copies the mandatory baseline receipts data you enter in schedule K to schedule R. To change 
the policy estimates, you must revise the baseline estimates. 
The following table indicates the line numbers used to report receipts in schedules K and R: 

RECEIPTS 

Entry Title Description 
0000–00 Governmental receipts Report all collections classified as governmental 
receipts (see section 20.7). 
Offsetting receipts: Report all offsetting receipts based on the character

How do I add a new data classification to my account in MAX? 

When you add a new policy line (line number xxxx-40 or xxxx-41) to schedule X in the MAX A-11 Data 
Entry application (MAX), you are required to specify a data classification. The classification includes the 
budget enforcement category (discretionary or mandatory), committee jurisdiction (appropriations or 
authorizing), and possibly a budget enforcement subcategory (e.g., emergency). See section 81.2 for a list 
of these combinations. 

To add a line with a data classification that is not already represented in your account: 

• 
Right-click on the title of the four-digit line number associated with the data you need to insert 
(e.g., 1160); 
• 
Choose Insert line/schedule; 
• 
Choose the item from the line number list with the same line number you just clicked on plus the 
last two digits ‘30’ (e.g., 116030) and titled Budget Enforcement Act Category; 
• 
Click on Insert; and 
• 
Choose the appropriate data classification (e.g., Discretionary, Discretionary Change in a 
Mandatory Program, Appropriations Committee). 
You should enter your data on the lines directly below the new header that will appear onscreen. 

To add another line series for an existing data classification: 

• 
Right-click on the title of a policy line (e.g., 1160-40) with the correct classification 
• 
Choose Insert line/schedule. 
• 
Choose the item from the line number list with the same line number plus the last two digits ‘40’ 
(e.g., 116040); 
• 
Click on Insert; 
• 
Choose a Sequence number or leave blank if you want the system to assign a value 
• 
Click Choose 
Right-click here

SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

82.1 What is schedule X? 
Schedule X facilitates entering like data into the MAX database. Instead of entering similar or identical 
data into three different schedules, you use one master worksheet. The data entered into schedule X 
populates: 

• 
Schedule P (Program and financing schedule) 
• 
Schedule A (Presidential policy data for expenditure accounts) 
• 
Schedule S (Presidential baseline data for expenditure accounts) 
For credit financing accounts and government-sponsored enterprises, schedule X populates only schedule 
P, because these accounts do not have policy or baseline data. 

82.2 What are schedules P, A, and S? 
Schedule P is the program and financing schedule. It is printed in the budget Appendix and presents 
information on agency programs, the allocation of budgetary resources by activity, the status of those 
resources, and spending patterns. The schedule covers PY through BY. It is used to: 

• 
Analyze and evaluate the estimates; 
• 
Compare enacted funding levels to the President's request; 
• 
Relate budget formulation to budget execution (estimates to actuals); and 
• 
Identify programmatic and historical trends. 
Schedule A shows budget authority (BA) and outlays by OMB account for the most recent actual year (PY), 
enacted levels for the current year (CY), and the levels proposed by the President for the budget year (BY) 
through BY+9. 
Schedule S shows baseline estimates of BA and outlays by OMB account and covers CY through BY+9. 
To learn more about the additional data classifications you will use for schedules A and S, see section 81. 

82.3 How is schedule X organized? 
Schedule X follows the flow of the program and financing schedule (schedule P): 

• 
Obligations by program activity (lines 0001–0900) (section 82.5) 
• 
Budgetary resources (lines 1000–1966) (section 82.6) 
• 
Change in obligated balance (lines 3000–3200) (section 82.7) 
• 
Budget authority and outlays, net (lines 4000–4190) (section 82.8) 
• 
Memorandum (non-add) entries (lines 5000–5250) (section 82.9) 
• 
Unfunded deficiencies (lines 7000–7020) (section 82.10) 
The data you enter in the Budgetary Resources section and the Budget Authority and Outlays, Net section 
will automatically populate schedules P, A, and S. The remainder of the sections populate schedule P. 

The Budgetary Resources section is a common section used in schedule X, the SF133 report on budget 
execution, and the apportionment schedule. The Change in Obligated Balance; the Budget Authority and 
Outlays, Net is used in schedule X and the SF133. 

Page 2 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

82.4 How are schedules A and S derived from schedule X? 
In the Budgetary Resources section, where schedule X shows the total for a type of BA (e.g., line 1160), 
you will also enter a more detailed breakout of budget authority and outlays used to populate schedules A 
and S. In the Budget Authority and Outlays, Net section, where schedule P shows offsets (e.g., line 4030), 
you will also enter a more detailed breakout of offsets for schedules A and S. 

You will do this by using more than one version of the line. For example, for total discretionary 
appropriations, you will use line X 1160 to populate schedule P, line X 1160–40 to populate schedule A, 
and line X 1160–50 to populate schedule S. Since baseline and policy should be equal in CY for all data 
in transmit 0 and for BY through BY+9 in transmit 0 for mandatory receipts and spending, MAX will copy 
your data entry from baseline lines to policy. MAX will display a CY error if the amounts you enter in 
schedule X to populate the P and A schedules do not match the corresponding amounts that populate 
schedule A. 

Schedules A and S also require that you associate outlays with your BA, so for each line of policy and 
baseline BA, you will show the associated outlays. These outlays are copied directly into schedules A and 
S, and are used to populate the Budget Authority and Outlays, Net section of schedule P. See exhibit 82B 
for more guidance on entering outlays. 

Schedule P line numbers always have four digits. Schedule A and S line numbers always have six digits. 
Subtotals that appear only onscreen (i.e., do not print) also have 6 digits. This chart shows what the fifth 
and sixth digits in line numbers mean:

82.5 How do I report obligations by program activity? 
The Obligations by Program Activity section of schedule X, lines 0001–0900, shows the new obligations 
of unexpired accounts for each of the principle program activities or projects financed by the account (see 
section 20.5 for instructions on when to record obligations). Direct obligations are shown on lines 0001– 
0799, reimbursable obligations are shown on lines 0801–0899 (see section 83.5 for more on the distinction 
between direct and reimbursable obligations), and the 07xx series is reserved for credit-specific activities. 
The total direct and reimbursable obligations in this section must tie to the totals in schedule O, object 
classification. 

In transmit 0, all amounts in this section must be positive. 

(a) Selecting program activities 
Use activities that provide a constructive basis for analyzing and evaluating the estimates. Keep the number 
of activities to a reasonable minimum without sacrificing clarity. Do not use subactivities (such as projects 
or recipient institutions), unless the amounts are significant and the breakdown necessary to provide full 
understanding. The activities should: 

• 
Clearly indicate the services to be performed or the programs to be conducted; 
• 
Finance no more than one strategic goal or objective; 
• 
Distinguish investment, developmental, grant and subsidy, and operating programs; and 
• 
Relate to administrative control and operation of the agency. 
In cases where a single program activity line is used to group a variety of activities that do not lend 
themselves to a more specific description, the line title will start with the name of the account and indicate 
whether the obligations are direct or reimbursable, as follows: 

• 
Account Title (Direct) 
• 
Account Title (Reimbursable) 
Page 4 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

This naming convention will better standardize and improve the program activity line descriptions reported 
in the Budget. 

Unless otherwise noted, you must: 

• 
Distinguish direct obligations from reimbursable programs; and, 
• 
Have adequate accounting support for obligations shown in the actual column. 
Having adequate accounting support means that your agency's financial system records obligations in a 
way that allows you to create a straight-forward cross-walk between the projects or limitations in the 
financial system and schedule X program activities. Typically, you will have many projects or limitations 
in your financial systems that correspond to one schedule X activity. 

Obtain approval for any changes in activity structure from OMB prior to your budget submission. 

(b) Allocating expenses to activities 
Charge personnel compensation to activities on the basis of organizational units or on the basis of specific 
assignments. When feasible, distribute other administrative and overhead expenses among activities. 
However, you must be able to readily separate these overhead expenses from other charges. If you need to 
distribute amounts between two or more activities, base the distribution on readily supportable factors. Be 
consistent from year to year, and do not rely on overly detailed procedures. 

Do not report adjustments to obligations in expired accounts in this part of schedule X. Report them under 
changes in obligated balance, on lines 3011 and 3041 (see section 82.5). 

(c) Reimbursable programs 
If your account includes reimbursable obligations (see section 20.5), show the obligations financed by 
reimbursements separately from direct obligations. For classifying obligations as direct or reimbursable 
see section 83.5. 

Report all the obligations in non-credit revolving fund accounts as reimbursable; report all the obligations 
in credit program and liquidating accounts as direct. 

(d) Program activity codes 
Program activity codes are unique to each account and have no relationship to the codes shown in other 
schedules, except for credit programs. For obligations specific to credit accounts, use the 07xx series, as 
specified in the list of line numbers at the end of this chapter. 

82.6 How do I report the budgetary resources available for obligation? 
This section identifies the budgetary resources available for obligation in the account and provides detailed 
information on the new budget authority. This section is also used in the SF 133 report on budget execution 
and in the apportionment schedule. 

(a) Unobligated balance 
The entries include unobligated balances carried over from prior years and adjustments to those amounts 
(such as transfers of balances to and from other budget accounts and recoveries resulting from downward 
adjustments of prior-year unpaid obligations). The unobligated balances reported on schedule X do not 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 5 of Section 82 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

include expired amounts or amounts unavailable for obligation. The end-of-year balances are shown as a 
memorandum entry on line 1941. 

(b) Budget authority 
The entries indicate the type of budget authority (such as appropriations, contract authority, spending 
authority from offsetting collections) and whether the authority: 

• 
Is discretionary or mandatory; and 
• 
Pertains to a special or trust fund account. 
Separate entries identify adjustments resulting from transfers, temporary and permanent reductions, capital 
transfers, repayments of outstanding borrowing, etc. 

Discretionary budget authority means budget authority under the jurisdiction of appropriations committees 
and controlled by annual appropriations acts. It includes budget authority provided in appropriations acts 
except where such authority funds direct-spending programs, such as appropriated entitlements. Use the 
appropriate discretionary entries to report budget authority that is classified as discretionary under the 
Balance Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), see sections 20.4(e) and 81.3. 

Mandatory budget authority means budget authority resulting from permanent laws and includes programs 
the BBEDCA defines as "appropriated entitlements and mandatories," direct spending programs included 
in appropriations Act such as the Medicare program. Use the appropriate mandatory entries to report all 
budget authority that is classified as mandatory under the BBEDCA, as well as budget authority that is 
classified as net interest. Also use the appropriate mandatory entries to report budget authority associated 
with credit financing accounts. 

(c) Entering policy and baseline budgetary resources data 
Below is additional detail on entering the data into schedule X that will populate schedules A and S for 
budgetary resources and outlays. 

BUDGETARY RESOURCES 

Entry Description 
1160–xx to 
1850–xx 
Budget Authority. Includes total lines for each BEA category (e.g., discretionary, 
mandatory,) for the different budgetary authority types (i.e., appropriations, advance 
appropriations, borrowing authority, contract authority, spending authority from offsetting 
collections). 
Policy estimates of advance appropriations (line 1180) for BY+2 and beyond will be set equal 
to BY+1, unless OMB approves as exception. 

1963–xx to Limitations. MAX includes data on limitations for selected accounts where limitations on 
1966–xx program level or administrative expenses are enacted or proposed. 

Limitation lines are also used, with OMB approval, for special purposes, such as to report 
information on mandatory administrative expenses for the social security and Medicare trust 
funds. The limitation(s) applicable to an account must be specified in advance in OMB 
database of account information before you can report limitation data in MAX. When more 
than one limitation is applicable, report each one separately. Supplemental requests and 
legislative proposals that involve limitations should be reported under the appropriate 
transmittal code. 

Page 6 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

Entry 

Description 

Mandatory budget authority that is subject to a discretionary limitation on obligations 
established in an appropriations act is scored as discretionary budget authority rather than as a 
limitation for all affected accounts except trust fund accounts in the Department of 
Transportation. 

xxxx–40 Policy budget authority. The amounts on this line will be copied to schedule A. 

For discretionary policy budget authority and spending authority from offsetting collections, 
as a general rule, MAX automatically calculates entries for BY+1 through BY+9 based on the 
BY budgetary resources entered by the agency and growth factors entered by OMB. 

For discretionary spending authority from offsetting collections entries (line 1750), you may 
overwrite these amounts, if necessary. 

For mandatory budget authority and spending authority from offsetting collections, amounts 
will be copied from line xxxx–50 in transmittal code 0 only. 

xxxx–50 Baseline budget authority. The amounts on this line will be copied to schedule S. 

As mentioned in section 81.2, amounts on this line should be broken out by civilian pay/ 
military pay/ non-pay. 

For discretionary baseline budget authority and spending authority from offsetting collections, 
as a general rule, MAX automatically calculates entries for BY through BY+9 based on the 
CY budgetary resources entered by the agency and growth factors entered by OMB. 

For discretionary spending authority from offsetting collections (line 1750), you may 
overwrite these amounts, if necessary, to accurately reflect levels of activity anticipated under 
current law. 

For mandatory budget authority and offsetting collections, entries should reflect the levels of 
activity anticipated under current law. 

(d) Entering policy and baseline outlay data 
Discretionary outlays. MAX automatically calculates discretionary outlays (policy and baseline) for CY 
through BY+9 based on the information reported in schedule X for: 

• 
The levels of budgetary resources reported; 
• 
The percentage of new BA that is outlayed in the year the BA is provided and in each subsequent 
year (outlay rate); and 
• 
Outlays from PY balances. 
You report outlay rates using the separate MAX drop down menu that is accessible for each budgetary 
resource, as described in the MAX A–11 User’s Guide (see exhibit 82B). If necessary, you can report 
multiple outlay rates for the budgetary resources within an account, along with the corresponding outlays 
from PY balances. To support the automatic outlay generation feature in MAX, you must enter information 
developed using the method of calculation (i.e., the waterfall method) that is specified in this Circular and 
the MAX A–11 User’s Guide (see exhibit 82C). As a general rule, you cannot override automatically 
generated discretionary outlay amounts. 

Mandatory outlays. If you enter outlay rates for mandatory resources, MAX will automatically generate 
the outlays. Remember to include information on outlays from PY balances if you use the automatic 
feature. Otherwise, you must enter mandatory outlays by hand for all years. A benefit of using outlay rates 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 7 of Section 82 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

to calculate outlays is that MAX will automatically generate revised outlays if you change the BA, saving 
you the work of calculating and entering revised outlay estimates. 

Outlays from new and prior authority. Outlays must be distributed between those from new authority and 
those from balances of prior authority. The distribution of prior authority should be available from 
accounting records. For CY through BY+9, estimate the distribution based on experience in the timing of 
outlays for the respective obligations. 

The following line numbers indicate the type of outlays. You will enter these data in schedule X, and MAX 
will automatically copy them to schedules A and S. 

OUTLAYS 

Policy Baseline Description 
xxxx–61 xxxx–81 Outlays from new authority. The outlays from new budget authority for that year. 
For outlays from discretionary and mandatory authority, the sum of all outlays from 
new authority may not exceed the sum of new budget authority entries (lines 11xx 
through 16xx) for that year. 
For outlays from spending authority from offsetting collections, outlays may not 
exceed the total amount reported on lines 1750 and 1850. 
Policy (xxxx–61) and baseline (xxxx–81) outlays from new authority will generally 
be the same for mandatory programs in all years and discretionary programs in the 
CY. Discretionary policy outlays may be different from baseline outlays if budget 
authority amounts are different between the two. 
xxxx–62 xxxx–82 Outlays from balances. The outlays from balances (both obligated and unobligated) 
of budget authority brought forward from CY to BY+9. 
Policy (xxxx–62) and baseline (xxxx–82) outlays from balances will generally be the 
same for mandatory programs in all years and discretionary programs in the BY. 
Discretionary policy outlays may be different from baseline outlays if budget 
authority amounts are different between the two. 
xxxx–63 xxxx–83 Outlays from end of PY balances. The outlays from balances (both obligated and 
unobligated) of budget authority brought forward from PY. Amounts should be 
shown in the year the outlay will be made, from CY to BY+9. Do not report outlays 
from new budget authority provided in CY to BY+9. 
This line can also be used to display the outlay impact (+ or –) of balance transfers 
(lines 1010 to 1031) and adjustments in expired accounts (line 3011, 3041). 
The sum of all years of the outlays from end of PY balances lines (xxxx–63) should 
not exceed the total end of PY balances plus PY unpaid obligations, end of year, plus 
or minus CY and BY balance transfers / adjustments. 
The amounts shown on baseline outlays from PY balances (xxxx–83) will be copied 
from policy outlays from PY balances (xxxx–63). 

82.7 How do I report the change in obligated balances? 
Obligated balances are composed of unpaid obligations (shown as positive amounts) and uncollected 
customer payments from Federal sources (shown as negative amounts). Unpaid obligations are obligations 
you have incurred but have not yet paid. Uncollected customer payments are money you're owed from 
Federal sources plus orders that have been placed with you by Federal sources, but you have not yet 

Page 8 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

fulfilled. Only if an account has explicit legal authority to count orders from non-Federal sources as a 
budgetary resource may it do so. 

Schedule X separately bridges between start and end of year unpaid obligations and uncollected customer 
payments from Federal sources. For unpaid obligations, new obligations are added to the start of year 
balance, and gross outlays are deducted. Adjustments, such as transfers of unpaid obligations are added or 
subtracted, as appropriate, and recoveries of prior-year unpaid obligations are subtracted to determine the 
unpaid obligations at the end of the year. For uncollected customer payments from Federal sources, 
adjustments, such as transfers of uncollected payments and the change in uncollected customer payments 
from Federal sources (both unexpired and expired), are added or subtracted, as appropriate, to determine 
the uncollected payments at the end of the year. In addition to reporting transactions in unexpired accounts, 
reflect outlays from and adjustments in expired (but not canceled) accounts. 

82.8 How do I report budget authority and outlays, net? 
This section of schedule X bridges between gross and net budget authority and outlays. It begins with 
mandatory and discretionary gross budget authority and outlays. Budget authority is reported for unexpired 
accounts only; outlays include both expired and unexpired accounts. Outlays are distinguished between 
outlays from new authority and from balances. 

Next, cash collections of offsetting collections are shown as negative amounts that offset both gross budget 
authority and gross outlays. Following that are several items that further adjust only gross budget authority: 
changes in uncollected customer payments; offsetting collections credited to expired accounts; and 
recoveries of prior year paid obligations. 

(1) Increases in uncollected customer payments from the start to the end of the year increase the amount 
of the offset (and are shown as negative amounts in this section) because the increase constitutes 
an increase in gross budget authority; decreases reduce the amount of the offset because a decrease 
means that a portion of the offsetting collections (cash) received has been applied to liquidate 
obligations for which an offset was already counted. 
(2) Offsetting collections credited to expired accounts are shown as positive amounts here so that there 
is no total effect on budget authority of receiving a cash collection that is credited to an expired 
account. The amount on this line (line 4052 or 4142) and the amount in the cash collection line 
(e.g., 4030) have opposite signs and sum to zero. We do this because gross budget authority 
includes only unexpired amounts. 
(3) Recoveries of prior-year paid obligations credited to unexpired accounts are shown as positive 
amounts here so that there is no total effect on budget authority of receiving a cash refund that is 
credited to an unexpired account. The amounts on this line (line 4053 or 4143) and the amount on 
the cash collection line (e.g., line 4030) have opposite signs and sum to zero. We do this because 
gross budget authority does not include recoveries of prior-year paid obligations. 
Finally, net outlays are shown as the sum of gross budget authority and outlays and any applicable offsets. 

Below is additional detail on entering the data into schedule X that will populate schedules A and S for 
offsets. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 9 of Section 82 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

OFFSETS 

Description 

Entry 
4030–xx to Offsets against gross budget authority and outlays Includes total lines for each BEA category 

4144–xx (e.g., discretionary, mandatory, see section 82.3 for line definitions) within the different sources 
of offsetting collections (e.g., Federal sources, interest on Federal securities, interest on 
uninvested funds, non-Federal sources, offsetting governmental collections from non-Federal 
sources, change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources unexpired accounts and 
offsetting collections credited to expired accounts and recoveries of prior-year paid obligations 
credited to unexpired accounts). 

xxxx–41 Policy offsetting collections. The amounts on this line will be copied to schedule A. 

For discretionary policy offsetting collections, as a general rule, MAX automatically calculates 
entries for BY+1 through BY+9 based on the BY amounts entered by the agency and growth 
factors entered by OMB. You may overwrite these amounts, if necessary. 

xxxx–71 Baseline offsetting collections. The amounts on this line will be copied from policy offsetting 
collections (xxxx–41) and will be copied to schedule S. 

For discretionary baseline offsetting collections, MAX automatically calculates entries for BY 
through BY+9 based on the CY amounts entered by the agency and growth factors entered by 
OMB. 

82.9 What memorandum information must I report on Schedule X? 
Lines 0910 and 0911 of schedule X display supplementary information related to amount of appropriations 
used to liquidate deficiencies of lease payments. Use only with OMB approval. 

While lines 1940 and 1941 of schedule X display supplemental information related to unobligated balances 
at the end of the fiscal year for all accounts, lines 1950 through 1955 specifically address unobligated 
balances of special and trust non-revolving trust funds including canceling amounts. 

Lines 5000–5201 of schedule X display supplementary information related to investments in Federal 
securities; investments in non-Federal securities, balances of contract authority, unavailable unobligated 
balances (derived from appropriations, borrowing authority, contract authority, offsetting collections), and 
discretionary mandated transfers. 

In addition, certain accounts will use line 5250–00 to report on the annual average number of beneficiaries 
who are served by Federal hospital insurance, supplementary medical insurance, unemployment insurance, 
and rail industry pension fund programs. MAX uses this data to generate discretionary baseline budget 
authority for administrative expenses for these programs. Use only with OMB approval. 

None of the amounts on the lines above are added or deducted from the budget authority or outlay amounts 
reported above. 

82.10 How do I show unfunded deficiencies that have not been liquidated? 
Section 145 explains prohibited agency actions under the Antideficiency Act and associated reporting 
requirements when a violation is discovered. 

Page 10 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

Lines 7000–7020 of schedule X identify unfunded deficiencies that have not yet been liquidated by either 
a new appropriation that specifically authorizes amounts to be applied to the deficiency or by the 
administrative application of other budgetary resources not expressly provided to liquidate deficiencies. 

82.11 What control totals do I need to tie to? 
Some of the data you enter into MAX needs to tie to control totals. The following list is not exhaustive: 

(a) Controls reported by the agency 
The following is data that your agency has already reported. You must either tie to those controls, or, if 
appropriate, fix your other reporting: 

GTAS. This data is drawn from the 4th quarter U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) accounting 
information reported by your agency accounting office at the Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol-level 
into a Treasury-operated system named Government-wide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial 
Balance System (GTAS). 

In the 2021 Budget, almost all the lines that are used to populate schedule X/P will be edit checked against 
your GTAS submission. The PY amounts on the edit checked schedule X/P lines must also equal the 
amounts reported in GTAS within a +/-one or two million tolerance. The following types of lines are not 
edit checked against GTAS: 

• 
Individual obligations by program activities (X0001–X0899) 
• 
Non-expenditure transfers, e.g. appropriation transfers from other accounts (–) (X1120) 
• 
Specific MAX-generated detail entries, e.g. new obligations, unexpired accounts (X3010) 
• 
Specific MAX-generated subtotals and totals, e.g., total discretionary appropriations (X1160) 
• 
Specific memorandum (non-add) entries, e.g. unobligated balance, SOY: contract authority 
(X5050) 
PY net outlays (line X4190) and PY receipts (schedule R). This data is drawn from the following budget 
execution documents: FS 224, FS 1219, and FS 1220. The data is loaded into MAX by OMB and locked. 
The PY net outlay amount on schedule X/P line 4190 must equal the net outlays reported in GTAS within 
a +/-one million tolerance. 

• 
If you do not agree with the amount on line X/P 4190 "Outlays, net (discretionary and mandatory)", 
after the GTAS database is locked (late-October) and the amount is reported in GTAS and imported 
into MAX A–11, then you must submit a written explanation of the difference to your OMB 
representative before OMB will consider revising the amount. Since these types of issues generally 
require a revised Statement of Transactions, you must submit your explanation via a backdated 
Treasury document request at https://max.omb.gov/community/x/6YLrHQ. Applies to GTAS and 
non-GTAS users. 
• 
Follow the process in the bullet above if your agency does not agree with the receipt actuals that 
have been imported into MAX schedule R from Treasury FS 224 data. (See section 81.1). Receipt 
account information is not collected via GTAS. 
Non-Federal securities (Market value). Line X5011, Total investments, end of year: non-Federal 
securities: Market value is checked against amounts agencies report to Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal 
Service in Business Event Type Codes associated with the previous subclasses 42 and 43 on the Statements 
of Transactions. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 11 of Section 82 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

Credit. For Federal credit programs, credit subsidy cost data must match amounts approved by OMB. 
Control totals for schedule X reestimate and interest on reestimate obligations are verified against agency 
submissions to OMB through the Credit Supplement Report Exercise (CSR). For most programs, both 
control totals and schedule X obligation data for reestimates are automatically loaded into MAX, upon 
OMB approval. 

Start of year balances. Start of year balances for investments in non-Federal securities (X 5010) and the 
unavailable balance of offsetting collections (X 5054) are checked against the end of year amount shown 
in the previous budget. If you disagree with this number, provide an explanation to your OMB 
representative for the discrepancy. 

(b) Controls reported by Treasury 
Interest earnings on Federal securities. Lines X4031 and X4121, Offsetting collections collected from 
interest on Federal securities are checked against amounts reported by Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal 
Service. 

Federal securities (Par value). Lines X5000 and X5001, Total investments, start and end of year: Federal 
securities: Par value is checked against amounts reported by Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service. 

Financing account interest. Lines X0713 (Obligations for payment of interest to Treasury) and X4122 
(Offsetting collections from interest on uninvested funds) are checked against amounts reported by 
Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service for financing accounts only. 

Capital transfers. Lines X1022 (capital transfer of unobligated balances to general fund), X1235 (capital 
transfer of appropriations to general fund) and X1720/1820 (capital transfer of spending authority from 
offsetting collections to general fund) are checked against amounts reported by Treasury's Bureau of the 
Fiscal Service. 

Unobligated balance transfers between expired and unexpired accounts. Line X1012 (unobligated 
balance transfers between expired and unexpired accounts) is checked against amounts reported by 
Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service. 

(c) Controls reported by OMB 
For both the formulation of the Budget and for mid-session review, OMB provides control totals for net 
discretionary levels. There are four types of edit checks which compare net discretionary levels in MAX to 
OMB control totals. Control total amounts are in whole millions. 

For each OMB account, these lines are included in each type of check: 

• 
BA/Obligation Limitation: The sum of lines X1160, X1340, X1540, and X1966, which are 
associated with budget authority (excluding advance appropriations) and obligation limitations. 
• 
Advance Appropriation: Line X1180 associated with advance appropriations. 
• 
Spending Authority and Offsetting Collections (Net Offset): The sum of line X1750 
(discretionary spending authority and orders on hand) and lines X4030, X4031, X4032, X4033, 
X4034, X4050, X4052, X4053, and X4054 (offsetting collections) are compared to the net totals 
for each OMB account. 
Page 12 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

• 
Offsetting Receipts: The total for lines R2004-03 and R1330-03 for discretionary offsetting 
receipts. 
Contact your OMB representative about how to view reports comparing live MAX data to the OMB 
discretionary control totals. 

CY net discretionary control totals. The OMB control totals are based on BEA scoring of enacted 
appropriations for CY. If there are no final enacted CY appropriations at the time, OMB will make a 
determination as to what funding levels to include in the CY column. 

In some cases, OMB's control total may need to be updated (e.g., for updated offsetting collection or receipt 
estimates, for transfers, or for other technical updates). Please contact your OMB representative if a change 
is needed to a control total. You will need to provide a written explanation of the change and the enacted 
legislation supporting that explanation. 

BY net discretionary controls for mid-session. The OMB control totals will be the net discretionary levels 
from the President's Budget, with limited changes based on: 

• 
technical adjustments due to legislation enacted since the Budget's release 
• 
budget amendments formally transmitted to the Congress 
• 
corrections submitted to OMB's errata database 
OMB anticipates very few changes to the net BY discretionary levels during mid-session. Please contact 
your OMB representative if you believe a change is needed to a control total. You will need to provide a 
written explanation of the change and the enacted legislation and/or Budget Appendix language supporting 
that explanation. 

82.12 How do I resolve issues with my GTAS control totals? 
(a) What actuals in schedule X are imported from the actual I reported to Treasury? 
In order to reduce duplicate reporting while improving the consistency of year-end data, your agency 
accounting office reports U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) accounting information at the Treasury 
account-level into a Treasury-operated system named Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol 
Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS), which was developed by agencies, Treasury, and OMB. The 
GTAS information is then translated/crosswalked and copied into the following reports: 

• 
SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (used to monitor SF 132 
Apportionments and used as the basis of the audited Statement of Budgetary Resources); and 
• 
Much of the PY column of schedule P. 
• 
For more information about GTAS and the USSGL and crosswalks from the USSGL to schedule P, 
see USSGL Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) supplement located at 
http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl/index.html. 
When year-end GTAS information is submitted, the information must not only pass a number of GTAS 
edit-checks, but a person separate from the "preparer" (i.e. data entry person) named a "certifier" must 
certify that the information is correct. In addition, GAO requires your auditors to determine whether 
controls exist to ensure that the amounts in your systems and the amounts submitted via GTAS agree. See 
GAO–02–126G "Guide for Auditing the Statement of Budgetary Resources". 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 13 of Section 82 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

On a daily basis, Treasury provides your agency with an Account Statement via the Governmentwide 
Accounting System. The Account Statement reflects all activity reported to Treasury. You are required to 
reconcile the Account Statement with your accounting system each month. At year-end, this reconciliation 
should be accomplished before submitting your GTAS data. 

During the preparation of the Budget, refer to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/h4CpAg for budget 
season GTAS reports that include the following: 

• 
MAX A–11 Issue Status Report – GTAS only 
• 
GTAS submissions that will lead to errors in MAX 
• 
GTAS suppression requests (link) 
• 
GTAS revision reports (link) 
• 
GTAS TAFSs revised after 4th quarter window 
• 
GTAS TAFSs with budgetary changes 
• 
GTAS TAFSs with budgetary and proprietary changes 
The following table summarizes the actions you need to take if MAX does not agree with GTAS edit-
checked amounts: 

If an error is found… Then…

• 
Consult with your accounting office. 
• 
Correct the amount in MAX A–11. 
• 
Ensure that your accounting office revises the amount in 
GTAS. Your accounting office must revise both material and 
non-material amounts in GTAS. 
• 
Work with your accounting office to determine the source of 
the problem and internally develop a plan to make sure the 
problem does not recur in the future. Your accounting office 
will also need to talk with the financial statement auditors to 
determine whether your financial statements for the next 
reporting cycle should be restated or a footnote to the 
financial statements is required for the changes made in 
GTAS. 
• 
For limited situations where there appears to be insufficient 
budgetary accounting to support the budget presentation, 
submit a PY GTAS-related suppression request to 
https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kQJuFw. OMB will 
review the suppression requests on a case-by-case basis. 
Agency requests should include affected Treasury 
Appropriation Fund Symbol, MAX A–11 edit error, the 
amount of the adjustment in actual dollars, agency contact 
information, and an action plan that explores the various 
options to improve the budgetary accounting.

SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

If an error is found… Then… 

• 
Submit a CY GTAS-related suppression request to 
https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kQJuFw for any situation 
where the certified end of year unobligated and/or obligated 
balance(s) differ from the balances shown in MAX A–11. 
Refer to section 82.12(d) below. 
• 
Ensure that your accounting office revises the amount in 
GTAS no later than 2nd quarter FY 2020 GTAS reporting 
window for both PY and CY changes. Include a statement in 
your action plan of your GTAS-related suppression request. 
Your accounting office must revise both material and non-
material amounts in GTAS. 
• 
OMB will review the suppression requests on a case-by-case 
basis. 
• 
The GTAS revision window will be open to agency accounting offices at the same time agency 
budget offices are working on the actual column (PY) data in the budget database. During this time, 
the GTAS-related suppression request exercise (https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kQJuFw) will 
also be available. Agencies may prepare suppression requests during and after the GTAS revision 
window. As a general rule, OMB will not suppress any MAX A–11 edit-checks related to GTAS 
data before the GTAS revision window closes. 
While the GTAS revision window is open, OMB will use the revised GTAS data in its edit checks. If your 
agency accounting office has made all the appropriate revisions in GTAS, then your agency should have 
no edit-checks problems related to GTAS. 

(b) What do I do if I do not agree with GTAS non-edit-checked PY amounts imported from 
Treasury? 
You may over-write amounts imported from GTAS that are not edit-checked. However, before overwriting 
an amount in the PY column of Schedule P in MAX A–11, you should talk with the person who 
entered the data into GTAS to see why they entered that amount. If you both find that an amount reported 
via GTAS was incorrect, then over-write the amount and let the person who entered the information in 
GTAS know, so that they can revise it. This may indirectly impact other GTAS data that is edit checked. 

(c) What do I need to do if a backdated Treasury document is required to revise MAX to report 
corrections to data for previous fiscal years? 
If you have discovered an error in the budgetary reporting for a previous fiscal year, you may be required 
to record the correction as an adjustment to the data for the previous fiscal year, even though the action 
taken to correct the data occurs in the current year. This is because budgetary transactions must be booked 
against the fiscal year in which they were incurred so that they can be reconciled to the legal period of 
availability of the appropriations available at the time. Where necessary, Treasury will backdate the 
correction to the appropriate fiscal year, to prevent recording prior fiscal activity as current fiscal year 
activity. This is accomplished by filing a backdated Treasury document (Statement of Transactions, non-
expenditure transfer, or warrant), which shows both the date the correction is requested and a prior-year 
adjustment attribute to backdate the change to the correct period. If this also requires making a change to 
MAX data, then you are required to submit a request in the exercise (located at 
https://max.omb.gov/community/x/6YLrHQ) and identify the appropriate information such as an 
explanation of why the error happened, affected Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol, MAX A–11 edit 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 15 of Section 82 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

error, the amount of the adjustment in actual dollars, an action plan, and agency contact information. Refer 
to Appendix F for more details. 

Once you have submitted your request and your backdated document in the exercise, you may monitor the 
status of your request via the exercise. You should get PY-related matters like this taken care of as soon as 
the budget database opens so that you can concentrate on the BY column later. 

The following table summarizes the actions you need to take to process a backdated Treasury document: 

If an error is found… Then…

action impacts line X/P 4190 “Outlays (net)” or receipt data, 
and your request is approved, line X/P 4190 or the receipt 
data will be centrally changed. 
• 
If the action impacts any line X/P other than line P 4190, 
ensure that your accounting office revises the amount in 
GTAS. Refer to section 82.11. Your accounting office must

suppression requests on a case-by-case basis. 
Page 16 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

(d) Why do I need to revise GTAS if I do not agree with PY amounts imported from Treasury? 
Before the MAX A–11 agency lock-out, the GTAS database opens for revisions. You must revise the 
incorrect information in GTAS because the revised GTAS database is used as a basis for revised SF 133s, 
audited Statements of Budgetary Resources (if material), and central analysis. Information is copied from 
GTAS to MAX A–11 once per year before MAX A–11 opens to agency budget offices. However, 
information is never copied from MAX A–11 to GTAS. 

Revisions are intended to help you correct errors (not to give you extra time to verify your data) and should 
be used sparingly. The primary purpose of this revision period is to make GTAS consistent with the 
amounts in the prior-year column of the Budget. Consult with the financial statement auditors to determine 
whether your financial statements for the next reporting cycle should be restated or a footnote to the 
financial statements is required for the changes made in GTAS that result in differences between the 
Statement of Budgetary Resources and the Budget. For GTAS reporting periods, see 
http://www.fms.treas.gov/factsii/. 

(e) What actions do I need to take if I changed amounts imported from GTAS in MAX A–11 for the 
Budget but did not change them in the GTAS revision window? 
Before OMB will suppress any PY or CY GTAS-related edit error request, agencies must submit a 
suppression request to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kQJuFw and identify the appropriate information 
such as affected Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol, MAX A–11 edit error, the amount of the adjustment 
in actual dollars, an action plan, and agency contact information. 

If the changes do not affect ending balances (e.g., changes to discretionary versus mandatory coding), you 
do not need to make changes in GTAS in the next fiscal year GTAS reporting window. For example, if 
you changed an appropriation from mandatory to discretionary, this change does not impact the ending 
balances. Therefore, no change is required in GTAS after the revision window has closed. 

If the changes affect ending balances (e.g., changes to amounts of budget authority, new obligations and 
upward adjustments, gross outlays, beginning balances), you will need to make changes in GTAS in the 
next fiscal year GTAS reporting window. You should consult with the person who entered the data into 
GTAS. If you both agree that the amount should have been revised in GTAS, then the person who entered 
the information in GTAS should adjust the appropriate beginning balances (whether material or non-
material) in the next fiscal year GTAS reporting window. For example, if you increased the amount of new 
obligations (but not disbursed) by 100, then the ending unobligated balance would decrease by 100, and the 
obligated balance would increase by 100. Therefore, the beginning unobligated balance reported in the 
preceding fiscal year GTAS reporting window should be decreased by 100, and the beginning obligated 
balance reported in the preceding fiscal year GTAS reporting window should be increased by 100. 

Until changes are made in both GTAS and MAX A–11, there will be an ongoing difference in the balances 
reported in GTAS and the Budget. 

(f) How can I prepare? 
Actuals reported in the budget must be consistent with amounts reported to Treasury and must be based on 
actual accounting data. Review any differences from last year's actuals reported to Treasury at 
https://max.omb.gov/community/x/HAAQAw to prevent these differences from reoccurring. The website 
also includes reports that show FY 2019 quarterly GTAS submissions and how they would crosswalk into 
schedule P. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 17 of Section 82 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

Typically, one group within your agency (for example, the accounting office) reports amounts to Treasury 
(see section 130.2), while another group (for example, the budget office) prepares budget schedules. Before 
your accounting office submits its actuals to Treasury in GTAS (described below), you must ensure that 
the amounts are conceptually and numerically consistent with the amounts that you are going to report in 
MAX A–11. GTAS facilitates, and to a large extent eliminates the need for, this reconciliation. 

Consult with your accounting office for any differences that you are aware of and review your obligations 
and balances reported on your quarterly SF 133 throughout the year. Also, review any differences from 
last year at https://max.omb.gov/community/x/HAAQAw to prevent these differences from reoccurring. 

82.13 What amounts in schedule X need to tie to other schedules? 
The data you enter into schedule X needs to tie to data in other schedules. The following list is not 
exhaustive: 

(a) Other schedules in the same account 
All accounts, not including financing accounts 

• 
Schedule O (obligations): The total obligations you report in the Obligations by program activities 
section of schedule X must equal the total obligations you report in schedule O, the object 
classification schedule. In addition, the breakdown of direct vs. reimbursable obligations must be 
the same as in O, with a small rounding tolerance. 
• 
Schedule C (net BA and outlays): Net policy BA and outlays you report in schedule X must match, 
by subfunction, the net BA and outlays reported in schedule C, the character classification schedule. 
If you have only one BA line and one outlay line in schedule C, MAX will generate these amounts 
for you. 
• 
Schedule T (pre-transfer appropriations): The pre-transfer policy BA you report in schedule X as 
controlled by the appropriations committee must match the BA you report in schedule T, the 
schedule for the budget year appropriations request in thousands of dollars. 
Credit accounts only 

• 
Schedule U (obligations and outlays): In credit program accounts, the obligations you report on 
lines 0701–0709 in schedule X must tie to schedule U. In addition, the gross outlays you report in 
schedule U cannot exceed the gross outlays you report in schedule X on lines xxxx–61, xxxx–62, 
and xxxx–63. 
• 
Schedules G and H (obligations): In credit financing accounts, obligations you report on lines 0710– 
0744 in schedule X must tie to schedule G for direct loan financing accounts or schedule H for 
guaranteed loan financing accounts. 
• 
Schedule Y (net financing disbursements): In credit financing accounts, the net financing 
disbursements you report on line 4190 of schedule X must match the policy net financing 
disbursements you report in schedule Y. 
(b) Schedules in other accounts 
• 
Non-expenditure transfers: When you enter a line in schedule X for a non-expenditure transfer to 
or from another account, you must enter the primary Treasury account code associated with that 
Page 18 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

account. The amounts you enter for your account must match the amounts entered in the other 
account for PY through BY. 

• 
Credit accounts: Transactions between program accounts, financing accounts, and receipt accounts 
for the same program must match. For example, if the program account reports negative subsidies 
in schedule U on lines x341–99, the same amount must be reported in the associated financing 
accounts on line 0740 in schedule X and in the associated negative subsidy receipt account. 
• 
Interfund account: For general fund accounts that make payments to trust fund accounts, the 
amounts paid by the general fund account must match the amounts received by the trust fund 
account. 
82.14 How do I present transfers of resources? 
Transfers between agencies resulting from Presidential reorganization plans or enacted reorganization 
legislation may involve unique problems. Agency staff must consult with OMB representatives in each 
instance. When the gaining agency assumes all of the activities previously financed under a single account 
in another agency, as a general rule, the losing agency should omit budget schedules and appropriation 
language for the affected account and the gaining agency should show the transferred activities and 
appropriation language with its schedules. Use footnotes to identify the amounts involved. (See section 

82.13 for an example of how the footnote should be worded and section 95 for guidance on submitting the 
footnotes for printing.) 
82.15 How do I present transfers in the estimates? 
When a transfer in the estimates (see section 20.4(k)) for the budget year results in a significant increase to 
or decrease from the amount of budget authority for the past or current year, include footnotes explaining 
the transfer after the program and financing schedule. (See section 95 for guidance on submitting the 
footnotes for printing.) 

For the account assuming the responsibility, use the following footnote: 

Note—Includes $_million in budget authority in BY for activities previously financed from: 

PY CY 
[List the full title of each losing account, including agency and bureau, and the budget authority amount 
applicable to each. Where it is appropriate to show the amount on some other basis, such as obligations, 
you may modify the footnote accordingly.] 

If the entire BY estimate is for the transferred activity, the footnote may be worded, "BY estimate is for 
activities previously financed from [List agency, bureau, and account title]." 

For the account losing the activity, use the following footnote: 

Note—Excludes $_million in budget authority in BY for activities transferred to: 

[List the title of each gaining account, including agency and bureau, and the budget authority amount 
applicable to each. Where it is more appropriate to show the amount on some other basis, such as 
obligations, modify the footnote accordingly.] 

Comparable amounts for PY ($_million) and CY ($_million) are included above. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 19 of Section 82 


SECTION 82—COMBINED SCHEDULE X 

You only need to provide a transfer in the estimates footnote in the year the transfer proposal is made. If 
you use more than one footnote, include them under a centered heading, "NOTES." Modify the wording 
of footnotes as necessary to explain current year transfers. 

At the discretion of OMB, transfers in the estimates may be shown on a three-year comparable basis. If 
they are, the footnotes should be modified accordingly. 

82.16 How do I present merged accounts? 
Where two or more appropriations have been or are proposed to be replaced by a single appropriation (see 
section 79.4(i)), submit a single set of schedules for the new appropriation. 

When you merge accounts, you may find it helpful to append a distribution of budget authority and outlays 
by account to the bottom of the program and financing schedule. For accounts where you have created a 
distribution table, list each merged budget account by name and provide data for PY through BY. 

82.17 How should I treat allocation accounts? 
Combine schedule P information for allocation accounts with the parent account without separate 
identification (see section 20.4(l)). 

82.18 What should I know about the individual lines in schedule X? 
Use the entries in the following tables to prepare the individual lines in schedule X. MAX will 
automatically generate the line entries indicated in bold face. 

OBLIGATIONS BY PROGRAM ACTIVITY 

This section only includes obligations by program activity in unexpired Treasury Appropriation Fund 
Symbols. 

Entry MAX Details 
All accounts: 
0xxx The first digit will always be zero (0). 
Non-credit programs: The line codes are unique to each account and have no relationship to information 
shown in other schedules. 

Direct programs 
(0001–0799): 

0Xxx 
0xXX 

For the second digit, use the values 0 through 7 to identify the activity or subactivity 
group. 

For the third and fourth digits, use the values 01 through 89 to identify activity or 
subactivity detail items. Any number sequence in this range is valid. 

For subtotals, use the values 91 through 98 as follows: 

• 
Xx91—Subtotal for a single group of detail lines (e.g., 0001–0089) 
•

which the offsetting collections are outlayed and spending 
authority from offsetting collections from non-Federal 
sources should be classified based on whether the

Schedule X is where users enter all budgetary resource and outlay data; MAX will then 
automatically populate lines in schedules P, A, and S. Schedule X looks identical to schedule P 
until the "Budget Authority" line. This exhibit illustrates how to insert data and new lines, unique 
features of schedule X, and where data entered in schedule X crosswalks to schedules A and S. See 
sections 80–82 for an overview and detailed line descriptions for schedules S, A, and P respectively.

Youcan enter multiple outlay rates for an account and show different programs on separate BAlines even if the rates are the 
same. To do this, use multiple 
line sequence numbers (01, 02, 03, etc.). MAXwill generate separateoutlay data that corresponds 
to each BAline. In schedule X, MAXdisplays BAand correspondingoutlays together. The examplesbelow show how to enter 
two different

Summary of Changes 

Clarifies the classification of interest paid to vendors for late payment (section 83.6) 

83.1 What are object classes? 
Object classes are categories in a classification system that presents obligations by the items or services 
purchased by the Federal Government. These are the major object classes: 

• 
10 Personnel compensation and benefits 
• 
20 Contractual services and supplies 
• 
30 Acquisition of assets 
• 
40 Grants and fixed charges 
• 
90 Other 
We divide these major classes into smaller classes and present them in the Budget Appendix in object class 
schedules. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 83 


SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

The object classes present obligations according to their initial purpose, not the end product or service. For 
example, if you pay a Federal employee who constructs a building, classify the obligations for the 
employee's wages under Personnel compensation and benefits, rather than Acquisition of assets. If you 
purchase a building, classify the contractual obligations under Acquisition of assets. 

You record obligations when the Federal Government places an order for an item or a service, awards a 
contract, receives a service, or enters into similar transactions that will require payments in the same or a 
future period (see section 20.5). You also record obligations when you make an expenditure transfer 
between Federal Government accounts (see section 20.4(j)). 

83.2 Why must I report object class information? 
You must report object class information because the law (31 U.S.C. 1104(b)) requires the President's 
Budget to present obligations by object class for each account. 

83.3 How do object classes compare to functional and character classes and program activity? 
The following table shows how the object classification system differs from the other classification systems 
used in the President's Budget. 

Classification System What is classified? What does it tell me? 
Object class Obligations Goods or services or items purchased, for example, 
supplies, rent, or equipment 
Program activity 
(see section 82.5) 
Obligations Activity, project, or other programmatic distinction 
Functional class 
(see section 79.3(d)) 
Budget authority, outlays, 
and offsetting receipts 
Major purpose served, for example, national defense, 
health, income security 
Character class 
(see section 84.4) 
Budget authority, outlays, 
and offsetting receipts 
Whether the amount pays for an investment or 
noninvestment and whether the amount is a grant to a 
State and local government or a direct Federal program; 
If investment, then, what type: physical asset, conduct 
of R&D, or conduct of education and training 

83.4 How does the object class schedule relate to the program and financing schedule? 
You report object class information whenever you report obligations on a program and financing (P&F) 
schedule (except you do not report object class information for credit financing accounts). This means you 
report obligations by object class separately for the regular budget requests, supplemental budget requests, 
rescission proposals, and legislative proposals. 

In addition, object class schedules separately identify the following types of obligations: 

• 
Direct and reimbursable obligations (see section 83.5). 
• 
Obligations between agencies (see section 83.14). 
83.5 How can I determine whether an obligation should be classified as direct or reimbursable?

SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

In general, reimbursable obligations are those financed by offsetting collections (see section 20.7(d)) 
received in return for goods and services provided, while all other obligations are direct. However, there 
are exceptions. Classify obligations as "direct" or "reimbursable" in accordance with the following criteria:

The amounts you classify as reimbursable obligations in both MAX schedule O and MAX schedule P for 
a budget account should be identical with the following exceptions: 

• 
Line 9995, Adjustment for rounding, in MAX schedule O may contain a mixture of direct and 
reimbursable obligations. These amounts are not material because they are normally $4 million or 
less; 
• 
Credit financing accounts do not have any MAX schedule O 
MAX Schedule O. Use the 4–digit object class line numbers in exhibit 83A when you enter obligations by 
object class in MAX schedule O. Be sure to use the correct prefix to distinguish reimbursable from direct 
obligations. 

MAX Schedule P. Use the 4–digit program activity codes described in section 82.5 when you report 
obligations. For reimbursable obligations, use 08xx. 

83.6 What object class codes and definitions should I use? 
Major object classes are divided into smaller classes. The following table provides the codes, standard 
titles, and definitions used to identify detailed object class data. Exhibit 83A summarizes the codes and 
standard titles used in MAX schedule O. 

Entry Description 

10 PERSONNEL This major object class consists of object classes 11, 12, and 13. 

COMPENSATION AND 
BENEFITS 

11 Personnel compensation Compensation directly related to duties performed for the Government by 
Federal civilian employees, military personnel, and non-Federal personnel. 
Object class 11 covers object classes 11.1 through 11.8. 

11.1 Full-time permanent For full-time civilian employees with permanent appointments. 
Full-time permanent employees are those who are full-time civilian 
employees with permanent appointments as defined by the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM). The nature of the employee's appointment 
is controlling, not the nature of the position. For this object class, include 
full-time permanent employees in the: 

• 
Competitive Service with career and career-conditional 
appointments. 
• 
Excepted Service whose appointments carry no restriction or 
condition. Include those serving trial periods or whose tenure is 
equivalent to career-conditional tenure in the Competitive Service. 
Exclude those serving on indefinite appointments and appointments 
limited to a specific time.

SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

Entry Description 

11.3 Other than full-time 
permanent 
• 
Senior Executive Service (SES) with career appointments as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(4) and non-career appointments as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(7). 
Refer to your agency's human resources office for assistance on the types of 
appointments for staff in your agency. 
Include: 

• 
Regular salaries and wages paid to the employees (some of which 
may be withheld from the employee's check to pay taxes, to pay a 
bill in a credit union, or to pay the employee's share of life and 
health insurance). 
• 
Other payments that become part of their basic pay (for example, 
geographic differentials, and critical position pay). 
• 
Regular salaries and wages paid while the employees are on paid 
leave, such as annual, sick, or compensatory leave. 
• 
Lump sum payments for annual leave upon separation (also known 
as terminal leave payments). 
Exclude: 

• 
Compensation above the basic rate, for example, overtime or other 
premium pay, which will be classified in object class 11.5, Other 
personnel compensation. 
• 
Full-time temporary employees who are full-time civilian 
employees with temporary appointments as defined by OPM who 
will be classified in object class 11.3, Other than full-time 
permanent. 
Regular salaries and wages paid to civilian employees for part-time, 
temporary, or intermittent employment (see note below). 
Include: 

• 
Part-time permanent employees, that is, employees with 
appointments that require work on a prearranged schedule of fewer 
hours or days of work than prescribed for full-time employees in 
the same group or class. 
• 
Temporary employees, that is, employees with appointments for a 
limited period of time that is generally less than a year. For 
example: 
(a) full-time temporary employees, 
(b)seasonal employees without permanent appointments, 
(c) employees with term appointments, and 
(d)employees with indefinite appointments. 
• 
Personnel appointments and advisory committees. 
• 
Intermittent employees, that is, employees with appointments that 
require work on an irregular or occasional basis and who are paid 
only for the time actually employed or services actually rendered. 
Note: For personal services contracts with individuals, who are 
classified by OPM as Federal employees, classify the basic pay in 
this object class and classify compensation above the basic pay in 
object class 11.5, Other personnel compensation. On the other 
hand, classify the payments to a contractor principally for the 
personal services of a group of the contractor's employees 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 5 of Section 83 


SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

Entry Description 

11.5 Other personnel 
compensation 
according to the type of contract involved (for example, classify 

personal services contracts for operation and maintenance of 

facilities under object class 25.4). 

Compensation above the basic rates paid directly to civilian employees. 
Include: 

• 
Overtime, which is pay for services in excess of the established 
work period as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5542, standby duty and 
administratively uncontrollable overtime as defined in 5 U.S.C. 
5545, and unscheduled availability duty hours for criminal 
investigations as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5545(a). 
• 
Holiday pay as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5546(b). 
• 
Night work differential, which is pay above the basic rate for 
regularly scheduled night work. 
• 
Post differentials, which are authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5925 above 
the basic rate for service at hardship posts abroad that are based 
upon conditions of environment substantially different from those 
in the continental United States and warrant additional pay as a 
recruitment and retention incentive. 
• 
Hazardous duty pay, which is pay above the basic rate because of 
assignments involving performance of duties that subject the 
employee to hazards or physical hardships. 
Note: Post differentials and hazardous duty pay result from the job or 
services performed. For example, a job performed at a hardship post 
abroad or under hazardous duty is different from what might appear to be 
the same job performed elsewhere and under non-hazardous conditions. 
Hence, both are classified with other pay in object class 11 and not as 
benefits in object class 12. By contrast, compensation in the form of cost 
of living allowances are classified as benefits in object class 12 because 
they do not result from the job or services performed. The cost for a job in 
one locale is different from the same job in another locale simply because 
the cost of living is higher in one locale. 

• 
Supervisory differential, which is pay above the basic rate to adjust 
the compensation of a supervisor to a level greater than the highest 
paid subordinate. The differential applies to a General Schedule 
employee who supervises one or more employees not covered by 
the General Schedule. 

• 
Cash incentive awards, which are payments for cash awards that do 
not become part of the Federal civilian employee's basic rate of 
pay, such as those authorized under 5 U.S.C. 4503, 4504, 4505(a), 
4507, and 5384. 
• 
Other payments above basic rates, which are payments for other 
premium pay, such as stand-by pay and premium pay in lieu of 
overtime and special pay that is paid periodically during the year in 
the same manner and at the same time as regular salaries and wages 
are paid. 
Exclude other payments which are classified in object class 12.1, 
Civilian personnel benefits.

Include: 

• 
Reimbursable details, that is, payments to other accounts for

reimbursable detail (both compensation and personnel benefits). 
• 
Reemployed annuitants, that is, payments by an agency employing 
an annuitant to reimburse the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund for the annuity paid to that employee under 5 
U.S.C. 8339 through 8344. 
• 
Non-Federal civilians, such as witnesses; casual workers, patient 
and inmate help, and allowances for trainees and volunteers. 
• 
Salary equalization (authorized under 5 U.S.C. 3372 and 3584) to 
individuals on leave of absence while employed by international 
organizations or State and local governments, when the

• 
Staff of former Presidents paid by the General Services 
Administration (GSA) under 3 U.S.C. 102(b). 
• 
Payments from the Working Capital Fund to the military personnel 
accounts to reimburse for work done by military personnel for the 
Working Capital Fund. 
• 
Payments to a person who tells someone in authority about alleged 
dishonest or illegal activities occurring in a Government 
agency. Often referred to as a "whistleblower."

should be classified under the object class of the acquisition for 
which the payment was late. 

Payments of amounts collected by the Government in a previous fiscal 
year. 
Include: 

• 
Payments to correct errors in computations, erroneous billing, and 
other factors (see section 20.10). 
• 
Payments to former employees or their beneficiaries for employee 
contributions to retirement and disability funds (e.g., payments 
made when employees die before retirement or before their 
annuities equal the amount withheld). 
• 
Payments to return cash advances or other offsetting collections or 
special or trust fund receipts received in a prior fiscal year (see 
section 20.10). 
Note: In the account receiving the refund, previously recorded obligations 
will be reduced in the appropriate object class(es) by the amount of the 
refund, if the refund is received in the same year as the obligations are 
reported (see section 20.10). 

90 OTHER This major object class covers object classes 91.0 through 99.5. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 21 of Section 83 


SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

Entry Description 

91.0 Unvouchered Charges that may be incurred lawfully for confidential purposes and are not 
subject to detailed vouchering or reporting. 
92.0 Undistributed Charges that cannot be distributed to the object classes listed above. 
Use this object class only with the prior approval of OMB. 
94.0 Financial transfers This object class is used for obligations that represent financial 
interchanges between Federal government accounts that are not in 
exchange for goods and services, e.g., an expenditure transfer that shifts 
budgetary resources between Federal funds and trust funds regardless of the 
purpose. 
99.0 Subtotal, obligations This entry is automatically generated by MAX: 
• 
For direct obligations, the subtotal stub entry should appear when 
more than one object class category is reported in a single account. 
For reimbursable obligations, the subtotal stub entry, 
"Reimbursable obligations,'' should appear, even if all reimbursable 
obligations are classified in a single object class category. 
99.5 Adjustment for rounding Use this object class adjustment line when the sum of the object class detail 
lines differ from total obligations due to rounding the detail amounts to the 
million. Amounts can be negative. 
There will be only one adjustment line per object class schedule. It will: 

• 
Follow the last subtotal (object class 99.0) for the schedule. 
• 
Be coded 9995 in MAX. 
Do not report amounts of more than +/-$4 million in this object class, 
unless approved by OMB. 

99.9 Total new obligations, 
unexpired accounts 
83.7 What object classes do I associate with civilian and military pay and benefits in the baseline? 
Civilian pay and benefits means the budgetary resources used to fund civilian compensation and benefits 
consistent with object classes 11.1 through 11.5 and 12.1. 

Military pay and benefits means the budgetary resources used to fund military personnel compensation and 
benefits consistent with object classes 11.6, 11.7 and 12.2. 

83.8 How do I classify relocation expenses related to a permanent change of station (PCS)? 
When an employee accepts a Federal position at a different location, such as at a different State, this is 
called a permanent change of station. An agency, at its discretion, may reimburse the employee for a variety 
of expenses related to the relocation. Follow the instructions in the table to classify these expenses among 
the object classes. 

If the obligations are for ... Then classify in object class ... 

Transportation, per diem while in travel status, or 21.0 Travel and transportation of persons 
reimbursement of actual travel expenses for the 
employee or the employee's immediate family

such as: 

• 
Allowances for expenses incurred in connection 
with a sale of a residence or settlement of an 
unexpired lease. 
• 
Subsistence when occupying temporary quarters 
(in contrast to per diem while in travel status, 
above).

taxes incurred by transferred employees for 
moving or storage expenses under 5 U.S.C. 
5724(b). 
• 
Contractual charges for relocation services under 
5 U.S.C. 5724(c). 

• 
Miscellaneous moving expenses under 5 U.S.C. 
5724(a). 
All other relocation expenses for military personnel 12.2 Military personnel benefits 

83.9 How do I classify purchases related to information technology (IT)? 
The general rule on how to classify IT obligations among the various object classes is to focus on the nature 
of the services, articles or other items for which obligations are first incurred. The following table shows 
the application of this rule. 

If the obligations are for ... Then classify in object class ... 
IT services or the rental of IT equipment 23.3 Communications, utilities, and miscellaneous 
charges

• 
Management and professional support 25.1 Advisory and assistance services 
services. 
• 
Studies, analyses, and evaluations. 
• 
Engineering and technical services. 
83.10 How do I classify obligations for education and training? 
The general rule on how to classify education and training obligations among the various object classes is 
to focus on the nature of the services, articles or other items for which obligations are first incurred. The 
following table shows the application of this rule. 

If the obligations are for ... Then classify in object class ... 

Payments of tuition to universities or colleges leading 25.2 Other services from non-Federal sources 
to a degree, or for attendance at conferences 

All other payments to a private sector company for 25.1 Advisory and assistance services 
training courses 

Payments to other Federal government agencies for 25.1 Advisory and assistance services 
training courses 

Cash allowances for the education of dependents that 12.1 Civilian personnel benefits 
are provided as recruitment and retention incentives for 
civilian employees 

Payment to the loan holder (e.g., the bank) to repay an 12.1 Civilian personnel benefits 
employee's student loan as a recruitment incentive 

Cash allowances for the education of dependents that 12.2 Military personnel benefits 
are provided as recruitment and retention incentives for 
military personnel 

83.11 How do I classify obligations for real property (space, land, and structures)? 
Classify obligations for the purchase, including lease purchase, or improvement (that is, alteration or 
modification) of real property in object class 32, Land and structures. 

Classify the rental or lease of real property, as follows: 

If the obligation are for ... 
Payment to another Federal 
government account 
And if ... 
The other account is GSA's Federal 
Buildings Fund* 
Then classify in object class ... 
23.1 Rental payments to GSA 
Page 24 of Section 83 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

If the obligation are for ... And if ... Then classify in object class ... 
Payment to another Federal 
government account 
The other account is NOT GSA's 
Federal Buildings Fund 
Purchases of goods and 
services from Government 
accounts 
Note: The paying account must use 
this object class code but may 
change the title to "Rental 
payments to GSA." 
Payment to the private sector 23.2 Rental payments to others 

* Classify amounts for the standard services, such as cleaning and security, covered by the basic rental charge 
assessed by GSA in object class 23.1, Rental payments to GSA. However, if the payment is for rent "related" services 
provided by GSA in addition to services provided under rental payments, for example, extra protection or extra 
cleaning, report the amounts under object class 25.3, Other goods and services from Federal sources. 
GSA operating delegations. When GSA delegates the operation of a facility back to an agency ("operating 
delegations"), the agency is in charge of operating the facility. 
GSA bills for basic rental charges differ depending on whether the building is owned or leased by GSA. 

For GSA-leased buildings, the GSA bills the total (gross) amount of the basic rental charge which includes 
a charge for operating the building. In these cases, the following transactions occur: 

• 
GSA bills the agency for the gross amount of the basic rental charge. 
• 
Agency records obligations in object class 23.1, Rental payments to GSA, and pays GSA's Federal 
Buildings Fund the gross amount. 
• 
GSA rebates the amount for operating the facility back to the agency. 
• 
Agency records the amount rebated as offsetting collections. 
• 
If the agency, in turn, contracts with the private sector to clean the facilities, the obligations are 
classified in object class 25.4, Operation and maintenance of facilities. 
• 
If the agency, in turn, contracts with another agency (for example, to guard the building), the 
obligations are classified in object class 25.3, Other goods and services from Federal sources. 
The above treatment will continue for rental of GSA-leased buildings. 

83.12 How do I classify obligations for Federal civilian retirement under the Civil Service 
Retirement System (CSRS)? 
Use the following: 

If the obligations are for ... Then classify in object class ... 
The accrual for the future retirement cost of current 
civilian personnel covered by CSRS that is charged to the 
accounts that pay direct compensation to those personnel. 
Note: The corresponding receipts credited to the civil 
service retirement and disability trust fund are treated as 
12.1 Civilian personnel benefits 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 25 of Section 83 


SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

If the obligations are for ... Then classify in object class ... 

undistributed offsetting receipts (Employer share, 
employee retirement on the inter fund transaction line). 

The Government's share of retirement costs that amortize 
increases in the static unfunded liability created since 
October 20, 1969 by any statute which authorizes new or 
liberalized benefits, an extension of retirement coverage, 
or pay increases 

Note: This applies to OPM's "Payment to the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund" account only. 

12.1 Civilian personnel benefits

SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

83.13 How do I classify obligations for military retirement? 
Since 1985, when the financing of military retirement changed to an accrual basis, the payments should be 
classified as follows: 

If the obligations are ... Then classify in object class ... 
The accrual for the future retirement cost of current 
military personnel that is charged to the accounts that 
pay direct compensation to those personnel 
12.2 Military personnel benefits 
Note: The corresponding receipts credited to the 
military retirement trust fund are treated as 
undistributed offsetting receipts (Employer share, 
employee retirement on the inter fund transaction line). 
From general revenues to the military retirement fund 
to finance retirement costs for service prior to 1985 
13.0 Benefits for former personnel 
Note: This applies to the "Payment to Military 
Retirement Fund" account only. 
Made to military retirees 
Note: This applies only to the "Military Retirement

42.0 Insurance, claims, and indemnities 

See also section 83.16 for the classification of Tricare benefits earned by all uniformed service members. 

83.14 How do I classify intragovernmental transactions? 
For payments between two Federal Government accounts for: 

• 
Relocation expenses, see section 83.8; 
• 
Information technology, see section 83.9; 
• 
Education and training, see section 83.10; 
• 
Real property, see section 83.11; 
• 
Federal civilian retirement under CSRS, see section 83.12; and 
• 
Military retirement, see section 83.13. 
For other payments between two Federal Government accounts, classify the obligations as follows: 

If the obligations are ... Then classify in object class ... 
Transfers by the paying account to reimburse 
the receiving account for an asset or a service 
with a specific object class 
The paying account should classify the direct obligations in 
the object class that best describes the purchase, such as: 
21.0 Travel and transportation of persons 
22.0 Transportation of things 
23.1 Rental payments to GSA 
23.2 Rental payments to others 
23.3 Communications, utilities, and miscellaneous charges

applies. 

Transfers that merely moves resources between 
Federal government accounts (e.g., expenditure 
transfers between a trust fund and Federal fund 
accounts). Normally these transfers result 
from appropriations action or general transfer 
authority where the obligations are simply 
accounting transfers. 

94.0 Financial transfers 
Note: The paying account should report direct obligations in 
object class 94.0 and the receiving account should distribute 
the obligations as direct obligations in the appropriate object 
classes. 

83.15 How do I classify obligations under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA)? 
Under the IPA, a Federal employee, with his or her consent, may be assigned temporarily to a non-Federal 
organization. 

• 
Detailed Federal employees. A detailed Federal employee continues to receive pay, allowances, 
and benefits from the Federal agency. In some cases, these costs are reimbursed by the non-Federal 
organization. 
• 
Federal employees on leave without pay (LWOP). A Federal employee on LWOP is paid by the 
non-Federal organization to which he or she is assigned. The salary paid by the non-Federal 
organization may be more or less than the employee's current Federal salary. If the rate of pay of 
the non-Federal organization is less, then the Federal agency may pay a supplemental salary to the 
employee. 
Also under the IPA, an employee of a non-Federal organization may be assigned temporarily to a Federal 
agency either (1) with a temporary Federal appointment or (2) on detail. 

• 
Non-Federal employees with temporary Federal appointments. A non-Federal employee with a 
temporary Federal appointment is paid by the Federal agency to which he or she is assigned. 
However, he or she is eligible to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program only if 
the Federal appointment results in the loss of coverage under the non-Federal health benefits system. 
He or she is not covered by any retirement system for Federal employees or by the Federal 
Employees Group Life Insurance Program. 
Page 28 of Section 83 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

• 
Non-Federal employees detailed to a Federal Position. A non-Federal employee who is detailed to 
a Federal agency continues to receive pay, allowances, and benefits from the non-Federal 
organization to which he or she is employed. In some cases these costs may be reimbursed by the 
Federal agency. In addition, if the non-Federal salary of the employee on detail is less than the 
minimum rate of pay for the Federal position, the Federal agency may supplement the salary to 
make up the difference. 
Cost-sharing arrangements for IPA assignments are negotiated between the participating organizations. The 
Federal agency may agree to pay all, some, or none of the costs associated with an assignment. These 
include basic pay, supplemental pay, fringe benefits, and travel and relocation expenses. 

Because of these cost-sharing arrangements you should use the following table to classify these obligations. 

If the obligations are ... And if the employees is ... Then classify in object class ... 

Regular salaries and wages Federal full-time and on detail to a 11.1 Full-time permanent 
non-Federal organization 
Federal but not full-time and on 11.3 Other than full-time 
detail to a non-Federal organization permanent 
Non-Federal with a temporary 
Federal appointment.

award to a non-Federal employee 
who is detailed to a Federal 
position.)

Travel or relocation expenses See sections 83.5 and 83.9 
Other expenses See section 83.5 

83.16 How do I classify obligations for Tricare benefits for uniformed service members? 
Tricare is a regionally administered program which provides healthcare for uniform service members, 
retirees, survivors, and their families. This program combines healthcare resources of the Air Force, Army, 
and Navy while enhancing them with a variety of civilian healthcare professionals. 

The National Defense Authorization Act replaces annual appropriations to the military personnel accounts 
of the Department of Defense (DoD) with permanent, indefinite appropriations from the General Fund of 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 29 of Section 83 


SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

the Treasury. The Tricare accrual payments are made at the beginning of each year, instead of at the end 
of each month, and will be based on planned troop levels within the enacted DoD budget, instead of on the 
actual number of military personnel at the end of each month. The funding is shown in separate accounts 
for the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Army reserve, the Navy reserve, the Marine 
Corps reserve, the Air Force reserve, the Army National Guard and the Air Force National Guard. These 
accounts will, in turn, pay the accruals to the DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. 

Tricare benefits are earned by all current uniformed service members not just those in the DoD. This means 
that accounts for the Commissioned Corps in the Public Health Service in the Department of Health and 
Human Services, the United States Coast Guard in the Department of Homeland Security, and the 
Commissioned Corps in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Department of 
Commerce will also pay the accruals to the DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. 

In turn, the DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund pays the health benefits for retired members 
of the uniformed service. 

If the obligations are ... Then classify in object class ... 
The employing agency contributions by the 
Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of 
Health and Human Services, the Department of 
Homeland Security, and the Department of Commerce 
to the special DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health 
Care Fund to pay for future benefits earned by current 
uniformed service members. 
Note: The corresponding receipts deposited in the 
special fund receipt account are permanently 
appropriated to the DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree 
Health Care Fund expenditure account. 
12.2 Military personnel benefits 
The annual payment from the general treasury to 
finance the accrued unfunded liability of retired 
uniformed servicemembers. This is paid to the DoD 
Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. 
13.0 Benefits for former personnel 
Note: This applies to the "Payment to the DoD 
Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund.' 
Direct payments for uniformed service retirees. 
Note: This applies to the "DoD Medicare-Eligible 
Retiree Health Care Fund" account only.” 
42.0 Insurance, claims, and indemnities 

83.17 How is object class information presented in MAX schedule O and the Appendix? 
You must first enter all object class information in MAX schedule O in order to populate the Appendix with 
object class data. The Appendix presents object class information in tables called object class schedules, 
which display the object class codes, the object class titles, and the amounts of obligations in the past, 
current, and budget year. 

MAX Schedule O. Object class data are displayed in MAX on the basis of a 4–digit line number followed 
by a 2-digit line serial number. The 4-digit line number is made up of a prefix and a 3-digit object class 
code. The prefix for direct obligations is 1xxx and for reimbursable obligations is 2xxx. See exhibit 83A 
for a list of the 3-digit object class codes. 

Page 30 of Section 83 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 83—OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (MAX SCHEDULE O) 

Note: The 3-digit object class code in MAX schedule O is the same 3-digit object class code in the Appendix, 
except that in the Appendix there is a decimal before the last digit. See section 83.7 for the definitions of 
the object classes. 

Appendix schedules. The object class schedules in the Appendix present the 3-digit object class codes and 
the object class titles. 

Normally, the Appendix will include a separate object class schedule for each P&F schedule that reports 
obligations (see exhibits 83B). However, when all obligations in a P&F schedule are classified in a single 
object class, there will be no object class schedule in the Appendix. Instead, the code for the appropriate 
object class will be identified in the P&F schedule in parentheses at the end of the line for total new 
obligations, unexpired accounts. For example, if all obligations in a P&F are for grants, then "(object class 
41.0)" will be at the end of the stub entry on line 10.00 of the P&F. Although there will be no object class 
schedule printed in the Appendix, you must enter the data in MAX schedule O. 

Normally, the Appendix includes only one object class line for each object class code and uses the standard 
titles listed in section 83.7. The default 2-digit line serial number is 01. However, you may insert additional 
object class lines in MAX and edit the standard titles. For example, to present employee travel separately 
from grantee travel in object class 21.0, Travel and transportation of persons, you may insert another line 
in MAX schedule O, edit the standard titles, and distribute the obligations between the two lines. 

Allocations between agencies. In some cases, funds appropriated to the President or to an agency are 
allocated to one or more agencies that help to carry out the program. Obligations incurred under such 
allocations are included in the data for the account to which the appropriation was made in the allocating 
agency, that is, the parent account. The parent account must enter the data in MAX schedule O. The parent 
account may use additional object class lines (as described above) to separately present the parent and 
allocation account activity. 

83.18 When I report data in MAX schedule O will it generate subtotals or totals? 
Yes. MAX will generate subtotals for different types of obligations from the amounts that you entered, as 
follows: 

• 
For reimbursable obligations (lines 2xxx), MAX will automatically generate a subtotal line 2990 
when you enter at least one amount on lines 2xxx. 
• 
For direct obligations (lines 1xxx), MAX will automatically generate a subtotal line 1990 when you 
enter more than one amount on lines 1xxx 
MAX will generate "Total new obligations, unexpired accounts" on line 9999, when you enter more than 
one amount above this line.

Summary of Changes 

Provides new guidance on reporting character classification in trust funds (section 84.3). 

Provides new guidance on reporting historical character classification data when a correction is made 
(section 84.3). 

84.1 What is the purpose of the character classification system? 
Character classification is used to distinguish between funding for investment and non-investment activities 
in the Budget and also to distinguish funding for grants-in-aid from funding for direct Federal programs. 
Character classification is used to capture gross spending on these activities even when they are financed 
by offsetting collections within an account. Character classification is recorded in Schedule C of MAX A11 
Data Entry (MAX). See exhibit 84 for a summary of character classification line numbers in Schedule 
C and see section 79 for more information about MAX generally. The data entered in Schedule C are used 
in the production of tables for the Historical Tables volume of the budget as well as special analysis in the 
budget. 

84.2 What are the different character classifications and how are they used? 
Investment activities in Schedule C are coded as Construction and rehabilitation (lines 1311-1314); Major 
equipment (lines 1321-1324); Commodity inventories (line 1330); Purchases and sales of land and 
structures for Federal use (line 1340); Other physical assets (lines 1351-1352); Conduct of research and 
development (lines 1411-1432); and Conduct of education and training (lines 1511-1512). 

Non-investment activities are coded as Grants, other than shared revenues (line 2001); Grants, shared 
revenues (line 2003); and Direct Federal programs (line 2004). 

In every classification series, grants are coded on odd numbered lines while direct Federal programs are 
coded on even numbered lines. See section 84.4 for detailed descriptions of all of the line numbers that 
you must use to report character classification. 

(a) Federal Investment (character class codes 1xxx) 
Federal investment is spending for programs and activities that will yield benefits largely in the future. 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 1 of Section 84 


SECTION 84—CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) 

(b) Physical Assets (character class codes 13xx) 
Physical assets are land, structures, equipment, and intellectual property (e.g., software or applications) that 
have an estimated useful life of two years or more; or commodity inventories. This character class code is 
used to enter amounts for the purchase, construction, manufacture, rehabilitation, or major improvement of 
physical assets regardless of whether the assets are owned or operated by the Federal Government, States, 
municipalities, or private individuals. The cost of the asset includes both its purchase price and all other 
costs incurred to bring it to a form and location for its intended use. Within this character class code, 
agencies are also required to identify spending for research and development (R&D) facilities and major 
equipment. 

For reporting Construction and Rehabilitation, R&D facilities (lines 1311 and 1312), include the following: 

• 
Construction of facilities that are necessary for the execution of an R&D program. This may include 
land, major fixed equipment, and supporting infrastructure such as a sewer line, or housing at a 
remote location. Many laboratory buildings will include a mixture of R&D facilities and office 
space. The fraction of the building directly related to the conduct of R&D may be calculated as a 
percentage of the building's total square footage. 
Exclude: 

• 
Construction of other facilities, such as office space (which should be reported in the other 
construction and rehabilitation category on line 1313 or 1314). 
• 
Major movable R&D equipment. 
For reporting Major Equipment, R&D equipment (lines 1321 and 1322), include the following: 

• 
Acquisition, design, or production of major movable equipment, such as mass spectrometers, 
research vessels, DNA sequencers, and other movable major instruments for use in R&D activities. 
• 
Programs of $1 million or more that are devoted to the purchase or construction of R&D major 
equipment (see section 84.3(a)). 
Exclude: 

• 
Minor equipment purchases, such as personal computers, standard microscopes, and simple 
spectrometers. 
For reporting Other Major Equipment (non-R&D, lines 1323 and 1324), include the following: 

• 
Acquisition, design, integration, recapitalization, improvement or production of major movable 
equipment, not used for R&D activities. 
• 
User demonstrations where the cost and benefits of a system are being validated for a specific use 
case. 
• 
Pre-production development, which is defined as non-experimental work on a product or system 
before it goes into full production. 
For reporting Other Physical Assets (lines 1351 and 1352), include the following: 

• 
Amounts for all physical assets not captured under another category, such as conservation, 
reforestation, and range improvements; grants to State or local governments for the purchase of 
land or structures; and amounts for certain privately held assets, including improvements to private 
farms, land, and sales of such land and structures. 
Page 2 of Section 84 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 84—CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) 

• 
Offsetting receipts collected from the sale of physical assets not used by the Federal Government. 
Exclude: 

• 
The operation and maintenance of land and structures. 
(c) Conduct of Research and Development (character class codes 14xx) 
Research and experimental development activities are defined as creative and systematic work undertaken 
in order to increase the stock of knowledge—including knowledge of people, culture, and society—and to 
devise new applications using available knowledge. 

For reporting R&D activities, include the following: 

• 
Administrative expenses for R&D, such as the operating costs of research facilities and equipment 
and other overhead costs. 
Exclude: 

• 
Investments in physical assets such as major equipment and facilities that support R&D programs. 
These investments should generally be reported under physical assets (13xx), discussed above. 
• 
Routine product testing, quality control, collection of general-purpose statistics, routine 
monitoring, and evaluation of an operational program (when that program is not R&D). Spending 
of this type should generally be reported as non-investment activities (2xxx). 
• 
Training of scientific and technical personnel should be reported as conduct of education and 
training (15xx). However, if an activity includes a mixture of R&D objectives as well as the 
education of graduate students, agencies should report under the lowest relevant line number in the 
14xx series (see section 84.3(a)). 
Additional discussion and examples of activities to include or exclude are available in the R&D Reporting 
Community of Practice page in the MAX Community. 

Agencies should use these character classifications to identify three different types of R&D: 

1. Basic research (character class codes 141x). Experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily 
to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts. Basic 
research may include activities with broad or general applications in mind, such as the study of how 
plant genomes change, but should exclude research directed towards a specific application or 
requirement, such as the optimization of the genome of a specific crop species. 
2. Applied research (character class codes 142x). Original investigation undertaken in order to acquire 
new knowledge. Applied research is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or 
objective. 
3. Experimental development (character class codes 143x). Creative and systematic work, drawing on 
knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products 
or processes or improving existing products or processes. Like research, experimental development 
will result in gaining additional knowledge. 
For reporting experimental development activities, include the following: 

• 
The production of materials, devices, and systems or methods, including the design, construction 
and testing of experimental prototypes. 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 3 of Section 84 


SECTION 84—CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) 

• 
Technology demonstrations, in cases where a system or component is being demonstrated at scale 
for the first time, and it is realistic to expect additional refinements to the design (feedback R&D) 
following the demonstration. However, not all activities that are identified as "technology 
demonstrations" are R&D. 
Exclude: 

• 
User demonstrations where the cost and benefits of a system are being validated for a specific use 
case. This includes low-rate initial production activities. 
• 
Pre-production development, which is defined as non-experimental work on a product or system 
before it goes into full production, including activities such as tooling, and development of 
production facilities. For example, exclude activities and programs that are categorized as 
"Operational Systems Development" in the Department of Defense's budget activity structure. 
Activities and programs of this type should generally be reported as investments in other major 
equipment (1323 or 1324). 
(d) Conduct of education and training (character class codes 15xx) 
Conduct of education and training includes veterans' education and training; operating assistance for 
elementary, secondary, vocational, adult, and higher education; agricultural extension services; and income 
support activities directly contingent upon participating in such programs. This character classification 
excludes training of military personnel or other persons in Government service. 

(e) Grants to State and local governments, also known as grants-in-aid (character class codes xxx1 or 
xxx3) 
For preparing character classification data, State or local governments include the following: 

• 
The 50 States and the District of Columbia. 
• 
Cities, counties, townships, municipalities, school districts, special districts, and other local 
governmental units, as defined by the Bureau of the Census. 
• 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories. 
• 
The Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Palau, if the payments are in an account 
that has grants to other State or local governments. 
• 
Indian Tribal governments when: 
• 
The legislation authorizing the payment includes such entities within the definition of eligible 
State or local units. 
• 
The Tribal government acts as a nonprofit agency operating under State or local auspices. 
• 
Quasi-public nonprofit entities, such as community action agencies, when the boards of such 
entities must either be elected in State or local elections, or must include significant representation 
of State or locally elected officials. 
Report budget authority and outlays as grants to State and local governments if the Federal Government's 
resources support State or local programs of government operations or provision of services to the public. 
For reporting character classification data for grants, include the following: 

Page 4 of Section 84 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 84—CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) 

• 
Direct cash grants to State or local governmental units, to other public bodies established under 
State or local law, or to their designee. 
• 
Payments for grants-in-kind, such as purchases of commodities distributed to State or local 
governmental institutions (e.g., school lunch programs). 
• 
Payments to nongovernmental entities when such payments result in cash or in-kind services or 
products that are passed on to State or local governments, for example, payments to the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting, or to the American Printing House for the Blind. 
• 
Payments to regional commissions and organizations that are redistributed at the State or local level 
to provide public services. 
• 
Payments to State and local governments for research and development that is an integral part of 
the State and local governments' provision of services to the general public (e.g., research on crime 
control financed from law enforcement assistance grants, or on mental health associated with the 
provision of mental rehabilitation services; see discussion below for exclusions related to research 
and development and payments for services rendered). 
• 
Direct loan or loan guarantee subsidies to State or local governments. 
• 
Shared revenues. These include payments to State or local governments that are computed as a 
percentage of the proceeds from the sale of certain Federal property, products, or services (e.g., 
payments from receipts of Oregon and California grant lands). Tax or other collections by the 
Federal Government that are passed on to State or local governments (e.g., internal revenue 
collections for Puerto Rico) are also included. 
Exclude the following: 

• 
Federal administrative expenses associated with grant programs. 
• 
Grants directly to profit-making institutions, individuals, and nonprofit institutions not covered 
above, for example, payments to Job Corps centers and trainees. 
• 
Payments for research and development not directly related to the provision of services to the 
general public, for example, basic research awarded via competitive grants. 
• 
Payments for services rendered, for example, utility services, training programs and expenses for 
Federal employees, research and development for Federal purposes conducted under contracts, 
grants, or agreements by such agencies as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National 
Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA), and the Department of Defense (DOD). 
• 
Federal grants to cover administrative expenses for regional bodies and other funds not 
redistributed to the States or their subordinate jurisdictions (e.g., the administrative expenses of the 
Appalachian Regional Commission). 
(f) Direct Federal programs (character class codes xxx0, xxx2, or xxx4) 
Federal programs that are not classified as grants to State and local governments will be classified as direct 
Federal programs. Direct Federal programs include both programs operated directly by Federal employees 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 5 of Section 84 


SECTION 84—CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) 

and programs operated through contract or by grants to non-Federal entities not included in the definition 
of "State and local governments" under (e). 

84.3 What do I need to know about reporting the data and relationships with other data 
requirements? 
(a) General requirements 
• 
If an account has only one character class code, MAX will automatically generate the amounts for 
Schedule C. 
• 
OMB does not control centrally the addition or deletion of character classification codes of 
expenditure accounts. If the nature of an account changes or otherwise requires the use of different 
character classes, you may add (or delete) the appropriate code and enter gross budget authority 
and outlays in MAX in that code without advance approval from OMB. 
• 
Report gross budget authority and gross outlays on character classification lines 1311-2003. Use 
line 2004 to capture non-investment and non-grant amounts, as well as non-investment offsetting 
collections, and balance the totals for Schedule C with net BA and outlay amounts in Schedule X. 
• 
Report rescissions on the same line as the original funding. For example, if funding appropriated 
for the construction of a new Federal facility is rescinded, the funding and the rescission should be 
recorded on line 1314. 
• 
Budget authority and outlay totals for each subfunction must be consistent across all schedules and 
transmits. If an account has multiple subfunctions, report budget authority and outlays by 
subfunction. See section 81 for more information on entering estimates of budget authority, 
outlays, and receipts. 
• 
Character classifications should be used consistently across all transmits, but can change to 
properly reflect program proposals (e.g., an account with investment funding on line 1512 under 
current law, could also have a mandatory proposal for a new grant on line 1511 in a transmit 4). 
• 
If a transaction fits into more than one classification, report it in the classification category with the 
lowest numerical character classification code. For example, record amounts for construction of 
research and development facilities in the appropriate 13xx grouping, not in the 14xx grouping. 
• 
If an account contains activities that fall under two or more character classifications, omit any 
classification involving less than $1 million in each of the three fiscal years (PY, CY, and BY), and 
include the amounts in the next largest classification in that particular account. 
• 
When entering a new grant line (an odd numbered line) in Schedule C, the correct Budget 
Enforcement Act (BEA) category (i.e. discretionary or mandatory) for those amounts should be 
selected. The BEA category for amounts on non-grant lines is not recorded in Schedule C. 
• 
In some cases, grants to State and local governments allow the recipient jurisdiction the option of 
using funds for current or investment-type purposes, such as in community development block 
programs. In such instances, record all of the budget authority and outlays for grants in the category 
where the majority of the funds are anticipated to be used. 
Page 6 of Section 84 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 84—CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) 

• 
Avoid double counting. If an appropriation is made to a Federal fund and transferred to a Trust 
fund, only code the funding as investment once in the account that makes the investment (usually 
the Trust Fund). See also (c) below. 
• 
If a correction in the MAX A-11 database to the character classification of current or prior year 
funding is necessary, it is required that the agency also provide corrected historical amounts for 
years prior to the current budget exercise’s PY. 
(b) Reporting offsetting collections (expenditure accounts) 
In almost all cases, offsetting collections in the account should be included in character class Direct Federal 
Programs, non-investment as part of a net total on line 2004. An exception would be offsetting collections 
from the sale of physical assets (e.g. land, structures, equipment, or commodities), which should be reported 
as negative amounts in the correct physical asset character class code. 

The gross budget authority and outlays for investments and grants should be identified first and classified 
with the appropriate character class code (i.e., character class codes 1xxx, 2001, or 2003). For the remaining 
spending and offsetting collections, use character class code 2004 as a residual balancing entry to ensure 
that the sum of entries in Schedule C add to total net budget authority and outlays in Schedule A by 
subfunction. This means that, in appropriate cases, character class code 2004 amounts may be negative. 

As an example, consider an account with gross BA and outlays of $100 million that receives $20 million 
in offsetting collections from the public and spends all of it. If $70 million of the funds in the account are 
for the construction of a non-R&D Federal facility (character class code 1314) and $30 million for direct 
Federal non-investment activities (character class code 2004), then Schedule C would show $70 million in 
gross BA and outlays on line 1314, and character class code 2004 would show a net $10 million. The net 
$10 million can be thought of two ways: as a residual balancing entry to ensure that total net outlays in 
Schedule C equal total net outlays in Schedule X (in this case $80 million), or as the sum of $30 million for 
direct Federal non-investment spending, and -$20 million for collections from the public. The sum of all 
character class codes would add to net outlays and, in this example, would be $80 million. 

(c) Classifying activities financed by offsetting collections from Federal sources 
If grants to State or local governments or investments are financed by payments from one Federal account 
to a second Federal account (i.e., offsetting collections from Federal sources), you must ensure that the 
amounts are recorded as grants or investments only once (i.e., ensure that they are not double-counted). In 
general, the amounts should be recorded as follows: 

• 
For all grants to State or local governments, record the grants in the second account (i.e., the account 
that actually makes the payment to the State or local government). Record the payment from the 
first account to the second account as direct Federal spending. 
• 
For direct Federal investment (which includes all investments except those through grants to State 
or local governments), record the investment in the account that is primarily responsible for funding 
the investment. (Note that grants to research institutions are classified as direct Federal investment, 
not as grants to State or local governments.) This is usually the initial account. For example, if the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides funds to the National Science Foundation (NSF) 
for research, record the R&D in the EPA account that funds the research, not in NSF. In this 
example, the NSF spending should be coded as non-investment spending (line 2004) rather than as 
spending for research. However, in certain cases, primary responsibility might occur in the second 
account. For example, regarding rental payments to the GSA Federal Buildings Fund, some of the 
rental receipts may ultimately be used for construction by GSA. In these situations, the investment 
OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 7 of Section 84 


SECTION 84—CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) 

should be recorded in the second account because primary responsibility for the investment would 
be in that account. 

(d) Reporting offsetting receipts (receipt accounts) 
You must also report offsetting receipts for PY through BY by character class in Schedules K (baseline) 
and R (policy). Classify offsetting receipts in receipt accounts as Federal investment to report: 

• 
proceeds from the sale of physical assets (e.g., land, structures, equipment, or commodities) in the 
corresponding physical asset character classes; and 
• 
credit reform offsetting receipts for downward reestimates and negative subsidies for 
investment-related credit programs (i.e., for physical assets or for the conduct of education and 
training) on the appropriate investment line number (i.e., 13xx or 1512). 
OMB controls the character classification of offsetting receipts centrally. When setting up a new receipt 
account, discuss the usage of a character classification with your OMB representative. And to change the 
classification, you must get approval before you can enter data under a different code. (See section 79.4 
for proposing changes to budget account classifications.) 

For general guidance on reporting collections deposited in offsetting receipt accounts in Schedules K and 
R use the instructions in section 81.3(b). 

(e) Credit programs 
For credit program accounts, classify subsidies and subsidy reestimates for direct loans and loan guarantees 
and their administrative expenses according to the purpose of the program in Schedule C and on the 
appropriate character class line. For example, credit subsidies for construction should be in the character 
class for construction and rehabilitation (131x), and credit subsidies for the conduct of education should be 
in the character class for the conduct of education and training (15xx). Classify direct loans and loan 
guarantees to State or local governments on a grant line. Do not report character class for credit financing 
accounts. 

(f) Outyear projections 
Agencies should enter character class data in the MAX budget data system for PY through BY. MAX will 
automatically generate outyear projections of grant outlays through BY+9 based on in-year data. Other 
entries will be shown through BY only. 

For the projection of grant outlays MAX will assume, using an algorithm, that the percentage of grant 
outlays estimated for the outyears is the same as that reported in the BY. For example, if 18 percent of 
outlays in the account are on line 1511–02 (grant outlays for education and training) in BY, then 18 percent 
of net outlays will be estimated on line 1511–02 for each outyear. Agencies may view these outyear 
projections on-screen. If projections do not accurately reflect outyear policy, contact your OMB 
representative to request permission to override the projections in MAX. 

(g) Relationships with other data requirements 
You should be able to reconcile information reported in this schedule for the conduct of R&D with 
information reported in the National Science Foundation's Survey of Federal Funds for R&D (see 
description of line 14xx), and with information provided in the supplemental R&D data request described 
in (h) below. R&D spending reported in Schedule C should also be consistent with financial reporting on 

Page 8 of Section 84 OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) 


SECTION 84—CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) 

R&D, as required by A-136 Section II.4.10 and the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards 
8, Chapter 7. 

You should also be able to reconcile the total reported in this schedule for the construction of R&D facilities 
(1311 or 1312) and major movable R&D equipment (1321 or 1322) with information reported in the 
National Science Foundation's Survey of Federal Funds for R&D as R&D plant. 

(h) Additional research and development reporting requirements 
Crosscutting R&D data for specific topics, such as climate change research, and nanotechnology R&D, will 
be requested in order to meet Congressional reporting requirements. These data are collected outside of 
MAX A-11 in an online MAX Collect tool (see section 25.5). Annual reports that complement the budget 
data are issued by components of the National Science and Technology Council. Detailed instructions and 
definitions will be distributed by OMB through a Budget Data Request. 

84.4 How do I report character classification in MAX? 
In schedules C, K, and R, character class data are identified by a line number that consists of a four-digit 
number and a two-digit suffix (xxxx–xx). The line number identifies data as investment or non-investment, 
and as grants or direct Federal programs. 

Character class line numbers include the following: 

• 
Investment activities: 
• 
Lines 13xx, physical assets. 
• 
Lines 14xx, research and development (R&D). 
• 
Lines 15xx, education and training. 
• 
Non-investment activities: 
• 
Lines 2xxx. 
Classify all investment activities in the 1xxx series and all non-investment activities in the 2xxx series. The 
two-digit suffix differentiates among budget authority, outlays, and offsetting receipts, as follows: 

• 
01—Budget authority 

• 
02—Outlays 

• 
03—Offsetting receipts 

Use the guidance in section 84.2 to ensure that data are reported in the correct categories. Only some of 
the following codes apply to offsetting receipts; they are specifically noted below with an asterisk (*). All 
of the line numbers apply to budget authority and outlays. 

For grants to State and local governments lines (odd numbered lines) make sure to select the appropriate 
BEA category when entering a new line. Use guidance in section 79.4(c) to assist. For non-grants lines 
MAX A-11 does not code amounts by BEA category. Also for grants to State and local governments, MAX 
A-11 will automatically calculate outlays in the outyears. No outyear data is stored in MAX A-11 for direct 
federal investment lines. 

You can see the previous year's character class data under "Historical reports" on the Budget Season Reports 
page.

Summary of Changes 

Explains methods to determine FTE employment estimates (section 85.5). 

85.1 How should my agency's budget address workforce planning and restructuring? 
Your budget submission must identify the human capital management and development objectives, 
key activities, and associated resources that are needed to support agency accomplishment of programmatic 
goals. 

Furthermore, your budget submission should describe the specific activities and/or actions planned to meet 
the standards for success under human capital initiatives, the associated resources, the expected outcomes, 
and how performance will be measured. For example, you should: 

Identify the organizational changes you are proposing to: 

• 
Reduce the number of managers, reduce organizational layers, and reduce the time it takes to make 
decisions. 
• 
Increase the span of control and redirect positions within the agency to ensure that the largest number 
of employees possible are in direct service delivery positions and retrain and/or redeploy employees 
as part of restructuring efforts to make the organization more citizen-centered. 
Identify the training, development, leadership development, and staffing actions you propose to take to: 

• 
Ensure continuity of leadership. 
• 
Ensure that leaders and managers effectively manage people. 
• 
Sustain a learning environment that drives continuous improvement in performance. 
• 
Prepare for and respond to changes driven by e-Government.

SECTION 85—ESTIMATING EMPLOYMENT LEVELS 
AND THE EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) 

Present agency competency and skill needs (or gaps) you identify as part of your workforce planning effort 
and how you plan to address those needs through recruitment, development, and related strategies. 

85.2 What terms do I need to know? 
Employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105, means an officer or individual who is appointed under a delegated 
authority, is engaged in the performance of a Federal function, and is subject to the supervision of an officer 
or employee of the Federal Government. 

Full-time equivalent (FTE) employment means the total number of regular straight-time hours worked 
(i.e., not including overtime or holiday hours worked) by employees divided by the number of compensable 
hours applicable to each fiscal year. Annual leave, sick leave, compensatory time off and other approved 
leave categories are considered "hours worked" for purposes of defining full-time equivalent employment 
that is reported in the employment summary (see section 85.6). A list of compensable days (with associated 
hours) is provided in section 85.5(c). 

85.3 What should be the basis for my personnel estimates? 
(1) Staffing requirements. Base estimates for staffing requirements on the assumption that improvements 
in skills, organization, procedures, and supervision will produce a steady increase in productivity. 
Personnel should be reassigned, to the maximum extent, to meet new program requirements. Use personnel 
currently funded to the maximum extent in staffing new programs and expansions of existing programs. 
These actions should be part of your agency's overall human capital strategy, and reflected in the integrated 
performance plan (see section 220). Reductions generally should be planned where the workload is stable. 
Where information technology systems are installed or enhanced, gains in productivity should result in 
lower personnel requirements after the first year. You should be prepared to explain the assumptions 
underlying staffing requirement adjustment upon request. 
Where appropriate, use calculations converting workload to required personnel that include an estimate of 
available workhours per employee. You should exclude annual leave, sick leave, administrative leave, 
training, and other non-work time from these calculations. Base estimates of available time on current data, 
reflect steps taken to improve the ratio of available time to total time, and recognize differences in available 
time by organization, location, or activity. Base exclusions for annual and sick leave on current experience 
of actual leave taken rather than leave earned. Employment levels should reflect budget proposals and 
assumptions with regard to workload, efficiency, proposed legislation, interagency reimbursable 
arrangements, and other special staffing methods. Employment intended for proposed legislation, or for 
carrying out proposed supplemental appropriations, cannot begin until the additional funds become 
available by congressional action. Employment proposed for activation of new facilities or start-up of new 
programs cannot begin until the new activity begins. Employment under estimated reimbursable 
arrangements also cannot begin until such arrangements have been negotiated and justified. 

(2) Personnel resources. Base estimates of personnel resources on the total number of regularly scheduled 
straight-time hours (worked or to be worked) in the fiscal year (see section 85.5(c)). Note that, although 
budgetary resources must be sufficient to cover any extra compensable days in a fiscal year, some of the 
corresponding outlays may not occur until the following year. 
(3) Requirement for FTE data. Wherever entries in schedules or materials required by this Circular pertain 
to personnel requirements or total employment levels, state such entries for all years in terms of FTEs, as 
defined in section 85.2, unless another measure is explicitly required. For military employment, see section 
85.8.

SECTION 85—ESTIMATING EMPLOYMENT LEVELS 
AND THE EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) 

85.4 What is the requirement for reporting civilian FTE data in the Budget? 
With the exception of some national security functions, agencies will report prior fiscal year civilian FTE 
actuals in MAX A-11 DE schedule Q each fall, along with current and budget year estimates. Therefore, 
agencies should maintain a system of accounting for their FTE on a regular basis. 

85.5 What do I need to know about FTE budgeted levels? 
(a) Federal FTE requirements 
There are no statutory or other government-wide caps on FTE levels. Similarly, agencies have the 
flexibility to manage their FTE levels, within their budget constraints, and to determine how many FTEs 
are required to successfully accomplish their mission. In exercising this authority, agencies may put into 
place internal management controls with respect to FTEs that, among other things, help to ensure that the 
agency does not exceed its appropriated funding level. Agencies should take steps to assess and, as 
appropriate, restructure, retrain, and resize its FTE count to achieve its mission as effectively and efficiently 
as possible. Such steps should be consistent with all Human Capital Management Reports. All increases in 
FTEs should be accompanied by a detailed justification of its purpose and workload, and should be 
appropriately commensurate with changes in account funding levels. Generally, if agency account funding 
requests decrease from previous years, the agency should take appropriate steps to reduce FTE levels as 
necessary. Where agencies have proposed the termination, reduction, or consolidation of a program, 
agencies should take the appropriate steps to reduce FTE levels that correspond with the proposed program 
reductions. Agencies should not overstate FTE levels, and provide justification supporting the accuracy of 
FTE estimates. 

(b) Workforce conversions 
Consistent with the general policy of making the most effective use of Government resources, each agency 
head will ensure close management of budgeted FTE levels for their agency. Agencies should not convert 
the work of their employees to contractors unless they determine that the work is not inherently 
governmental (as defined in the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998, P.L. 105-270), the agency 
has sufficient internal capability and capacity to maintain control of its mission and operations, and the 
agency undertakes cost comparisons that demonstrate that such a conversion is of financial advantage to 
the Government (see OMB Circular A-76). Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 1710 and 10 U.S.C. 2461, agencies are 
precluded from converting, in whole or in part, functions performed by federal employees to contract 
performance absent a public-private competition (a practice known as "direct conversion"). The conversion 
of work from in-house to private sector performance may only occur through public-private 
competition. Appropriations acts since 2009, however, have prohibited agencies from using funds to "begin 
or announce a study or public-private competition regarding the conversion to contractor performance of 
any function performed by Federal employees pursuant to Office of Management and Budget Circular A76 
or any other administrative regulation, directive, or policy." 

(c) Determining FTE usage 
You must prepare budget estimates relating to personnel requirements in terms of FTE employment as 
specified in this Circular. 

Agencies may choose from two methods to determine current year and budget year FTE employment 
estimates: 

OMB Circular No. A–11 (2019) Page 3 of Section 85 


SECTION 85—ESTIMATING EMPLOYMENT LEVELS 
AND THE EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) 

Regular Method -Divide the estimated total number of regular hours by the number of compensable 
hours in each fiscal year. Divide the total regular hours worked during the actual fiscal year 
(October 1-September 30) by the number of compensable hours shown in the table below for the 
applicable fiscal year. The regular method derives compensable days by counting days in the 
standard Monday-through-Friday workweek in the given fiscal year. Compensable hours are 
derived by multiplying the number of compensable days by 8 hours (i.e., the standard workday). 

Pay Period Method -Divide regular hours worked during a period of 26 biweekly pay periods 
(closely corresponding to the fiscal year) are by 2080 hours. (The 26 biweekly pay periods cover 
52 weeks with 40 hours in a standard workweek. 52 x 40 = 2080.) The 26 biweekly pay periods 
that closely correspond to a fiscal year are identified as the pay periods that end in the given fiscal 
year. If there are 27 pay periods that end in a fiscal year, agencies should drop the one implicating 
the fewest work days in that fiscal year, so that 26 pay periods are always used. 

FTE employment levels apply to straight-time hours only. Include foreign national direct hire employees 
in your FTE employment totals. FTEs funded by allocations from other agencies will be included with the 
performing agency where the employees work and are paid (see section 85.7). 

Be sure to include in FTE employment estimates for all Federal employees, including persons appointed 
under the Worker Trainee Opportunity Program, Presidential Management Fellows, Federal Cooperative 
Education Program, summer aids, Stay-in-School Program, and the Federal Junior Fellowship Program.

(d) Justification and estimates of FTE usage 
The FTE estimates for each agency are determined at the time of the annual budget review, for the fiscal 
year in progress and for the succeeding fiscal year. In addition, you must ensure that the FTE estimates are 
consistent with all applicable laws. In particular, some statutes providing agencies with authority to use 
voluntary separation incentive proposals (or "buy-outs") stipulate that agency-wide FTE levels must be 
reduced one-for-one for each buy-out. Further, FTE estimates must represent an effective and efficient use 
of resources to meet program requirements. 

Current year FTE estimates should be consistent with PY actuals, should be fully funded, and should be 
very close to the actual usage reported at the end of the fiscal year. For example, the estimates in the 
previous Budget should be very close to the actuals published in the current Budget. 

(e) FTE transfers between agencies 
Prior to entering into new or expanded agreements to perform work for other agencies on a reimbursable 
basis, you must prepare a cost justification. As part of this agreement, you may transfer FTEs on a one-forone 
basis, provided that you notify OMB prior to making such a transfer. You may proceed with the FTE 
transfer fifteen days after notification to OMB, unless OMB objects.

SECTION 85—ESTIMATING EMPLOYMENT LEVELS 
AND THE EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) 

(f) Adjustment requests 
Send all requests for adjustments in employment levels, including agreements to transfer FTEs between 
agencies, to your OMB representative. 

85.6 What do I need to know about the employment summary (schedule Q)? 
This schedule shows the total full-time equivalent (FTE) civilian employment of straight-time compensable 
workyears (i.e., not overtime) financed by an account for PY through BY. FTE employment excludes 
estimates for terminal leave and overtime hours. The method for calculating FTE employment is described 
in section 85.5. You must provide an employment summary when an account contains an entry for either 
direct or reimbursable personnel compensation in the object class schedule (i.e., object class entry 11.1 or 

11.3 (see section 83.7)). You must also provide an employment summary when employees are 
compensated via an allocation account. For reimbursable and allocation FTE arrangements, see the 
discussion on their budget schedule treatment in section 85.7. This schedule also shows military average 
strength employment as discussed in section 85.9. 
The definition of object class 11.1 stipulates that compensation must be included for all workdays in the 
fiscal year. You must ensure that FTE levels in the employment summary and funding for FTEs in the 
object class schedule are reported consistently. 

You must also ensure that agency-wide FTE totals agree with the negotiated levels in the current and budget 
years. Prior year FTE in the employment summary must equal your agency's FTE execution level. 

When entering FTE data in schedule Q, use the four-digit line numbering scheme described in the following 
table: 

EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) 

Entry Description 

Xxxx The first digit of the line number distinguishes between direct, 
reimbursable, and other categories, consistent with the reporting of data 
in the object classification schedule (see section 83.5). Use the 
following codes: 
1—direct 
2—reimbursable 
3—allocation account 

xXxx The second digit of the line number distinguishes between civilian and 
military employment. Use the following codes: 
0—civilian employment 
1—military employment 

xx0x The third digit is 0. 

xxx1 The fourth digit is 1.
