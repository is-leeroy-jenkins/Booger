The following is a list of definitions of key terms frequently used in2 CFR part 200. Definitions found in Federal 
statutes or regulations that apply to particular programs take precedence over the following definitions. However, 
where the following definitions implement specific statutory requirements that apply government-wide, such as the 
Single Audit Act, the following definitions take precedence over Federal regulations. For purposes of this part, the 
following definitions apply: 

2 CFR 200.1 (enhanced display) page 8 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.1 “Acquisition cost” 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

Acquisition cost means the (total) cost of the asset including the cost to ready the asset for its intended use. For 
example, acquisition cost for equipment means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost 
of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the 
purpose for which it is acquired. Acquisition costs for software include those development costs 
capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Ancillary charges such 
as taxes, duty, protective in transit insurance, freight, and installation may be included in or excluded from 
the acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's regular accounting practices. 

Advance payment means a payment that a Federal agency or pass-through entity makes by any appropriate 
payment mechanism and payment method before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for 
program purposes. 

Allocation means the process of assigning a cost, or a group of costs, to one or more cost objective(s), in 
reasonable proportion to the benefit provided or other equitable relationship. The process may entail 
assigning a cost(s) directly to a final cost objective or through one or more intermediate cost objectives. 

Assistance Listings refer to the publicly available listing of Federal assistance programs managed and 
administered by the General Services Administration (GSA) atSAM.gov. 

Assistance Listing number means a unique number assigned to identify an Assistance Listing. 
Assistance Listing program title means the title that corresponds to the Assistance Listing number. 
Audit finding means deficiencies which the auditor is required to report in the schedule of findings and 
questioned costs. (See§ 200.516(a)) 

Auditee means any non-Federal entity that must be audited under this part. (See§ 200.501) 
Auditor means an auditor who is a public accountant or a Federal, State, local government, or Indian Tribe audit 
organization that meets the general standards specified for external auditors in generally accepted 
government auditing standards (GAGAS). The term auditor does not include internal auditors of nonprofit 
organizations. 

Budget means the financial plan for the Federal award that the Federal agency or pass-through entity approves 
during the Federal award process or in subsequent amendments to the Federal award. It may include the 
Federal and non-Federal share or only the Federal share, as determined by the Federal agency or pass-
through entity. 

Budget period means the time interval from the start date of a funded portion of an award to the end date of that 
funded portion, during which recipients and subrecipients are authorized to incur financial obligations of 
the funds awarded, including any funds carried forward or other revisions pursuant to§ 200.308. 

Capital assets means: 
(1) Tangible or intangible assets used in operations having a useful life of more than one year which are 
capitalized in accordance with GAAP. Capital assets include: 

(i) Land, buildings (facilities), equipment, and intellectual property (including software), whether 
acquired by purchase, construction, manufacture, exchange, or through a lease accounted for 
as financed purchase under Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards or a 
finance lease under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards; and

2 CFR 200.1 “Capital assets” (1)(ii) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(ii) Additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, 
renovations, or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life 
(not ordinary repairs and maintenance). 

(2) For purpose of this part, capital assets do not include intangible right-to-use assets (per GASB) and 
right-to-use operating lease assets (per FASB). For example, assets capitalized that recognize a 
lessee's right to control the use of property or equipment for a period of time under a lease contract. 
See§ 200.465. 

Capital expenditures means expenditures to acquire capital assets or expenditures to make additions, 

improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations, or alterations to 
capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life. 

Central service cost allocation plan means the documentation identifying, accumulating, and allocating or 
developing billing rates based on the allowable costs of services provided by a State, local government, or 
Indian Tribe to its departments and agencies on a centralized basis. The costs of these services may be 
allocated or billed to users. 

Claim means, depending on the context, either: 

(1) A written demand or assertion by one of the parties to a Federal award seeking as a matter of right: 
(i) The payment of money; 
(ii) The adjustment or interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Federal award; or 
(iii) Other relief arising under or relating to a Federal award. 
(2) A request for payment not in dispute when submitted. 
Class of Federal awards means a group of Federal awards either awarded under a specific program or group of 

programs or to a specific type of recipient or group of recipients to which specific provisions or 
exceptions may apply. 

Closeout means the process by which the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that all applicable 

administrative actions and all required work of the Federal award have been completed and takes actions 
as described in§ 200.344. 

Cluster of programs means a grouping of closely related programs that share common compliance 

requirements. The types of clusters of programs are research and development (R&D), student financial 
aid (SFA), and other clusters. “Other clusters” are defined by OMB in the compliance supplement or 
designated by a State for Federal awards the State provides to its subrecipients that meet the definition of 
a cluster of programs. When designating “other clusters,” a State must identify the Federal awards 
included in the cluster and advise the subrecipients of compliance requirements applicable to the cluster, 
consistent with§ 200.332. A cluster of programs must be considered one program when determining 
major programs as described in§ 200.518, and with the exception of R&D as described in§ 200.501(d), 
whether a program-specific audit may be elected. 

Cognizant agency for audit means the Federal agency designated to carry out the responsibilities described in§ 

200.513(a). The cognizant agency for audit is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for 
indirect costs. A list of Federal agency Single Audit contacts can be found on the Federal Audit 
Clearinghouse (FAC) website.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

Cognizant agency for indirect costs means the Federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating and 
approving cost allocation plans or indirect cost proposals on behalf of all Federal agencies. The cognizant 
agency for indirect cost is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for audit. For assignments 
of cognizant agencies, see the following: 

(1) For Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs): Appendix III, paragraph C.11. 
(2) For nonprofit organizations: Appendix IV, paragraph C.2.a. 
(3) For State and local governments: Appendix V, paragraph F.1. 
(4) For Indian Tribes: Appendix VII, paragraph D.1. 
Compliance supplement means an annually updated authoritative source of information for auditors that 
identifies existing important compliance requirements that the Federal Government expects to be

and compliance requirements, as well as audit objectives and suggested audit procedures for 
determining compliance with the relevant Federal program. 

Computing devices means machines that acquire, store, analyze, process, and publish data and other 
information electronically, including accessories (or “peripherals”) for printing, transmitting and receiving, 
or storing electronic information. See also the definitions ofsuppliesandinformation technology systems 
in this section. 

Contract means, for the purpose of Federal financial assistance, a legal instrument by which a recipient or 
subrecipient conducts procurement transactions under a Federal award. For additional information on 
subrecipient and contractor determinations, see§ 200.331. See also the definition ofsubawardin this 
section. 

Contractor means an entity that receives a contract. 
Continuation funding means the second or subsequent budget period within an identified period of performance. 
Cooperative agreement means a legal instrument of financial assistance between a Federal agency and a 
recipient or between a pass-through entity and subrecipient, consistent with31 U.S.C. 6302-6305: 

(1) Is used to enter into a relationship the principal purpose of which is to transfer anything of value to 
carry out a public purpose authorized by a law of the United States (see31 U.S.C. 6101(3)); and not 
to acquire property or services for the Federal Government or pass-through entity's direct benefit or 
use; 

(2) Is distinguished from a grant in that it provides for substantial involvement of the Federal agency or 
pass-through entity in carrying out the activity contemplated by the Federal award. 

(3) The term does not include: 
(i) A cooperative research and development agreement as defined in15 U.S.C. 3710a; or 
(ii) An agreement that provides only: 
(A) Direct United States Government cash assistance to an individual; 
(B) A subsidy; 
(C) A loan; 
(D) A loan guarantee; or

(1) Corrects identified deficiencies; 
(2) Produces recommended improvements; or 
(3) Demonstrates that audit findings are either invalid or do not warrant auditee action. 
Cost allocation plan means a central service or public assistance cost allocation plan. 
Cost objective means a program, function, activity, award, organizational subdivision, contract, or work unit for 
which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and measure the cost of 
processes, products, jobs, and capital projects. A cost objective may be a major function of the recipient 
or subrecipient, a particular service or project, a Federal award, or an indirect cost activity, as described in 
subpart E. See also the definitions offinal cost objectiveandintermediate cost objectivein this section. 

Cost sharing means the portion of project costs not paid by Federal funds or contributions (unless authorized by 
Federal statute). This term includesmatching,which refers to required levels of cost share that must be 
provided. See§ 200.306. 

Disallowed cost means charges to a Federal award that the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines to 
be unallowable in accordance with applicable Federal statutes, regulations, the provisions of this part, or 
the terms and conditions of the Federal award. 

Discretionary award means an award in which the Federal agency, in keeping with specific statutory authority 
that enables the agency to exercise judgment (“discretion”), selects the recipient or the amount of Federal 
funding awarded through a competitive process or based on merit of proposals. A discretionary award 
may be selected on a non-competitive basis, as appropriate. 

Equipment means tangible personal property (including information technology systems) having a useful life of 
more than one year and a per-unit acquisition cost that equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization 
level established by the recipient or subrecipient for financial statement purposes, or $10,000. See the 
definitions ofcapital assets, computing devices, general purpose equipment, information technology

Micro-purchase threshold means the dollar amount at or below which a recipient or subrecipient may purchase 

property, or services using micro-purchase procedures (see§ 200.320). Generally, except as provided in§ 
200.320, the micro-purchase threshold for procurement activities administered under Federal awards is

requested by the recipient or subrecipient and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. 

Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) means all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and 
supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $50,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period of 
performance of the subawards under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, 
charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support 
costs, and the portion of each subaward in excess of $50,000. Other items may only be excluded when 
necessary to avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of indirect costs and with the approval of the 
cognizant agency for indirect costs. 

Non-discretionary award means an award made by the Federal agency to specific recipients in accordance with

of funding opportunity is any paper or electronic issuance that an agency uses to announce a funding 
opportunity, whether it is called a “program announcement,” “notice of funding availability,” “broad agency 
announcement,” “research announcement,” “solicitation,” or some other term.

recipient or subrecipient unless OMB designates a specific cognizant agency for audit. When the direct 
funding represents less than 25 percent of the total Federal expenditures (as direct and sub-awards) by 
the recipient or subrecipient, then the Federal agency with the predominant amount of total funding is the

designated oversight agency for audit. When there is no direct funding, the Federal agency that is the 
predominant source of pass-through funding must assume the oversight responsibilities. The duties of 
the oversight agency for audit and the process for any reassignments are described in§ 200.513(b). 

Participant generally means an individual participating in or attending program activities under a Federal award, 
such as trainings or conferences, but who is not responsible for implementation of the Federal award. 
Individuals committing effort to the development or delivery of program activities under a Federal award

and their involvement in a Federal award, such as stipends, subsistence allowances, travel allowances, 
registration fees, temporary dependent care, and per diem paid directly to or on behalf of participants. 

Pass-through entity means a recipient or subrecipient that provides a subaward to a subrecipient (including 
lower tier subrecipients) to carry out part of a Federal program. The authority of the pass-through entity 
under this part flows through the subaward agreement between the pass-through entity and subrecipient. 

Performance goal means a measurable target level of performance expressed as a tangible, measurable 
objective, against which actual achievement can be compared, including a goal expressed as a 
quantitative standard, value, or rate. In some instances (for example, discretionary research awards), this 
may be limited to the requirement to submit technical performance reports (to be evaluated in 
accordance with agency policy). 

Period of performance means the time interval between the start and end date of a Federal award, which may

consistent with§ 200.211(b)(5)does not commit the Federal agency to fund the award beyond the 
currently approved budget period. 

Personal property means property other than real property. It may be tangible or intangible. 
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's 
identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or 
linkable to a specific individual. Some PII is available in public sources such as telephone books, 
websites, and university listings. The definition of PII is not attached to any single category of information 
or technology. Instead, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be 
identified. Non-PII can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available, in any 
medium and from any source, that could be used to identify an individual when combined with other 
available information. 

Prior approval means the written approval obtained in advance by an authorized official of a Federal agency or 
pass-through entity of certain costs or programmatic decisions. 

Program income means gross income earned by the recipient or subrecipient that is directly generated by a

performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of 
commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, license fees, and royalties on patents and 
copyrights, and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on 
advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes,

Project cost means total allowable costs incurred under a Federal award and all cost sharing, including third-

party contributions. 

Property means real property or personal property. See this section's definitions ofreal propertyandpersonal

PII that must be disclosed by law. Examples of PII include, but are not limited to, social security number; 
passport number; credit card numbers; clearances, bank numbers; biometrics; date and place of birth; 
mother's maiden name; criminal, medical and financial records; and educational transcripts. 

Questioned cost has the meaning given in paragraphs (1) through (3). 

(1) Questioned costmeans an amount, expended or received from a Federal award, that in the auditor's 
judgment: 

(i) Is noncompliant or suspected noncompliant with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and 
conditions of the Federal award; 

(ii) At the time of the audit, lacked adequate documentation to support compliance; or 
(iii) Appeared unreasonable and did not reflect the actions a prudent person would take in the 
circumstances. 

(2) The questioned cost amount under (1)(ii) is calculated as if the portion of a transaction that lacked 
adequate documentation were confirmed noncompliant. 

(3) There is no questioned cost solely because of: 
(i) Deficiencies in internal control; or 
(ii) Noncompliance with the reporting type of compliance requirement (described in the 
compliance supplement) if this noncompliance does not affect the amount expended or 
received from the Federal award. 

(4) Known questioned costmeans a questioned cost specifically identified by the auditor. Known 
questioned costs are a subset of likely questioned costs. 

(5) Likely questioned costmeans the auditor's best estimate of total questioned costs, not just the 
known questioned costs. Likely questioned costs are developed by extrapolating from audit 
evidence obtained, for example, by projecting known questioned costs identified in an audit sample 
to the entire population from which the sample was drawn. In evaluating the effect of questioned 
costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the likely questioned costs, not just the 
known questioned costs. 

(6) Questioned costs are not improper payments until reviewed and confirmed to be improper payments 
as defined in OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C. 

Real property means land, including land improvements, structures, and appurtenances thereto, and legal 

interests in land, including fee interest, licenses, rights of way, and easements. Real property excludes

2 CFR 200.1 “Recipient” 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

Recipient means an entity that receives a Federal award directly from a Federal agency to carry out an activity 

under a Federal program. The term recipient does not include subrecipients or individuals that are 
participants or beneficiaries of the award. 

Renewal award means a Federal award for which the start date is contiguous with, or closely follows, the end of 

the expiring Federal award. The start date of a renewal award begins a new and distinct period of 

performance. 

Research and Development (R&D) means all basic and applied research activities and all development activities 
performed by a recipient or subrecipient. The term research also includes activities involving the training 
of individuals in research techniques where such activities use the same facilities as other research and 
development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function. “Research” is 
the systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. 
“Development” is the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research to produce 
useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including designing and developing prototypes and 
processes. 

Simplified acquisition threshold means the dollar amount below which a recipient or subrecipient may purchase 
property or services using small purchase methods (see§ 200.320). Recipients and subrecipients adopt 
small purchase procedures to expedite the purchase of items at or below the simplified acquisition 
threshold. The simplified acquisition threshold set in the FAR at48 CFR part 2, subpart 2.1is used in this 
part as the simplified acquisition threshold for secondary procurement activities administered under 
Federal awards. The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining an appropriate simplified 
acquisition threshold, which is less than or equal to the dollar value established in the FAR, based on 
internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. Recipients and 
subrecipients should also determine if local government purchasing laws apply. This threshold must 
never exceed the dollar value established in the FAR. 

Special purpose equipment means equipment that is used only for research, medical, scientific, or other similar 

technical activities. Examples of special purpose equipment include microscopes, x-ray machines, 
surgical instruments, spectrometers, and associated software. See also the definitions ofequipmentand

Subsidiary means an entity in which more than 50 percent of the entity is owned or controlled directly by a 
parent corporation or through another subsidiary of a parent corporation. 

Supply means all tangible personal property other than those described in theequipmentdefinition. A 
computing device is a supply if the acquisition cost is below the lesser of the capitalization level 
established by the recipient or subrecipient for financial statement purposes or $10,000, regardless of the 
length of its useful life. See this section's definitions ofcomputing devicesandequipment. 

Telecommunications cost means the cost of using communication technologies such as mobile phones, 
landlines, and the internet. 

Termination means the action a Federal agency or pass-through entity takes to discontinue a Federal award, in 
whole or in part, at any time before the planned end date of the period of performance. Termination does 
not include discontinuing a Federal award due to a lack of available funds. 

Third-party in-kind contributions means the value of non-cash contributions (meaning,property or services) that: 
(1) Benefit a project or program funded by a Federal award; and 
(2) Are contributed by non-Federal third parties, without charge, to a recipient or subrecipient under a 
Federal award. 

Unliquidated financial obligation means financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient but not 
paid (liquidated) for financial reports prepared on a cash basis. For reports prepared on an accrual basis, 
these are financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient but for which expenditures have 
not been recorded. 

Unobligated balance means the amount of funds under a Federal award that the recipient or subrecipient has 
not obligated. The amount is computed by subtracting the cumulative amount of the recipient's or 
subrecipient's unliquidated financial obligations and expenditures under the Federal award from the 
cumulative amount of funds the Federal agency or pass-through entity authorized the recipient or 
subrecipient to obligate.

Subpart B—General Provisions 

§ 200.100 Purpose. 

Voluntary committed cost sharing means cost sharing specifically pledged voluntarily in the proposal's budget 
on the part of the recipient or subrecipient, which becomes a binding requirement of the Federal award. 
(a) Purpose. 
(1) This part establishes uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements 
for Federal awards. Federal agencies must not impose additional requirements except as allowed in 
§§ 200.102,200.211, or unless specifically required by Federal statute, regulation, or Executive order. 

(2) This part provides Federal agencies with the policy for collecting and submitting information on all 
Federal financial assistance programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and 
communicating this information to the public. It also establishes Federal policies related to the 

2 CFR 200.100(a)(2) (enhanced display) page 23 of 208

delivery of this information to the public, including through the use of electronic media. It also sets 
forth how the General Services Administration (GSA), OMB, and Federal agencies implement the 
Federal Program Information Act (31 U.S.C. 6101-6106). 

(b) Administrative requirements.Subparts B through D set forth the uniform administrative requirements for 
Federal financial assistance. This includes establishing requirements for Federal agencies management 
of Federal financial assistance programs before a Federal award is made, and requirements that Federal 
agencies may impose on recipients and subrecipients throughout the lifecycle of a Federal award. 

(c) Cost principles.Subpart E establishes principles for determining allowable costs incurred by recipients 
and subrecipients under Federal awards. These principles are for the purpose of cost determination. They 
do not address the circumstances nor dictate the extent of Federal Government funding of a particular 
program or project. 

(d) Single Audit Requirements and Audit Follow-up.Subpart F is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act 
Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). Subpart F sets forth the standards for achieving 
consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending 
Federal awards. Subpart F also provides the policies and procedures for Federal agencies or pass-through 
entities when using the results of these audits. 

§ 200.101 Applicability. 

(a) General applicability to Federal agencies. 
(1) Subparts A through F apply to Federal agencies that make Federal awards to non-Federal entities. As 
provided in paragraph (a)(2), subparts A through E may also apply to Federal agencies that make 
Federal awards to other entities. 

(2) Federal agencies must apply subparts A though F of this part to non-Federal entities unless a 
particular section of this part or Federal statute provides otherwise. Federal agencies may apply 
subparts AthroughE of this partto Federal agencies, for-profit organizations, foreign public entities, 
or foreign organizations as permitted in agency regulations or program statutes, except when a 
Federal agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the 
international responsibilities of the United States or the laws of a foreign government. Subpart F only 
applies to non-Federal entities as defined in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 
7501-7507). Federal agencies should apply the requirements to all recipients in a consistent and 
equitable manner to the extent permitted within applicable statutes, regulations, and policies. 

(3) Throughout subparts A through F, the word “must” indicates a requirement. The words “should” or 
“may” indicate a recommended approach and permit discretion. 

(4) Throughout subparts A through E, when the word “or” is used between the terms “recipient” and 
“subrecipient,” any requirements or recommendations in the relevant provisions of this part apply to 
the recipient, the subrecipient, or both, as applicable. The use of “or” between recipient and 
subrecipient does not mean that applicable requirements or recommendations only apply to one of 
these entities unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 

(b) Applicability to Federal financial assistance. 
(1) Paragraphs (b)(2)through(b)(5)of this section describe what portions of this part apply to specific 
types of Federal financial assistance.Paragraphs (d)and(e)of this section explain additional 
exceptions related to governing provisions and Federal program applicability. The terms and 
conditions of Federal awards (including this part) flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a

and management) also apply to all types of Federal financial assistance. 

(4) Subpart E (Cost Principles) applies to grants and cooperative agreements, but does not apply to the 
following: 

(i) Food commodities provided through grants and cooperative agreements; 
(ii) Fixed amount awards, except for§§ 200.400(g),200.402through200.405, and200.407(d),

entity under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). 

(1) Paragraphs (c)(2)and(c)(3)of this section describe what portions of this part apply to specific types 
of contracts and subcontracts awarded by a Federal agency to a non-Federal entity. See also

apply a risk-based, data-driven framework to alleviate select compliance requirements and hold recipients 
accountable for good performance. See also§ 200.206. Federal agencies may also request exceptions in 
emergency situations. When OMB allows an exception to requirements of this part, the Federal agency 
remains responsible for ensuring the exception is applied to Federal awards in a manner consistent with 
Federal statutes and regulations. 

(b) Statutory and regulatory exceptions.A Federal agency may adjust requirements to a class of Federal 
awards, recipients, or subrecipients when required by Federal statutes or regulations, except for the 
requirements in subpart F. Except for provisions in subpart F, when a Federal statute requires exceptions

(c) Federal agency exceptions.Federal agencies may allow exceptions to requirements of this part on a caseby-
case basis for individual Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients, except when the exceptions are 
prohibited by law or other approval is expressly required by this part. Only the cognizant agency for 
indirect costs may authorize exceptions related to cost allocation plans or indirect cost rate proposals. A 
Federal agency may also apply less restrictive requirements when issuing fixed amount awards (see§ 
200.1), except for those requirements imposed by statute or in subpart F. 

§ 200.103 Authorities. 

This part is issued under the following authorities. 

(a) Subparts B through D are authorized under31 U.S.C. 503(the Chief Financial Officers Act, Functions of

Federal Procurement Policy Act); Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 and Executive Order 11541 
(“Prescribing the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the 
Executive Office of the President”); and the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). 

(b) Subpart E is authorized under the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended; the Budget and 
Accounting Procedures Act of 1950, as amended (31 U.S.C. 1101-1126); the Chief Financial Officers Act 
of 1990 (31 U.S.C. 503-504); Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970; and Executive Order 11541, “Prescribing 
the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the Executive 
Office of the President.” OMB also relies on authority under31 U.S.C. 503and31 U.S.C. 6307. 

(c) Subpart F is authorized under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (codified at31 U.S.C.

§ 200.105 Effect on other issuances. 

(a) Superseding inconsistent requirements.For Federal awards made subject to this part by a Federal agency, 
this part takes precedence over any administrative requirements, program manuals, handbooks, and other 
non-regulatory materials that are inconsistent with the requirements of this part upon implementation by 
the Federal agency, except to the extent that they are required by statute or authorized in accordance with 
§ 200.102. 

(b) Imposition of requirements on recipients.Agencies may only impose legally binding requirements on 
recipients and subrecipients through: 

(1) Notice and public comment procedures through an approved agency process, including as 
authorized by this part, other statutes, or regulations; or 

(2) Incorporating requirements into the terms and conditions of a Federal award as permitted by Federal 
statute, regulation, or this part. 

§ 200.106 Agency implementation. 

The specific requirements and responsibilities of Federal agencies, non-Federal entities, recipients, and 
subrecipients are set forth in this part. Federal agencies making Federal awards to non-Federal entities must 
implement the language insubparts CthroughF of this partin codified regulations unless different provisions are 
required by Federal statute or are approved by OMB. 

§ 200.107 OMB responsibilities. 

OMB will review Federal agency regulations and implementation of this part. OMB will provide interpretations of 
policy requirements and assistance to ensure effective, efficient, and consistent implementation. Any exceptions 
will be subject to approval by OMB and only with adequate justification from the Federal agency. 

§ 200.108 Inquiries. 

Inquiries from Federal agencies concerning this part may be directed to OMB. Inquiries from recipients or 
subrecipients should be addressed to the Federal agency, the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the cognizant 
agency for audit, or the pass-through entity as appropriate. 

§ 200.109 Review date. 

OMB will review this part periodically. 

§ 200.110 Effective date. 

(a) The standards set forth in this part affecting the administration of Federal awards by Federal agencies 
become effective once implemented by Federal agencies or when any future amendment to this part 
becomes final. 

(b) Existing negotiated indirect cost rates will remain in place until they expire. The effective date of changes 
to indirect cost rates must be based upon the date a newly re-negotiated rate goes into effect for the 
recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year. Therefore, for indirect cost rates and cost allocation plans, the 
revisions to this part (as of the publication date for revisions to this guidance) become effective in 
generating proposals and negotiating a new rate (when the rate is re-negotiated).

2 CFR 200.111 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 
§ 200.111 English language. 

(a) All Federal financial assistance announcements, applications, and Federal award information should be in 
the English language and must be in terms of U.S. dollars. However, Federal agencies, recipients, and 
subrecipients may issue or translate a Federal award or other documents into another language. A 
Federal agency may translate formal or informal announcements of the availability of Federal funding 
through a financial assistance program, such as a notice of funding opportunity, when translations may 
serve to increase the pool of applicants or the participation of a specific community (for example, 
programs administered in foreign countries where the primary language is not English). Federal agencies 
must maintain an official controlling English version of the Federal financial assistance announcement 
and the Federal award, including the terms and conditions. 

(b) Applications, reports, and official correspondence may be submitted in languages other than English if 
specified in the notice of funding opportunity or the terms and conditions of the Federal award. 

(c) In the event of inconsistency between English and another language, the English language meaning will 
control. When a significant portion of the recipient's or subrecipient's employees administering a Federal 
award are not fluent in English, the Federal award should be provided in English and the language(s) with 
which employees are more familiar. 

§ 200.112 Conflict of interest. 

Federal agencies must establish conflict of interest policies for Federal awards. A recipient or subrecipient must 
disclose in writing any potential conflict of interest to the Federal agency or pass-through entity in accordance with 
the established Federal agency policies. 

§ 200.113 Mandatory disclosures. 

An applicant, recipient, or subrecipient of a Federal award must promptly disclose whenever, in connection with the 
Federal award (including any activities or subawards thereunder), it has credible evidence of the commission of a 
violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of 
the United States Code or a violation of the civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733). The disclosure must be 
made in writing to the Federal agency, the agency's Office of Inspector General, and pass-through entity (if 
applicable). Recipients and subrecipients are also required to report matters related to recipient integrity and 
performance in accordance withAppendix XII of this part. Failure to make required disclosures can result in any of 
the remedies described in§ 200.339. (See also2 CFR part 180,31 U.S.C. 3321, and41 U.S.C. 2313.)

agencies in the program planning, announcement, application, and award processes. 

§ 200.201 Use of grants, cooperative agreements, fixed amount awards, and contracts. 

(a) Federal awards.The Federal agency or pass-through entity must decide on the appropriate type of 
agreement for a Federal award (for example, a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract) in

(b) Fixed amount awards.The Federal agency or pass-through entity (see§ 200.333) may use fixed amount 
awards (see the definition offixed amount awardsin§ 200.1) for which the following conditions apply: 

(1) The Federal award amount is negotiated using the cost principles (or other pricing information) as a 
guide. See§ 200.101(b)(4)(ii)for further information on which provisions in subpart E (cost 
principles) apply to fixed amount awards. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may use fixed 
amount awards if the project scope has measurable goals and objectives and if accurate cost, 
historical, or unit pricing data is available to establish a fixed budget based on a reasonable estimate 
of actual costs. Budgets for fixed amount awards are negotiated with the recipient or subrecipient 
and the total amount of Federal funding is determined in accordance with the recipient's or 
subrecipient's proposal, available pricing data, and subpart E. Accountability must be based on 
performance and results, which can be communicated in performance reports or through routine 
monitoring. There is no expected routine monitoring of the actual costs incurred by the recipient or 
subrecipient under the Federal award. Therefore, no financial reporting is required. This does not 
absolve the recipient or subrecipient from the record retention requirements contained in§§ 
200.334through200.338; nor does it absolve the recipient or subrecipient of the responsibilities of 
making records available for review during an audit. See§ 200.101(b)(5)(i). Payments must be 
based on meeting specific requirements of the Federal award. Some of the ways in which the 
Federal award may be paid include, but are not limited to: 

(i) In several partial payments. The amount of each payment as well as the “milestone” or event 
triggering the payment, should be agreed to in advance and included in the Federal award; 

(ii) On a unit price basis. The defined unit(s) or price(s) should be agreed to in advance and 
included in the Federal award; or 

(iii) In one payment at the completion of the Federal award. 
(2) A fixed amount award must not be used in programs that require cost sharing. 
(3) A fixed amount award may generate and use program income in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the Federal award; however, the requirements of§ 200.307do not apply. 

(4) At the end of a fixed amount award, the recipient or subrecipient must certify in writing to the Federal 
agency or pass-through entity that the project was completed as agreed to in the Federal award, or 
identify those activities that were not completed, and that all expenditures were incurred in 
accordance with§ 200.403. When the required activities were not carried out, including fixed amount 
awards paid on a unit price basis under200.201(b)(1)(ii), the amount of the Federal award must be 
reduced by the amount that reflects the activities that were not completed in accordance with the 
Federal award. When the required activities were completed in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient is entitled to any unexpended funds. 

(5) Periodic reports may be established for fixed amount awards. 
(6) Prior approval requirements that apply to fixed amount awards are§ 200.308(f)(paragraphs 1 
through 3, 6 through 8, and 10) and§ 200.333. 

§ 200.202 Program planning and design. 

(a) The Federal agency must design a program and create an Assistance Listing before announcing the 
Notice of Funding Opportunity. A program must be designed:

2 CFR 200.202(a)(1) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) With clear goals and objectives that provide meaningful results and be consistent with the Federal 
authorizing legislation of the program; 

(2) To measure performance based on the goals and objectives developed during program planning and 
design. Performance measures may differ depending on the type of program. See§ 200.301for 
more information on performance measurement; 

(3) To align with the strategic goals and objectives within the Federal agency's performance plan and 
support the Federal agency's performance measurement, management, customer service initiatives, 
and reporting as required by Part 6 of OMB Circular A-11 (Preparation, Submission, and Execution of 
the Budget); 

(4) To align with the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (Pub. L. 114-264) as well as 
the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Pub. L. 115-435), as applicable; and 

(5) To encourage applicants to engage, when practicable, during the design phase, members of the 
community that will benefit from or be impacted by a program. 

(b) Federal agencies should develop programs in consultation with communities benefiting from or impacted 
by the program. In addition, Federal agencies should consider available data, evidence, and evaluation 
results from past programs and make every effort to extend eligibility requirements to all potential 
applicants. Federal agencies are encouraged to coordinate with other agencies during program planning 
and design, particularly when the goals and objectives of a program or project align with those of other 
agencies. 

§ 200.203 Requirement to provide public notice of Federal financial assistance programs. 

(a) The Federal agency must maintain an accurate list of Federal programs in the Assistance Listings 
maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA) atSAM.gov. 

(1) The Assistance Listings is the comprehensive government-wide source of Federal financial 
assistance program information produced by the executive branch of the Federal Government. 

(2) The information that the Federal agency must submit to GSA for approval by OMB is listed in 
paragraph (b). GSA must prescribe the format for the submission in coordination with OMB. 

(3) The Federal agency must assign the appropriate Assistance Listing before making the Federal award 
unless exigent circumstances require otherwise (for example, timing requirements imposed by a 
Federal statute). 

(b) To the extent practicable, the Federal agency must create, update, and manage Assistance Listing entries 
based on the authorizing statute for the program and comply with additional guidance provided by GSA 
(in consultation with OMB) to ensure consistent and accurate information is available to prospective 
applicants. Assistance Listings should be communicated to the public in plain language. Accordingly, 
Federal agencies must submit the following information to GSA when creating an Assistance Listing: 

(1) Program Description, Purpose, Goals, and Measurement.A brief summary of the statutory or 
regulatory requirements of the program and its intended outcome. Where appropriate, the program 
description, purpose, goals, and performance measurement should align with the strategic goals and 
objectives within the Federal agency's performance plan and should support the Federal agency's 
performance measurement, management, customer experience initiatives, and reporting as required 
by Part 6 of OMB Circular A-11;

associated funding identifier (for example, Treasury Account Symbol(s)); 

(5) General eligibility requirements.The statutory, regulatory, or other eligibility factors or considerations 
that determine the applicant's qualification for Federal awards under the program (for example, type 
of recipient); and 

(6) Applicability of Single Audit Requirements.Applicability of Single Audit Requirements as required by 
subpart F. 

§ 200.204 Notices of funding opportunities. 

The Federal agency must announce specific funding opportunities for Federal financial assistance that will be 
openly competed. The term openly competed means opportunities that are not directed to one or more specifically 
identified applicants. To the extent possible, the Federal agency should communicate opportunities to the public in 
plain language to ensure the announcement is accessible to diverse communities of eligible applicants, including 
underserved communities. The Federal agency should also make efforts to limit the length and complexity of the 
announcement and only include the information that is necessary for the effective communication of the program 
objectives. Federal agencies may offer pre-application technical assistance or provide clarifying information for 
funding opportunities. However, Federal agencies must ensure these resources are made accessible and widely 
available to all potential applicants (for example, by posting answers to questions and requests onGrants.gov). The 
Federal agency should make every effort to identify in the NOFO all eligible applicants (for example, different types 
of nonprofit organizations such as labor unions and tribal organizations). The following information must be 
provided in a public notice: 

(a) Summary information in notices of funding opportunities.The Federal agency must display the following 
information onGrants.gov,in a location preceding the full text of the announcement: 

(1) Federal Agency Name; 
(2) Funding Opportunity Title; 
(3) Announcement Type (whether the funding opportunity is the initial announcement or a modification 
of a previously announced opportunity); 

(4) Funding Opportunity Number (required, if the Federal agency has assigned a number to the funding 
opportunity announcement); 

(5) Assistance Listing Number(s); 
(6) Funding Details. To the extent appropriate, the total amount of funding that the Federal agency 
expects to award, the anticipated number of awards, and the expected dollar values of individual 
awards, which may be a range or average; 

(7) Key Dates. Key dates include due dates for submitting applications or Executive Order 12372 
submissions, as well as for any letters of intent or preapplications. For any announcement issued 
before a program's application materials are available, key dates also include the date on which

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

those materials will be released; and any other additional information, as deemed applicable by the 
Federal agency. If possible, the Federal agency should provide an anticipated award date. If the 
NOFO states that applications will be evaluated on a “rolling” basis (that is, at different points during 
a specified period of time), the Federal agency should provide an estimate of the time needed to 
process an application and notify the applicant of the Federal agency's decision; 

(8) Executive Summary. A brief description that is written in plain language and summarizes the goals 
and objectives of the program, the target audience, and eligible applicants. The text of the executive 
summary should not exceed 500 words; and 

(9) Agency contact information. 
(b) Availability period.The Federal agency should make all funding opportunities available for application for 
at least 60 calendar days. However, the Federal agency may modify the availability period of an 
opportunity as needed. For example, extending the period may be necessary to provide technical 
assistance to an applicant pool that was not anticipated when the announcement was made or has less 
experience with applying for Federal financial assistance. The Federal agency may also determine that an 
availability period of less than 60 days is sufficient for a particular funding opportunity. However, no 
funding opportunity should be available for less than 30 calendar days unless the Federal agency 
determines that exigent circumstances justify this. 

(c) Full text of funding opportunities. 
(1) The Federal agency must include the information in Appendix I for every funding opportunity. 
(2) Federal agencies should ensure that funding opportunities are written using plain language. To the 
extent possible Federal agencies must streamline opportunities to make them accessible, 
particularly for funding opportunities that are new, targeted to underserved communities, or intended 
to reach inexperienced applicants. 

(3) To reduce application burden, Federal agencies should consider whether programmatic or 
administrative requirements specific to the agency, program, or funding opportunity must be met at 
the time of application or as a requirement of receiving a Federal award. 

§ 200.205 Federal agency review of merit of proposals. 

Unless prohibited by Federal statute, the Federal agency must design and execute a merit review process of 
applications for discretionary Federal awards. The objective of a merit review process is to select recipients most 
likely to be successful in delivering results based on the program objectives as outlined in section§ 200.202. A 
merit review is an objective process of evaluating Federal award applications in accordance with the written 
standards of the Federal agency. These standards should identify the number of people the agency requires to 
participate in the merit review process and provide opportunities for a diverse group of participants, including those 
representing underserved communities. The merit review process explained in this section must be described or 
incorporated by reference in the applicable funding opportunity. See appendix I to this part. See also§ 200.204. The 
Federal agency must also periodically review its merit review process. 

§ 200.206 Federal agency review of risk posed by applicants. 

(a) Review of OMB-designated repositories of government-wide data.

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.206(a)(1) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) Prior to making a Federal award, the Federal agency is required to review eligibility information for 
applicants and financial integrity information for applicants available in OMB-designated databases 
per the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 116-117), the “Do Not Pay Initiative” (31 
U.S.C. 3354), and41 U.S.C. 2313. 

(2) The Federal agency is required to review the responsibility and qualification records available in the 
non-public segment of the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) prior to making a Federal 
award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined at 
41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. See41 U.S.C. 2313. The Federal agency must 
consider all of the information available inSAM.govwith regard to the applicant and any immediate 
highest-level owner, predecessor (meaning, an organization that is replaced by a successor), or 
subsidiary, identified for that applicant inSAM.gov. SeePublic Law 112-239, National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013;41 U.S.C. 2313(d). The information in the system for a prior 
recipient of a Federal award must demonstrate a satisfactory record of administering programs or 
activities under Federal financial assistance or procurement awards, and integrity and business 
ethics. The Federal agency may make a Federal award to a recipient that does not fully meet these 
standards if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the Federal award under 
consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the risk associated 
with the recipient in accordance with§ 200.208. 

(b) Risk Assessment. 
(1) The Federal agency must establish and maintain policies and procedures for conducting a risk 
assessment to evaluate the risks posed by applicants before issuing Federal awards. This 
assessment helps identify risks that may affect the advancement toward or the achievement of a 
project's goals and objectives. Risk assessments assist Federal managers in determining 
appropriate resources and time to devote to project oversight and monitor recipient progress. This 
assessment may incorporate elements such as the quality of the application, award amount, risk 
associated with the program, cybersecurity risks, fraud risks, and impacts on local jobs and the 
community. If the Federal agency determines that the Federal award will be made, specific 
conditions that address the assessed risk may be implemented in the Federal award. The risk 
criteria to be evaluated must be described in the announcement of the funding opportunity 
described in§ 200.204. 

(2) In evaluating risks posed by applicants, the Federal agency should consider the following items: 
(i) Financial stability.The applicant's record of effectively managing financial risks, assets, and 
resources; 

(ii) Management systems and standards.Quality of management systems and ability to meet the 
management standards prescribed in this part; 

(iii) History of performance.The applicant's record of managing previous and current Federal 
awards, including compliance with reporting requirements and conformance to the terms and 
conditions of Federal awards, if applicable; 

(iv) Audit reports and findings.Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F or the 
reports and findings of any other available audits, if applicable; and 

(v) Ability to effectively implement requirements.The applicant's ability to effectively implement 
statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on recipients of Federal awards.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(c) Adjustments to the Risk Assessment.The Federal agency may modify the risk assessment at any time 
during the period of performance, which may justify changes to the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award. See§ 200.208. 

(d) Suspension and debarment compliance.The Federal agency must comply with the government-wide 
suspension and debarment guidance in2 CFR part 180and individual Federal agency suspension and 
debarment requirements intitle 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Federal agencies must also require 
recipients to comply with these requirements. These requirements restrict making Federal awards, 
subawards, and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from 
receiving Federal awards or participating in Federal awards. 

§ 200.207 Standard application requirements. 

(a) Paperwork clearances.The Federal agency may only use application information collections approved by 
OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and OMB's implementing regulations in5 CFR part 1320 
and in alignment with OMB-approved, government-wide data elements available from the OMB-
designated standards lead. Examples of application information collections approved by OMB include the 
Standard Forms 424 (SF-424), which is available onGrants.gov, and the Biographical Sketch Common 
Form (OMB Control Number 3145-0279), which Federal agencies should use to collect biographical 
sketches and other disclosure information from award applicants. OMB will authorize additional 
information collections only on a limited basis and consistent with these requirements. 

(b) Information collection.The Federal agency may inform applicants that they do not need to provide certain 
information already being collected through other means. 

§ 200.208 Specific conditions. 

(a) Federal agencies are responsible for ensuring that specific Federal award conditions and performance 
expectations are consistent with the program design (See§ 200.202and§ 200.301). 

(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity may adjust specific conditions in the Federal award based on 
an analysis of the following factors: 

(1) Review of OMB-designated repositories of government-wide data (for example,SAM.gov) or review 
of its risk assessment (See§ 200.206); 

(2) The recipient's or subrecipient's history of compliance with the terms and conditions of Federal 
awards; 

(3) The recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet expected performance goals as described in§ 
200.211; or 

(4) A determination of whether a recipient or subrecipient has inadequate financial capability to perform 
the Federal award. 

(c) Specific conditions may include the following: 
(1) Requiring payments as reimbursements rather than advance payments; 
(2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt of evidence of acceptable 
performance; 

(3) Requiring additional or more detailed financial reports; 
(4) Requiring additional project monitoring;

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(5) Requiring the recipient or subrecipient to obtain technical or management assistance; or 
(6) Establishing additional prior approvals. 
(d) Prior to imposing specific conditions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must notify the recipient 
or subrecipient as to: 

(1) The nature of the specific condition(s); 
(2) The reason why the specific condition(s) is being imposed; 
(3) The nature of the action needed to remove the specific condition(s); 
(4) The time allowed for completing the actions; and 
(5) The method for requesting the Federal agency or pass-through entity to reconsider imposing a 
specific condition. 

(e) Any specific conditions must be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been 
satisfied. 

§ 200.209 Certifications and representations. 

Unless prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, or regulations, a Federal agency or pass-through entity 
is authorized to require a recipient to submit annual certifications and representations. Submission may be required 
more frequently if a recipient or subrecipient fails to meet a requirement of a Federal award. When a recipient is 
provided an exception to the requirements of2 CFR 25.110, the recipient must submit the appropriate assurance 
form (for example, SF-424B). 

§ 200.210 Pre-award costs. 

For requirements on costs incurred by the applicant prior to the start date of the period of performance of the 
Federal award, see§ 200.458. 

§ 200.211 Information contained in a Federal award. 

The Federal award must include the following information: 

(a) Federal award performance goals.Where applicable, performance goals, indicators, targets, and baseline 
data must be included in the Federal award. The Federal agency must also specify in the terms and 
conditions of the Federal award how performance will be assessed, including the timing and scope of 
expected performance. See§§ 200.202and200.301for more information on Federal award performance 
goals. 

(b) General Federal award information.The Federal agency must include the following information in each 
Federal award: 

(1) Recipient Name (which must match the name associated with its unique entity identifier as defined 
at2 CFR 25.400); 

(2) Recipient's Unique Entity Identifier; 
(3) Unique Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN);

(4) The Federal agency must maintain an archive of previous versions of the general terms and 
conditions, with effective dates, for use by a recipient, auditors, or others. The archive should be 
located on the Federal agency's website in the same place where current terms and conditions are 
available. 

(d) Federal award specific terms and conditions.The Federal agency must include in each Federal award any 
specific terms and conditions that are in addition to the general terms and conditions. See also§ 

200.208. For loan and loan guarantee programs, the Federal agency must specify whether or not the 
Federal award has continuing compliance requirements. Whenever practicable, these specific terms and 
conditions should also be available on the Federal agency's website and in notices of funding 
opportunities (as outlined in§ 200.204). 
(e) Federal agency requirements.Any other information required by the Federal agency. 
§ 200.212 Public access to Federal award information.

under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), or controlled unclassified information pursuant to 
Executive Order 13556. 

§ 200.213 Reporting a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal award. 

(a) The Federal agency must report inSAM.govif it does not make a Federal award to an applicant because it 
determines that the applicant does not meet the minimum qualification standards as described in§ 
200.206(a)(2). The Federal agency must report that determination only if all of the following apply: 

(1) The only basis for the determination is the applicant's prior record of performance on administering 
Federal awards or its record of integrity and business ethics, as described in§ 200.206(a)(2) 
(meaning, the applicant was determined to be qualified based on all factors other than those two 
standards); and 

(2) The total Federal share of the Federal award was expected to exceed the simplified acquisition 
threshold over the period of performance. 

(b) The Federal agency is not required to report a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal 
award if they issue the Federal award in accordance with the requirements of§ 200.208.

2 CFR 200.213(c)(1) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) The determination was made and reported inSAM.gov. The notification from the Federal agency to 
the applicant should also provide a brief explanation for the determination; 

(2) The information will be kept in the system for a period of five years from the date of the 
determination and then archived (See section 872 ofPublic Law 110-417, as amended, codified at41 
U.S.C. 2313); 

(3) Each Federal agency that considers making a Federal award to the applicant during that five-year 
period will consider that information in determining the applicant's qualification to receive a Federal 
award when the total Federal share of a Federal award is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold over the period of performance; 

(4) The applicant may review the responsibility and qualification records accessible inSAM.govand 
comment on any information the system contains about the applicant; and 

(5) Federal agencies must consider the applicant's comments in determining whether the applicant is 
qualified for a future Federal award. 

(d) If the Federal agency enters information intoSAM.govabout a determination that an applicant is not 
qualified for a Federal award and subsequently: 

(1) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal agency must correct the information in 
the system within three business days; and 

(2) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal agencies, the Federal 
agency should amend the information in the system within 30 days. 

(e) Federal agencies must not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public 
segment of the responsibility and qualification records that is covered by a disclosure exemption under 
the Freedom of Information Act. If a recipient asserts within seven calendar days to a Federal agency that 
some or all of the publicly available information is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom 
of Information Act, the Federal agency that posted the information must remove the posting within seven 
calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, the Federal agency 
must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures. 

§ 200.214 Suspension and debarment. 

Recipients and subrecipients are subject to the nonprocurement debarment and suspension regulations 
implementing Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, as well as2 CFR part 180. The regulations in2 CFR part 180 
restrict making Federal awards, subawards, and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended, or 
otherwise excluded from receiving or participating in Federal awards. 

§ 200.215 Never contract with the enemy. 

Federal agencies, recipients, and subrecipients are subject to the guidance implementing Never Contract with the 
Enemy in2 CFR part 183. The guidance in2 CFR part 183affects covered contracts, grants, and cooperative

§ 200.216 Prohibition on certain telecommunications and video surveillance equipment or 
services. 

(a) Recipients and subrecipients are prohibited from obligating or expending loan or grant funds to: 
(1) Procure or obtain covered telecommunications equipment or services; 
(2) Extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain covered telecommunications equipment or services; 
or 

(3) Enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure or obtain covered 
telecommunications equipment or services. 

(b) As described in section 889 ofPublic Law 115-232, “covered telecommunications equipment or services” 
means any of the following: 

(1) Telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company or ZTE Corporation (or 
any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities); 

(2) For the purpose of public safety, security of government facilities, physical security surveillance of 
critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes, video surveillance and 
telecommunications equipment produced by Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou 
Hikvision Digital Technology Company, or Dahua Technology Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate 
of such entities); 

(3) Telecommunications or video surveillance services provided by such entities or using such 
equipment; 

(4) Telecommunications or video surveillance equipment or services produced or provided by an entity 
that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the National Intelligence or the

§ 200.217 Whistleblower protections. 

An employee of a recipient or subrecipient must not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as 
a reprisal for disclosing to a person or body described inparagraph (a)(2) of 41 U.S.C. 4712information that the 
employee reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal contract or grant, a gross waste of 
Federal funds, an abuse of authority relating to a Federal contract or grant, a substantial and specific danger to 
public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a Federal contract (including the 
competition for or negotiation of a contract) or grant. The recipient and subrecipient must inform their employees in 
writing of employee whistleblower rights and protections under41 U.S.C. 4712. See statutory requirements for 
whistleblower protections at10 U.S.C. 4701,41 U.S.C. 4712,41 U.S.C. 4304, and10 U.S.C. 4310. 

Subpart D—Post Federal Award Requirements 

§ 200.300 Statutory and national policy requirements. 

(a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must manage and administer the Federal award in a manner so 
as to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full 
accordance with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations—including provisions 
protecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, and the environment, and those prohibiting 
discrimination—and the requirements of this part. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must 
communicate to a recipient or subrecipient all relevant requirements, including those contained in general 
appropriations provisions, and incorporate them directly or by reference in the terms and conditions of the 
Federal award. 

(b) In administering Federal awards that are subject to a Federal statute prohibiting discrimination based on 
sex, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must ensure that the award is administered in a way that 
does not unlawfully discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity if the statute's prohibition 
on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity 
consistent with the Supreme Court's reasoning inBostockv.Clayton County,140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). 

(c) In administering awards in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, the Federal agency must take account 
of the heightened constitutional scrutiny that may apply under the Constitution's Equal Protection 
guarantee for government action that provides differential treatment based on protected characteristics. 

§ 200.301 Performance measurement. 

(a) The Federal agency must measure the recipient's performance to show achievement of program goals 
and objectives, share lessons learned, improve program outcomes, and foster the adoption of promising 
practices. The Federal agency should establish program goals and objectives during program planning 
and design (see§ 200.202). The Federal agency should clearly communicate the specific program goals 
and objectives in the Federal award, including how the Federal agency will measure the achievement of 
the goals and objectives, the expected timeline, and information on how the recipient must report the 
achievement of program goals and objectives. The Federal agency should also clearly communicate in 
the Federal award any expected outcomes (such as outputs, service performance, or public impacts of 
any of these), indicators, targets, baseline data, or data collections that the recipient is responsible for 
measuring and reporting. The Federal agency must ensure all requirements for measuring performance 
align with the Federal agency's strategic goals, strategic objectives, or performance goals relevant to a 
program (see OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget Part 6).

2 CFR 200.301(b) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(b) When establishing performance reporting frequency and content, the Federal agency should consider 
what information will be necessary to measure the recipient's progress, to identify promising practices of 
recipients, and build the evidence upon which the Federal agency makes program and performance 
decisions. The Federal agency should not require additional information that is not necessary for 
measuring program performance and evaluation. See§ 200.329for more information on reporting 
program performance. 

(c) The Federal agency should also specify in the Federal award any requirements of the recipients' 
participation in federally funded evaluations. 

§ 200.302 Financial management. 

(a) Each State must expend and account for the Federal award in accordance with State laws and procedures 
for expending and accounting for the State's funds. All recipient and subrecipient financial management 
systems, including records documenting compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions of the Federal award, must be sufficient to permit the preparation of reports required by the 
terms and conditions; and tracking expenditures to establish that funds have been used in accordance 
with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See§ 200.450. 

(b) The recipient's and subrecipient's financial management system must provide for the following (see§§ 
200.334,200.335,200.336, and200.337): 

(1) Identification of all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which 
they were received. Federal program and Federal award identification must include, as applicable, 
the Assistance Listings title and number, Federal award identification number, year the Federal award 
was issued, and name of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. 

(2) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each Federal award or program 
in accordance with the reporting requirements in§§ 200.328and200.329. When a Federal agency 
or pass-through entity requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient or subrecipient that 
maintains its records other than on an accrual basis, the recipient or subrecipient must not be 
required to establish an accrual accounting system. This recipient or subrecipient may develop 
accrual data for its reports based on an analysis of the documentation on hand. 

(3) Maintaining records that sufficiently identify the amount, source, and expenditure of Federal funds 
for Federal awards. These records must contain information necessary to identify Federal awards, 
authorizations, financial obligations, unobligated balances, as well as assets, expenditures, income, 
and interest. All records must be supported by source documentation. 

(4) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property, and assets. The recipient or 
subrecipient must safeguard all assets and ensure they are used solely for authorized purposes. See 
§ 200.303. 

(5) Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award. 
(6) Written procedures to implement the requirements of§ 200.305. 
(7) Written procedures for determining the allowability of costs in accordance with subpart E and the 
terms and conditions of the Federal award. 

§ 200.303 Internal controls. 

The recipient and subrecipient must:

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.303(a) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(a) Establish, document, and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides 
reasonable assurance that the recipient or subrecipient is managing the Federal award in compliance with 
Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. These internal controls 
should align with the guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government” issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

(b) Comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the 
Federal award. 

(c) Evaluate and monitor the recipient's or subrecipient's compliance with statutes, regulations, and the terms 
and conditions of Federal awards. 

(d) Take prompt action when instances of noncompliance are identified. 
(e) Take reasonable cybersecurity and other measures to safeguard information including protected 
personally identifiable information (PII) and other types of information. This also includes information the 
Federal agency or pass-through entity designates as sensitive or other information the recipient or 
subrecipient considers sensitive and is consistent with applicable Federal, State, local, and tribal laws 
regarding privacy and responsibility over confidentiality. 

§ 200.304 Bonds. 

(a) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, 
the Federal agency may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance 
requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 

(b) The Federal agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks coverage to 
protect the interest of the Federal Government. 

(c) Where bonds, insurance, or both are required in the situations described above, the bonds and insurance 
must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority issued by the U.S. Department of 
Treasury (see31 CFR part 223). 

§ 200.305 Federal payment. 

(a) Payments for States.Payments for States are governed by Treasury-State Cash Management 
Improvement Act (CMIA) agreements and default procedures codified at31 CFR part 205and Treasury 
Financial Manual (TFM) 4A-2000, “Overall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies.” 

(b) Payments for recipients and subrecipients other than States.For recipients and subrecipients other than 
States, payment methods must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the 
Federal agency or the pass-through entity and the disbursement of funds by the recipient or subrecipient 
regardless of whether the payment is made by electronic funds transfer or by other means. See§ 
200.302(b)(6). Except as noted in this part, the Federal agency must require recipients to use only OMB-
approved, government-wide information collections to request payment. 

(1) The recipient or subrecipient must be paid in advance, provided it maintains or demonstrates the 
willingness to maintain both written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient or subrecipient, and financial management 
systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in this part. 
Advance payments to a recipient or subrecipient must be limited to the minimum amounts needed 
and be timed with actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient or subrecipient in carrying 

2 CFR 200.305(b)(1) (enhanced display) page 44 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.305(b)(2) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of advance payments 
must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient or 
subrecipient for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect 
costs. The recipient or subrecipient must make timely payments to contractors in accordance with 
the contract provisions. 

(2) Whenever possible, advance payment requests by the recipient or subrecipient must be consolidated 
to cover anticipated cash needs for all Federal awards received by the recipient from the awarding 
Federal agency or pass-through entity. 

(i) Advance payment mechanisms must comply with31 CFR part 208and include, but are not 
limited to, Treasury checks and electronic funds transfers. 

(ii) Recipients and subrecipients must be authorized to submit payment requests as often as 
necessary when electronic fund transfers are used or at least monthly when electronic 
transfers are not used. See Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r). 

(3) Reimbursement is preferred when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met, when the 
Federal agency or pass-through entity sets a specific condition per§ 200.208, when requested by 
the recipient or subrecipient, when a Federal award is for construction, or when a significant portion 
of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans and 
the Federal award constitutes a minor portion of the project. When the reimbursement method is 
used, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must make payment within 30 calendar days after 
receipt of the payment request unless the Federal agency or pass-through entity reasonably believes 
the request to be improper. 

(4) If the recipient or subrecipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal 
agency or pass-through entity has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the 
recipient or subrecipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal agency or pass-through entity 
may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal agency or 
pass-through entity must advance cash payments to the recipient or subrecipient to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally aligned to the recipient's or 
subrecipient's disbursing cycle. After that, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must reimburse 
the recipient or subrecipient for its actual cash disbursements. Use of the working capital advance 
payment method requires that the pass-through entity provide timely advance payments to any 
subrecipients to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. The pass-through entity must 
not use the working capital advance method of payment if the reason for using this method is the 
unwillingness or inability of the pass-through entity to provide timely advance payments to the 
subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. 

(5) If available, the recipient or subrecipient must disburse funds available from program income 
(including repayments to a revolving fund), rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, 
and interest earned on Federal funds before requesting additional cash payments. 

(6) Payments for allowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance 
unless required by Federal statute, regulations, or in one of the following instances: 

(i) The recipient or subrecipient has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award; or

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.305(b)(6)(ii) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(ii) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB 
Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.” Under such 
conditions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may, after providing reasonable notice, 
withhold payments to the recipient or subrecipient for financial obligations incurred after a 
specified date until the conditions are corrected or the debt is repaid to the Federal 
Government. 

(7) A payment withheld for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award must be 
released to the recipient or subrecipient upon subsequent compliance. When a Federal award is 
suspended, payment adjustments must be made in accordance with§ 200.343. 

(8) A payment must not be made to a recipient or subrecipient for amounts that the recipient or 
subrecipient withholds from contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payment must 
be made when the recipient or subrecipient disburses the withheld funds to the contractors or to 
escrow accounts established to ensure satisfactory completion of work. 

(9) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not require separate depository accounts for funds 
provided to the recipient or subrecipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories. 
However, the recipient or subrecipient must be able to account for all Federal funds received, 
obligated, and expended. 

(10) Advance payments of Federal funds must be deposited and maintained in insured accounts 
whenever possible. 

(11) The recipient or subrecipient must maintain advance payments of Federal funds in interest-bearing 
accounts unless one of the following applies: 

(i) The recipient or subrecipient receives less than $250,000 in Federal funding per year; 
(ii) The best available interest-bearing account would not reasonably be expected to earn interest 
in excess of $500 per year on Federal cash balances; 

(iii) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be 
feasible with the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources; 

(iv) A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest-bearing accounts; or 
(v) An interest-bearing account is not readily accessible (for example, due to public or political 
unrest in a foreign country). 

(12) The recipient or subrecipient may retain up to $500 per year of interest earned on Federal funds to 
use for administrative expenses of the recipient or subrecipient. Any additional interest earned on 
Federal funds must be returned annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment 
Management System (PMS) through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network or a 
Fedwire Funds Service payment. All interest in excess of $500 per year must be returned to PMS 
regardless of whether the recipient or subrecipient was paid through PMS. Instructions for returning 
interest can be found athttps://pms.psc.gov/grant-recipients/returning-funds-interest.html. 

(13) All other Federal funds must be returned to the payment system of the Federal agency. Returns 
should follow the instructions provided by the Federal agency. All returns to PMS should follow the 
instructions provided athttps://pms.psc.gov/grant-recipients/returning-funds-interest.html.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 
§ 200.306 Cost sharing. 

(a) Voluntary committed cost sharing is not expected under Federal research grants. The Federal agency may 
not use voluntary committed cost sharing as a factor during the merit review of applications or proposals 
for Federal research grants unless authorized by Federal statutes or agency regulations and specified in 
the notice of funding opportunity. Federal agencies are also discouraged from using voluntary committed 
cost sharing as a factor during the merit review of applications for other Federal financial assistance 
programs. If voluntary committed cost sharing is used for this purpose for other programs, the notice of 
funding opportunity must specify how an applicant's proposed cost sharing will be considered. See§§ 
200.414,200.204, and Appendix I. 

(b) For all Federal awards, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must accept any cost sharing funds 
(including cash and third-party in-kind contributions, and also including funds committed by the recipient, 
subrecipient, or third parties) as part of the recipient's or subrecipient's contributions to a program when 
the funds: 

(1) Are verifiable in the recipient's or subrecipient's records; 
(2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federal award; 
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for achieving the objectives of the Federal award; 
(4) Are allowable under subpart E; 
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, except where the program's 
Federal authorizing statute specifically provides that Federal funds made available for the program 
can be applied to cost sharing requirements of other Federal programs; 

(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal agency; and 
(7) Conform to other applicable provisions of this part. 
(c) Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing, may be included as part of cost 
sharing with the prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. Unrecovered indirect cost 
means the difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which could 
have been charged to the Federal award under the recipient's or subrecipient's approved indirect cost rate. 

(d) Values for recipient or subrecipient contributions of services and property must be established in 
accordance with the cost principles in subpart E. When a Federal agency or pass-through entity 
authorizes the recipient or subrecipient to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition 
projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing must be the lesser of 
paragraph (d)(1) or (2) below. 

(1) The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's or subrecipient's accounting 
records at the time of donation. 

(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal agency or 
pass-through may approve using the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it 
exceeds the value described in paragraph (d)(1) at the time of donation. 

(e) Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other 
labor may be counted as cost sharing if the service is necessary for the program. Rates for third-party 
volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work by the recipient or subrecipient. 
When the required skills are not found in the recipient's or subrecipient's workforce, rates must be 

2 CFR 200.306(e) (enhanced display) page 47 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.306(f) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market where the recipient or subrecipient 
competes for the services involved. In either case, fringe benefits that are allowable, allocable, and 
reasonable may be included in the valuation. 

(f) When a third-party organization furnishes the services of an employee, these services must be valued at 
the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits that is reasonable, necessary, 
allocable, and otherwise allowable, and indirect costs at either the third-party organization's approved 
federally-negotiated indirect cost rate or, a rate in accordance with§ 200.414(d)provided these services 
employ the same skill(s) for which the employee is normally paid. Where donated services are treated as 
indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donated services so that reimbursement 
for the donated services will not be made. 

(g) Donated property from third parties may include items such as equipment, office supplies, laboratory 
supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. The assessed value of donated property included as cost 
sharing must not exceed the property's fair market value at the time of the donation. 

(h) The method used for determining the value of donated equipment, buildings, and land for which title 
passes to the recipient or subrecipient may differ according to the following: 

(1) If the purpose of the Federal award is to assist the recipient or subrecipient in acquiring equipment, 
buildings, or land, the aggregate value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing. 

(2) If the purpose of the Federal award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, 
buildings, or land, only depreciation charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the 
fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be 
allowed if provided in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See§ 200.420. 

(i) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the accounting policies of the 
recipient or subrecipient with the following qualifications: 

(1) The value of donated land and buildings must not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation 
to the recipient or subrecipient as established by an independent appraiser (for example, certified 
real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a 
responsible official of the recipient or subrecipient as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance 
and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) except as 
provided in the implementing regulations at49 CFR part 24, “Uniform Relocation Assistance And 
Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-Assisted Programs.” 

(2) The value of donated equipment must not exceed the fair market value at the time of donation. 
(3) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as 
established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned 
building in the same locality. 

(4) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value. 
(j) The fair market value of third-party in-kind contributions must be documented and, to the extent feasible, 
supported by the same methods used internally by the recipient or subrecipient. 

(k) For institutions of higher education (IHE), voluntary uncommitted cost sharing should be treated 
differently from mandatory or voluntary committed cost sharing. Voluntary uncommitted cost sharing 
should not be included in the organized research base for computing the indirect cost rate or reflected in 
any allocation of indirect costs. Voluntary uncommitted cost sharing includes faculty-donated additional

Costs. 

§ 200.307 Program income. 

(a) General.The recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to earn income to defray program costs when 
appropriate. Program income must be used for the original purpose of the Federal award. Program 
income earned during the period of performance may only be used for costs incurred during the period of 
performance or allowable closeout costs. See§ 200.472(b). Program income must be expended prior to 
requesting additional Federal funds. Program income exceeding amounts specified in the Federal award 
may be added to or deducted from the total allowable costs in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of the Federal award. 

(b) Use of program income.There are three methods of applying program income: deduction; addition; and 
cost-sharing. The Federal agency should specify what program income method(s) will be used in the 
terms and conditions of the Federal award. The deduction method will be used if the Federal agency does 
not specify a method for applying program income. When no program income method is specified in the 
Federal award, prior approval is required to use the addition or cost sharing methods. However, the 
addition method will be used when no method is specified for awards made to institutions of higher 
education (IHE) and nonprofit research institutions. In specifying alternatives to the deduction and 
addition methods, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned by the recipient and 
income earned by subrecipients as well as between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. 

(1) Deduction.Program income is deducted from the total allowable costs, reducing the overall total 
amount of the Federal award. 

(2) Addition.Program income is added to the total allowable costs, increasing the overall total amount 
of the Federal award. 

(3) Cost sharing.Program income is used to meet the Federal award's cost sharing requirement. 
(c) Income after the period of performance.There are no requirements governing the disposition of program 
income earned after the end of the period of performance of the Federal award unless stipulated in the 
Federal agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The Federal agency may 
negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of income earned after the end of the 
period of performance as part of the closeout process. See§ 200.344. 

(d) Cost of generating program income.If authorized by Federal regulations or the Federal award, costs 
incidental to generating program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award. 

(e) Not considered program income.The following are not considered program income unless specified in 
Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award: 

(1) Governmental revenues.Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and similar revenues the recipient 
or subrecipient raised. 

(2) Property.Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies. The proceeds must be 
handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards of§§ 200.311,200.313, 
200.314, or as explicitly identified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the 
Federal award.

§ 200.308 Revision of budget and program plans. 

(a) Approved budget in general.The approved budget for the Federal award summarizes the financial aspects 
of the project or program as approved during the Federal award process. It may include the Federal share 
and non-Federal share or only the Federal share, as determined by the Federal agency or pass-through 
entity. 

(b) Deviations from approved budget.The recipient or subrecipient must report deviations from the approved 
budget, project or program scope, or objective(s) in accordance with§ 200.329. The recipient or 
subrecipient must request prior approvals from the Federal agency or pass-through entity for budget and 
program plan revisions in accordance with this section. 

(c) Requesting approval for budget revisions.When requesting approval for budget revisions, the recipient or 
subrecipient must use the same format for budget information that was used in their application, except 
if the Federal agency has approved an alternative format. Alternative formats may include the use of 
electronic systems, email, or other agency-approved mechanisms that document the request. 

(d) Federal agency or pass-through entity review.The Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the 
request for budget or program plan revision and should notify the recipient or subrecipient whether the 
revisions have been approved within 30 days of receipt of the request. The Federal agency or pass-
through entity must inform the recipient or subrecipient in writing when a decision can be expected if 
more than 30 days is required for a review. 

(e) Limitation on other prior approval requirements.Unless specified in this guidance, the Federal agency must 
not impose additional prior approval requirements without OMB approval. See also§§ 200.102and 
200.407. 

(f) Revisions Requiring Prior Approval.A recipient or subrecipient must request prior written approval from 
the Federal agency or pass-through entity for the following program and budget-related reasons: 

(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget 
revision requiring prior written approval). 

(2) Change in key personnel (including employees and contractors) that are identified by name or 
position in the Federal award. 

(3) The disengagement from a project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time and 
effort devoted to the Federal award over the course of the period of performance, by the approved 
project director or principal investigator. 

(4) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal agency, of costs that require prior approval in 
accordance with subpart E as applicable. 

(5) The transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs to other budget categories. 
(6) Subaward activities not proposed in the application and approved in the Federal award. A change of 
subrecipient only requires prior approval if the Federal agency or pass-through entity includes the 
requirement in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. In general, a Federal agency or pass-
through entity should not require prior approval of a change of subrecipient unless the inclusion was 
a determining factor in the merit review or eligibility process. This requirement does not apply to 
procurement transactions for goods and services.

(7) Changes in the total approved cost-sharing amount. 
(8) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project. Before providing approval, the 
Federal agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to avoid a violation of the 
Antideficiency Act. 

(9) Transferring funds between the construction and non-construction work under a Federal award. 
(10) A no-cost extension (meaning, an extension of time that does not require the obligation of additional 
Federal funds) of the period of performance, other than any one-time extension authorized by the 
Federal agency in accordance with paragraph (g)(2). All requests for no-cost extensions should be 
submitted at least 10 calendar days before the conclusion of the period of performance. The Federal 
agency may approve multiple no-cost extensions under a Federal award if not prohibited by Federal 
statute or regulation. 

(g) Waiver of certain prior approvals.Except for the requirements listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (10), the 
Federal agency is authorized to waive other cost-related and administrative prior written approval 
requirements contained in subparts D and E. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do one or 
more of the following: 

(1) Pre-award costs.Incur project costs 90 calendar days before the Federal award date. Expenses 
incurred more than 90 calendar days before the Federal award date require prior approval of the 
Federal agency. All costs incurred before the Federal award date are at the recipient's own risk (for 
example,the Federal agency is not required to reimburse such costs if the recipient does not receive 
the Federal award or if the Federal award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such 
costs). Pre-award costs must be charged to the initial budget period of the Federal award unless 
otherwise specified by the Federal agency. See also§ 200.458. 

(2) One-time extensions.Initiate a one-time extension of the period of performance by up to 12 months 
unless one or more of the conditions outlined inparagraphs (g)(2)(i)through(iii)of this section 
apply. Prior approval is not required if a recipient is authorized in the terms and conditions of the 
Federal award to initiate a one-time extension. However, the recipient must notify the Federal agency 
in writing with the supporting justification and a revised period of performance at least 10 calendar 
days before the conclusion of the period of performance. A one-time extension may not be exercised 
for the sole purpose of using unobligated balances. This paragraph does not preclude the Federal 
agency from approving further no-cost extensions to the Federal award. One-time extensions require 
prior approval from the Federal agency when: 

(i) The terms and conditions of the Federal award prohibit the extension; 
(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds; or 
(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved scope of the project. 
(3) Unobligated Balances.Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods. 
(h) Prior approvals for research awards.The prior approval requirements for the actions described in 
paragraph (g)of this section are automatically waived for Federal awards that support research unless 
stipulated in the Federal agency's regulations or terms and conditions of the Federal award. However, onetime 
extensions require the Federal agency's prior approval when one of the conditions inparagraph (g)(2) 
of this section applies.

(i) Transfer of funds.The Federal agency must not permit a transfer of funds that would cause any Federal 
appropriation to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the appropriation. The Federal 
agency may also, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories (for example, 
personnel, travel, and supplies) or programs, functions, and activities when: 

(1) The Federal share of the Federal award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold; and 
(2) The cumulative amount of a transfer exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget, 
including cost share, as last approved by the Federal agency. 

§ 200.309 Modifications to Period of Performance. 

When the Federal agency or pass-through entity approves an extension to a Federal award, or if a recipient extends 
under§ 200.308(g)(2), the period of performance will be amended to end at the completion of the extension. If 
termination occurs, the period of performance will be amended to end upon the effective date of termination. The 
start date of a renewal award begins a new and distinct period of performance. 

PROPERTY STANDARDS 

§ 200.310 Insurance coverage. 

The recipient or subrecipient must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and 
equipment acquired or improved with Federal funds as provided to property and equipment owned by the recipient 
or subrecipient. Insurance is not required for Federally owned property unless required by the terms and conditions 
of the Federal award. 

§ 200.311 Real property. 

(a) Title.Subject to the requirements and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired or 
improved under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient. 

(b) Use.Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes or the Federal agency, real property must be used 
for the originally authorized purpose as long as it is needed for that purpose. While the property is being 
used for the originally authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must not dispose of or encumber 
its title or other interests except as provided by the Federal agency. Easements for utility, cable, and 
similar services that benefit the real property and are consistent with the authorized use are not 
considered an encumbrance. 

(c) Appraisals.When an appraisal of real property is required and obtained by the recipient or subrecipient, it 
must be conducted by an independent appraiser (for example, certified real property appraiser or General 
Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient or 
subrecipient as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act 
of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) except as provided in the implementing regulations at49 
CFR part 24, “Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-
Assisted Programs.” 

(d) Disposition.When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the recipient or 
subrecipient must obtain disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity. The 
instructions must specify one of the following disposition methods:

2 CFR 200.311(d)(1) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) Retain title after compensating the Federal agency.When the recipient or subrecipient retains title to 
the property, it must pay the Federal agency an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of 
the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase (and costs of any improvements) by 
the current fair market value of the property. However, in situations where the recipient or 
subrecipient is disposing of real property acquired or improved with the Federal award and acquiring 
replacement real property under the same Federal award, the net proceeds from the disposition may 
be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property. 

(2) Sell the property and compensate the Federal agency.When a recipient or subrecipient sells the 
property, it must pay the Federal agency an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the 
Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase (and cost of any improvements) by the 
proceeds of the sale after deducting any actual and reasonable expenses paid to sell or fix up the 
property for sale. When the Federal award has not been closed out, the net proceeds from the sale 
may be offset against the original cost of the property. When directed to sell the property, the 
recipient or subrecipient must sell the property utilizing procedures that provide for competition to 
the extent practicable and that result in the highest possible return. 

(3) Transfer title to the Federal agency or a third party designated/approved by the Federal agency.When a 
recipient or subrecipient transfers title to the property to a Federal agency or third party designated 
or approved by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient is entitled to be paid an amount 
calculated by multiplying the percentage of the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution towards the 
original purchase of the real property (and cost of any improvements) by the current fair market 
value of the property. 

§ 200.312 Federally owned and exempt property. 

(a) Title to Federally owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. The recipient or subrecipient 
must submit an inventory listing of Federally owned property in its custody to the Federal agency or pass-
through entity on an annual basis. The recipient or subrecipient must request disposition instructions 
from the Federal agency or pass-through entity upon completion of the Federal award or when the 
property is no longer needed. 

(b) If the Federal agency has no further need for the property, it must declare the property excess and report it 
for disposal to the appropriate Federal disposal authority unless the Federal agency has statutory 
authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (for example,the authority provided by the 
Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)). The Federal agency or pass-through entity must 
issue appropriate instructions to the recipient or subrecipient. 

(c) Exempt property means property acquired under the Federal award where the Federal agency has chosen 
to vest title to the property to the recipient or subrecipient without further responsibility to the Federal 
Government. The Federal agency may only exercise this option when permitted by Federal statute and set 
forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Absent statutory authority and specific terms and 
conditions of the Federal award, the title to exempt property acquired under the Federal award remains 
with the Federal Government.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(a) Title.Title to equipment acquired under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or 
subrecipient subject to the conditions of this section. This title must be a conditional title unless a Federal 
statute specifically authorizes the Federal agency to vest title in the recipient or subrecipient without 
further responsibility to the Federal Government (and the Federal agency elects to do so). A conditional 
title means a clear title is withheld by the Federal agency until conditions and requirements specified in 
the terms and conditions of a Federal award have been fulfilled. Title for equipment vested in a recipient 
or subrecipient is subject to the following conditions: 

(1) Use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project during the period of performance or 
until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project. 

(2) While the equipment is being used for the originally-authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient 
must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests without the approval of the Federal 
agency or pass-through entity. 

(3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance withparagraphs (b),(c), and(e)of this section. 
(b) General.A State must use, manage and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award in 
accordance with State laws and procedures. Indian Tribes must use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a Federal award in accordance with tribal laws and procedures. If such laws and 
procedures do not exist, Indian Tribes must follow the guidance in this section. Other recipients and 
subrecipients, including subrecipients of a State or Indian Tribe, must followparagraphs (c)through(e)of 
this section. 

(c) Use. 
(1) The recipient or subrecipient must use equipment for the project or program for which it was 
acquired and for as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported 
by the Federal award. The recipient or subrecipient must not encumber the equipment without prior 
approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. The Federal agency may require the 
submission of the applicable common forms for reporting on equipment. When no longer needed for 
the original project or program, the equipment may be used in other activities in the following order 
of priority: 

(i) Activities under other Federal awards from the Federal agency that funded the original program 
or project; then 

(ii) Activities under Federal awards from other Federal agencies. These activities include 
consolidated equipment for information technology systems. 

(2) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the 
recipient or subrecipient must also make the equipment available for use on other programs or 
projects supported by the Federal Government, provided that such use will not interfere with the 
purpose for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use of the equipment must be 
given to other programs or projects supported by the Federal agency that financed the equipment. 
Second preference must be given to programs or projects under Federal awards from other Federal 
agencies. Use for non-federally-funded projects is also permissible, provided such use will not 
interfere with the purpose for which it was originally acquired. The recipient or subrecipient should 
consider charging user fees as appropriate.

(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in§ 200.307to earn program income, the recipient or 
subrecipient must not use equipment acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee 
that is less than a private company would charge for similar services unless specifically authorized 
by Federal statute. This restriction is effective as long as the Federal Government retains an interest 
in the equipment. 

(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient or subrecipient may either trade-in or sell the 
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement equipment. 

(d) Management requirements.Regardless of whether equipment is acquired in part or its entirety under the 
Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient must manage equipment (including replacement equipment) 
utilizing procedures that meet the following requirements: 

(1) Property records must include a description of the property, a serial number or another identification 
number, the source of funding for the property (including the FAIN), the title holder, the acquisition 
date, the cost of the property, the percentage of the Federal agency contribution towards the original 
purchase, the location, use and condition of the property, and any disposition data including the date 
of disposal and sale price of the property. The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for 
maintaining and updating property records when there is a change in the status of the property. 

(2) A physical inventory of the property must be conducted, and the results must be reconciled with the 
property records at least once every two years. 

(3) A control system must be in place to ensure safeguards for preventing property loss, damage, or 
theft. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment must be investigated. The recipient or subrecipient 
must notify the Federal agency or pass-through entity of any loss, damage, or theft of equipment 
that will have an impact on the program. 

(4) Regular maintenance procedures must be in place to ensure the property is in proper working 
condition. 

(5) If the recipient or subrecipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures 
must be in place to ensure the highest possible return. 

(e) Disposition.When equipment acquired under a Federal award is no longer needed for the original project, 
program, or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency, the recipient or 
subrecipient must request disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity if 
required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Disposition of the equipment will be made as 
follows, in accordance with Federal agency or pass-through entity disposition instructions: 

(1) Equipment with a current fair market value of $10,000 or less (per unit) may be retained, sold, or 
otherwise disposed of with no further responsibility to the Federal agency or pass-through entity. 

(2) Except as provided in§ 200.312(b), or if the Federal agency or pass-through entity fails to provide 
requested disposition instructions within 120 days, items of equipment with a current fair market 
value in excess of $10,000 (per-unit) may be retained or sold by the recipient or subrecipient. 
However, the Federal agency is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the 
Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase by the current market value or proceeds 
from the sale. If the equipment is sold, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may permit the 
recipient or subrecipient to retain, from the Federal share, $1,000 of the proceeds to cover expenses 
associated with the selling and handling of the equipment.

(3) The recipient or subrecipient may transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an 
eligible third party provided that the recipient or subrecipient must be entitled to compensation for 
its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property. 

(4) In cases where a recipient or subrecipient fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the Federal 
agency or pass-through entity may direct the recipient or subrecipient to take disposition actions. 

(f) Equipment retention.When included in the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the Federal agency 
may permit the recipient to retain equipment, or authorize a pass-through entity to permit the subrecipient 
to retain equipment, with no further obligation to the Federal Government unless prohibited by Federal 
statute or regulation. 

§ 200.314 Supplies. 

See also§ 200.453. 

(a) Title to supplies acquired under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or 
subrecipient. When there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $10,000 in aggregate value 
at the end of the period of performance, and the supplies are not needed for any other Federal award, the 
recipient or subrecipient may retain or sell the unused supplies. Unused supplies means supplies that are 
in new condition, not having been used or opened before. The aggregate value of unused supplies 
consists of all supply types, not just like-item supplies. The Federal agency or pass-through entity is 
entitled to compensation in an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's 
or pass-through entity's contribution towards the cost of the original purchase(s) by the current market 
value or proceeds from the sale. If the supplies are sold, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may 
permit the recipient or subrecipient to retain, from the Federal share, $1,000 of the proceeds to cover 
expenses associated with the selling and handling of the supplies. 

(b) Unless expressly authorized by Federal statute, the recipient or subrecipient must not use supplies 
acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee that is less than a private company would 
charge for similar services. This restriction is effective as long as the Federal Government retains an 
interest in the supplies or as authorized by Federal statute. 

§ 200.315 Intangible property. 

(a) Title to intangible property acquired under a Federal award vests upon acquisition in the recipient or 
subrecipient. The recipient or subrecipient must use that intangible property for the originally authorized 
purpose and must not encumber the property without the approval of the Federal agency or pass-through 
entity. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property 
must occur in accordance with the provisions in§ 200.313(e). 

(b) To the extent permitted by law, the recipient or subrecipient may copyright any work that is subject to 
copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was acquired, under a Federal award. The Federal 
agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use 
the work for Federal purposes and to authorize others to do so. This includes the right to require 
recipients and subrecipients to make such works available through agency-designated public access 
repositories. 

(c) The recipient or subrecipient is subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, 
including government-wide regulations in37 CFR part 401. 

(d) The Federal Government has the right to:

(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data produced under a Federal award; and 
(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data for Federal purposes. 
(e) 
(1) The recipient or subrecipient must provide research data relating to published research findings 
produced under the Federal award and that were used by the Federal Government in developing an 
agency action that has the force and effect of law if requested by the Federal agency in response to 
a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. When the Federal agency obtains the research data 
solely in response to a FOIA request, the Federal agency may charge the requester a fee for the cost 
of obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect the costs incurred by the Federal agency and 
the recipient or subrecipient. This fee is in addition to any fees the Federal agency may assess under 
the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)). 

(2) Published research findings mean: 
(i) Research findings published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or 
(ii) Research findings publicly cited by a Federal agency in developing an agency action that has 
the force and effect of law. 

(3) Research data means the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community 
as necessary to validate research findings. Research data does not include any of the following: 

(i) Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or 
communications with colleagues. This “recorded” material excludes physical objects (for 
example, laboratory samples). 

(ii) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a 
researcher until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and 

(iii) Personnel, medical, and other personally identifiable information that, if disclosed, would 
constitute an invasion of personal privacy. Information that could identify a particular person in 
a research study is not considered research data. 

(f) Federal agencies should work with recipients to maximize public access to Federally funded research 
results and data in a manner that protects data providers' confidentiality, privacy, and security. Agencies 
should provide guidance to recipients to make restricted-access data available through a variety of 
mechanisms. FOIA may not be the most appropriate mechanism for providing access to intangible 
property, including Federally funded research results and data. 

§ 200.316 Property trust relationship. 

Real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved with the Federal award must be held in trust 
by the recipient or subrecipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property 
was acquired or improved. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may require the recipient or subrecipient to 
record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or 
improved with a Federal award and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.

§ 200.317 Procurements by States and Indian Tribes. 

When conducting procurement transactions under a Federal award, a State or Indian Tribe must follow the same 
policies and procedures it uses for procurements with non-Federal funds. If such policies and procedures do not 
exist, States and Indian Tribes must follow the procurement standards in§§ 200.318through200.327. In addition 
to its own policies and procedures, a State or Indian Tribe must also comply with the following procurement 
standards:§§ 200.321,200.322,200.323, and200.327. All other recipients and subrecipients, including 
subrecipients of a State or Indian Tribe, must follow the procurement standards in§§ 200.318through200.327. 

§ 200.318 General procurement standards. 

(a) Documented procurement procedures.The recipient or subrecipient must maintain and use documented 
procedures for procurement transactions under a Federal award or subaward, including for acquisition of 
property or services. These documented procurement procedures must be consistent with State, local, 
and tribal laws and regulations and the standards identified in§§ 200.317through200.327. 

(b) Oversight of contractors.Recipients and subrecipients must maintain oversight to ensure that contractors 
perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders. See also§ 200.501(h). 

(c) Conflicts of interest. 
(1) The recipient or subrecipient must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of 
interest and governing the actions of its employees engaged in the selection, award, and 
administration of contracts. No employee, officer, agent, or board member with a real or apparent 
conflict of interest may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported 
by the Federal award. A conflict of interest includes when the employee, officer, agent, or board 
member, any member of their immediate family, their partner, or an organization that employs or is 
about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible 
personal benefit from an entity considered for a contract. An employee, officer, agent, and board 
member of the recipient or subrecipient may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything 
of monetary value from contractors. However, the recipient or subrecipient may set standards for 
situations where the financial interest is not substantial or a gift is an unsolicited item of nominal 
value. The recipient's or subrecipient's standards of conduct must also provide for disciplinary 
actions to be applied for violations by its employees, officers, agents, or board members. 

(2) If the recipient or subrecipient has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a State, 
local government, or Indian Tribe, the recipient or subrecipient must also maintain written standards 
of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest mean 
that because of relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the 
recipient or subrecipient is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a 
procurement action involving a related organization. 

(d) Avoidance of unnecessary or duplicative items.The recipient's or subrecipient's procedures must avoid the 
acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or 
breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. When appropriate, an analysis should 
be made between leasing and purchasing property or equipment to determine the most economical 
approach.

(e) Procurement arrangements using strategic sourcing.When appropriate for the procurement or use of 
common or shared goods and services, recipients and subrecipients are encouraged to enter into State 
and local intergovernmental agreements or inter-entity agreements for procurement transactions. These 
or similar procurement arrangements using strategic sourcing may foster greater economy and efficiency. 
Documented procurement actions of this type (using strategic sourcing, shared services, and other 
similar procurement arrangements) will meet the competition requirements of this part. 

(f) Use of excess and surplus Federal property.The recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to use excess and 
surplus Federal property instead of purchasing new equipment and property when it is feasible and 
reduces project costs. 

(g) Use of value engineering clauses.When practical, the recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to use value 
engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable 
opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering means analyzing each contract item or task to 
ensure its essential function is provided at the overall lowest cost. 

(h) Responsible contractors.The recipient or subrecipient must award contracts only to responsible 
contractors that possess the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a 
proposed contract. The recipient or subrecipient must consider contractor integrity, public policy 
compliance, proper classification of employees (see the Fair Labor Standards Act,29 U.S.C. 201, chapter 
8), past performance record, and financial and technical resources when conducting a procurement 
transaction. See also§ 200.214. 

(i) Procurement records.The recipient or subrecipient must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of 
each procurement transaction. These records must include the rationale for the procurement method, 
contract type selection, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price. 

(j) Time-and-materials type contracts. 
(1) The recipient or subrecipient may use a time-and-materials type contract only after a determination 
that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk. Time-and-materials type contract means a contract whose cost to a 
recipient or subrecipient is the sum of: 

(i) The actual cost of materials; and 
(ii) Direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general and administrative 
(2) Because this formula generates an open-ended contract price, a time-and-materials contract 
expenses, and profit. 

provides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, 
each contract must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Further, the 
recipient or subrecipient awarding such a contract must assert a high degree of oversight to obtain 
reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls. 

(k) Settlement of contractual and administrative issues.The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for the 
settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of its procurement transactions. These 
issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards 
do not relieve the recipient or subrecipient of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The 
Federal agency will not substitute its judgment for that of the recipient or subrecipient unless the matter 
is primarily a Federal concern. The recipient or subrecipient must report violations of law to the Federal, 
State, or local authority with proper jurisdiction.

(l) Examples of labor and employment practices. 
(1) The procurement standards in this subpart do not prohibit recipients or subrecipients from: 
(i) Using Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) or similar forms of pre-hire collective bargaining 
agreements; 

(ii) Requiring construction contractors to use hiring preferences or goals for people residing in 
high-poverty areas, disadvantaged communities as defined by the Justice40 Initiative (see OMB 
Memorandum M-21-28), or high-unemployment census tracts within a region no smaller than 
the county where a federally funded construction project is located. The hiring preferences or 
goals should be consistent with the policies and procedures of the recipient or subrecipient, 
and must not prohibit interstate hiring; 

(iii) Requiring a contractor to use hiring preferences or goals for individuals with barriers to 
employment (as defined in section 3 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 

U.S.C. 3102(24)), including women and people from underserved communities as defined by 
Executive Order 14091; 
(iv) Using agreements intended to ensure uninterrupted delivery of services; using agreements 
intended to ensure community benefits; or 

(v) Offering employees of a predecessor contractor rights of first refusal under a new contract. 
(2) Recipients and subrecipients may use the practices listed in paragraph (1) if consistent with the U.S. 
Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations, the objectives and purposes of the 
applicable Federal financial assistance program, and other requirements of this part. 

§ 200.319 Competition. 

(a) All procurement transactions under the Federal award must be conducted in a manner that provides full 
and open competition and is consistent with the standards of this section and§ 200.320. 

(b) To ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that 
develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids must be excluded 
from competing on those procurements. 

(c) Examples of situations that may restrict competition include, but are not limited to: 
(1) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms for them to qualify to do business; 
(2) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding; 
(3) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies; 
(4) Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts; 
(5) Organizational conflicts of interest; 
(6) Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and 
describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and 

(7) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. 
(d) The recipient or subrecipient must have written procedures for procurement transactions. These 
procedures must ensure that all solicitations:

2 CFR 200.319(d)(1) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) Are made in accordance with§ 200.319(b); 
(2) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the property, 
equipment, or service being procured. The description may include a statement of the qualitative 
nature of the property, equipment, or service to be procured. When necessary, the description must 
provide minimum essential characteristics and standards to which the property, equipment, or 
service must conform. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is 
impractical or uneconomical to clearly and accurately describe the technical requirements, a “brand 
name or equivalent” description of features may be used to provide procurement requirements. The 
specific features of the named brand must be clearly stated; and 

(3) Identify any additional requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors that will be 
used in evaluating bids or proposals. 

(e) The recipient or subrecipient must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products used in 
procurement transactions are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open 
competition. When establishing or amending prequalified lists, the recipient or subrecipient must consider 
objective factors that evaluate price and cost to maximize competition. The recipient or subrecipient 
must not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period. 

(f) To the extent consistent with established practices and legal requirements applicable to the recipient or 
subrecipient, this subpart does not prohibit recipients or subrecipients from developing written 
procedures for procurement transactions that incorporate a scoring mechanism that rewards bidders that 
commit to specific numbers and types of U.S. jobs, minimum compensation, benefits, on-the-job-training 
for employees making work products or providing services on a contract, and other worker protections. 
This subpart also does not prohibit recipients and subrecipients from making inquiries of bidders about 
these subjects and assessing the responses. Any scoring mechanism must be consistent with the U.S. 
Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award. 

(g) Noncompetitive procurements can only be awarded in accordance with§ 200.320(c). 
§ 200.320 Procurement methods. 

There are three types of procurement methods described in this section: informal procurement methods (for micro-
purchases and simplified acquisitions); formal procurement methods (through sealed bids or proposals); and 
noncompetitive procurement methods. For any of these methods, the recipient or subrecipient must maintain and 
use documented procurement procedures, consistent with the standards of this section and§§ 200.317,200.318, 
and200.319. 

(a) Informal procurement methods for small purchases.These procurement methods expedite the completion 
of transactions, minimize administrative burdens, and reduce costs. Informal procurement methods may 
be used when the value of the procurement transaction under the Federal award does not exceed the 
simplified acquisition threshold as defined in§ 200.1. Recipients and subrecipients may also establish a 
lower threshold. Informal procurement methods include: 

(1) Micro-purchases— 
(i) Distribution.The aggregate amount of the procurement transaction does not exceed the micro-
purchase threshold defined in§ 200.1. To the extent practicable, the recipient or subrecipient 
should distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.

2 CFR 200.320(a)(1)(ii) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(ii) Micro-purchase awards.Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive price 
or rate quotations if the recipient or subrecipient considers the price reasonable based on 
research, experience, purchase history, or other information; and maintains documents to 
support its conclusion. Purchase cards may be used as a method of payment for micro-
purchases. 

(iii) Micro-purchase thresholds.The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining and 
documenting an appropriate micro-purchase threshold based on internal controls, an 
evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. The micro-purchase threshold 
used by the recipient or subrecipient must be authorized or not prohibited under State, local, or 
tribal laws or regulations. The recipient or subrecipient may establish a threshold higher than 
the Federal threshold established in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in accordance 
withparagraphs (a)(1)(iv)and(v)of this section. 

(iv) Recipient or subrecipient increase to the micro-purchase threshold up to $50,000.The recipient 
or subrecipient may establish a threshold higher than the micro-purchase threshold identified in 
the FAR in accordance with the requirements of this section. The recipient or subrecipient may 
self-certify a threshold up to $50,000 on an annual basis and must maintain documentation to 
be made available to the Federal agency or pass-through entity and auditors in accordance with 
§ 200.334. The self-certification must include a justification, clear identification of the 
threshold, and supporting documentation of any of the following: 

(A) A qualification as a low-risk auditee, in accordance with the criteria in§ 200.520for the 
most recent audit; 

(B) An annual internal institutional risk assessment to identify, mitigate, and manage financial 
risks; or, 

(C) For public institutions, a higher threshold is consistent with State law. 
(v) Recipient or subrecipient increase to the micro-purchase threshold over $50,000.Micro-purchase 
thresholds higher than $50,000 must be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. 
The recipient or subrecipient must submit a request that includes the requirements in 
paragraph (a)(1)(iv)of this section. The increased threshold is valid until any factor that was 
relied on in the establishment and rationale of the threshold changes. 

(2) Simplified acquisitions— 
(i) Simplified acquisition procedures.The aggregate dollar amount of the procurement transaction 
is higher than the micro-purchase threshold but does not exceed the simplified acquisition 
threshold. If simplified acquisition procedures are used, price or rate quotations must be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources. Unless specified by the Federal 
agency, the recipient or subrecipient may exercise judgment in determining what number is 
adequate. 

(ii) Simplified acquisition thresholds.The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining an 
appropriate simplified acquisition threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, 
and its documented procurement procedures, which may be lower than, but must not exceed, 
the threshold established in the FAR.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(b) Formal procurement methods.Formal procurement methods are required when the value of the 
procurement transaction under a Federal award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold of the 
recipient or subrecipient. Formal procurement methods are competitive and require public notice. The 
following formal methods of procurement are used for procurement transactions above the simplified 
acquisition threshold determined by the recipient or subrecipient in accordance withparagraph (a)(2)(ii) 
of this section: 

(1) Sealed bids.This is a procurement method in which bids are publicly solicited through an invitation 
and a firm fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose 
bid conforms with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation and is the lowest in price. 
The sealed bids procurement method is preferred for procuring construction services. 

(i) For sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present: 
(A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; 
(B) Two or more responsible bidders have been identified as willing and able to compete 
effectively for the business; and 

(C) The procurement lends itself to a firm-fixed-price contract, and the selection of the 
successful bidder can be made principally based on price. 

(ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply: 
(A) Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources, providing them with 
sufficient response time prior to the date set for opening the bids. Unless specified by the 
Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient may exercise judgment in determining what 
number is adequate. For local governments, the invitation for bids must be publicly 
advertised. 

(B) The invitation for bids must define the items or services with specific information, 
including any required specifications, for the bidder to properly respond; 

(C) All bids will be opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids. For local 
governments, the bids must be opened publicly. 

(D) A firm-fixed-price contract is awarded in writing to the lowest responsive bid and 
responsible bidder. When specified in the invitation for bids, factors such as discounts, 
transportation cost, and life-cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is 
the lowest. Payment discounts must only be used to determine the low bid when the 
recipient or subrecipient determines they are a valid factor based on prior experience. 

(E) The recipient or subrecipient must document and provide a justification for all bids it 
rejects. 

(2) Proposals.This is a procurement method used when conditions are not appropriate for using sealed 
bids. This procurement method may result in either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement contract. 
They are awarded in accordance with the following requirements: 

(i) Requests for proposals require public notice, and all evaluation factors and their relative 
importance must be identified. Proposals must be solicited from multiple qualified entities. To 
the maximum extent practicable, any proposals submitted in response to the public notice 
must be considered.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(ii) The recipient or subrecipient must have written procedures for conducting technical 
evaluations and making selections. 

(iii) Contracts must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to 
the recipient or subrecipient considering price and other factors; and 

(iv) The recipient or subrecipient may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based 
procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby the offeror's 
qualifications are evaluated, and the most qualified offeror is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where the price is not used as a selection 
factor, can only be used to procure architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services. The 
method may not be used to purchase other services provided by A/E firms that are a potential 
source to perform the proposed effort. 

(c) Noncompetitive procurement.There are specific circumstances in which the recipient or subrecipient may 
use a noncompetitive procurement method. The noncompetitive procurement method may only be used if 
one of the following circumstances applies: 

(1) The aggregate amount of the procurement transaction does not exceed the micro-purchase 
threshold (seeparagraph (a)(1)of this section); 

(2) The procurement transaction can only be fulfilled by a single source; 
(3) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from providing 
public notice of a competitive solicitation; 

(4) The recipient or subrecipient requests in writing to use a noncompetitive procurement method, and 
the Federal agency or pass-through entity provides written approval; or 

(5) After soliciting several sources, competition is determined inadequate. 
§ 200.321 Contracting with small businesses, minority businesses, women's business 
enterprises, veteran-owned businesses, and labor surplus area firms. 

(a) When possible, the recipient or subrecipient should ensure that small businesses, minority businesses, 
women's business enterprises, veteran-owned businesses, and labor surplus area firms (See U.S. 
Department of Labor's list) are considered as set forth below. 

(b) Such consideration means: 
(1) These business types are included on solicitation lists; 
(2) These business types are solicited whenever they are deemed eligible as potential sources; 
(3) Dividing procurement transactions into separate procurements to permit maximum participation by 
these business types; 

(4) Establishing delivery schedules (for example, the percentage of an order to be delivered by a given 
date of each month) that encourage participation by these business types; 

(5) Utilizing organizations such as the Small Business Administration and the Minority Business 
Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and 

(6) Requiring a contractor under a Federal award to apply this section to subcontracts.

§ 200.322 Domestic preferences for procurements. 

(a) The recipient or subrecipient should, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with law, provide a 
preference for the purchase, acquisition, or use of goods, products, or materials produced in the United 
States (including but not limited to iron, aluminum, steel, cement, and other manufactured products). The 
requirements of this section must be included in all subawards, contracts, and purchase orders under 
Federal awards. 

(b) For purposes of this section: 
(1) “Produced in the United States” means, for iron and steel products, that all manufacturing processes, 
from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States. 

(2) “Manufactured products” means items and construction materials composed in whole or in part of 
non-ferrous metals such as aluminum; plastics and polymer-based products such as polyvinyl 
chloride pipe; aggregates such as concrete; glass, including optical fiber; and lumber. 

(c) Federal agencies providing Federal financial assistance for infrastructure projects must implement the 
Buy America preferences set forth in2 CFR part 184. 

§ 200.323 Procurement of recovered materials. 

(a) A recipient or subrecipient that is a State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State and its 
contractors must comply with section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as amended,42 U.S.C. 6962. The requirements of Section 6002 
include procuring only items designated in the guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
at40 CFR part 247that contain the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent 
with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, where the purchase price of the item exceeds 
$10,000 or the value of the quantity acquired during the preceding fiscal year exceeded $10,000; 
procuring solid waste management services in a manner that maximizes energy and resource recovery; 
and establishing an affirmative procurement program for procurement of recovered materials identified in 
the EPA guidelines. 

(b) The recipient or subrecipient should, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with law, purchase, 
acquire, or use products and services that can be reused, refurbished, or recycled; contain recycled 
content, are biobased, or are energy and water efficient; and are sustainable. This may include purchasing 
compostable items and other products and services that reduce the use of single-use plastic products. 
See Executive Order 14057, section 101, Policy. 

§ 200.324 Contract cost and price. 

(a) The recipient or subrecipient must perform a cost or price analysis for every procurement transaction, 
including contract modifications, in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. The method and 
degree of analysis conducted depend on the facts surrounding the particular procurement transaction. 
For example, the recipient or subrecipient should consider potential workforce impacts in their analysis if 
the procurement transaction will displace public sector employees. However, as a starting point, the 
recipient or subrecipient must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. 

(b) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under the Federal award are allowable only to the 
extent that the costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices would be allowable for the 
recipient or subrecipient undersubpart E of this part. The recipient or subrecipient may reference its own 
cost principles as long as they comply withsubpart E of this part.

(c) The recipient or subrecipient must not use the “cost plus a percentage of cost” and “percentage of 
construction costs” methods of contracting. 

§ 200.325 Federal agency or pass-through entity review. 

(a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity may review the technical specifications of proposed 
procurements under the Federal award if the Federal agency or pass-through entity believes the review is 
needed to ensure that the item or service specified is the one being proposed for acquisition. The 
recipient or subrecipient must submit the technical specifications of proposed procurements when 
requested by the Federal agency or pass-through entity. This review should take place prior to the time the 
specifications are incorporated into a solicitation document. When the recipient or subrecipient desires to 
accomplish the review after a solicitation has been developed, the Federal agency or pass-through entity 
may still review the specifications. In those cases, the review should be limited to the technical aspects of 
the proposed purchase. 

(b) When requested, the recipient or subrecipient must provide procurement documents (such as requests for 
proposals, invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates) to the Federal agency or pass-through 
entity for pre-procurement review. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may conduct a preprocurement 
review when: 

(1) The recipient's or subrecipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the 
procurement standards in this part; 

(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded 
without competition, or only one bid is expected to be received in response to a solicitation; 

(3) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and specifies a “brand 
name” product; 

(4) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, and a sealed bid 
procurement is to be awarded to an entity other than the apparent low bidder; or 

(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount 
by more than the simplified acquisition threshold. 

(c) The recipient or subrecipient is exempt from the pre-procurement review inparagraph (b)of this section if 
the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that its procurement systems comply with the 
standards of this part. 

(1) The recipient or subrecipient may request that the Federal agency or pass-through entity review its 
procurement system to determine whether it meets these standards for its system to be certified. 
Generally, these reviews must occur where there is continuous high-dollar funding and third-party 
contracts are awarded regularly. 

(2) The recipient or subrecipient may self-certify its procurement system. However, self-certification 
does not limit the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's right to review the system. Under a self-
certification procedure, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may rely on written assurances 
from the recipient or subrecipient that it is complying with the standards of this part. The recipient or 
subrecipient must cite specific policies, procedures, regulations, or standards as complying with 
these requirements and have its system available for review.

§ 200.326 Bonding requirements. 

The Federal agency or pass-through entity may accept the recipient's or subrecipient's bonding policy and 
requirements for construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified 
acquisition threshold. Before doing so, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must determine that the Federal 
interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be as 
follows: 

(a) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The bid guarantee must 
consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute any required 
contractual documents within the specified timeframe. 

(b) A performance bond on the contractor's part for 100 percent of the contract price. A performance bond is 
a bond executed in connection with a contract to secure the fulfillment of all the contractor's 
requirements under a contract. 

(c) A payment bond on the contractor's part for 100 percent of the contract price. A payment bond is a bond 
executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by the law of all persons supplying 
labor and material in the execution of the work provided for under a contract. 

§ 200.327 Contract provisions. 

The recipient's or subrecipient's contracts must contain the applicable provisions described inAppendix II of this 
part. 

PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL MONITORING AND REPORTING 

§ 200.328 Financial reporting. 

(a) The Federal agency must require only OMB-approved government-wide data elements on recipient 
financial reports. At the time of publication, this consists of the Federal Financial Report (SF-425); 
however, this also applies to any future OMB-approved government-wide data elements available from the 
OMB-designated standards lead. 

(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must collect financial reports no less than annually. The 
Federal agency or pass-through entity may not collect financial reports more frequently than quarterly 
unless a specific condition has been implemented in accordance with§ 200.208. To the extent 
practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should collect financial reports in coordination with 
performance reports. 

(c) The recipient or subrecipient must submit financial reports as required by the Federal award. Reports 
submitted annually by the recipient or subrecipient must be due no later than 90 calendar days after the 
reporting period. Reports submitted quarterly or semiannually must be due no later than 30 calendar days 
after the reporting period. 

(d) The final financial report submitted by the recipient must be due no later than 120 calendar days after the 
conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient must submit a final financial report to a pass-
through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. See also 
§ 200.344. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may extend the due date for any financial report 
with justification from the recipient or subrecipient.

§ 200.329 Monitoring and reporting program performance. 

(a) Monitoring by the recipient and subrecipient.The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for the 
oversight of the Federal award. The recipient and subrecipient must monitor their activities under Federal 
awards to ensure they are compliant with all requirements and meeting performance expectations. 
Monitoring by the recipient and subrecipient must cover each program, function, or activity. See also§ 
200.332. 

(b) Reporting program performance.The Federal agency must use OMB-approved common information 
collections (for example, Research Performance Progress Reports) when requesting performance 
reporting information. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may not collect performance reports 
more frequently than quarterly unless a specific condition has been implemented in accordance with§ 

200.208. To the extent practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should align the due dates 
of performance reports and financial reports. When reporting program performance, the recipient or 
subrecipient must relate financial data and project or program accomplishments to the performance 
goals and objectives of the Federal award. Also, the recipient or subrecipient must provide cost 
information to demonstrate cost-effective practices (for example, through unit cost data) when required 
by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. In some instances (for example, discretionary research 
awards), this may be limited to the requirement to submit technical performance reports. Reporting 
requirements must clearly indicate a standard against which the recipient's or subrecipient's performance 
can be measured. Reporting requirements should not solicit information from the recipient or 
subrecipient that is not necessary for the effective monitoring or evaluation of the Federal award. Federal 
agencies should consult monitoring framework documents such as the agency's Evaluation Plan to make 
that determination. As noted in OMB Circular A-11, Part 6, Section 280, measures of customer experience 
are of co-equal importance as traditional measures of financial and operational performance. 
(c) Submitting performance reports. 
(1) The recipient or subrecipient must submit performance reports as required by the Federal award. 
Intervals must be no less frequent than annually nor more frequent than quarterly except if specific 
conditions are applied (See§ 200.208). Reports submitted annually by the recipient or subrecipient 
must be due no later than 90 calendar days after the reporting period. Reports submitted quarterly or 
semiannually must be due no later than 30 calendar days after the reporting period. Alternatively, the 
Federal agency or pass-through entity may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of 
multiple-year Federal awards. The final performance report submitted by the recipient must be due 
no later than 120 calendar days after the period of performance. A subrecipient must submit a final 
performance report to a pass-through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of 
the period of performance. See also§ 200.344. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may 
extend the due date for any performance report with justification from the recipient or subrecipient. 

(2) As applicable, performance reports should contain information on the following: 
(i) A comparison of accomplishments to the objectives of the Federal award established for the 
reporting period (for example, comparing costs to units of accomplishment). Where 
performance trend data and analysis would be informative to the Federal agency program, the 
Federal agency should include this as a performance reporting requirement. 

(ii) Explanations on why established goals or objectives were not met; and 
(iii) Additional information, analysis, and explanation of cost overruns or higher-than-expected unit 
costs.

(d) Construction performance reports.Federal agencies or pass-through entities rely on on-site technical 
inspections and certified percentage of completion data to monitor progress under Federal awards for 
construction. Therefore, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may require additional performance 
reports when necessary to ensure the goals and objectives of Federal awards are met. 

(e) Significant developments.When a significant development that could impact the Federal award occurs 
between performance reporting due dates, the recipient or subrecipient must notify the Federal agency or 
pass-through entity. Significant developments include events that enable meeting milestones and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or that produce different beneficial results than 
originally planned. Significant developments also include problems, delays, or adverse conditions which 
will impact the recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet milestones or the objectives of the Federal 
award. When significant developments occur that negatively impact the Federal Award, the recipient or 
subrecipient must include information on their plan for corrective action and any assistance needed to 
resolve the situation. 

(f) Site visits.The Federal agency or pass-through entity may conduct in-person or virtual site visits as 
warranted. 

(g) Performance report requirement waiver.The Federal agency may waive any performance report that is not 
necessary to ensure the goals and objectives of the Federal award are being achieved. 

§ 200.330 Reporting on real property. 

The Federal agency or pass-through entity must require the recipient or subrecipient to submit reports on the status 
of real property in which the Federal Government retains an interest. Such reports must be submitted at least 
annually. In instances where the Federal Government's interest in the real property extends for 15 years or more, the 
Federal agency or pass-through entity may require the recipient or subrecipient to report at various multi-year 
frequencies. Reports submitted at multi-year frequencies may not exceed a five-year reporting period. The Federal 
agency must only require OMB-approved government-wide data elements on recipient real property reports. 

SUBRECIPIENT MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT 

§ 200.331 Subrecipient and contractor determinations. 

An entity may concurrently receive Federal awards as a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. The pass-through 
entity is responsible for making case-by-case determinations to determine whether the entity receiving Federal 
funds is a subrecipient or a contractor. The Federal agency may require the pass-through entity to comply with 
additional guidance to make these determinations, provided such guidance does not conflict with this section. The 
Federal agency does not have a direct legal relationship with subrecipients or contractors of any tier; however, the 
Federal agency is responsible for monitoring the pass-through entity's oversight of first-tier subrecipients. All of the 
characteristics listed below may not be present in all cases, and some characteristics from both categories may be 
present at the same time. No single factor or any combination of factors is necessarily determinative. The pass-
through entity must use judgment in classifying each agreement as a subaward or a procurement contract. In 
making this determination, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. 

(a) Subrecipients.A subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of the Federal award and creates a 
Federal financial assistance relationship with a subrecipient. See the definition ofSubawardin§ 200.1. 
Characteristics that support the classification of the entity as a subrecipient include, but are not limited to, 
when the entity:

(1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal assistance; 
(2) Has its performance measured in relation to whether the objectives of a Federal program were met; 
(3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision-making; 
(4) Is responsible for adherence to applicable Federal program requirements specified in the Federal 
award; and 

(5) Implements a program for a public purpose specified in authorizing statute, as opposed to providing 
goods or services for the benefit of the pass-through entity. 

(b) Contractors.A contract is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the recipient's or 
subrecipient's use and creates a procurement relationship with a contractor. See the definition ofcontract 
in§ 200.1. Characteristics that support a procurement relationship between the recipient or subrecipient 
and a contractor include, but are not limited to, when the contractor: 

(1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations; 
(2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers; 
(3) Normally operates in a competitive environment; 
(4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the implementation of a Federal program; and 
(5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of a Federal program as a result of the agreement. 
However, similar requirements may apply for other reasons. 

§ 200.332 Requirements for pass-through entities. 

A pass-through entity must: 

(a) Verify that the subrecipient is not excluded or disqualified in accordance with§ 180.300. Verification 
methods are provided in§ 180.300, which include confirming inSAM.govthat a potential subrecipient is 
not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from receiving Federal funds. 

(b) Ensure that every subaward is clearly identified to the subrecipient as a subaward and includes the 
information provided below. A pass-through entity must provide the best available information when 
some of the information below is unavailable. A pass-through entity must provide the unavailable 
information when it is obtained. Required information includes: 

(1) Federal award identification. 
(i) Subrecipient's name (must match the name associated with its unique entity identifier); 
(ii) Subrecipient's unique entity identifier; 
(iii) Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN); 
(iv) Federal Award Date; 
(v) Subaward Period of Performance Start and End Date; 
(vi) Subaward Budget Period Start and End Date; 
(vii) Amount of Federal Funds Obligated in the subaward;

(viii) Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity, 
including the current financial obligation; 

(ix) Total Amount of the Federal Award committed to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity; 
(x) Federal award project description, as required by the Federal Funding Accountability and 
Transparency Act (FFATA); 

(xi) Name of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and contact information for awarding official 
of the pass-through entity; 

(xii) Assistance Listings title and number; the pass-through entity must identify the dollar amount 
made available under each Federal award and the Assistance Listings Number at the time of 
disbursement; 

(xiii) Identification of whether the Federal award is for research and development; and 
(xiv) Indirect cost rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is used in accordance 
with§ 200.414). 

(2) All requirements of the subaward, including requirements imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, 
and the terms and conditions of the Federal award; 

(3) Any additional requirements that the pass-through entity imposes on the subrecipient for the pass-
through entity to meet its responsibilities under the Federal award. This includes information and 
certifications (see§ 200.415) required for submitting financial and performance reports that the 
pass-through entity must provide to the Federal agency; 

(4) Indirect cost rate: 
(i) An approved indirect cost rate negotiated between the subrecipient and the Federal 
Government. If no approved rate exists, a pass-through entity must determine the appropriate 
rate in collaboration with the subrecipient. The indirect cost rate may be either: 

(A) An indirect cost rate negotiated between the pass-through entity and the subrecipient. 
These rates may be based on a prior negotiated rate between a different pass-through 
entity and the subrecipient, in which case the pass-through entity is not required to collect 
information justifying the rate but may elect to do so; or 

(B) The de minimis indirect cost rate. 
(ii) The pass-through entity must not require the use of the de minimis indirect cost rate if the 
subrecipient has an approved indirect cost rate negotiated with the Federal Government. 
Subrecipients may elect to use the cost allocation method to account for indirect costs in 
accordance with§ 200.405(d). 

(5) A requirement that the subrecipient permit the pass-through entity and auditors to access the 
subrecipient's records and financial statements for the pass-through entity to fulfill its monitoring 
requirements; and 

(6) Appropriate terms and conditions concerning the closeout of the subaward. 
(c) Evaluate each subrecipient's fraud risk and risk of noncompliance with a subaward to determine the 
appropriate subrecipient monitoring described inparagraph (f)of this section. When evaluating a 
subrecipient's risk, a pass-through entity should consider the following:

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.332(c)(1) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) The subrecipient's prior experience with the same or similar subawards; 
(2) The results of previous audits. This includes considering whether or not the subrecipient receives a 
Single Audit in accordance with subpart F and the extent to which the same or similar subawards 
have been audited as a major program; 

(3) Whether the subrecipient has new personnel or new or substantially changed systems; and 
(4) The extent and results of any Federal agency monitoring (for example, if the subrecipient also 
receives Federal awards directly from the Federal agency). 

(d) If appropriate, consider implementing specific conditions in a subaward as described in§ 200.208and 
notify the Federal agency of the specific conditions. 

(e) Monitor the activities of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subrecipient complies with Federal 
statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward. The pass-through entity is 
responsible for monitoring the overall performance of a subrecipient to ensure that the goals and 
objectives of the subaward are achieved. In monitoring a subrecipient, a pass-through entity must: 

(1) Review financial and performance reports. 
(2) Ensure that the subrecipient takes corrective action on all significant developments that negatively 
affect the subaward. Significant developments include Single Audit findings related to the subaward, 
other audit findings, site visits, and written notifications from a subrecipient of adverse conditions 
which will impact their ability to meet the milestones or the objectives of a subaward. When 
significant developments negatively impact the subaward, a subrecipient must provide the pass-
through entity with information on their plan for corrective action and any assistance needed to 
resolve the situation. 

(3) Issue a management decision for audit findings pertaining only to the Federal award provided to the 
subrecipient from the pass-through entity as required by§ 200.521. 

(4) Resolve audit findings specifically related to the subaward. However, the pass-through entity is not 
responsible for resolving cross-cutting audit findings that apply to the subaward and other Federal 
awards or subawards. If a subrecipient has a current Single Audit report and has not been excluded 
from receiving Federal funding (meaning, has not been debarred or suspended), the pass-through 
entity may rely on the subrecipient's cognizant agency for audit or oversight agency for audit to 
perform audit follow-up and make management decisions related to cross-cutting audit findings in 
accordance with section§ 200.513(a)(4)(viii). Such reliance does not eliminate the responsibility of 
the pass-through entity to issue subawards that conform to agency and award-specific 
requirements, to manage risk through ongoing subaward monitoring, and to monitor the status of 
the findings that are specifically related to the subaward. 

(f) Depending upon the pass-through entity's assessment of the risk posed by the subrecipient (as described 
inparagraph (c)of this section), the following monitoring tools may be useful for the pass-through entity 
to ensure proper accountability and compliance with program requirements and achievement of 
performance goals: 

(1) Providing subrecipients with training and technical assistance on program-related matters; 
(2) Performing site visits to review the subrecipient's program operations; and 
(3) Arranging for agreed-upon-procedures engagements as described in§ 200.425.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(g) Verify that a subrecipient is audited as required bysubpart F of this part. 
(h) Consider whether the results of a subrecipient's audit, site visits, or other monitoring necessitate 
adjustments to the pass-through entity's records. 

(i) Consider taking enforcement action against noncompliant subrecipients as described in§ 200.339and in 
program regulations. 

§ 200.333 Fixed amount subawards. 

With prior written approval from the Federal agency, the recipient may provide subawards based on fixed amounts 
up to $500,000. Fixed amount subawards must meet the requirements of§ 200.201. 

RECORD RETENTION AND ACCESS 

§ 200.334 Record retention requirements. 

The recipient and subrecipient must retain all Federal award records for three years from the date of submission of 
their final financial report. For awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, the recipient and subrecipient must 
retain records for three years from the date of submission of their quarterly or annual financial report, respectively. 
Records to be retained include but are not limited to, financial records, supporting documentation, and statistical 
records. Federal agencies or pass-through entities may not impose any other record retention requirements except 
for the following: 

(a) The records must be retained until all litigation, claims, or audit findings involving the records have been 
resolved and final action taken if any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the three-
year period. 

(b) When the recipient or subrecipient is notified in writing by the Federal agency or pass-through entity, 
cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, or cognizant agency for indirect costs to extend 
the retention period. 

(c) The records for property and equipment acquired with the support of Federal funds must be retained for 
three years after final disposition. 

(d) The three-year retention requirement does not apply to the recipient or subrecipient when records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency. 

(e) The records for program income earned after the period of performance must be retained for three years 
from the end of the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year in which the program income is earned. This 
only applies if the Federal agency or pass-through entity requires the recipient or subrecipient to report on 
program income earned after the period of performance in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. 

(f) The records for indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar 
accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer 
usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates) must be retained according to the applicable 
option below: 

(1) If submitted for negotiation.When a proposal, plan, or other computation must be submitted to the 
Federal Government to form the basis for negotiation of an indirect cost rate (or other standard 
rates), then the three-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
submission.

(2) If not submitted for negotiation.When a proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be 
submitted to the Federal Government to form the basis for negotiation of an indirect cost rate (or 
other standard rates), then the three-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the 
end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other 
computation. 

§ 200.335 Requests for transfer of records. 

The Federal agency must request the transfer of records to its custody from the recipient or subrecipient when it 
determines that the records possess long-term retention value. However, the Federal agency may arrange for the 
recipient or subrecipient to retain the records that have long-term retention value so long as they are continuously 
available to the Federal Government. 

§ 200.336 Methods for collection, transmission, and storage of information. 

When practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity and the recipient or subrecipient must collect, transmit, 
and store Federal award information in open and machine-readable formats. A machine-readable format is a format 
in a standard computer language (not English text) that can be read automatically by a computer system. Upon 
request, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must always provide or accept paper versions of Federal award 
information to and from the recipient or subrecipient. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not require 
additional copies of Federal award information submitted in paper versions. The recipient or subrecipient does not 
need to create and retain paper copies when original records are electronic and cannot be altered. In addition, the 
recipient or subrecipient may substitute electronic versions of original paper records through duplication or other 
forms of electronic conversion, provided that the procedures are subject to periodic quality control reviews. Quality 
control reviews must ensure that electronic conversion procedures provide safeguards against the alteration of 
records and assurance that records remain in a format that is readable by a computer system. 

§ 200.337 Access to records. 

(a) Records of recipients and subrecipients.The Federal agency or pass-through entity, Inspectors General, the 
Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives must have the right of 
access to any records of the recipient or subrecipient pertinent to the Federal award to perform audits, 
execute site visits, or for any other official use. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to 
the recipient's or subrecipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such 
documents or the Federal award in general. 

(b) Extraordinary and rare circumstances.The recipient or subrecipient and Federal agency or pass-through 
entity must take measures to protect the name of victims of a crime when access to the victim's name is 
necessary. Only under extraordinary and rare circumstances would such access include a review of the 
true name of victims of a crime. Routine monitoring cannot be considered extraordinary and rare 
circumstances that would necessitate access to this information. Any such access, other than under a 
court order or subpoena pursuant to a bona fide confidential investigation, must be approved by the head 
or delegate of the Federal agency. 

(c) Expiration of right of access.The Federal agency's or pass-through entity's rights of access are not limited 
to the required retention period of this part but last as long as the records are retained. Federal agencies 
or pass-through entities must not impose any other access requirements upon recipients and 
subrecipients.

§ 200.338 Restrictions on public access to records. 

Federal agencies may not place restrictions on the recipient or subrecipient that limit public access to the records 
of the recipient or subrecipient pertinent to a Federal award, except for protected personally identifiable information 
(PII) or other sensitive information when the Federal agency can demonstrate that such records will be kept 
confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 

552) or controlled unclassified information pursuant to Executive Order 13556 if the records had belonged to the 
Federal agency. The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA) does not apply to records that remain under 
the recipient's or subrecipient's control except as required by§ 200.315. Unless required by Federal, State, local, or 
tribal law, recipients and subrecipients are not required to permit public access to their records. The recipient's or 
subrecipient's records provided to a Federal agency generally will be subject to FOIA and applicable exemptions. 
REMEDIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE 

§ 200.339 Remedies for noncompliance. 

The Federal agency or pass-through entity may implement specific conditions if the recipient or subrecipient fails to 
comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award. See§ 
200.208for additional information on specific conditions. When the Federal agency or pass-through entity 
determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions, the Federal agency or pass-
through entity may take one or more of the following actions: 

(a) Temporarily withhold payments until the recipient or subrecipient takes corrective action. 
(b) Disallow costs for all or part of the activity associated with the noncompliance of the recipient or 
subrecipient. 

(c) Suspend or terminate the Federal award in part or in its entirety. 
(d) Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized in2 CFR part 180and the Federal agency's 
regulations, or for pass-through entities, recommend suspension or debarment proceedings be initiated 
by the Federal agency. 

(e) Withhold further Federal funds (new awards or continuation funding) for the project or program. 
(f) Pursue other legally available remedies. 
§ 200.340 Termination. 

(a) The Federal award may be terminated in part or its entirety as follows: 
(1) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity if the recipient or subrecipient fails to comply with the 
terms and conditions of the Federal award; 

(2) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the recipient or subrecipient, in 
which case the two parties must agree upon the termination conditions. These conditions include 
the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated; 

(3) By the recipient or subrecipient upon sending the Federal agency or pass-through entity a written 
notification of the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial 
termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal agency or pass-through entity

determines that the remaining portion of the Federal award will not accomplish the purposes for 
which the Federal award was made, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may terminate the 
Federal award in its entirety; or 

(4) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program 
goals or agency priorities. 

(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly and unambiguously specify all termination 
provisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. 

(c) When the Federal agency terminates the Federal award prior to the end of the period of performance due 
to the recipient's material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the 
Federal agency must report the termination inSAM.gov. A Federal agency must use the Contractor 
Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to enter information inSAM.gov. 

(1) The information required underparagraph (c)of this section is not to be reported inSAM.govuntil 
the recipient has either: 

(i) Exhausted its opportunities to object or challenge the decision (see§ 200.342); or 
(ii) Has not, within 30 calendar days after being notified of the termination, informed the Federal 
agency that it intends to appeal the decision to terminate. 

(2) If a Federal agency, after entering information about a termination inSAM.gov, subsequently: 
(i) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal agency must correct the 
information in the system within three business days; 

(ii) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal agencies, the 
Federal agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate 
the update in a timely way. 

(3) The Federal agency must not post any information that will be made publicly available in the nonpublic 
segment ofSAM.govthat is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA). When the recipient asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal agency 
which posted the information that a disclosure exemption under FOIA covers some of the 
information made publicly available, the Federal agency that posted the information must remove 
the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Before reposting the releasable 
information, the Federal agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's FOIA 
procedures. 

(d) When the Federal award is terminated in part or its entirety, the Federal agency or pass-through entity and 
recipient or subrecipient remain responsible for compliance with the requirements in§§ 200.344and 
200.345. 

§ 200.341 Notification of termination requirement. 

(a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must provide written notice of termination to the recipient or 
subrecipient. The written notice of termination should include the reasons for termination, the effective 
date, and the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, if applicable. 

(b) If the Federal award is terminated for the recipient's material failure to comply with a Federal award, the 
notification must state the following:

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.341(b)(1) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) The termination decision will be reported inSAM.gov; 
(2) The information will be available inSAM.govfor five years from the date of the termination and then 
archived; 

(3) Federal agencies that consider making a Federal award to the recipient during the five year period 
must consider this information in judging whether the recipient is qualified to receive the Federal 
award when the Federal share of the Federal award is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition 
threshold over the period of performance; 

(4) The recipient may comment on any information inSAM.govabout the recipient for future 
consideration by Federal agencies. The recipient may submit comments inSAM.gov. 

(5) Federal agencies should consider the recipient's comments when determining whether the recipient 
is qualified for a Federal award. 

(c) Upon termination of the Federal award, the Federal agency must provide the information required by the 
Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) toUSAspending.gov.In addition, the Federal 
agency must update or notify any other relevant government-wide systems or entities of any indications 
of poor performance as required by41 U.S.C. 2313and31 U.S.C. 3321. 

§ 200.342 Opportunities to object, hearings, and appeals. 

The Federal agency must maintain written procedures for processing objections, hearings, and appeals. Upon 
initiating a remedy for noncompliance (for example, disallowed costs, a corrective action plan, or termination), the 
Federal agency must provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information challenging the 
action. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must comply with any requirements for hearings, appeals, or 
other administrative proceedings to which the recipient or subrecipient is entitled under any statute or regulation 
applicable to the action involved. 

§ 200.343 Effects of suspension and termination. 

Costs to the recipient or subrecipient resulting from financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient 
during a suspension or after the termination of a Federal award are not allowable unless the Federal agency or 
pass-through entity expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. However, 
costs during suspension or after termination are allowable if: 

(a) The costs result from financial obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient or subrecipient 
before the effective date of suspension or termination, and not in anticipation of it; and 

(b) The costs would be allowable if the Federal award was not suspended or expired normally at the end of 
the period of performance in which the termination takes effect. 

CLOSEOUT 

§ 200.344 Closeout. 

(a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must close out the Federal award when it determines that all 
administrative actions and required work of the Federal award have been completed. When the recipient 
or subrecipient fails to complete the necessary administrative actions or the required work for an award, 
the Federal agency or pass-through entity must proceed with closeout based on the information available. 
This section specifies the administrative actions required at the end of the period of performance.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(b) A recipient must submit all reports (financial, performance, and other reports required by the Federal 
award) no later than 120 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient 
must submit all reports (financial, performance, and other reports required by a subaward) to the pass-
through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance of the 
subaward (or an earlier date as agreed upon by the pass-through entity and subrecipient). When justified, 
the Federal agency or pass-through entity may approve extensions for the recipient or subrecipient. When 
the recipient does not have a final indirect cost rate covering the period of performance, a final financial 
report must still be submitted to fulfill the requirements of this section. The recipient must submit a 
revised final financial report when all applicable indirect cost rates have been finalized. 

(c) The recipient must liquidate all financial obligations incurred under the Federal award no later than 120 
calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient must liquidate all 
financial obligations incurred under a subaward no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the 
period of performance of the subaward (or an earlier date as agreed upon by the pass-through entity and 
subrecipient). When justified, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may approve extensions for the 
recipient or subrecipient. 

(d) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not delay payments to the recipient or subrecipient for 
costs meeting the requirements ofsubpart E of this part. 

(e) The recipient or subrecipient must promptly refund any unobligated funds that the Federal agency or 
pass-through entity paid and that are not authorized to be retained. See OMB Circular A-129 and§ 
200.346. 

(f) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must make all necessary adjustments to the Federal share of 
costs after closeout reports are received (for example, to reflect the disallowance of any costs or the 
deobligation of an unliquidated balance). 

(g) The recipient or subrecipient must account for any property acquired with Federal funds or received from 
the Federal Government in accordance with§§ 200.310through200.316and200.330. 

(h) The Federal agency must make every effort to complete all closeout actions no later than one year after 
the end of the period of performance. If the indirect cost rate has not been finalized and would delay 
closeout, the Federal agency is authorized to mutually agree with the recipient to close an award using the 
current or most recently negotiated rate. However, the recipient is not required to agree to a final rate for a 
Federal award for the purpose of prompt closeout. 

(i) If the recipient does not comply with the requirements of this section, including submitting all final 
reports, the Federal agency must report the recipient's material failure to comply with the terms and 
conditions of the Federal award inSAM.gov. A Federal agency must use the Contractor Performance 
Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to enter or amend information inSAM.gov. Federal agencies may 
also pursue other enforcement actions as appropriate. See§ 200.339. 

POST-CLOSEOUT ADJUSTMENTS AND CONTINUING RESPONSIBILITIES 

§ 200.345 Post-closeout adjustments and continuing responsibilities. 

(a) The closeout of the Federal award does not affect any of the following:

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) The right of the Federal agency or pass-through entity to disallow costs and recover funds on the 
basis of a later audit or review. However, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must make 
determinations to disallow costs and notify the recipient or subrecipient within the record retention 
period. 

(2) The recipient's or subrecipient's requirement to return funds or right to receive any remaining and 
available funds as a result of refunds, corrections, final indirect cost rate adjustments (unless the 
Federal award in closed in accordance with§ 200.344(h)), or other transactions. 

(3) The ability of the Federal agency or pass-through entity to make financial adjustments to a previously 
closed Federal award, such as resolving indirect cost payments and making final payments. 

(4) Audit requirements insubpart F of this part. 
(5) Property management and disposition requirements in§§ 200.310through200.316. 
(6) Records retention as required in§§ 200.334through200.337. 
(b) After the closeout of the Federal award, a relationship created under the Federal award may be modified 
or ended in whole or in part. This may only be done with the consent of the awarding Federal agency or 
pass-through entity and the recipient or subrecipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient or 
subrecipient referred to inparagraph (a)of this section, including those for property management as 
applicable, are considered and provisions are made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient or 
subrecipient, as appropriate. 

COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DUE 

§ 200.346 Collection of amounts due. 

Any Federal funds paid to the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the amount that the recipient or subrecipient is 
determined to be entitled to under the Federal award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. The Federal 
agency must collect all debts arising out of its Federal awards in accordance with the Standards for the 
Administrative Collection of Claims (31 CFR part 901). 

Subpart E—Cost Principles 

GENERAL PROVISIONS 

§ 200.400 Policy guide. 

The application of these cost principles is based on the fundamental premises that: 

(a) The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for the efficient and effective administration of the Federal 
award through sound management practices. 

(b) The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for administering Federal funds in a manner consistent 
with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. 

(c) The recipient and subrecipient, in recognition of their unique combination of staff, facilities, and 
experience, are responsible for employing organization and management techniques necessary to ensure 
the proper and efficient administration of the Federal award.

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.400(d) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(d) The accounting practices of the recipient and subrecipient must be consistent with these cost principles 
and support the accumulation of costs as required by these cost principles, including maintaining 
adequate documentation to support costs charged to the Federal award. 

(e) When reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans or indirect cost proposals, the cognizant 
agency for indirect costs should ensure that the recipient consistently applies these cost principles. 
Where wide variations exist in the treatment of a given cost item by the recipient, the reasonableness and 
equity of such treatments should be fully considered. See the definition ofindirect costsin§ 200.1. 

(f) For recipients and subrecipients that educate and engage students in research, the dual role of students 
as both trainees and employees (including pre- and post-doctoral staff) contributing to the completion of 
Federal awards for research must be recognized in the application of these principles. 

(g) The recipient or subrecipient must not earn or keep any profit resulting from Federal financial assistance 
unless explicitly authorized by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also§ 200.307. When 
the required activities of a fixed amount award were completed in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the award, the unexpended funds retained by the recipient or subrecipient are not 
considered profit. 

§ 200.401 Application. 

(a) General.The recipient and subrecipient must apply these principles in determining allowable costs under 
Federal awards. The recipient and subrecipient must also use these principles as a guide in pricing fixed-
price contracts and subcontracts when costs are used in determining the appropriate price. These cost 
principles do not apply to: 

(1) Arrangements under which Federal financing is in the form of loans, scholarships, fellowships, 
traineeships, or other fixed amounts based on items such as education allowance or published 
tuition rates and fees. 

(2) Capitation awards based on case counts or the number of beneficiaries. 
(3) Fixed amount awards, except as provided in§ 200.101(b). See also§ 200.201. 
(4) Federal awards to hospitals (seeAppendix IX of this part). 
(5) Food commodities provided through grants and cooperative agreements. 
(6) Other awards under which the recipient or subrecipient is not required to account for actual costs 
incurred. 

(b) Federal contract.A Federal contract awarded to a recipient is subject to the Cost Accounting Standards 
(CAS). It must incorporate the applicable CAS requirements per48 CFR Chapter 99and48 CFR part 30 
(FAR Part 30). With respect to the allocation of costs, the Cost Accounting Standards at48 CFR parts 
9904or9905take precedence over the cost principles in subpart E. When a contract with a recipient is 
subject to full CAS coverage, the allowability of certain costs under the cost principles will be affected by 
the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards (for example, CAS 414—48 CFR 
9904.414—Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital, and CAS 417—48 CFR 
9904.417—Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction, apply instead 
of the allowability provisions of§ 200.449). For example, the allowability of costs in CAS-covered 
contracts is determined first by the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards rather than the 
allowability provisions in§ 200.449(unless the CAS does not address the specific costs). In complying 
with those requirements, the recipient's application of cost accounting practices for estimating,

2 CFR 200.401(c) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

accumulating, and reporting costs for Federal awards and CAS-covered contracts must be consistent with 
48 CFR. The recipient only needs to maintain one set of accounting records supporting the allocation of 
costs if the recipient administers both Federal awards and CAS-covered contracts. 

(c) Exemptions.Some nonprofit organizations, because of their size and nature of operations, can be 
considered to be similar to for-profit organizations in terms of the applicability of cost principles. These 
nonprofit organizations must operate under Federal cost principles that apply to for-profit organizations 
located at48 CFR 31.2. Appendix VIII contains a list of these nonprofit organizations. Other organizations 
may be added to this list if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. 

BASIC CONSIDERATIONS 

§ 200.402 Composition of costs. 

The total cost of a Federal award is the sum of the allowable direct and allocable indirect costs minus any 
applicable credits 

§ 200.403 Factors affecting allowability of costs. 

Except where otherwise authorized by statute, costs must meet the following criteria to be allowable under Federal 
awards: 

(a) Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under 
these principles. 

(b) Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles or in the Federal award as to types or 
amount of cost items. 

(c) Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally financed and other 
activities of the recipient or subrecipient. 

(d) Be accorded consistent treatment. For example, a cost must not be assigned to a Federal award as a 
direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the 
Federal award as an indirect cost. 

(e) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except, for State and 
local governments and Indian Tribes only, as otherwise provided for in this part. 

(f) Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing requirements of any other federally-financed 
program in either the current or a prior period. See§ 200.306(b). 

(g) Be adequately documented. See§§ 200.300through200.309. 
(h) Administrative closeout costs may be incurred until the due date of the final report(s). If incurred, these 
costs must be liquidated prior to the due date of the final report(s) and charged to the final budget period 
of the award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency. All other costs must be incurred during the 
approved budget period. At its discretion, the Federal agency is authorized to waive prior written 
approvals to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods. See§ 200.308(g)(3).

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

§ 200.404 Reasonable costs. 

A cost is reasonable if it does not exceed an amount that a prudent person would incur under the circumstances 
prevailing when the decision was made to incur the cost. In determining the reasonableness of a given cost, 
consideration must be given to the following: 

(a) Whether the cost is generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the recipient's or subrecipient's 
operation or the proper and efficient performance of the Federal award; 

(b) The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as sound business practices; arm's-length 
bargaining; Federal, State, local, tribal, and other laws and regulations; and terms and conditions of the 
Federal award; 

(c) Market prices for comparable costs for the geographic area; 
(d) Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the circumstances considering their 
responsibilities to the recipient or subrecipient, its employees, its students or membership (if applicable), 
the public at large, and the Federal Government; and 

(e) Whether the cost represents a deviation from the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies 
and procedures for incurring costs. 

§ 200.405 Allocable costs. 

(a) Allocable costs in general.A cost is allocable to a Federal award or other cost objective if the cost is 
assignable to that Federal award or other cost objective in accordance with the relative benefits received. 
This standard is met if the cost satisfies any of the following criteria: 

(1) Is incurred specifically for the Federal award; 
(2) Benefits both the Federal award and other work of the recipient or subrecipient and can be 
distributed in proportions that may be approximated using reasonable methods; or 

(3) Is necessary to the overall operation of the recipient or subrecipient and is assignable in part to the 
Federal award in accordance with these cost principles. 

(b) Allocation of indirect costs.All activities which benefit from the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect cost, 
including unallowable activities and donated services by the recipient or subrecipient or third parties, will 
receive an appropriate allocation of indirect costs. 

(c) Limitation on charging certain allocable costs to other Federal awards.A cost allocable to a particular 
Federal award may not be charged to other Federal awards (for example, to overcome fund deficiencies or 
to avoid restrictions imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal 
awards). However, this prohibition would not preclude the recipient or subrecipient from shifting costs 
that are allowable under two or more Federal awards in accordance with existing Federal statutes, 
regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards. 

(d) Direct cost allocation principles.If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can 
be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the 
proportional benefit However, when those proportions cannot be determined because of the 
interrelationship of the work involved, then, notwithstanding paragraph (c), the costs may be allocated or 
transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented basis. Where the purchase of 
equipment or other capital asset is specifically authorized under a Federal award, the costs are

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

assignable to the Federal award regardless of the use that may be made of the equipment or other capital 
asset involved, when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally required. See also§§ 
200.310through200.316and200.439. 

(e) Costs of contracts subject to CAS.If a contract is subject to CAS, costs must be allocated to that contract 
according to the Cost Accounting Standards, which take precedence over the allocation provisions in this 
part. 

§ 200.406 Applicable credits. 

(a) Applicable credits refer to transactions that offset or reduce direct or indirect costs allocable to a Federal 
award. Examples of such transactions are purchase discounts, rebates or allowances, recoveries or 
indemnities on losses, insurance refunds or rebates, and adjustments of overpayments or erroneous 
charges. To the extent that such credits accruing to or received by the recipient or subrecipient relate to 
allowable costs, they must be credited to the Federal award either as a cost reduction or cash refund, as 
appropriate. 

(b) In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal Government to finance activities or service 
operations of the recipient or subrecipient should be treated as applicable credits. Specifically, the 
concept of netting such credit items (including any amounts used to meet cost sharing requirements) 
must be recognized in determining the rates or amounts to be charged to the Federal award. See§§ 
200.436and200.468for potential application areas. 

§ 200.407 Prior written approval (prior approval). 

The reasonableness and allocability of certain costs under Federal awards may be difficult to determine. To avoid 
subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness or nonallocability, the recipient may seek the prior 
written approval of the Federal agency (or, for indirect costs, the cognizant agency for indirect costs) before 
incurring the cost. The absence of prior written approval on any element of cost will not, in itself, affect the 
reasonableness or allocability of that cost unless prior approval is specifically required for allowability as described 
under certain circumstances in the following sections: 

(a) Section 200.306 Cost sharing; 
(b) Section 200.307 Program income; 
(c) Section 200.308 Revision of budget and program plans; 
(d) Section 200.333 Fixed amount subawards; 
(e) Section 200.430 Compensation—personal services, paragraph (h);

§ 200.408 Limitation on allowance of costs. 

Statutory requirements may limit the allowability of costs. Any costs that exceed the maximum amount allowed by 
statute may not be charged to the Federal award. Only the amount allowable by statute may be charged to the 
Federal award. 

§ 200.409 Special considerations. 

Other sections in this part describe special considerations and requirements applicable to states, local 
governments, Indian Tribes, and IHEs. In addition, certain provisions among the items of cost in this subpart are 
only applicable to certain types of recipients and subrecipients, as specified in the following sections: 

(a) Direct and Indirect Costs (§§ 200.412-200.415); 
(b) Special Considerations for States, Local Governments and Indian Tribes (§§ 200.416and200.417); and 
(c) Special Considerations for Institutions of Higher Education (§§ 200.418and200.419). 
§ 200.410 Collection of unallowable costs. 

Payments made for costs determined to be unallowable by either the awarding Federal agency, cognizant agency 
for indirect costs, or pass-through entity must be refunded with interest to the Federal Government. Unless directed 
by Federal statute or regulation, repayments must be made in accordance with the instructions provided by the 
Federal agency or pass-through entity that made the allowability determination. See§§ 200.300through200.309, 
and§ 200.346. 

§ 200.411 Adjustment of previously negotiated indirect cost rates containing unallowable costs. 

(a) Negotiated indirect cost rates based on a proposal later found to have included costs that: 
(1) Are unallowable as specified by Federal statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of a 
Federal award; or 

(2) Are unallowable because they are not allocable to the Federal award(s), must be adjusted, or a 
refund must be made in accordance with the requirements of this section. These adjustments or 
refunds are intended to correct the proposals used to establish the rates and do not constitute a 
reopening of the rate negotiation. The adjustments or refunds must be made regardless of the type 
of rate negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or provisional). 

(b) For rates covering a future fiscal year of the recipient or subrecipient, the unallowable costs must be 
removed from the indirect cost pools and the rates must be adjusted.

2 CFR 200.411(c) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(c) For rates covering a past period, the Federal share of the unallowable costs must be computed for each 
year involved, and a cash refund (including interest) must be made to the Federal Government in 
accordance with the directions provided by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. When cash refunds 
are made for past periods covered by provisional or fixed rates, appropriate adjustments must be made 
when the rates are finalized to avoid duplicate recovery of the unallowable costs. 

(d) For rates covering the current period, either a rate adjustment or a refund, as described inparagraphs (b) 
and(c)of this section, must be required by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The choice of method 
must be at the discretion of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, based on its judgment as to which 
method would be most practical. 

(e) The amount or proportion of unallowable costs included in each year's rate will be assumed to be the 
same as the amount or proportion of unallowable costs included in the base year proposal used to 
establish the rate. 

DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS 

§ 200.412 Classification of costs. 

There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as direct or indirect costs. A cost may be direct for some 
specific service or function but indirect for the Federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, each cost 
incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently either as a direct or an indirect 
cost to avoid possible double-charging of Federal awards. Guidelines for determining direct and indirect costs 
charged to Federal awards are provided in this subpart. 

§ 200.413 Direct costs. 

(a) General.Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost 
objective, such as a Federal award, or other internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly 
assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. Costs incurred for the same 
purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently as direct or indirect costs. See§ 200.405. 

(b) Application to Federal awards.The association of costs with a Federal award determines whether costs 
are direct or indirect. Costs charged directly to a Federal award are typically incurred specifically for that 
Federal award (including, for example, supplies needed to achieve the award's objectives and the 
proportion of employee compensation and fringe benefits expended in relation to that specific award). 
Costs that otherwise would be treated as indirect costs may also be considered direct costs if they are 
directly related to a specific award (including, for example, extraordinary utility consumption, the cost of 
materials supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized facilities, cybersecurity, integrated data 
systems, asset management systems, performance management costs, program evaluation costs, or 
other institutional service operations). 

(c) Administrative and clerical staff salaries.Administrative and clerical staff salaries should normally be 
treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate only if they meet all of the 
following conditions: 

(1) The administrative or clerical services are integral to a Federal award; 
(2) Individuals involved can be specifically identified with a Federal award; and 
(3) The costs are not also recovered as indirect costs. 
2 CFR 200.413(c)(3) (enhanced display) page 85 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.413(d) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(d) Minor items.A direct cost of a minor amount may be treated as an indirect cost, for reasons of 
practicality, provided that it is treated consistently for all Federal and non-Federal purposes. 

(e) Treatment of unallowable costs in determining indirect cost rates.The costs of certain activities are not 
allowable as charges to Federal awards. Even though these costs are unallowable, they must be treated 
as direct costs for purposes of determining indirect cost rates and be allocated their equitable share of 
the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs if they represent activities which: 

(1) Include the salaries of personnel; 
(2) Occupy space; and 
(3) Benefit from the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs. 
(f) Treatment of certain costs for nonprofit organizations.For nonprofit organizations, the costs of activities 
performed by the nonprofit organization primarily as a service to members, clients, or the general public 
when significant and necessary to the organization's mission must be treated as direct costs whether or 
not allowable, and be allocated an equitable share of indirect costs. Some examples of these types of 
activities include: 

(1) Maintenance of membership rolls, subscriptions, publications, and related functions. See§ 200.454. 
(2) Providing services and information to members, the government, or the public. See§§ 200.454and 
200.450. 

(3) Promotion, lobbying, and other forms of public relations. See§§ 200.421and200.450. 
(4) Conferences (except those held to conduct the general administration of the recipient or 
subrecipient). See also§ 200.432. 

(5) Maintenance, protection, and investment of special funds not used in the recipient's or subrecipient's 
operation. See also§ 200.442. 

(6) Administration of group benefits on behalf of members or clients, including life and hospital 
insurance, annuity or retirement plans, and financial aid. See also§ 200.431. 

§ 200.414 Indirect costs. 

(a) Facilities and administration classification.For major Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) and major 
nonprofit organizations, indirect costs must be classified within two broad categories: “Facilities” and 
“Administration.” “Facilities” is defined as depreciation on buildings, equipment and capital improvements, 
interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, and operations 
and maintenance expenses.“Administration” is defined as general administration and general expenses 
such as the director's office, accounting, personnel, and all other types of expenditures not listed 
specifically under one of the subcategories of “Facilities” (including cross allocations from other pools, 
where applicable). For nonprofit organizations, library expenses are included in the “Administration” 
category; for IHEs, they are included in the “Facilities” category. Major IHEs are defined as those required 
to use the Standard Format for Submission as noted in Appendix III. Major nonprofit organizations are 
those which receive more than $10 million in direct Federal funding. 

(b) Diversity of nonprofit organizations.It is not always possible to specify the types of costs that may be 
classified as indirect costs for nonprofit organizations due to the diversity of their accounting practices. 
The association of a cost with a Federal award is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from 
indirect costs. However, typical examples of indirect cost for many nonprofit organizations may include

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, and general 
administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel 
administration, and accounting. 

(c) Federal Agency Acceptance of Negotiated Indirect Cost Rates.(See§ 200.306.) 
(1) Negotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all Federal agencies. A Federal agency may use a 
rate different from the negotiated rate for either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award 
only when required by Federal statute or regulation, or when approved by the awarding Federal 
agency in accordance withparagraph (c)(3)of this section. 

(2) The Federal agency must notify OMB of any approved deviations. The recipient or subrecipient may 
notify OMB of any disputes with Federal agencies regarding the application of a federally negotiated 
indirect cost rate. 

(3) The Federal agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, procedures and 
general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow to seek and justify deviations from 
negotiated rates. 

(4) The Federal agency must include, in the notice of funding opportunity, the policies relating to indirect 
cost rate reimbursement or cost share as approved under paragraph (e). As appropriate, the Federal 
agency should incorporate discussion of these policies into its outreach activities with applicants 
before posting a notice of funding opportunity. See§ 200.204. 

(d) Pass-through entities.Pass-through entities are subject to the requirements in§ 200.332(b)(4)and must 
accept all federally negotiated indirect costs rates for subrecipients. 

(e) Appendices.Requirements for development and submission of indirect cost rate proposals and cost 
allocation plans are contained in the following Appendices: 

(1) Appendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination 
for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs); 

(2) Appendix IV to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination 
for Nonprofit Organizations; 

(3) Appendix V to Part 200—State/Local Government-wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans; 
(4) Appendix VI to Part 200—Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans; 
(5) Appendix VII to Part 200—States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals; 
and 

(6) Appendix IX to Part 200—Hospital Cost Principles. 
(f) De minimis rate.Recipients and subrecipients that do not have a current Federal negotiated indirect cost 
rate (including provisional rate) may elect to charge a de minimis rate of up to 15 percent of modified total 
direct costs (MTDC). The recipient or subrecipient is authorized to determine the appropriate rate up to 
this limit. Federal agencies and pass-through entities may not require recipients and subrecipients to use 
a de minimis rate lower than the negotiated indirect cost rate or the rate elected pursuant to this 
subsection unless required by Federal statute or regulation. The de minimis rate must not be applied to 
cost reimbursement contracts issued directly by the Federal Government in accordance with the FAR. 
Recipients and subrecipients are not required to use the de minimis rate. When applying the de minimis 
rate, costs must be consistently charged as either direct or indirect costs and may not be double charged

or inconsistently charged as both. The de minimis rate does not require documentation to justify its use 
and may be used indefinitely. Once elected, the recipient or subrecipient must use the de minimis rate for 
all Federal awards until the recipient or subrecipient chooses to receive a negotiated rate. 

(g) One-time extension of indirect rates.A recipient or subrecipient with a current Federal negotiated indirect 
cost rate may apply for a one-time extension of that agreement for up to four years. This extension will be 
subject to review and approval by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. If this extension is granted, the 
recipient or subrecipient may not request a rate review until the extension period ends. The recipient or 
subrecipient must re-apply to negotiate a new rate when the extension ends. After a new rate has been 
negotiated, the recipient or subrecipient may again apply for a one-time extension of the new rate in 
accordance with this paragraph. 

§ 200.415 Required certifications. 

(a) Financial reports must include a certification, signed by an official who is authorized to legally bind the 
recipient, which reads as follows: “By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief 
that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are 
for the purposes and objectives set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. I am aware 
that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to 
criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code 
Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812).” 

(b) Subrecipients under the Federal award must certify to the pass-through entity whenever applying for 
funds, requesting payment, and submitting financial reports: “I certify to the best of my knowledge and 
belief that the information provided herein is true, complete, and accurate. I am aware that the provision 
of false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to 
criminal, civil, or administrative consequences including, but not limited to violations of U.S. Code Title 18, 
Sections 2, 1001, 1343 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812.” Each such certification must be 
maintained pursuant to the requirements of§ 200.334. This paragraph applies to all tiers of 
subrecipients. 

(c) Certification of cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal. Each cost allocation plan or indirect 
cost rate proposal must comply with the following: 

(1) A proposal to establish a cost allocation plan or an indirect cost rate, whether submitted to a Federal 
cognizant agency for indirect costs or maintained on file by the recipient, must be certified by the 
recipient using theCertificate of Cost Allocation PlanorCertificate of Indirect Costsas set forth in 
appendices III through VII, and IX of this part. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the 
recipient by an individual at a level no lower than the vice president or chief financial officer of the 
recipient that submits the proposal. 

(2) The Federal Government may either disallow all indirect costs or unilaterally establish an indirect 
cost rate when the recipient fails to submit a certified proposal for establishing a rate. This rate 
should be based upon audited historical data or other data furnished to the cognizant agency for 
indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated that all unallowable costs have been excluded. 
The rate established must ensure that potentially unallowable costs are not reimbursed. 
Alternatively, the recipient may use the de minimis indirect cost rate. See§ 200.414(f). 

(d) Nonprofit organizations must certify that they did not meet the definition of a major nonprofit organization 
as defined in§ 200.414(a), if applicable.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR STATES, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND INDIAN TRIBES 

§ 200.416 Cost allocation plans and indirect cost proposals. 

(a) Awards to states, local governments, and Indian Tribes are often implemented at the level of department 
within the State, local government, or Indian Tribe. A central service cost allocation plan is established to 
allow such department to claim a portion of centralized service costs that are incurred in proportion to 
the award's activities. Examples of centralized service costs may include motor pools, computer centers, 
purchasing, and accounting. Since Federal awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, 
there needs to be a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to 
benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan 
establishes this process. 

(b) Individual departments typically charge Federal awards for indirect costs through an indirect cost rate. A 
separate indirect cost rate proposal for each operating department is usually necessary to claim indirect 
costs under Federal awards. Indirect costs include: 

(1) The indirect costs originating in each operating department of the State, local government, or Indian 
Tribe carrying out Federal awards; and 

(2) The costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation 
plan and not otherwise treated as direct costs. 

(c) The requirements for developing and submitting cost allocation plans (for central service costs and public 
assistance programs) and indirect cost rate proposals are contained in appendices V, VI, and VII of this 
part. 

§ 200.417 Interagency service. 

An operating department may provide services to another operating department of the same State, local 
government, or Indian Tribe. In these instances, the cost of services provided may include allowable direct costs of 
the service plus a pro-rated share of indirect costs. A standard indirect cost rate equal to 15 percent of the direct 
salaries and wages for providing the service (excluding overtime, shift premiums, and fringe benefits) may be used 
instead of determining the actual indirect costs of the service. These services do not include centralized services 
that are included in central service cost allocation plans described inAppendix V of this part. 

Special Considerations for Institutions of Higher Education 

§ 200.418 Costs incurred by states and local governments. 

Costs incurred or paid by a State or local government on behalf of and in direct benefit to its IHEs are allowable. 
These costs include but are not limited to fringe benefit programs such as pension costs and Federal Insurance 
Contributions Act (FICA) costs. These costs are allowable regardless of whether they are recorded in the 
accounting records of the institutions, subject to the following conditions: 

(a) The costs meet the requirements of§ 200.402-200.411; 
2 CFR 200.418(a) (enhanced display) page 89 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.418(b) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(b) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with the applicable 
cost accounting principles of this part; and 

(c) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government. 
§ 200.419 Cost accounting standards. 

An IHE that receive an aggregate total $50 million or more in Federal awards and instruments subject to this 
subpart (as specified in§ 200.101) in its most recently completed fiscal year must comply with the Cost 
Accounting Standards Board's cost accounting standards located at48 CFR 9905.501,9905.502,9905.505, and 
9905.506. CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts awarded to the IHEs are subject to the broader range of CAS 
requirements at48 CFR 9900through9999and48 CFR part 30(FAR Part 30). 

GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR SELECTED ITEMS OF COST 

§ 200.420 Considerations for selected items of cost. 

(a) This section provides principles to be applied in establishing the allowability of certain items involved in 
determining cost, in addition to other requirements of this subpart. These principles apply whether or not 
a particular cost item is properly treated as a direct or indirect cost. 

(b) The following sections are not intended to be a comprehensive list of potential items of cost encountered 
under Federal awards. Failure to mention a particular item of cost, including as an example in certain 
sections, is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable. When determining the 
allowability for an item of cost, each case should be based on the treatment provided for similar or related 
items of cost and based on the principles described in§§ 200.402through200.411. In case of a 
discrepancy between the provisions of a specific Federal award and the provisions below, the Federal 
award governs. Criteria outlined in§ 200.403must be applied in determining allowability. 

§ 200.421 Advertising and public relations. 

(a) The term advertising costs means the costs of advertising media and corollary administrative costs. 
Advertising media includes, but is not limited to, magazines, newspapers, radio and television, direct mail, 
exhibits, and electronic or computer transmittals. 

(b) The only allowable advertising costs are those which are solely for: 
(1) The recruitment of personnel required by the recipient or subrecipient for the performance of a 
Federal award (See also§ 200.463); 

(2) The procurement of goods and services for the performance of a Federal award; 
(3) The disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the performance of a Federal award except 
when the recipient or subrecipient is reimbursed for disposal costs at a predetermined amount; or 

(4) Program outreach (for example, recruiting project participants) and other specific purposes 
necessary to meet the Federal award requirements. 

(c) The term “public relations” includes community relations and means those activities dedicated to 
maintaining the recipient's or subrecipient's image or maintaining or promoting understanding and 
favorable relations with the community or public at large or any segment of the public. 

(d) The only allowable public relations costs are:

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) Costs specifically required by the Federal award; 
(2) Costs of communicating with the public and press about specific activities or accomplishments 
which result from the performance of the Federal award (these costs are considered necessary as 
part of the outreach effort for the Federal award); or 

(3) Costs of conducting general liaison with news media and government public relations officers, to the 
extent that such activities are limited to communication and liaison necessary to keep the public 
informed on matters of public concern, such as notices of funding opportunities or financial matters. 

(e) Unallowable advertising and public relations costs include the following: 
(1) All advertising and public relations costs other than as specified inparagraphs (b)and(d)of this 
section; 

(2) Costs of meetings, conventions, conferences, or other events related to other activities of the entity 
(see also§ 200.432), including: 

(i) Costs of displays, demonstrations, and exhibits; 
(ii) Costs of meeting rooms, hospitality suites, and other special facilities used in conjunction with 
shows and other special events; and 

(iii) Salaries and wages of employees engaged in setting up and displaying exhibits, making 
demonstrations, and providing briefings; 

(3) Costs of promotional items and memorabilia; 
(4) Costs of advertising and public relations designed solely to promote the recipient or subrecipient. 
§ 200.422 Advisory councils. 

An advisory council or committee is a body that provides advice to the management of such entities as 
corporations, organizations, or foundations. Costs incurred by both internal and external advisory councils or 
committees are allowable if authorized by statute, the Federal agency, or as an indirect cost where allocable to 
Federal awards. See§ 200.444, which applies to States, local governments, and Indian Tribes. 

§ 200.423 Alcoholic beverages. 

The cost of alcoholic beverages is unallowable. 

§ 200.424 Alumni activities. 

Costs incurred by IHEs for, or in support of, alumni activities are unallowable. 

§ 200.425 Audit services. 

(a) A reasonably proportionate share of the costs of audits required by and performed in accordance with the 
Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), and the requirements of this part are 
allowable. However, the following audit costs are unallowable: 

(1) Any costs when audits required by the Single Audit Act andsubpart F of this parthave not been 
conducted, or have been conducted but not in accordance with the requirements; and

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(2) Except as provided for inparagraph (c)of this section, any costs of auditing a non-Federal entity that 
is exempted from having an audit conducted under the Single Audit Act andsubpart F of this part 
because its expenditures under Federal awards are less than $1,000,000 during its fiscal year.” 

(b) The costs of a financial statement audit of a recipient or subrecipient that does not currently have a 
Federal award may be included in the indirect cost pool for a cost allocation plan or indirect cost 
proposal. 

(c) Pass-through entities may charge Federal awards for the cost of agreed-upon procedures engagements to 
monitor subrecipients (in accordance with§§ 200.331-333) exempt from having an audit conducted 
under the Single Audit Act and therequirements of this part.This cost is allowable only if the agreed-upon 
procedures engagements are: 

(1) Conducted in accordance with GAGAS or applicable international attestation standards, as 
(2) Paid for and arranged by the pass-through entity; and 
(3) Limited in scope to one or more of the following types of compliance requirements: activities 
appropriate; 

allowed or unallowed; allowable costs/cost principles; eligibility; and reporting. 

§ 200.426 Bad debts. 

Bad debts (debts determined to be uncollectable), including losses (whether actual or estimated) arising from 
uncollectable accounts and other claims, are unallowable. Related collection costs, and related legal costs, arising 
from such debts are also unallowable. See§ 200.428. 

§ 200.427 Bonding costs. 

(a) Bonding costs arise when the Federal agency requires assurance against financial loss to itself or others 
because of an act or default of the recipient or subrecipient. They also arise when the recipient or 
subrecipient requires similar assurance, including bonds as bid, performance, payment, advance payment, 
infringement, and fidelity bonds for employees and officials. 

(b) Costs of bonding required under the Federal award's terms and conditions are allowable. 
(c) Costs of bonding required by the recipient or subrecipient in the general conduct of its operations are 
allowable as an indirect cost to the extent that such bonding is in accordance with sound business 
practice and the rates and premiums are reasonable under the circumstances. 

§ 200.428 Collections of improper payments. 

The costs incurred by a recipient or subrecipient to recover improper payments, including improper overpayments, 
are allowable as either direct or indirect costs, as appropriate. The recipient or subrecipient may use the amounts 
collected in accordance with cash management standards described in§ 200.305. 

§ 200.429 Commencement and convocation costs. 

For IHEs, costs incurred for commencements and convocations are unallowable, except as activity costs provided 
for in Appendix III, (B)(9) Student Administration and Services.

§ 200.430 Compensation—personal services. 

(a) General.Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, for 
services of employees rendered during the period of performance under the Federal award, including but 
not necessarily limited to wages and salaries. Compensation for personal services may also include 
fringe benefits addressed in§ 200.431. Costs of compensation are allowable to the extent that they 
satisfy the specific requirements of this part and that the total compensation for individual employees: 

(1) Is reasonable for the services rendered and conforms to the established written policy of the 
recipient or subrecipient consistently applied to both Federal and non-Federal activities; 

(2) Follows an appointment made in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's laws, rules, or 
written policies and meets the requirements of Federal statute, where applicable; and 

(3) Is determined and supported as provided inparagraph (g)of this section, when applicable. 
(b) Reasonableness.Compensation for employees engaged in work on Federal awards will be reasonable to 
the extent that it is consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the recipient or 
subrecipient. In cases where the kinds of employees required for Federal awards are not found in the 
other activities of the recipient or subrecipient, compensation will be considered reasonable to the extent 
that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient or subrecipient 
competes for the kind of employees involved. 

(c) Professional activities outside the recipient or subrecipient.Unless the Federal agency expressly 
authorizes an arrangement, a recipient or subrecipient must follow its written policies and procedures 
concerning the permissible extent of professional services that can be provided outside the recipient or 
subrecipient for non-organizational compensation. Where the recipient or subrecipient does not have 
written policies or procedures, or they do not adequately define the permissible extent of consulting or 
other non-organizational activities undertaken for extra outside pay, the Federal Government may require 
the recipient or subrecipient to allocate the effort of professional staff working on Federal awards 
between: 

(1) Recipient or subrecipient activities, and 
(2) Non-organizational professional activities. Appropriate arrangements governing compensation must 
be negotiated on a case-by-case basis if the Federal agency considers the extent of non-
organizational professional effort excessive or inconsistent with the conflicts-of-interest terms and 
conditions of the Federal award. 

(d) Unallowable costs. 
(1) Costs unallowable under other sections of these principles must not be allowable under this section 
solely because they constitute personnel compensation. 

(2) The allowable compensation for certain employees is subject to a ceiling in accordance with Federal 
statute. See10 U.S.C. 3744(a)(16),41 U.S.C. 1127, and41 U.S.C. 4304(a)(16)for the ceiling amount, 
covered compensation subject to the ceiling, covered employees, and other relevant provisions for 
cost-reimbursement contracts. For other types of Federal awards, other statutory ceilings may apply.

2 CFR 200.430(e) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(e) Special considerations.Special considerations in determining the allowability of compensation will be 
given to any change in a recipient's or subrecipient's compensation policy resulting in a substantial 
increase in its employees' level of compensation (particularly when the change was concurrent with an 
increase in the ratio of Federal awards to other activities) or any change in the treatment of allowability of 
specific types of compensation due to changes in Federal policy. 

(f) Incentive compensation.Incentive compensation to employees based on cost reduction, efficient 
performance, suggestion awards, or safety awards is allowable to the extent that the overall 
compensation is determined to be reasonable and such costs are paid or accrued according to an 
agreement entered into in good faith between the recipient or subrecipient and the employees before the 
services were rendered, or according to an established plan followed by the recipient or subrecipient so 
consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make such payment. 

(g) Standards for Documentation of Personnel Expenses. 
(1) Charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately reflect 
the work performed. These records must: 

(i) Be supported by a system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance that the 
charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated; 

(ii) Be incorporated into the official records of the recipient or subrecipient; 
(iii) Reasonably reflect the total activity for which the employee is compensated by the recipient or 
subrecipient, not exceeding 100 percent of compensated activities (for IHEs, this is the IBS); 

(iv) Encompass federally-assisted and all other activities compensated by the recipient or 
subrecipient on an integrated basis but may include the use of subsidiary records as defined in 
the recipient's or subrecipient's written policy; 

(v) Comply with the established accounting policies and procedures of the recipient or subrecipient 
(Seeparagraph (i)(1)(ii)of this section for treatment of incidental work for IHEs.); and 

(vi) Support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific activities or cost 
objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal award and non-
Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities 
allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or indirect 
cost activity. 

(vii) Budget estimates (meaning, estimates determined before the services are performed) alone do 
not qualify as support for charges to Federal awards, but may be used for interim accounting 
purposes, provided that: 

(A) The system for establishing the estimates produces reasonable approximations of the 
activity performed; 

(B) Significant changes in the related work activity (as defined by the recipient's or 
subrecipient's written policies) are promptly identified and entered into the records. Short-
term (such as one or two months) fluctuations between workload categories do not need 
to be considered as long as the distribution of salaries and wages is reasonable over the 
longer term; and

2 CFR 200.430(g)(1)(vii)(C) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(C) The recipient's or subrecipient's system of internal controls includes processes to perform 
periodic after-the-fact reviews of interim charges made to a Federal award based on 
budget estimates. All necessary adjustments must be made so that the final amount 
charged to the Federal award is accurate, allowable, and properly allocated. 

(viii) Because practices vary as to the activity constituting a full workload (for example, the 
Institutional Base Salary (IBS) for IHEs), records may reflect categories of activities expressed 
as a percentage distribution of total activities. 

(ix) It is recognized that teaching, research, service, and administration are often inextricably 
intermingled in an academic setting. Therefore, a precise assessment of factors contributing to 
costs is not required when IHEs record salaries and wages charged to Federal awards. 

(2) For records that meet the standards required inparagraph (g)(1)of this section, the recipient or 
subrecipient is not required to provide additional support or documentation for the work performed 
other than that referenced inparagraph (g)(3)of this section. 

(3) In accordance with Department of Labor regulations implementing the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA) (29 CFR part 516), charges for the salaries and wages of nonexempt employees, in addition 
to the supporting documentation described in this section, must also be supported by records 
indicating the total number of hours worked each day. 

(4) Salaries and wages of employees used in meeting cost sharing requirements on Federal awards 
must be supported in the same manner as salaries and wages claimed for reimbursement from 
Federal awards. 

(5) States, local governments, and Indian Tribes may use substitute processes or systems for allocating 
salaries and wages to Federal awards either in place of or in addition to the records described in 
paragraph (g)(1)of this section if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect cost. Such systems 
may include, but are not limited to, random moment sampling, “rolling” time studies, case counts, or 
other quantifiable measures of work performed. 

(i) Substitute systems that use sampling methods (primarily for Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and other 
public assistance programs) must meet acceptable statistical sampling standards, including: 

(A) The sampling universe must include all of the employees whose salaries and wages are to 
be allocated based on sample results except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iii); 

(B) The sample must cover the entire period involved; and 
(C) The results must be statistically valid and applied to the period being sampled. 
(ii) Allocating charges for the sampled employees' supervisors and clerical and support staff, 
based on the results of the sampled employees, will be acceptable. 

(iii) Less than full compliance with the statistical sampling standards noted in paragraph (5)(i) may 
be accepted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs if it concludes that the amounts 
allocated to Federal awards will be minimal or if it concludes that the system proposed by the 
recipient or subrecipient will result in lower costs to Federal awards than a system which 
complies with the standards.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(6) Cognizant agencies for indirect costs are encouraged to approve alternative proposals based on 
outcomes and milestones for program performance when these are clearly documented. These 
plans are acceptable as an alternative to requirements inparagraph (g)(1)of this section when 
approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. 

(7) For Federal awards of similar purpose activity or instances of approved blended funding, a recipient 
or subrecipient may submit performance plans that incorporate funds from multiple Federal awards 
and account for their combined use based on performance-oriented metrics, provided the plans are 
approved in advance by all involved Federal agencies. In these instances, the recipient or 
subrecipient must submit a request for waiver of the requirements based on documentation that 
describes the method of charging costs, relates the charging of costs to the specific activity that is 
applicable to all fund sources, and is based on quantifiable measures of the activity in relation to 
time charged. 

(8) For a recipient or subrecipient whose records do not meet the standards described in this section, 
the Federal Government may require personnel activity reports, including prescribed certifications, or 
equivalent documentation supporting the records as required in this section. 

(h) Nonprofit organizations.Thisparagraph (h)provides guidance specific to only nonprofit organizations. For 
compensation to members of nonprofit organizations, trustees, directors, associates, officers, or the 
immediate families thereof, a determination must be made that the compensation is reasonable for the 
actual personal services rendered rather than a distribution of earnings above actual costs. 
Compensation may include director's and executive committee member's fees, incentive awards, off-site 
or incentive pay, location allowances, hardship pay, and cost-of-living differentials. 

(i) Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs).This paragraph provides guidance specific to only IHEs. 
(1) Determining allowable personnel costs.Certain conditions require special consideration and possible 
limitations in determining allowable personnel compensation costs under Federal awards. Among 
such conditions are the following: 

(i) Allowable activities. Charges to Federal awards may include reasonable amounts for activities 
contributing and directly related to work under an agreement, such as delivering special 
lectures about specific aspects of the ongoing activity, writing reports and articles, developing 
and maintaining protocols (human, animals, etcetera), managing substances/chemicals, 
managing and securing project-specific data, coordinating research subjects, participating in 
appropriate seminars, consulting with colleagues and graduate students, and attending 
meetings and conferences. 

(ii) Incidental activities. Incidental activities for which supplemental compensation is allowable 
under the written institutional policy (at a rate not to exceed institutional base salary) do not 
need to be included in the records described in paragraph (g). To charge payments of incidental 
activities directly, such activities must either be expressly authorized in the Federal award 
budget or receive prior written approval by the Federal agency. 

(2) Salary basis.Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members during the 
academic year are allowable at the institutional base salary (IBS) rate. Except as noted in paragraph 
(i)(1)(ii), in no event will charges to Federal awards, irrespective of the basis of computation, exceed 
the proportionate share of the IBS for that period. This principle applies to all members of the faculty 
at an institution. IBS is the annual compensation paid by an IHE for an individual's appointment, 
whether that individual's time is spent on research, instruction, administration, or other activities. IBS 
excludes any income an individual earns outside of duties performed for the IHE. Unless there is

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.430(i)(3) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

prior approval by the Federal agency, charges of a faculty member's salary to a Federal award may 
not exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for the period during which the faculty member 
worked on the Federal award. 

(3) Intra-Institution of Higher Education (IHE) consulting.Intra-IHE consulting by faculty should be 
undertaken as an IHE responsibility requiring no compensation in addition to IBS. However, in 
unusual cases where consultation is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote 
operation, and the work performed by the faculty members is in addition to their regular 
responsibilities, any charges for such work representing additional compensation above IBS are 
allowable provided that such consulting arrangements are expressly authorized in the Federal award 
or approved in writing by the Federal agency. 

(4) Extra service pay.Extra service pay typically represents overload compensation, subject to 
institutional compensation policies for services above and beyond IBS. Where extra service pay 
results from Intra-IHE consulting, it is subject to the same requirements ofparagraph (b)of this 
section. It is allowable if all of the following conditions are met: 

(i) The IHE establishes consistent written policies which apply uniformly to all faculty members, 
not just those working on Federal awards. 

(ii) The IHE establishes a consistent written definition of work covered by IBS, which is specific 
enough to determine conclusively when work beyond that level has occurred. This definition 
may be described in appointment letters or other documentation. 

(iii) The supplementation amount paid is commensurate with the IBS pay rate and additional work 
performed. Seeparagraph (i)(2)of this section. 

(iv) The salaries, as supplemented, fall within the salary structure and pay ranges established by 
and documented in writing or otherwise applicable to the IHE. 

(v) The total salaries charged to Federal awards, including extra service payments, are subject to 
the standards of documentation as described in paragraph (g). 

(5) Periods outside the academic year. 
(i) Except as specified for teaching activity inparagraph (i)(5)(ii)of this section, charges for work 
performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in the base 
salary period must be at a rate not more than the IBS. 

(ii) Charges for teaching activities performed by faculty members on Federal awards during 
periods not included in IBS period must be based on the written policy of the IHE governing 
compensation to faculty members for teaching assignments during such periods. 

(6) Part-time faculty.Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members having only 
part-time appointments must be determined at a rate not more than that regularly paid for part-time 
assignments. 

(7) Sabbatical leave costs.Rules for sabbatical leave are as follows: 
(i) Costs of leaves of absence by employees for performance of graduate work or sabbatical 
study, travel, or research are allowable, provided the IHE has a uniform written policy on 
sabbatical leave for persons engaged in instruction and persons engaged in research. These 
costs must be allocated equitably among all related activities of the IHE.

(ii) Where sabbatical leave is included in fringe benefits for which a cost is determined for 
assessment as a direct charge, the aggregate amount of such assessments applicable to all 
work of the institution during the base period must be reasonable in relation to the IHE's actual 
experience under its sabbatical leave policy. 

(8) Salary rates for non-faculty members.Non-faculty full-time professional personnel may also earn 
“extra service pay” in accordance with the IHE's written policy and paragraph (i)(1)(i). 

§ 200.431 Compensation—fringe benefits. 

(a) General.Fringe benefits are allowances and services employers provide to their employees as 
compensation in addition to regular salaries and wages. Fringe benefits include, but are not limited to, the 
costs of leave, employee insurance, pensions, and unemployment benefits. Except as provided elsewhere 
in these principles, the costs of fringe benefits are allowable provided that the benefits are reasonable and 
are required by law, an organization-employee agreement, or an established policy of the recipient or 
subrecipient. 

(b) Leave.The cost of fringe benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during periods 
of authorized absences from the job, such as for annual leave, family-related leave, sick leave, holidays, 
court leave, military leave, administrative leave, and other similar benefits, are allowable if all of the 
following criteria are met: 

(1) They are provided under established written leave policies; 
(2) The costs are equitably allocated to all related activities, including Federal awards; and, 
(3) The accounting basis (cash or accrual) selected for costing each type of leave is consistently 
followed by the recipient or subrecipient or a specified grouping of employees. 

(i) When a recipient or subrecipient uses the cash basis of accounting, the cost of leave is 
recognized in the period that the leave is taken and paid for. Payments for unused leave when 
an employee retires or terminates employment are allowable in the year of payment and should 
be allocated as a general administrative expense to all activities or included in the fringe benefit 
rate. 

(ii) The accrual basis may be only used for those types of leave for which a liability as defined by 
GAAP exists when the leave is earned. When a recipient or subrecipient uses the accrual basis 
of accounting, allowable leave costs are the lesser of the amount accrued or funded. 

(c) Fringe benefits.The cost of fringe benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses for social 
security; employee life, health, unemployment, and worker's compensation insurance (except as indicated 
in§ 200.447); pension plan costs; and other similar benefits are allowable, provided such benefits are 
permitted under established written policies. The recipient or subrecipient must allocate fringe benefits to 
Federal awards and all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to 
the individuals or group(s) of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal 
awards and other activities, and charged as direct or indirect costs following the recipient's or 
subrecipient's accounting practices. 

(d) Cost objectives.The recipient or subrecipient may assign fringe benefits to cost objectives by identifying 
specific benefits to specific individual employees or by allocating them based on entity-wide salaries and 
wages of the employees receiving the benefits. When the allocation method is used, separate allocations 
must be made to selective groupings of employees unless the recipient or subrecipient demonstrates that 
costs in relationship to salaries and wages do not differ significantly for different groups of employees.

(e) Insurance.See also§ 200.447(d)(1)and(2). 
(1) Provisions for a reserve under a self-insurance program for unemployment compensation or workers' 
compensation are allowable to the extent that the provisions represent reasonable estimates of the 
liabilities for such compensation and the types of coverage, the extent of coverage, and rates and 
premiums would have been allowable had insurance been purchased to cover the risks. However, 
provisions for self-insured liabilities which do not become payable for more than one year after the 
provision is made must not exceed the present value of the liability. 

(2) Insurance costs on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar 
responsibility are allowable only to the extent that the insurance represents additional 
compensation. The cost of such insurance is unallowable when the recipient or subrecipient is 
named as beneficiary. 

(3) Actual claims paid to or on behalf of employees or former employees for workers' compensation, 
unemployment compensation, severance pay, and similar employee benefits (for example,postretirement 
health benefits) are allowable in the year of payment provided that the recipient or 
subrecipient follows a consistent costing policy. 

(f) Automobiles.That portion of automobile costs furnished by the recipient or subrecipient that relates to 
personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is unallowable as a fringe benefit 
or indirect costs regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees. 

(g) Pension plan costs.Pension plan costs incurred in accordance with the established written policies of the 
recipient or subrecipient are allowable, provided that: 
(1) Such policies meet the test of reasonableness. 
(2) The methods of cost allocation are not discriminatory. 
(3) The cost assigned to each fiscal year should be determined in accordance with GAAP, except for 
(4) The costs assigned to a given fiscal year are funded for all plan participants within six months after 
State and local governments. 

the end of that year. However, increases to normal and past service pension costs caused by a delay 
in funding the actuarial liability beyond 30 calendar days after each quarter of the year to which such 
costs are assignable are unallowable. The recipient or subrecipient may follow the “Cost Accounting 
Standard for Composition and Measurement of Pension Costs” (48 CFR 9904.412). 

(5) Premiums for pension plan termination insurance that are paid according to the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1301-1461) are allowable. Late payment 
charges on such premiums are unallowable. Excise taxes on accumulated funding deficiencies and 
other penalties imposed under ERISA are unallowable. 

(6) Pension plan costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an actuarial cost method 
recognized by GAAP and following the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies. 
(i) For pension plans financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those 
(ii) Pension costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable for 
representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries. 

a given fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year.

an extension if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges 
to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursement and the recipient's or 
subrecipient's contribution to the pension fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund or 
other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of 
Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the pension fund. 

(iii) Amounts funded by the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the actuarially determined amount 
for a fiscal year may be used as the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution in future periods. 

(iv) When a recipient or subrecipient establishes or converts to an acceptable actuarial cost 
method, as defined by GAAP, and funds pension costs in accordance with this method, the 
unfunded liability at the time of conversion is allowable if amortized over a period of years in 
accordance with GAAP. 

(v) Payments for unfunded pension costs must be charged in accordance with the allocation 
principles of this subpart. Specifically, the recipient or subrecipient may not charge unfunded 
pension costs directly to a Federal award if those unfunded pension costs are not allocable to 
that award. 

(vi) The recipient or subrecipient must provide the Federal Government an equitable share of any 
previously allowed pension costs (including subsequent earnings) that revert or inure to the 
recipient or subrecipient through a refund, withdrawal, or other credit. 

(h) Post-retirement health.A post-retirement health plan (PRHP) refers to the costs of health insurance or 
health services not included in a pension plan covered by paragraph (g) for retirees and their spouses, 
dependents, and survivors. PRHP costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an actuarial 
cost method recognized by GAAP and following the recipient's or subrecipient's established written 
policies. 

(1) For PRHP financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing 
actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries. 

(2) PRHP costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable for a given 
fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded 
after six months (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency for indirect costs) are allowable 
in the year funded. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension if an 
appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal 
Government and related Federal reimbursement and the recipient's or subrecipient's contributions to 
the PRHP fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund, reduction in the current year's PRHP 
costs, or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of 
Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the PRHP fund. 

(3) Amounts funded by the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a 
fiscal year may be used as the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution in future periods. 

(4) If a recipient or subrecipient establishes or converts to an actuarial cost method and funds PRHP 
costs in accordance with this method, the initial unfunded liability attributable to prior years is 
allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP, or, if no such GAAP period 
exists, over a period negotiated with the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

(5) Payments for unfunded PRHP costs must be charged in accordance with the allocation principles of 
this subpart. Specifically, the recipient or subrecipient may not charge unfunded PRHP costs directly 
to a Federal award if those unfunded PRHP costs are not allocable to that award. 

(6) To be allowable in the current year, the PRHP costs must be paid either to: 
(i) An insurer or other benefit provider as current year costs or premiums; or 
(ii) An insurer or trustee that will maintain a trust fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing 
post-retirement benefits to retirees and other beneficiaries. 

(7) The recipient or subrecipient must provide the Federal Government an equitable share of any 
previously allowed post-retirement benefit costs (including subsequent earnings) that revert or inure 
to the recipient or subrecipient through a refund, withdrawal, or other credit. 

(i) Severance pay. 
(1) Severance pay, also commonly referred to as dismissal wages, is a payment in addition to regular 
salaries and wages, by recipients and subrecipients to workers whose employment is being 
terminated. Severance pay is allowable only to the extent that, in each case, it is required by: 

(i) Law; 
(ii) Employer-employee agreement; 
(iii) Established policy that constitutes, in effect, an implied agreement on the recipient's or 
subrecipient's part; or 

(iv) Circumstances of the particular employment. 
(2) Costs of severance payments are divided into two categories as follows: 
(i) Actual severance payments for normal turnover must be allocated to all activities; or, where the 
recipient or subrecipient provides for a reserve for normal severances, such method is 
acceptable if the charge to current operations is reasonable in light of payments made for 
normal severances over a representative past period, and if amounts charged are allocated to 
all activities of the recipient or subrecipient. 

(ii) Measuring the costs of abnormal or mass severance pay by means of an accrual method will 
not achieve equity for both parties. Therefore, accruals are not allowable. However, the Federal 
Government recognizes its responsibility to contribute its fair share toward a specific payment. 
Prior approval by the Federal agency or cognizant agency for indirect cost, as appropriate, is 
required. 

(3) Costs incurred in severance pay packages that are in excess of the standard severance pay provided 
by the recipient or subrecipient to an employee upon termination of employment and that are paid to 
the employee contingent upon a change in management control over, or ownership of, the recipient's 
or subrecipient's assets, are unallowable. 

(4) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the recipient or subrecipient outside the 
United States, to the extent that the amount exceeds the customary or prevailing practices for the 
recipient or subrecipient in the United States, are unallowable unless they are required by applicable 
foreign law or necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal 
agency.

(5) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the recipient or subrecipient outside the 
United States due to the termination of the foreign national as a result of the closing of, or 
curtailment of activities by, the recipient or subrecipient in that country, are unallowable unless they 
are either: 

(i) Required by applicable foreign law; or 
(ii) Necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal agency. 
(j) For IHEs only. 
(1) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or tuition remission for individual 
employees are allowable, provided such benefits are granted in accordance with established written 
policies of the IHE and are distributed to all IHE activities on an equitable basis. Tuition benefits for 
family members other than the employee are unallowable. 

(2) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or tuition remission for individual 
employees not employed by the IHE are limited to the tax-free amount allowed by the Internal 
Revenue Code as amended (26 U.S.C. 127). 

(3) IHEs may offer employees tuition waivers or reductions, provided that the benefit does not 
discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Employees can exercise these benefits at 
other institutions according to institutional policy. See§ 200.466, for treatment of tuition remission 
provided to students. 

(k) Fringe benefit programs and other benefit costs. 
(1) For IHEs whose costs are paid by a State or local government, fringe benefit programs (such as 
pension costs and FICA) and any other benefits costs incurred specifically on behalf of, and in direct 
benefit to, the IHE, are allowable, subject to the following: 

(i) The costs meet the requirements of Basic Considerations in§§ 200.402through200.411; 
(ii) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with 
applicable Federal cost accounting principles; and 

(iii) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government. 
(2) The allowability of these costs for the IHE does not depend on whether they are recorded in the 
accounting records of the IHE.

§ 200.432 Conferences. 

A conference means an event whose primary purpose is to disseminate technical information beyond the recipient 
or subrecipient and is necessary and reasonable for successful performance under the Federal award. Allowable 
conference costs may include the rental of facilities, speakers' fees, attendance fees, costs of meals and 
refreshments, local transportation, and other items incidental to such conferences unless further restricted by the 
terms and conditions of the Federal award. The costs of identifying and providing locally available dependent-care 
resources for participants are allowable as needed. Conference hosts/sponsors must exercise discretion and 
judgment in ensuring that conference costs are appropriate, necessary, and managed to minimize costs to the 
Federal award. The Federal agency may authorize exceptions for programs including Indian Tribes, children, and the 
elderly. See also§§ 200.438,200.456, and200.475.

§ 200.433 Contingency provisions. 

(a) Contingency provisions are part of a budget estimate of future costs (typically of large construction 
projects, IT systems, or other items approved by the Federal agency) which are associated with possible 
events or conditions arising from causes for which the precise outcome is indeterminable at the time of 
estimate and that are likely to result, in the aggregate, in additional costs for the approved activity or 
project. Contingency amounts for major project scope changes, unforeseen risks, or extraordinary events 
must not be included in the budget estimates for a Federal award. 

(b) It is permissible for contingency amounts other than those excluded inparagraph (a)of this section to be 
explicitly included in budget estimates to the extent necessary to improve their precision. Contingency 
amounts must be estimated using broadly-accepted cost estimating methodologies, specified in the 
budget documentation of the Federal award, and accepted by the Federal agency. As such, contingency 
amounts are to be included in the Federal award. In order for actual costs incurred to be allowable, they 
must comply with the cost principles and other requirements of this part (see§§ 200.300and200.403), 
be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives, 
and be verifiable from the recipient's or subrecipient's records. 

(c) Payments to a recipient's or subrecipient's “contingency reserve” or any similar payment made for events 
the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to the time or intensity, or with an assurance 
of their happening, are unallowable, except as noted in§§ 200.431and200.447. 

§ 200.434 Contributions and donations. 

(a) Costs of contributions and donations, including cash, property, and services, from the recipient or 
subrecipient to other entities are unallowable. 

(b) The value of services and property donated (that is, in-kind donations) to the recipient or subrecipient may 
not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost. The value of donated services and 
property may be used to meet cost sharing requirements (see§ 200.306). Depreciation on donated 
assets is permitted so long as the donated property is not counted towards meeting cost sharing 
requirements (see§ 200.436). 

(c) Services donated or volunteered to the recipient or subrecipient may be provided by professional and 
technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor. The value of these services may 
not be charged to the Federal award as a direct or indirect cost. However, the value of donated services 
may be used to meet cost sharing requirements in accordance with the provisions of§ 200.306. 

(d) To the extent feasible, services donated to the recipient or subrecipient will be supported by the same 
methods used to support the allocability of regular personnel services. 

(e) The following provisions apply to nonprofit organizations. The value of services donated to a nonprofit 
organization and used in the performance of a direct cost activity must be considered in the 
determination of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect cost rate(s) and, accordingly, must be allocated a 
proportionate share of applicable indirect costs when the following circumstances exist: 

(1) The aggregate value of the services is material; 
(2) The services are supported by a significant amount of the indirect costs incurred by the recipient or 
subrecipient;

(i) In those instances where there is no basis for determining the fair market value of the services 
rendered, the recipient or subrecipient and the cognizant agency for indirect costs must 
negotiate an appropriate allocation of indirect cost to the services. 

(ii) Where donated services directly benefit a project supported by the Federal award, the indirect 
costs allocated to the services will be considered as a part of the project's total costs. Such 
indirect costs may be reimbursed under the Federal award or used to meet cost sharing 
requirements. 

(f) Fair market value of donated services must be computed as described in§ 200.306. 
(g) Personal property and use of space. 
(1) Donated personal property and use of space may be furnished to a recipient or subrecipient. The 
value of the personal property and space may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct 
or indirect cost. 

(2) The value of the donations of personal property and use of space may be used to meet cost sharing 
requirements described in§ 200.300. The recipient or subrecipient must value the donations in 
accordance with§ 200.300. Where the recipient or subrecipient treats donations as indirect costs, 
indirect cost rates must separate the value of the donations so that reimbursement is not made. 

§ 200.435 Defense and prosecution of criminal and civil proceedings, claims, appeals and 
patent infringements. 

(a) Definitions for this section— 
(1) Convictionmeans a judgment or conviction of a criminal offense by any court of competent 
jurisdiction, whether entered upon verdict or a plea, including a conviction due to a plea of nolo

(2) Costsinclude the services that bear a direct relationship to a judicial or administrative proceeding 
and provided by in-house or private counsel, accountants, consultants, or others engaged to assist 
the recipient or subrecipient before, during, or after the commencement of that proceeding. 

(3) Fraudmeans: 
(i) Acts of fraud or corruption or attempts to defraud the Federal Government or to corrupt its 
agents, 

(ii) Acts that constitute a cause for debarment or suspension (as specified in agency regulations),

imposition of a monetary penalty, or an order issued by the Federal agency head or 
delegate to the recipient or subrecipient to take corrective action under10 U.S.C. 4701or 
41 U.S.C. 4712. 

(D) A final decision by an appropriate Federal official to debar or suspend the recipient or 
subrecipient, to rescind or void a Federal award, or to terminate a Federal award because 
of a violation or failure to comply with a statute, regulation, or the terms and conditions of 
the Federal award. 

(E) A disposition by consent or compromise if the action could have resulted in any of the 
dispositions described inparagraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A)through(D)of this section. 

(2) If more than one proceeding involves the same alleged misconduct, the costs of all such 
proceedings are unallowable if any results in one of the dispositions shown inparagraph (b)of this 
section. 

(c) Allowability of costs for proceeding commenced by Federal Government.If a proceeding referred to in 
paragraph (b)of this section is commenced by the Federal Government and is resolved by consent or 
compromise pursuant to an agreement by the recipient or subrecipient and the Federal Government, then 
the costs incurred may be allowed to the extent expressly authorized in the agreement. 

(d) Allowability of costs for proceeding commenced by State, local, or foreign government.If a proceeding 
referred to inparagraph (b)of this section is commenced by a State, local or foreign government, then the 
costs incurred may be allowed if the authorized Federal official determines that the costs were incurred 
as a result of: 

(1) A specific term or condition of the Federal award, or 
(2) Specific written direction of an authorized official of the Federal agency. 
(e) Allowability of costs in general.Costs incurred in connection with proceedings described in paragraph (b), 
and not made unallowable by that paragraph, may be allowed to the extent that: 

(1) The costs are reasonable and necessary for the administration of the Federal award and activities 
required to deal with the proceeding and the underlying cause of action; 

(2) Payment of the reasonable, necessary, allocable and otherwise allowable costs incurred is not 
prohibited by any other provision(s) of the Federal award;

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(3) The costs are not recovered from the Federal Government or a third party, either directly as a result 
of the proceeding or otherwise; and, 

(4) An authorized Federal official has determined the percentage of costs allowed considering the 
complexity of litigation, generally accepted principles governing the award of legal fees in civil 
actions involving the United States, and other factors that may be appropriate. This percentage must 
not exceed 80 percent unless an agreement under paragraph (c) has explicitly considered this 
limitation and permitted a higher percentage. In that case, the total amount of costs incurred may be 
allowable. 

(f) Major Fraud Act.Costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient in connection with the defense of suits 
brought by its employees or ex-employees under section 2 of the Major Fraud Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C.

against the Federal Government, including appeals of final Federal agency decisions, are unallowable. 

(h) Patent infringement litigation.Costs of legal, accounting, and consultant services, and related costs 
incurred in connection with patent infringement litigation, are unallowable unless otherwise provided for 
in the Federal award. 

(i) Potentially unallowable costs.Costs that may be unallowable under this section, including directly 
associated costs, must be segregated and accounted for separately. During the pendency of any 
proceeding covered byparagraphs (b)and(f)of this section, the Federal Government must generally 
withhold payment of such costs. However, if in its best interests, the Federal Government may provide for 
conditional payment upon provision of adequate security, or other adequate assurance, and agreement to 
repay all unallowable costs, plus interest, if the costs are subsequently determined to be unallowable. 

§ 200.436 Depreciation. 

(a) Depreciation is the method for allocating the cost of fixed assets to periods benefitting from asset use. 
The recipient or subrecipient may be compensated for the use of its buildings, capital improvements, 
equipment, and software projects capitalized in accordance with GAAP provided that they are needed and 
used in the recipient's or subrecipient's activities and correctly allocated to Federal awards. The 
compensation must be made by computing the proper depreciation. 

(b) The allocation for depreciation must be made in accordance with Appendices III through IX of this part. 
(c) Depreciation is computed applying the following rules. The computation of depreciation must be based 
on the acquisition cost of the assets involved. For an asset donated to the recipient or subrecipient by a 
third party, its fair market value at the time of the donation must be considered as the acquisition cost. 
Such assets may be depreciated or claimed as cost sharing but not both. When computing depreciation 
charges, the acquisition cost will exclude: 

(1) The cost of land; 
(2) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Federal Government, 
irrespective of where the title was originally vested or is presently located; 

(3) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment contributed by or for the recipient or subrecipient 
that is already claimed as cost sharing or where law or agreement prohibits recovery; and 

(4) Any asset acquired solely for the performance of a non-Federal award.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(d) When computing depreciation charges, the following must be observed: 
(1) The period of useful service or useful life established in each case for usable capital assets must 
take into consideration such factors as the type of construction, nature of the equipment, 
technological developments in the particular area, historical data, and the renewal and replacement 
policies followed for the individual items or classes of assets involved. 

(2) The depreciation method used to charge the cost of an asset (or group of assets) to accounting 
periods must reflect the pattern of consumption of the asset during its useful life. In the absence of 
clear evidence indicating that the expected consumption of the asset will be significantly greater in 
the early portions than in the later portions of its useful life, the straight-line method must be 
presumed to be the appropriate method. Once used, depreciation methods may not be changed 
unless approved in advance by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The depreciation methods 
used to calculate the depreciation amounts for indirect cost rate purposes must be the same 
methods used by the recipient or subrecipient for its financial statements. 

(3) The entire building, including the shell and all components, may be treated as a single asset and 
depreciated over a single useful life. A building may also be divided into multiple components. Each 
component may be depreciated over its estimated useful life in this case. The building components 
must be grouped into three general components: building shell (including construction and design 
costs), building services systems (for example, elevators, HVAC, and plumbing system), and fixed 
equipment (for example, sterilizers, casework, fume hoods, cold rooms, and glassware/washers). A 
cognizant agency for indirect costs may authorize a recipient or subrecipient to use more than these 
three groupings in exceptional cases. When a recipient or subrecipient elects to depreciate its 
buildings by their components, the same depreciation method must be used for indirect and 
financial statements purposes, as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2). 

(4) No depreciation may be allowed on assets that have outlived their depreciable lives. 
(5) Where the depreciation method is introduced to replace the use allowance method, depreciation 
must be computed as if the asset had been depreciated over its entire life (meaning, from the date 
the asset was acquired and ready for use to the date of disposal or withdrawal from service). The 
total amount of use allowance and depreciation for an asset (including imputed depreciation 
applicable to periods before the conversion from the use allowance method and depreciation after 
the conversion) may not exceed the total acquisition cost of the asset. 

(e) Adequate property records must support depreciation charges, and physical inventories must be taken at 
least once every two years to ensure that the assets exist and are usable, used, and needed. The recipient 
or subrecipient may use statistical sampling techniques when taking these inventories. In addition, the 
recipient or subrecipient must maintain adequate depreciation records showing the amount of 
depreciation. 

§ 200.437 Employee health and welfare costs. 

(a) Costs incurred in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies for 
improving working conditions, employer-employee relations, employee health, and employee performance 
are allowable. 

(b) These costs must be equitably apportioned to all activities of the recipient or subrecipient. Income 
generated from these activities must be credited to the cost thereof unless such income has been 
irrevocably sent to employee welfare organizations.

(c) Losses resulting from operating food services are allowable only if the recipient's or subrecipient's 
objective is to operate food services on a break-even basis. Losses sustained because of operating 
objectives other than the above are allowable only when: 

(1) The recipient or subrecipient can demonstrate unusual circumstances; and 
(2) Approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. 
§ 200.438 Entertainment and prizes. 

(a) Entertainment costs.Costs of entertainment, including amusement, diversion, and social activities and 
any associated costs (such as gifts), are unallowable unless they have a specific and direct programmatic 
purpose and are included in a Federal award. 

(b) Prizes.Costs of prizes or challenges are allowable if they have a specific and direct programmatic 
purpose and are included in the Federal award. Federal agencies should refer to OMB guidance in M-10-11 
“Guidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government,” issued March 8, 2010, or 
its successor. 

§ 200.439 Equipment and other capital expenditures. 

(a) See§ 200.1for the definitions ofcapital expenditures, equipment, special purpose equipment, general 
purpose equipment, acquisition cost, and capital assets. 

(b) The following rules of allowability must apply to equipment and other capital expenditures: 
(1) Capital expenditures for general purpose equipment, buildings, and land are allowable as direct 
costs, but only with the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. 

(2) Capital expenditures for special purpose equipment are allowable as direct costs, provided that 
items with a unit cost of $10,000 or more have the prior written approval of the Federal agency or 
pass-through entity. 

(3) Capital expenditures for improvements to land, buildings, or equipment that materially increase their 
value or useful life are allowable as a direct cost, but only with the prior written approval of the 
Federal agency or pass-through entity. See§ 200.436on the allowability of depreciation on 
buildings, capital improvements, and equipment. See§ 200.465on the allowability of real property 
and equipment rental costs. 

(4) When approved as a direct cost in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (3), capital 
expenditures must be charged in the period in which the expenditure is incurred or as otherwise 
determined appropriate and negotiated with the Federal agency. 

(5) The recipient or subrecipient may claim the unamortized portion of any equipment written off as a 
result of a change in capitalization levels by continuing to claim the otherwise allowable depreciation 
on the equipment or by amortizing the amount to be written off over a period of years negotiated 
with the cognizant agency for indirect cost. 

(6) Cost of equipment disposal. If the Federal agency instructs the recipient or subrecipient to otherwise 
dispose of or transfer the equipment, the costs of disposal or transfer are allowable. 

(7) Equipment and other capital expenditures are unallowable as indirect costs. See§ 200.436.

§ 200.440 Exchange rates. 

(a) Cost increases for fluctuations in exchange rates are allowable costs subject to the availability of funding. 
Prior approval of exchange rate fluctuations is required only when the change results in the need for 
additional Federal funding, or the increased costs result in the need to significantly reduce the scope of 
the project. Before providing approval, the Federal agency must ensure that adequate funds are available 
to cover currency fluctuations in order to avoid a violation of the Antideficiency Act. 

(b) The recipient or subrecipient is required to make reviews of local currency gains to determine the need for 
additional Federal funding before the expiration date of the Federal award. Subsequent adjustments for 
currency increases may be allowable only when the recipient or subrecipient provides the Federal agency 
with adequate source documentation from a commonly used source in effect at the time the expense 
was made, and to the extent that sufficient Federal funds are available. 

§ 200.441 Fines, penalties, damages and other settlements. 

Costs resulting from recipient or subrecipient violations of, alleged violations of, or failure to comply with, Federal, 
State, local, tribal, or foreign laws and regulations are unallowable, except when incurred as a result of compliance 
with specific provisions of the Federal award, or with the prior written approval of the Federal agency. See§ 
200.435. 

§ 200.442 Fundraising and investment management costs. 

(a) Costs of organized fundraising, including financial campaigns, endowment drives, solicitation of gifts and 
bequests, and similar expenses incurred to raise capital or obtain contributions, are unallowable. 
Fundraising costs for meeting the Federal program objectives are allowable with the prior written approval 
of the Federal agency. 

(b) Costs of investment counsel and staff and similar expenses incurred to enhance income from 
investments are unallowable except when associated with investments covering pension, self-insurance, 
or other funds, which include Federal participation allowed by this part. 

(c) Costs related to the physical custody and control of monies and securities are allowable. 
(d) Both allowable and unallowable fundraising and investment activities must be allocated an appropriate 
share of indirect costs in accordance with§ 200.413. 

§ 200.443 Gains and losses on the disposition of depreciable assets. 

(a) The recipient or subrecipient must include gains and losses on the sale, retirement, or other disposition of 
depreciable property in the year they occur as credits or charges to the asset cost grouping(s) of the 
property. The amount of the gain or loss is the difference between the amount realized on the property 
and the undepreciated basis of the property. 

(b) Gains and losses from the disposition of depreciable property must not be recognized as a separate 
credit or charge under the following conditions: 

(1) The gain or loss is processed through a depreciation account and is reflected in the depreciation 
allowable under§§ 200.436and200.439. 

(2) The property is given in exchange as part of the purchase price of a similar item, and the gain or loss 
is taken into account in determining the depreciation cost basis of the new item. 

(3) A loss results from failing to maintain proper insurance, except as provided in§ 200.447.

(4) Compensation for the use of the property was provided through use allowances instead of 
depreciation. 

(5) Gains and losses arising from extraordinary or bulk sales, retirements, or other dispositions must be 
considered on a case-by-case basis. 

(c) Gains or losses of any nature arising from the sale or exchange of property other than the property 
covered inparagraph (a)of this section must be excluded in computing Federal award costs. 

(d) When assets acquired with Federal funds, in part or wholly, are disposed of, the distribution of the 
proceeds must be made in accordance with§§ 200.310through200.316. 

§ 200.444 General costs of government. 

(a) For states, local governments, and Indian Tribes, the general costs of government are unallowable except 
as provided in§ 200.475. Unallowable costs include: 

(1) Salaries and expenses of the Office of the Governor of a State or the chief executive of a local 
government or the chief executive of an Indian Tribe; 

(2) Salaries and other expenses of a State legislature, tribal council, or similar local governmental body, 
such as a county supervisor, city council, or school board, whether incurred for purposes of 
legislation or executive direction; 

(3) Costs of the judicial branch of a government; 
(4) Costs of prosecutorial activities unless treated as a direct cost to a specific program if authorized by 
statute or regulation. However, this does not preclude the allowability of other legal activities of the 
Attorney General as described in§ 200.435; and 

(5) Costs of other general types of government services normally provided to the general public, such as 
fire and police, unless provided as a direct cost under a program statute or regulation. 

(b) Indian Tribes and Councils of Governments (COGs) (see definition forLocal governmentin§ 200.1) may 
include up to 50 percent of salaries and expenses directly attributable to managing and operating Federal 
programs by the chief executive and their staff in the indirect cost calculation without documentation. 

§ 200.445 Goods or services for personal use. 

(a) Costs of goods or services for the personal use of the recipient's or subrecipient's employees are 
unallowable regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees. 

(b) Housing costs (for example, depreciation, maintenance, utilities, furnishings, rent), housing allowances, 
and personal living expenses for the recipient's or subrecipient's employees are only allowable as direct 
costs and must be approved in advance by the Federal agency. 

§ 200.446 Idle facilities and idle capacity. 

(a) Definitions for the purpose of this section: 
(1) Facilities means land and buildings or any portion thereof, equipment individually or collectively, or 
any other tangible capital asset, wherever located, and whether owned or leased by the recipient or 
subrecipient. 

(2) Idle facilities mean completely unused facilities that exceed the recipient's or subrecipient's current 
needs.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(3) Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used facilities. It is the difference between: 
(i) That which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time on a one-shift basis less 
operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, 
and other normal delays; and 

(ii) The extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting 
period. A multi-shift basis should be used if it can be shown that this amount of usage would 
normally be expected for the type of facility involved. 

(4) Cost of idle facilities or idle capacity means maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related 
costs (for example, insurance, interest, and depreciation). These costs could include the costs of 
idle public safety emergency facilities, telecommunications, or information technology system 
capacity that is built to withstand major fluctuations in load (for example, consolidated data 
centers). 

(b) The costs of idle facilities are unallowable except to the extent that: 
(1) They are necessary to meet workload requirements which may fluctuate, and are allocated 
appropriately to all benefiting programs; or 

(2) Although not necessary to meet fluctuations in workload, they were necessary when acquired and 
are now idle because of changes in program requirements, efforts to achieve more economical 
operations, reorganization, termination, or other causes which could not have been reasonably 
foreseen. Under this exception, costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period, 
ordinarily not to exceed one year, depending on the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose of such 
facilities. 

(c) The costs of idle capacity are normal costs of doing business and are a factor in the normal fluctuations 
of usage or indirect cost rates from period to period. These costs are allowable, provided that the 
capacity is reasonably anticipated to be necessary to carry out the purpose of the Federal award or was 
originally reasonable and is not subject to reduction or elimination by use on other Federal awards, 
subletting, renting, or sale, in accordance with sound business, economic, or security practices. 
Widespread idle capacity throughout an entire facility or among a group of assets having substantially the 
same function may be considered idle facilities. 

§ 200.447 Insurance and indemnification. 

(a) Costs of insurance required or approved and maintained by the terms and conditions of the Federal award 
are allowable. 

(b) Costs of other insurance in connection with the general conduct of activities are allowable subject to the 
following limitations: 

(1) The types, extent, and cost of coverage are in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's 
established written policy and sound business practices. 

(2) Costs of insurance or contributions to any reserve covering the risk of loss of, or damage to, Federal 
Government property are unallowable except to the extent that the Federal agency has approved the 
costs. 

(3) Costs allowed for business interruption or other similar insurance must exclude coverage of 
management fees.

(4) Insurance costs on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar 
responsibilities are allowable only when the insurance represents additional compensation (see§ 
200.431). This insurance is unallowable when the recipient or subrecipient is identified as the 
beneficiary. 

(5) Insurance costs to correct defects in the recipient's or subrecipient's materials or workmanship are 
unallowable. 

(6) Medical liability (malpractice) insurance is an allowable cost of a Federal research program only 
when the program involves human subjects or training of participants in research techniques. 
Medical liability insurance costs must be treated as a direct cost and assigned to individual projects 
based on how the insurer allocates the risk to the population covered by the insurance. 

(c) Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible insurance (through a self-insurance program 
or otherwise) are unallowable unless expressly authorized in the Federal award. However, costs incurred 
because of losses not covered under nominal deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with 
sound management practice, and minor losses not covered by insurance, such as spoilage, breakage, and 
disappearance of small hand tools, which occur in the ordinary course of operations, are allowable. 

(d) Contributions to a reserve for a self-insurance program, including workers' compensation, unemployment 
compensation, and severance pay, are allowable subject to the following requirements: 

(1) The type, extent, and cost of coverage and the rates and premiums would have been allowed had 
insurance (including reinsurance) been purchased to cover the risks. However, a provision for known 
or reasonably estimated self-insured liabilities, which do not become payable for more than one year 
after the provision is made, must not exceed the discounted present value of the liability. The rate 
used for discounting the liability must be determined by considering factors such as the recipient's 
or subrecipient's settlement rate for those liabilities and its investment rate of return. 

(2) Earnings or investment income on reserves must be credited to those reserves. 
(3) 
(i) Contributions to reserves must be based on sound actuarial principles using historical 
experience and reasonable assumptions. Reserve levels must be analyzed and updated at least 
biennially for each major risk being insured and take into account any reinsurance, coinsurance, 
and other relevant factors or information. Reserve levels related to employee-related coverages 
must normally be limited to the value of claims: 

(A) Submitted and adjudicated but not paid; 
(B) Submitted but not adjudicated; and 
(C) Incurred but not submitted. 
(ii) Reserve exceeding the levels described inparagraph (d)(3)(i)of this section must be identified 
and justified in the cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal. 

(4) Accounting records, actuarial studies, and cost allocations (or billings) must recognize any 
significant differences due to the types of insured risk and losses generated by the various insured 
activities or agencies of the recipient or subrecipient. If individual departments or agencies of the 
recipient or subrecipient experience significantly different levels of claims for a particular risk, those 
differences must be recognized by using separate allocations or other techniques resulting in an 
equitable allocation.

(5) Whenever funds are transferred from a self-insurance reserve to other accounts (for example, 
general fund or unrestricted account), refunds must be made to the Federal Government for its share 
of funds transferred, including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, 
if applicable, chargeable in accordance with the claims collection regulations of the cognizant 
agency for indirect cost. 

(e) Insurance refunds must be credited against insurance costs in the year the refund is received. 
(f) Indemnification includes securing the recipient or subrecipient against liabilities to third persons and 
other losses not compensated by insurance or otherwise. The Federal Government is obligated to 
indemnify the recipient or subrecipient only to the extent expressly provided for in the Federal award, 
except as provided in paragraph (c). 

§ 200.448 Intellectual property. 

(a) Patent and copyright costs. 
(1) The following costs related to securing patents and copyrights are allowable: 
(i) Costs of preparing disclosures, reports, and other documents required by the Federal award and 
of searching the art to the extent necessary to make such disclosures; 

(ii) Costs of preparing documents and any other patent costs in connection with the filing and 
prosecution of a United States patent application where the Federal Government requires that a 
title or a royalty-free license be conveyed to the Federal Government; and 

(iii) General counseling services relating to patent and copyright matters, such as advice on patent 
and copyright laws, regulations, clauses, and employee intellectual property agreements (See§ 
200.459). 

(2) The following costs related to securing patents and copyrights are unallowable: 
(i) Costs of preparing disclosures, reports, and other documents and of searching the art to make 
disclosures not required by the Federal award; 

(ii) Costs in connection with filing and prosecuting any foreign patent application, or any United 
States patent application, where the Federal award does not require conveying title or a royalty-
free license to the Federal Government. 

(b) Royalties and other costs for the use of patents and copyrights. 
(1) Royalties on a patent or copyright or amortization of the cost of acquiring by purchase a copyright, 
patent, or rights thereto, necessary for the proper performance of the Federal award are allowable 
unless: 

(i) The Federal Government already has a license or the right to free use of the patent or copyright. 
(ii) The patent or copyright has been adjudicated to be invalid or administratively determined to be 
invalid. 

(iii) The patent or copyright is considered to be unenforceable. 
(iv) The patent or copyright is expired. 
(2) Special care should be exercised in determining reasonableness when the royalties may have been 
obtained as a result of less-than-arm's-length bargaining, such as:

(i) Royalties paid to persons, including corporations, affiliated with the recipient or subrecipient. 
(ii) Royalties paid to unaffiliated parties, including corporations, under an agreement entered into in 
contemplation that a Federal award would be made. 

(iii) Royalties paid under an agreement entered into after a Federal award is made to a recipient or 
subrecipient. 

(3) In any case involving a patent or copyright formerly owned by the recipient or subrecipient, the 
amount of royalty allowed must not exceed the cost which would have been allowed had the 
recipient or subrecipient retained ownership. 

§ 200.449 Interest. 

(a) General.Costs incurred for interest on borrowed capital, temporary use of endowment funds, or the use of 
the recipient's or subrecipient's own funds are unallowable. Financing costs (including interest) to acquire, 
construct, or replace capital assets are allowable, subject to the requirements of this section. 

(b) Capital assets. 
(1) Capital assets is defined in§ 200.1. An asset cost includes (as applicable) acquisition costs, 
construction costs, and other costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP. 

(2) For recipient or subrecipient fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, intangible assets 
include patents and computer software. For software development projects, only interest 
attributable to the portion of the project costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP is allowable. 

(c) Requirements for all recipients and subrecipients. 
(1) The recipient or subrecipient uses the capital assets in support of Federal awards; 
(2) The allowable asset costs to acquire facilities and equipment are limited to a fair market value 
available to the recipient or subrecipient from an unrelated (arm's length) third party. 

(3) The recipient or subrecipient obtains the financing via an arm's-length transaction (meaning, a 
transaction with an unrelated third party); or claims reimbursement of actual interest cost at a rate 
available via such a transaction. 

(4) The recipient or subrecipient limits claims for Federal reimbursement of interest costs to the least 
expensive alternative. For example, a lease contract that transfers ownership by the end of the 
contract may be determined less costly than purchasing through other types of debt financing, in 
which case reimbursement must be limited to the amount of interest determined if leasing had been 
used. 

(5) The recipient or subrecipient expenses or capitalizes allowable interest cost in accordance with 
GAAP. 

(6) Earnings generated by the investment of borrowed funds pending their disbursement for the asset 
costs are used to offset the current period's allowable interest cost, whether that cost is expensed or 
capitalized. Earnings subject to being reported to the Federal Internal Revenue Service under 
arbitrage requirements are excludable.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(7) The following conditions must apply to debt arrangements over $1 million to purchase or construct 
facilities unless the recipient or subrecipient makes an initial equity contribution to the purchase of 
25 percent or more. For this purpose, “initial equity contribution” means the amount or value of 
contributions made by the recipient or subrecipient for the acquisition of facilities prior to 
occupancy. 

(i) The recipient or subrecipient must reduce claims for reimbursement of interest cost by an 
amount equal to imputed interest earnings on excess cash flow attributable to the portion of 
the facility used for Federal awards. 

(ii) The recipient or subrecipient must impute interest on excess cash flow as follows: 
(A) Annually, the recipient or subrecipient must prepare a cumulative (from the project's 
inception) report of monthly cash inflows and outflows, regardless of the funding source. 
For this purpose, inflows consist of Federal reimbursement for depreciation, amortization 
of capitalized construction interest, and annual interest cost. Outflows consist of initial 
equity contributions, debt principal payments (less the pro-rata share attributable to the 
cost of land), and interest payments. 

(B) To compute monthly cash inflows and outflows, the recipient or subrecipient must divide 
the above-mentioned annual amounts by the months in the year (usually 12) that the 
building is in service. 

(C) For any month in which cumulative cash inflows exceed cumulative outflows, interest 
must be calculated on the excess inflows for that month and be treated as a reduction to 
allowable interest cost. The interest rate to be used must be the three-month Treasury bill 
closing rate as of the last business day of that month. 

(8) Interest attributable to a fully depreciated asset is unallowable. 
(d) Additional requirements for states, local governments and Indian Tribes.For interest costs to be allowable 
for states, local governments, and Indian Tribes, the recipient or subrecipient must have incurred the 
interest costs for buildings after October 1, 1980, or after September 1, 1995, for land and equipment. 

(1) The requirement to offset the interest earned on borrowed funds against allowable interest cost 
(paragraph (c)(5)of this section) also applies to earnings on debt service reserve funds. 

(2) The recipient or subrecipient must negotiate the amount of allowable interest cost related to the 
acquisition of facilities with asset costs of $1 million or more, as described inparagraph (c)(7)of 
this section. For this purpose, a recipient or subrecipient must consider only cash inflows and 
outflows attributable to that portion of the real property used for Federal awards. 

(e) Additional requirements for IHEs.For interest costs to be allowable, the IHE must have incurred the 
interest costs after July 1, 1982, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that 
date. 

(f) Additional requirements for nonprofit organizations.For interest costs to be allowable, the nonprofit 
organization must have incurred the interest costs after September 29, 1995, in connection with 
acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date. 

(g) Requirements for nonprofit organizations subject to full coverage under CAS.The interest allowability 
provisions of this section do not apply to a nonprofit organization subject to “full coverage” under the Cost 
Accounting Standards (CAS), as defined at48 CFR 9903.201-2(a). The nonprofit organization's Federal

§ 200.450 Lobbying. 

(a) Lobbying costs associated with obtaining Federal assistance awards.The costs of certain influencing 
activities associated with obtaining grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or loans are unallowable. 
Lobbying with respect to certain grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and loans is governed by 
relevant statutes, including the provisions of31 U.S.C. 1352, as well as the common rule, “New

(2) The following activities are excepted from the coverage ofparagraph (c)(1)of this section: 
(i) Technical and factual presentations on topics directly related to the performance of a grant, 
contract, or other agreement (through hearing testimony, statements, or letters to the Congress 
or a State legislature, or subdivision, member, or cognizant staff member thereof), in response 
to a documented request (including a Congressional Record notice requesting testimony or 
statements for the record at a regularly scheduled hearing) made by the recipient's or 
subrecipient's member of congress, legislative body, subdivision, or a cognizant staff member 
thereof, provided such information is readily obtainable and can be readily put in deliverable 
form, and further provided that costs under this section for travel, lodging or meals are 
unallowable unless incurred to offer testimony at a regularly scheduled Congressional hearing 
pursuant to a written request for such presentation made by the Chairman or Ranking Minority 
Member of the Committee or Subcommittee conducting such hearings; 

(ii) Any lobbying made unallowable byparagraph (c)(1)(iii)of this section to influence State 
legislation to directly reduce the cost, or to avoid material impairment of the recipient's or 
subrecipient's authority to perform the grant, contract, or other agreement; 

(iii) Any activity specifically authorized by statute to be undertaken with funds from the Federal 
award; or 

(iv) Any activity excepted from the definitions of “lobbying” or “influencing legislation” by the 
Internal Revenue Code provisions that require nonprofit organizations to limit their participation 
in direct and “grass roots” lobbying activities to retain their charitable deduction status and 
avoid punitive excise taxes, 26 U.S.C. (I.R.C.) 501(c)(3), 501(h), 4911(a), including: 

(A) Nonpartisan analysis, study, or research reports; 
(B) Examinations and discussions of broad social, economic, and similar problems; and 
(C) Information provided upon request by a legislator for technical advice and assistance, as 
defined by I.R.C. 4911(d)(2) and26 CFR 56.4911-2(c)(1)through(c)(3).

be identified separately in the indirect cost rate proposal and thereafter be treated as other 
unallowable activity costs in accordance with§ 200.413. 

(4) The recipient or subrecipient must submit a certification that the requirements and standards of this 
section have been complied with as part of its annual indirect cost rate proposal. (See§ 200.415.) 

(5) 
(i) Time logs, calendars, or similar records are not required to be created for purposes of 
complying with the record-keeping requirements in§ 200.302with respect to lobbying costs 
during a particular calendar month when: 

(A) The employee engages in lobbying (as defined inparagraphs (c)(1)and(2)of this section) 
for 25 percent or less of the employee's compensated hours of employment during that 
calendar month; and 

(B) Within the preceding five-year period, the recipient or subrecipient has not materially 
misstated allowable or unallowable costs of any nature, including legislative lobbying 
costs.

(ii) When conditions inparagraph (c)(5)(i)(A)and(B)of this section are met, recipients and 
subrecipients are not required to establish records to support the allowability of claimed costs 
in addition to records already required or maintained. Also, when conditions inparagraphs 
(c)(5)(i)(A)and(B)of this section are met, the absence of time logs, calendars, or similar 
records will not serve as a basis for disallowing costs by contesting estimates of lobbying time 
spent by employees during a calendar month. 

(iii) In consultation with OMB, the Federal agency must establish procedures for resolving, in 
advance, any significant questions or disagreements concerning the interpretation or 
application of this section. Any such advance resolutions must be binding in any subsequent 
settlements, audits, or investigations with respect to that grant or contract for purposes of 
interpretation of this part, provided, however, that this must not be construed to prevent a 
contractor or recipient or subrecipient from contesting the lawfulness of such a determination. 

§ 200.451 Losses on other awards or contracts. 

Any excess costs over income under any other award or contract of any nature is unallowable. This includes, but is 
not limited to, the recipient's or subrecipient's contributed portion by reason of cost sharing agreements or any 
under-recoveries through negotiation of flat amounts for indirect costs. Also, any excess of costs over authorized 
funding levels transferred from any award or contract to another is unallowable. All losses are not allowable indirect 
costs and must be included in the appropriate indirect cost rate base for allocating indirect costs. 

§ 200.452 Maintenance and repair costs. 

Costs incurred for utilities, insurance, security, necessary maintenance, janitorial services, repair, or upkeep of 
buildings and equipment (including Federal property unless otherwise provided for) which neither add to the 
permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in an efficient operating 
condition, are allowable. Costs incurred for improvements that add to the permanent value of the buildings and 
equipment or appreciably prolong their intended life must be treated as capital expenditures (see§ 200.439). These 
costs are only allowable to the extent not paid through rental or other agreements. 

§ 200.453 Materials and supplies costs, including costs of computing devices. 

(a) Costs incurred for materials, supplies, and fabricated parts necessary for the performance of a Federal 
award are allowable. 

(b) Purchased materials and supplies must be charged at their actual prices, net of applicable credits.

recognized method of pricing inventory withdrawals, consistently applied. Incoming transportation 
charges are an allowable part of materials and supplies costs. 

(c) Materials and supplies used for the performance of a Federal award may be charged as direct costs. 
Charging computing devices as direct costs is allowable for devices that are essential and allocable, but 
not solely dedicated, to the performance of a Federal award. 

(d) Where Federally-donated or furnished materials are used in performing the Federal award, the materials 
will be used without charge. 

§ 200.454 Memberships, subscriptions, and professional activity costs. 

(a) Costs of the recipient's or subrecipient's membership in business, technical, and professional 
organizations are allowable.

§ 200.455 Organization costs. 

(a) Costs such as incorporation fees, brokers' fees, fees to promoters, organizers or management 
consultants, attorneys, accountants, or investment counselors, whether or not employees of the recipient 
or subrecipient in connection with the establishment or reorganization of an organization, are unallowable 
except with prior approval of the Federal agency. 

(b) The costs of any of the following activities are unallowable: activities undertaken to persuade employees 
of the recipient or subrecipient, or any other entity, to exercise or not to exercise, or concerning the 
manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of the 
employees' own choosing. 

(c) The costs related to data and evaluation are allowable. Data costs include (but are not limited to) the 
expenditures needed to gather, store, track, manage, analyze, disaggregate, secure, share, publish, or 
otherwise use data to administer or improve the program, such as data systems, personnel, data 
dashboards, cybersecurity, and related items. Data costs may also include direct or indirect costs 
associated with building integrated data systems—data systems that link individual-level data from 
multiple State and local government agencies for purposes of management, research, and evaluation. 
Evaluation costs include (but are not limited to) evidence reviews, evaluation planning and feasibility 
assessment, conducting evaluations, sharing evaluation results, and other personnel or materials costs 
related to the effective building and use of evidence and evaluation for program design, administration, or 
improvement. 

§ 200.456 Participant support costs. 

Participant support costs are allowable (see§ 200.1).The classification of items as participant support costs must 
be documented in the recipient's or subrecipient's written policies and procedures and treated consistently across 
all Federal awards. 

§ 200.457 Plant and security costs. 

Necessary and reasonable expenses incurred for the protection and security of facilities, personnel, and work 
products are allowable. Such costs include, but are not limited to, wages and uniforms of personnel engaged in 
security activities; equipment; barriers; protective (non-military) gear, devices, and equipment; contractual security 
services; and consultants. Capital expenditures for plant security purposes are subject to§ 200.439. 

§ 200.458 Pre-award costs. 

Pre-award costs are those incurred before the start date of the Federal award or subaward directly pursuant to the 
negotiation and in anticipation of the Federal award where such costs are necessary for efficient and timely 
performance of the scope of work. These costs are allowable only to the extent that they would have been allowed

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

if incurred after the start date of the Federal award and only with the written approval of the Federal agency. If 
approved, these costs must be charged to the initial budget period of the Federal award unless otherwise specified 
by the Federal agency or pass-through entity. 

§ 200.459 Professional service costs. 

(a) Costs of professional and consultant services rendered by persons who are members of a particular 
profession or possess a special skill and who are not officers or employees of the recipient or 
subrecipient are allowable, subject toparagraphs (b)and(c)of this section when reasonable in relation to 
the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of the costs from the Federal Government. 
In addition, legal and related services are limited under§ 200.435. 

(b) In determining the allowability of costs in a particular case, no single factor or any combination of factors 
is necessarily determinative. However, the following factors are relevant: 

(1) The nature and scope of the service rendered in relation to the service required. 
(2) The necessity of contracting for the service, considering the recipient's or subrecipient's capability in 
the particular area. 

(3) The past pattern of such costs, particularly in the years prior to receiving a Federal award(s). 
(4) The impact of Federal awards on the recipient's or subrecipient's business (meaning, what new 
problems have arisen). 

(5) Whether the proportion of Federal work to the recipient's or subrecipient's total business influences 
the recipient or subrecipient in favor of incurring the cost, particularly where the services rendered 
are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under Federal awards. 

(6) Whether the service can be performed more economically by direct employment rather than 
contracting. 

(7) The qualifications of the individual or entity providing the service and the customary fees charged, 
especially on non-federally funded activities. 

(8) Adequacy of the contractual agreement for the service (for example, description of the service, 
estimate of the time required, rate of compensation, and termination provisions). 

(c) To be allowable, retainer fees must be supported by evidence of bona fide services available or rendered 
in addition to the factors inparagraph (b)of this section. 

§ 200.460 Proposal costs. 

Proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids, proposals, or applications on potential Federal and non-Federal 
awards or projects, including developing data necessary to support the recipient's or subrecipient's bids or 
proposals. Proposal costs of the current accounting period of both successful and unsuccessful bids and 
proposals normally should be treated as indirect costs and allocated to all current activities of the recipient or 
subrecipient. No proposal costs of past accounting periods may be allocated to the current period. 

§ 200.461 Publication and printing costs. 

(a) Publication costs for electronic and print media, including distribution, promotion, and general handling, 
are allowable. These costs should be allocated as indirect costs to all benefiting activities of the recipient 
or subrecipient if they are not identifiable with a particular cost objective.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(b) Page charges, article processing charges (APCs), or similar fees such as open access fees for 
professional journal publications and other peer-reviewed publications resulting from a Federal award are 
allowable where: 

(1) The publications report work supported by the Federal Government; and 
(2) The charges are levied impartially on all items published by the journal, whether or not under a 
Federal award. 

(3) The recipient or subrecipient may charge the Federal award during closeout for the costs of 
publication or sharing of research results if the costs were not incurred during the period of 
performance of the Federal award. These costs must be charged to the final budget period of the 
award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency. 

§ 200.462 Rearrangement and reconversion costs. 

(a) Costs incurred for ordinary and normal rearrangement and alteration of facilities are allowable as indirect 
costs. Special arrangements and alterations are allowable as a direct cost if the costs are incurred 
specifically for a Federal award and with the prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. 

(b) Costs incurred in restoring or rehabilitating the recipient's or subrecipient's facilities to approximately the 
same condition existing immediately before the commencement of a Federal award(s), less costs related 
to normal wear and tear, are allowable. 

§ 200.463 Recruiting costs. 

(a) Subject toparagraphs (b)and(c)of this section, and provided that the size of the staff recruited and 
maintained is in keeping with workload requirements, costs of “help wanted” advertising, operating costs 
of an employment office necessary to secure and maintain adequate staff, costs of operating an aptitude 
and educational testing program, travel costs of employees while engaged in recruiting personnel, travel 
costs of applicants for interviews for prospective employment, and relocation costs incurred incident to 
recruitment of new employees, are allowable to the extent that such costs are incurred pursuant to the 
recipient's or subrecipient's standard recruitment program. When the recipient or subrecipient uses 
employment agencies, costs not in excess of standard commercial rates for such services are allowable. 

(b) Special emoluments, fringe benefits, and salary allowances incurred to attract professional personnel that 
do not meet the test of reasonableness or do not conform with the established practices of the recipient 
or subrecipient, are unallowable. 

(c) If relocation costs incurred incident to recruitment of a new employee have been funded in whole or in 
part by a Federal award, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within the employee's control 
within 12 months after hire, the recipient or subrecipient must refund or credit the Federal Government for 
its share of those relocation costs. See§ 200.464. 

(d) Short-term visas (as opposed to longer-term immigration visas) are generally an allowable cost and they 
may be proposed as a direct cost because they are issued for a specific period and purpose and can be 
clearly identified as directly connected to work performed on a Federal award. For these costs to be 
directly charged to a Federal award, they must: 

(1) Be critical and necessary for the conduct of the project; 
(2) Be allowable under the applicable cost principles;

(3) Be consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's cost accounting practices and established written 
policy; and 

(4) Meet the definition of “direct cost” as described in the applicable cost principles. 
§ 200.464 Relocation costs of employees. 

(a) Relocation costs are costs incident to the permanent change of duty assignment (for an indefinite period 
or a stated period of not less than 12 months) of an existing employee or upon recruitment of a new 
employee. Relocation costs are allowable, subject to the limitations described inparagraphs (b),(c), and 
(d)of this section, provided that: 

(1) The move is for the benefit of the employer. 
(2) Reimbursement to the employee is in accordance with an established written policy consistently 
followed by the employer. 

(3) The reimbursement does not exceed the employee's actual (or reasonably estimated) expenses. 
(b) Allowable relocation costs for current employees are limited to the following: 
(1) The costs of transportation of the employee, members of their immediate family and their 
household, and personal effects to the new location. 

(2) The costs of finding a new home, such as advance trips by employees and spouses to locate living 
quarters and temporary lodging during the transition period, up to a maximum period of 30 calendar 
days. 

(3) Closing costs, such as brokerage, legal, and appraisal fees, incidental to the disposition of the 
employee's former home. These costs, together with those described inparagraph (b)(4)of this 
section, are limited to eight percent of the sales price of the employee's former home. 

(4) The continuing costs of ownership (for up to six months) of the vacant former home after the 
settlement or lease date of the employee's new permanent home, such as maintenance of buildings 
and grounds (exclusive of fixing-up expenses), utilities, taxes, and property insurance. 

(5) Other necessary and reasonable expenses normally incident to relocation, such as canceling an 
unexpired lease, transportation of personal property, and purchasing insurance against loss of or 
damages to personal property. The cost of canceling an unexpired lease is limited to three times the 
monthly rental. 

(c) Allowable relocation costs for new employees are limited to those described inparagraphs (b)(1)and(2) 
of this section. If relocation costs incurred incident to the recruitment of a new employee have been 
funded in whole or in part by a Federal award, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within the 
employee's control within 12 months after hire, the recipient or subrecipient must refund or credit the 
Federal Government for its share of the cost. If a new employee is relocating to an overseas location and 
dependents are not permitted for any reason, and the costs do not include transporting household goods, 
the costs must be considered travel costs in accordance with§ 200.474, not relocation costs underthis 
section. 

(d) The following costs related to relocation are unallowable: 
(1) Fees and other costs associated with acquiring a new home. 
(2) A loss on the sale of a former home.

(3) Continuing mortgage principal and interest payments on a home being sold. 
(4) Income taxes paid by an employee related to reimbursed relocation costs. 
§ 200.465 Rental costs of real property and equipment. 

(a) Subject to the limitations described inparagraphs (b)through(d)of this section, rental costs are 
allowable to the extent that the rates are reasonable in light of such factors as costs of comparable rental 
properties; market conditions in the area; alternatives available; and the type, life expectancy, condition, 
and value of the property leased. Rental arrangements should be reviewed periodically to determine if 
circumstances have changed and if other options are available. 

(b) Rental costs under “sale and lease back” arrangements are allowable only up to the amount that would 
have been allowed if the recipient or subrecipient had continued to own the property. This amount would 
include expenses such as depreciation, maintenance, taxes, and insurance. 

(c) Rental costs under “less-than-arm's-length” leases are allowable only up to the amount described in 
paragraph (b)of this section. For this purpose, a less-than-arm's-length lease is one under which one party 
to the lease agreement can control or substantially influence the actions of the other. Such leases include, 
but are not limited to, those between: 

(1) Divisions of the recipient or subrecipient; 
(2) The recipient or subrecipient and another entity under common control through common officers, 
directors, or members; and 

(3) The recipient or subrecipient and a director, trustee, officer, or key employee of the recipient or 
subrecipient or an immediate family member, either directly or through corporations, trusts, or 
similar arrangements in which they hold a controlling interest. For example, the recipient or 
subrecipient may establish a separate corporation to own property and lease it back to the recipient 
or subrecipient. 

(4) Family members include one party with any of the following relationships to another party: 
(i) Spouse and parents thereof; 
(ii) Children and spouses thereof; 
(iii) Parents and spouses thereof; 
(iv) Siblings and spouses thereof; 
(v) Grandparents and grandchildren and spouses thereof; 
(vi) Domestic partner and parents thereof, including domestic partners of any individual in 2 
through 5 of this definition; and 

(vii) Any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the 
equivalent of a family relationship. 

(d) Rental costs under leases which are required to be accounted for as a financed purchase under GASB 
standards or a finance lease under FASB standards are allowable only up to the amount (described in 
paragraph (b)of this section) that would have been allowed if the recipient or subrecipient had purchased 
the property on the date the lease agreement was executed. Interest costs related to these leases are

allowable if they meet the criteria in§ 200.449. Unallowable costs include costs that would not have been 
incurred if the recipient or subrecipient had purchased the property, such as amounts paid for profit, 
management fees, and taxes. 

(e) Rental or lease payments are allowable under lease contracts where the recipient or subrecipient is 
required to recognize an intangible right-to-use lease asset under GASB standards or right-of-use 
operating lease asset under FASB standards for purposes of financial reporting in accordance with GAAP. 

(f) The rental of any property owned by any individuals or entities affiliated with the recipient or subrecipient, 
including commercial or residential real estate, for purposes such as the home office is unallowable. 

§ 200.466 Scholarships, student aid costs, and tuition remission. 

(a) Costs of scholarships, fellowships, and student aid programs at IHEs are allowable only when the purpose 
of the Federal award is to provide training to participants, and the Federal agency approves the cost. 

(b) Tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid as, or instead of, wages to students performing 
necessary work are allowable provided that: 

(1) The individual is conducting activities necessary to the Federal award; 
(2) Tuition remission and other support are provided in accordance with the established written policy of 
the IHE and consistently provided in a like manner to students in return for similar activities 
conducted under Federal awards as well as other activities; and 

(3) The student is enrolled in an advanced degree program at the IHE or an affiliated institution during 
the academic period and the student's activities under the Federal award are related to their degree 
program; 

(4) The tuition or other payments are reasonable compensation for the work performed and are 
conditioned explicitly upon the performance of necessary work; and 

(5) The IHE compensates students under Federal awards as well as other activities in similar manners. 
(c) Charges for tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid to students as, or instead of, salaries 
and wages are subject to the reporting requirements in§ 200.430. The charges must be treated as a 
direct or indirect cost in accordance with the actual work performed. Tuition remission may be charged 
on an average rate basis. See§ 200.431. 

§ 200.467 Selling and marketing costs. 

Costs of selling and marketing any products or services of the recipient or subrecipient are unallowable unless they 
are allowed under§ 200.421and are necessary to meet the requirements of the Federal award. 

§ 200.468 Specialized service facilities. 

(a) The costs of services provided by highly complex or specialized facilities operated by the recipient or 
subrecipient are allowable provided the charges for the services meet the conditions of eitherparagraph 
(b)or(c)of this sectionandtake into account any items of income or Federal financing that qualify as 
applicable credits under§ 200.406. These costs include charges for facilities such as computing 
facilities, wind tunnels, and reactors.

2 CFR 200.468(b) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(b) The costs of such services, when material, must be charged directly to the applicable Federal awards 
based on actual usage of the services on the basis of a schedule of rates or established methodology 
that: 

(1) Does not discriminate between activities under Federal awards and other activities of the recipient or 
subrecipient, including usage by the recipient or subrecipient for internal purposes; and 

(2) Is designed to recover only the aggregate costs of the services. Each service's costs must normally 
consist of its direct costs and an allocable share of all indirect costs. Rates must be adjusted at 
least biennially and must consider any over or under-applied costs of the previous period(s). 

(c) Where the costs incurred for a service are not material, they may be allocated as indirect costs. 
(d) Under extraordinary circumstances, the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the recipient or 
subrecipient may negotiate and establish an alternative costing arrangement if it is in the Federal 
Government's best interest. 

§ 200.469 Student activity costs. 

Costs incurred for intramural activities, student publications, student clubs, and other student activities are 
unallowable unless expressly authorized in the Federal award. 

§ 200.470 Taxes (including Value Added Tax). 

(a) For States, local governments, and Indian Tribes. 
(1) Taxes that a governmental unit is legally required to pay are allowable, except for self-assessed 
taxes that disproportionately affect Federal programs or changes in tax policies that 
disproportionately affect Federal programs. 

(2) Gasoline taxes, motor vehicle fees, and other taxes that are, in effect, user fees for benefits provided 
to the Federal Government are allowable. 

(3) This provision does not restrict the authority of the Federal agency to identify taxes where Federal 
participation is inappropriate. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may accept a reasonable 
approximation in circumstances where determining the amount of unallowable taxes would require 
an excessive amount of effort. 

(b) For nonprofit organizations and IHEs. 
(1) Taxes that the recipient or subrecipient is required to pay and which are paid or accrued in 
accordance with GAAP are generally allowable. These costs include payments made to local 
governments instead of taxes and that are commensurate with the local government services 
received. The following taxes are unallowable: 

(i) Taxes for which exemptions are available to the recipient or subrecipient directly or which are 
available to the recipient or subrecipient based on an exemption afforded the Federal 
Government and, in the latter case, when the Federal agency makes available the necessary 
exemption certificates;

(2) Any refund of taxes and interest thereon, which were allowed as Federal award costs, must be 
credited to the Federal Government as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate. However, any 
interest paid or credited to a recipient or subrecipient incident to a refund of tax, interest, and penalty 
will be paid or credited to the Federal Government only to the extent that such interest accrued over 
the period during which the Federal Government has reimbursed the recipient or subrecipient for the 
taxes, interest, and penalties. 

(c) Value Added Tax (VAT).Foreign taxes charged for procurement transactions that a recipient or 
subrecipient is legally required to pay in a country are allowable. Foreign tax refunds or applicable credits 
under Federal awards refer to receipts or reduction of expenditures, which operate to offset or reduce 
expense items that are allocable to Federal awards as direct or indirect costs. To the extent that such 
credits accrued or received by the recipient or subrecipient relate to allowable cost, these costs must be 
credited to the Federal agency as a cost reduction or cash refunds, as appropriate. In cases where the 
costs are credited back to the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient may reduce the Federal share 
of costs by the amount of the foreign tax reimbursement, or where Federal award has not expired, the 
Federal agency may allow the recipient or subrecipient to use the foreign government tax refund for 
approved activities under the Federal award. 

§ 200.471 Telecommunication and video surveillance costs. 

(a) Costs incurred for telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment such as phones, 
internet, video surveillance, and cloud servers are allowable except for the following circumstances: 
(b) Obligating or expending covered telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment or 
services as described in§ 200.216to: 
(1) Procure or obtain, extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain; 
(2) Enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure; or 
(3) Obtain the equipment, services, or systems. 
§ 200.472 Termination and standard closeout costs. 

(a) Termination Costs.Termination of a Federal award generally gives rise to the incurrence of costs or the 
need for special treatment of costs, which would not have arisen had the Federal award not been 
terminated. Cost principles covering these items are set forth in this section. They must be used in 
conjunction with the other termination requirements of this part. 

(1) The cost of items reasonably usable on the recipient's or subrecipient's other work is unallowable 
unless the recipient or subrecipient submits evidence that it would not retain such items without 
sustaining a loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other work of the 
recipient or subrecipient, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should consider the recipient's or 
subrecipient's plans and orders for current and scheduled activity. Contemporaneous purchases of 
common items by the recipient or subrecipient must be considered evidence that the items are 
reasonably usable on the recipient's or subrecipient's other work. Any acceptance of common items 
as allocable to the terminated portion of the Federal award must be limited to the extent that the 
quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on order do not exceed the reasonable quantitative 
requirements of other work.

2 CFR 200.472(a)(2) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(2) If the recipient or subrecipient cannot discontinue certain costs immediately after the effective 
termination date, despite making all reasonable efforts, then the costs are generally allowable within 
the limitations of this part. Any costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful 
failure of the recipient or subrecipient to immediately discontinue the costs are unallowable. 

(3) Loss of useful value of special tooling, machinery, and equipment is generally allowable if: 
(i) Such special tooling, special machinery, or equipment is not reasonably capable of use in the 
other work of the recipient or subrecipient; 

(ii) The interest of the Federal Government is protected by transfer of title or by other means 
deemed appropriate by the Federal agency (see§ 200.313 (d)); and 

(iii) The loss of useful value for any one terminated Federal award is limited to the portion of the 
acquisition cost which bears the same ratio to the total acquisition cost as the terminated 
portion of the Federal award bears to the entire terminated Federal award and other Federal 
awards for which the special tooling, machinery, or equipment was acquired. 

(4) If paragraph (a)(4)(i) and (ii) below are satisfied, rental costs under unexpired leases (less the 
residual value of such leases) are generally allowable where clearly shown to have been reasonably 
necessary for the performance of the terminated Federal award. These rental costs may include the 
cost of alterations of the leased property and the cost of reasonable restoration required by the 
lease, provided the alterations were necessary for the performance of the Federal award. 

(i) The amount of claimed rental costs does not exceed the reasonable use value of the property 
leased for the period of the Federal award and a further period as may be reasonable; and 

(ii) The recipient or subrecipient makes all reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or 
otherwise reduce the cost of the lease. 

(5) The following settlement expenses are generally allowable. 
(i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs that are reasonably necessary for: 
(A) The preparation and presentation to the Federal agency or pass-through entity of 
settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated portion of the 
Federal award, unless the termination is for cause (see§§ 200.339-200.343); and 

(B) The termination and settlement of subawards. 
(ii) Reasonable costs for the storage, transportation, protection, and disposition of property 
provided by the Federal Government or acquired or produced for the Federal award. 

(6) Claims under subawards, including the allocable portion of claims common to the Federal award and 
other work of the recipient or subrecipient, are generally allowable. An appropriate share of the 
recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs may be allocated to the amount of settlements with 
contractors and subrecipients, provided that the amount allocated is consistent with the 
requirements of§ 200.414. These allocated indirect costs must exclude the same and similar costs 
claimed directly or indirectly as settlement expenses. 

(b) Closeout Costs.Administrative costs associated with the closeout activities of a Federal award are 
allowable. The recipient or subrecipient may charge the Federal award during the closeout for the 
necessary administrative costs of that Federal award (for example, salaries of personnel preparing final 
reports, publication and printing costs, costs associated with the disposition of equipment and property,

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

and related indirect costs). These costs may be incurred until the due date of the final report(s). If 
incurred, these costs must be liquidated prior to the due date of the final report(s) and charged to the final 
budget period of the award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency. 

§ 200.473 Training and education costs. 

The cost of training and education provided for employee development is allowable. 

§ 200.474 Transportation costs. 

Costs incurred for freight, express, cartage, postage, and other transportation services relating to goods purchased, 
in process, or delivered, are allowable. When the costs can be readily identified with the items involved, they may be 
charged directly as transportation costs or added to the cost of such items. When identification with the materials 
received cannot be readily made, the inbound transportation cost may be charged to the appropriate indirect cost 
accounts if the recipient or subrecipient follows a consistent, equitable procedure in this respect. If reimbursable 
under the terms and conditions of the Federal award, outbound freight should be treated as a direct cost. 

§ 200.475 Travel costs. 

(a) General.Travel costs include the transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by 
employees who are in travel status on official business of the recipient or subrecipient. These costs may 
be charged on an actual cost basis, on a per diem or mileage basis, or on a combination of the two, 
provided the method used is applied to an entire trip and not to selected days of the trip. The method 
used must be consistent with those normally allowed in like circumstances in the recipient's or 
subrecipient's other activities and in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written 
policies. Notwithstanding the provisions of§ 200.444, travel costs of officials covered by that section are 
allowable with the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity when they are 
specifically related to the Federal award. 

(b) Lodging and subsistence.Costs incurred by employees and officers for travel, including costs of lodging, 
other subsistence, and incidental expenses, must be considered reasonable and otherwise allowable only 
to the extent such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the recipient or subrecipient in its 
regular operations as the result of the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy. In addition, if 
these costs are charged directly to the Federal award documentation must justify that: 

(1) Participation of the individual is necessary for the Federal award; and 
(2) The costs are reasonable and consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written 
policy. 

(c) Dependents. 
(1) Temporary dependent care costs (dependent is defined in26 U.S.C. 152) above and beyond regular 
dependent care are allowable provided that these costs: 

(i) Are a direct result of the individual's travel to a conference for the Federal award; 
(ii) Are consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy for all travel; and 
(iii) Are only temporary during the travel period. 
(2) Travel costs for dependents are unallowable, except for travel of six months or more with prior 
approval of the Federal agency. See§ 200.432.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(d) Establishing rates and amounts.In the absence of an established written policy regarding travel costs, the 
rates and amounts established under5 U.S.C. 5701-11 (“Travel and Subsistence Expenses; Mileage 
Allowances”), by the Administrator of General Services, or by the President (or their designee) pursuant to 
any provisions of such subchapter must apply to travel under Federal awards (48 CFR 31.205-46(a)). 

(e) Commercial air travel. 
(1) Airfare costs in excess of the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by 
commercial airlines are unallowable except when such accommodations would: 

(i) Require circuitous routing; 
(ii) Require travel during unreasonable hours; 
(iii) Excessively prolong travel; 
(iv) Result in additional costs that would offset the transportation savings; or 
(v) Offer accommodations not reasonably adequate for the traveler's medical needs. The recipient 
or subrecipient must justify and document these conditions on a case-by-case basis for the use 
of first-class or business-class airfare to be allowable in such cases. 

(2) Unless a pattern of avoidance is detected, the Federal Government will generally not question a 
recipient's or subrecipient's determinations that customary standard airfare or other discount airfare 
is unavailable for specific trips if the recipient or subrecipient can demonstrate that such airfare was 
not available in the specific case. 

(f) Air travel by other than commercial carrier.Travel costs by recipient or subrecipient-owned, -leased, or 
-chartered aircraft include the cost of the lease, charter, operation (including personnel costs), 
maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs. The portion of these costs that exceeds 
the cost of airfare, as provided for in paragraph (d), is unallowable. 

§ 200.476 Trustees. 

Travel and subsistence costs of trustees (or directors) at IHEs and nonprofit organizations are allowable. See§ 
200.475. 

Subpart F—Audit Requirements 

GENERAL 

§ 200.500 Purpose. 

This part sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of 
non-Federal entities expending Federal awards. 

AUDITS 

§ 200.501 Audit requirements. 

(a) Audit required.A non-Federal entity that expends $1,000,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal 
year in Federal awards must have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in 
accordance with the provisions of this part.

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.501(b) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(b) Single audit.A non-Federal entity that expends $1,000,000 or more in Federal awards during the non-
Federal entity's fiscal year must have a single audit conducted in accordance with§ 200.514except when 
it elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance withparagraph (c)or(d)of this 
section. 

(c) Program-specific audit election (in general).A non-Federal entity may elect to have a program-specific 
audit conducted in accordance with§ 200.507if the following conditions are met: 

(1) The non-Federal entity expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding research 
and development); and 

(2) The Federal program's statutes or regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award, do not 
require a financial statement audit of the non-Federal entity. 

(d) Program-specific audit election for research and development.A non-Federal entity may elect to have a 
program-specific audit for research and development conducted in accordance with§ 200.507, but only if 
all of the following conditions are met: 

(1) The non-Federal entity expends Federal awards only from the same Federal agency, or the same 
Federal agency and the same pass-through entity; and 

(2) The Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves a program-specific 
audit in advance. 

(e) Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $1,000,000.A non-Federal entity that expends less 
than $1,000,000 in Federal awards during its fiscal year is exempt from Federal audit requirements for 
that year, except as noted in§ 200.503. However, in all instances, the records of the non-Federal entity 
must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, 
and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

(f) Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).Management of an auditee that owns or 
operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part. 

(g) Subrecipients and contractors.An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a 
contractor. Unless a program is exempt by Federal statute, Federal awards expended as a recipient or a 
subrecipient are subject to audit under this part. Payments received for goods or services provided as a 
contractor under a Federal award (see§ 200.331) are not subject to audit under this part. 

(h) Compliance responsibility for contractors.In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for 
contractors is to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with 
Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of a Federal award. Federal award compliance 
requirements normally do not flow down to contractors. However, for procurement transactions in which 
the contractor is made responsible for meeting program requirements, the auditee must ensure those 
requirements are met, including by clearly stating the contractor's responsibilities within the contract and 
reviewing the contractor's records to determine compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions 
relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include a determination of whether these 
transactions comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of a Federal award. 
See also§ 200.318(b). 

(i) For-profit subrecipient.This subpart does not apply to for-profit organizations. As necessary, the pass-
through entity is responsible for establishing requirements to ensure compliance by for-profit 
subrecipients. The subaward with a for-profit subrecipient must describe applicable compliance 

2 CFR 200.501(i) (enhanced display) page 130 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.502 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance 
for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring throughout 
the performance of the subaward, and post-award audits (see§ 200.332). 

§ 200.502 Basis for determining Federal awards expended. 

(a) Determining Federal awards expended.The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be 
based on when the activity related to the Federal award occurs. Generally, the activity related to the 
Federal award pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, 
regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, such as: 

(1) Expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cooperative agreements, cost-
reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, and direct appropriations; 

(2) The disbursement of funds to subrecipients; 
(3) The use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; 
(4) The receipt of property (including surplus property); 
(5) The receipt or use of program income; 
(6) The distribution or use of food commodities; 
(7) The disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and 
(8) The period when insurance is in force. 
(b) Loan and loan guarantees (loans).The Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid. 
Therefore, the following guidelines must be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under 
loan programs (except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d)): 

(1) The value of new loans made or received during the audit period; plus 
(2) The balance of loans from previous years at the beginning of the audit period for which the Federal 
Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus 

(3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received. 
(c) Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at Institutions of Higher Education (IHE).When loans are made to 
students of an IHE, but the IHE itself does not have continuing compliance requirements for the loans, 
then only the value of loans made during the audit period are considered Federal awards expended in that 
audit period. The balance of loans for previous audit periods is not included as Federal awards expended 
because the lender accounts for the prior balances. 

(d) Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior 
years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when Federal statutes, regulations, 
and the terms and conditions of Federal awards pertaining to such loans impose no continuing 
compliance requirements other than to repay the loans. 

(e) Endowment funds.The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds that are federally 
restricted is considered Federal awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still 
restricted.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(f) Free rent.Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. 
However, free rent received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program must be included in 
determining Federal awards expended and is subject to audit under this part. 

(g) Valuing non-cash assistance.Federal non-cash assistance (such as free rent, food commodities, donated 
property, or donated surplus property that is received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal 
program) must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the 
Federal agency and must be included in determining Federal awards expended under this part. 

(h) Medicare.Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare-
eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part. 

(i) Medicaid.Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid-eligible 
individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State requires the funds 
to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis. 

(j) Certain loans provided by the National Credit Union Administration.For purposes of this part, loans from 
the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility funded by contributions 
from insured non-Federal entities are not considered Federal awards expended. 

§ 200.503 Relation to other audit requirements. 

(a) Other financial audits.An audit conducted in accordance with this part must be in lieu of any financial 
audit of Federal awards which a non-Federal entity is required to undergo under any other Federal statute 
or regulation. To the extent that such an audit provides a Federal agency with the information it requires 
to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation, a Federal agency must rely upon and 
use that information. 

(b) Conducting additional audits.Notwithstandingparagraph (a)of this section, a Federal agency, Inspectors 
General, or GAO may conduct or arrange additional audits to carry out its responsibilities under Federal 
statute or regulation. The provisions of this part do not authorize any non-Federal entity to constrain, in 
any manner, such Federal agency from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that the 
Federal agency must plan such audits not to be duplicative of other audits of Federal awards. Prior to 
commencing such an audit, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the FAC for recent 
audits submitted by the non-Federal entity, and to the extent such audits meet a Federal agency or pass-
through entity's needs, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must rely upon and use such audits. Any 
additional audits must be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed, 
including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already performed by other auditors. 

(c) Authority to conduct additional audits.The provisions of this part do not limit the authority of Federal 
agencies to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal awards, nor limit the 
authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal officials. For example, requirements 
that may be applicable under the FAR or CAS and the terms and conditions of a cost-reimbursement 
contract may include additional applicable audits to be conducted or arranged for by Federal agencies. 

(d) Federal agency to pay for additional audits.A Federal agency that conducts or arranges for additional 
audits must, consistent with other applicable Federal statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full 
cost of such additional audits. 

(e) Request for a program to be audited as a major program.A Federal agency may request that an auditee 
have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal agency conducting or 
arranging for the additional audits. Such requests should be made at least 180 calendar days prior to the 

2 CFR 200.503(e) (enhanced display) page 132 of 208

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

end of the fiscal year to be audited to allow for planning. After consultation with its auditor, the auditee 
should promptly respond to such a request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would 
otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in§ 200.518and, 
if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal agency must then promptly confirm to the auditee 
whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major 
program based upon this Federal agency request, and the Federal agency agrees to pay the full 
incremental costs, then the auditee must have the program audited as a major program. With approval of 
the Federal agency, a pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient. 

§ 200.504 Frequency of audits. 

Audits required by this part must be performed annually unless biennial audits are permitted underparagraph (a)or 
(b)of this section. Biennial audits must cover both fiscal years within the biennial period. 

(a) A State, local government, or Indian Tribe that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 
1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo biennial (every other 
year) audits pursuant to this part. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period. 

(b) Any nonprofit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, 
and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo biennial audits pursuant to this part. 

§ 200.505 Remedies for audit noncompliance. 

In cases of continued inability or unwillingness of a non-federal entity to have an audit conducted in accordance 
with this part, Federal agencies or pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in§ 200.339. 

§ 200.506 Audit costs. 

See§ 200.425. 

§ 200.507 Program-specific audits. 

(a) Program-specific audit guide available.In some cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to 
provide specific guidance to the auditor concerning internal controls, compliance requirements, 
suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. A listing of current program-specific audit 
guides can be found in the compliance supplement (Appendix VI, Program-Specific Audit Guides). When a 
current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor must follow Generally Accepted Government 
Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and the guide when performing a program-specific audit. 

(b) Program-specific audit guide not available. 
(1) When a current program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor must have 
basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a 
major program in a single audit. 

(2) The auditee must prepare the financial statement(s) for the Federal program that includes a 
schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the program and notes that describe the significant 
accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, a summary schedule of prior audit findings 
consistent with the requirements of § 200.511(b), and a corrective action plan consistent with the 
requirements of§ 200.511(c). 

(3) The auditor must:

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(i) Perform an audit of the financial statement(s) for the Federal program in accordance with 
GAGAS; 

(ii) Obtain an understanding of internal controls and perform tests of internal controls over the 
Federal program consistent with the requirements for a major program in accordance with§ 
200.514(c); 

(iii) Determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms 
and conditions of Federal awards that could have a direct and material effect on the Federal 
program consistent with the requirements for a major program under§ 200.514(d); 

(iv) Follow up on prior audit findings and perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the 
summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the 
requirements of§ 200.511When the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior 
audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding, the auditor must 
report this condition as a current-year audit finding.; and 

(v) Report any audit findings consistent with the requirements of§ 200.516. 
(4) The auditor
's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports. It may be 

organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state 
that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following: 

(i) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statement(s) of the Federal 
program is presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with the stated accounting 
policies; 

(ii) A report on internal control related to the Federal program, which must describe the scope of 
testing of internal control and the results of the tests; 

(iii) A report on compliance that includes an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the 
auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards which 
could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program; and 

(iv) A schedule of findings and questioned costs for the Federal program that includes a summary 
of the auditor's results relative to the Federal program in a format consistent with§ 
200.515(d)(1)and findings and questioned costs consistent with the requirements of§ 
200.515(d)(3). 

(c) Report submission for program-specific audits. 
(1) Submission deadline and public availability.The audit must be completed and submitted in 
accordance withparagraph (c)(2)or(c)(3)of this section. Unless a different period is specified in 
the program-specific audit guide, the audit must be submitted within 30 calendar days after the 
auditee receives the auditor's report(s) or nine months after the end of the audit period (whichever is 
earlier). The submission is due the next business day when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, 
or Federal holiday. Unless restricted by Federal law or regulation, the auditee must make copies of 
the reporting package available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their 
respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable 
information.

(2) Program-specific audit guide available.When a program-specific audit guide is available, the auditee 
must electronically submit the data collection form prepared in accordance with§ 200.512(b), as 
applicable to the program-specific audit, to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC). The submission 
must also include the reporting required by the program-specific audit guide.

AUDITEES 

§ 200.508 Auditee responsibilities. 

The auditee must: 

(a) Arrange for the audit required by this part in accordance with§ 200.509, and ensure it is properly 
performed and submitted in accordance with§ 200.512. 

(b) Prepare financial statements, including the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards in accordance 
with§ 200.510. 

(c) Promptly follow up and take corrective action on audit findings. This includes preparing a summary 
schedule of prior audit findings and a corrective action plan in accordance with§ 200.511(b)and(c), 
respectively. 

(d) Provide the auditor access to personnel, accounts, books, records, supporting documentation, and any 
other information needed for the auditor to perform the audit required by this part.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 
§ 200.509 Auditor selection. 

(a) Auditor procurement.When procuring audit services, the auditee must follow the procurement standards 
in§§ 200.317through200.327of subpart D or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. When requesting 
proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit must be made clear, and the non-
Federal entity must request a copy of the audit organization's peer review report, which the auditor must 
provide under GAGAS. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the 
responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional 
qualifications and technical abilities, the results of peer and external quality control reviews, and price. 
Whenever possible, the auditee must make efforts to contract with businesses as stated in§ 200.321or 
the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. 

(b) Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals.An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal 
or cost allocation plan may not be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect 
costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceed $1 million. This restriction applies to the base 
year used to prepare the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which 
the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs. 

(c) Use of Federal auditors.Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if 
they fully comply with the requirements of this part. 

§ 200.510 Financial statements. 

(a) Financial statements.The auditee must prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, 
results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year 
audited. The financial statements must be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year chosen to meet 
this part's requirements. However, organization-wide financial statements of the non-Federal entity may 
also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in 
accordance with§ 200.514(a)and prepare separate financial statements. 

(b) Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.The auditee must also prepare a schedule of expenditures of 
Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements. The schedule must include 
the total Federal awards expended as determined in accordance with§ 200.502. The auditee may choose 
to provide information requested by Federal agencies or pass-through entities to make the schedule 
easier to use. For example, when a Federal program has multiple Federal award years, the auditee may 
separately list the amount of Federal awards expended for each year of a Federal award. The schedule 
must: 

(1) List individual Federal programs by Federal agency using the applicable Assistance Listing 
number(s). For a cluster of programs, the non-Federal entity must provide the cluster name, a list of 
individual Federal programs within the cluster, and provide the Federal agency name and the 
applicable Assistance Listing number(s). For research and development, total Federal awards 
expended must be shown either by individual Federal award or by Federal agency and major 
subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major 
subdivision within the Department of Health and Human Services. 

(2) For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying 
number assigned by the pass-through entity must be included. 

(3) Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the Assistance 
Listings number or other identifying number when the Assistance Listings information is 
unavailable. For a cluster of programs, the auditee must also provide the total for the cluster.

2 CFR 200.510(b)(4) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(4) Include the total amount provided to subrecipients from each Federal program. 
(5) For loan or loan guarantee programs described in§ 200.502(b), identify in the notes to the schedule 
the balances outstanding at the end of the audit period. This requirement is in addition to including 
the total Federal awards expended for loan or loan guarantee programs in the schedule. 

(6) Include notes describing the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule and 
whether the auditee elected to use the de minimis indirect cost rate of up to 15 percent (see§ 
200.414). 

§ 200.511 Audit findings follow-up. 

(a) General.The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this 
responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must 
also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit 
findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit 
findings under§ 200.516(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, 
it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and 
summary schedule of prior audit findings must include financial statement findings that the auditor was 
required to report in accordance with GAGAS. 

(b) Summary schedule of prior audit findings.The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the 
status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The 
summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of 
prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance withparagraph (b)(1)of this 
section or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance withparagraph (b)(3)of this 
section. 

(1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and 
state that corrective action was taken. 

(2) When audit findings were not corrected or only partially corrected, the summary schedule must 
describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence, planned corrective action, and any partial 
corrective action taken. When the corrective action taken significantly differs from the corrective 
action previously reported in a corrective action plan or the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's 
management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation. 

(3) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the 
reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering 
an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred: 

(i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to 
the FAC; 

(ii) The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the 
audit finding; and 

(iii) A management decision was not issued. 
(c) Corrective action plan.At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare a corrective action plan to 
address each audit finding included in the auditor's report for the current year. The corrective action plan 
must be a document separate from the auditor's findings described in§ 200.516. The corrective action 
plan must also provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for the corrective action, the 

2 CFR 200.511(c) (enhanced display) page 137 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.512 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

corrective action to be taken, and the anticipated completion date. When the auditee does not agree with 
the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, the corrective action plan must include a 
detailed explanation of the reasons. 

§ 200.512 Report submission. 

(a) General. 
(1) The audit, the data collection form, and the reporting package must be submitted within 30 calendar 
days after the auditee receives the auditor's report(s) or nine months after the end of the audit period 
(whichever is earlier). The cognizant agency for audit or oversight agency for audit (in the absence of 
a cognizant agency for audit) may authorize an extension when the nine-month timeframe would 
place an undue burden on the auditee. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, 
the reporting package is due the next business day. 

(2) The auditee must make copies available for public inspection unless restricted by Federal statute or 
regulation. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package 
do not include protected personally identifiable information. 

(b) Data collection.The FAC is the repository of record for subpart F reporting packages and the data 
collection form. All Federal agencies, pass-through entities and others interested in a reporting package 
and data collection form must obtain it by accessing the FAC. 

(1) The auditee must submit the required data collection form described inAppendix X of this part. This 
form provides information about the auditee, its Federal programs, the results of the audit, and 
whether the audit was completed in accordance with this part. The form must include all information 
required by this part that is necessary for Federal agencies to use the audit to ensure the integrity of 
Federal programs. The form includes data elements and a format that OMB must approve, is 
available from the FAC, and include collections of information from the reporting package described 
in paragraph (c). 

(2) A senior-level representative of the auditee (for example, a State controller, director of finance, chief 
executive officer, or chief financial officer) must sign a statement to be included as part of the data 
collection form stating that the auditee complied with the requirements of this part, including that: 

(i) The data collection form was prepared in accordance with this part (and the instructions 
accompanying the form); 

(ii) The reporting package does not include protected personally identifiable information; 
(iii) The information included in its entirety is accurate and complete; and 
(iv) The FAC is authorized to make the reporting package and the form publicly available on a 
website. 

(3) An auditee that is an Indian Tribe or a tribal organization (as defined in the Indian Self-Determination, 
Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA),25 U.S.C. 450b(l)) may opt not to authorize the FAC to make 
the reporting package publicly available on a website. To opt-out, an Indian Tribe or tribal 
organization must exclude the authorization described inparagraph (b)(2)(iv)of this section. In 
these instances, the Indian Tribe is responsible for submitting the reporting package directly to any 
pass-through entities through which it has received a Federal award and to pass-through entities for 
which the summary schedule of prior audit findings reported the status of any findings related to 

2 CFR 200.512(b)(3) (enhanced display) page 138 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.512(b)(4) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

those Federal awards that the pass-through entity provided. Unless restricted by Federal statute or 
regulation, if the Indian Tribe opts not to authorize publication, it must make copies of the reporting 
package available for public inspection. 

(4) The auditor must complete the applicable data elements of the data collection form using the 
information included in the reporting package described inparagraph (c)of this section. The auditor 
must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection form stating: 

(i) The source of information included in the data collection form; 
(ii) The auditor
's responsibility for the information; 

(iii) The data collection form is not a substitute for the reporting package described in paragraph 
(c); and 

(iv) The content of the form is limited to the collection of information prescribed by OMB. 
(c) Reporting package.The reporting package must include the following: 
(1) Financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards discussed in§ 200.510(a)and 
(b), respectively; 

(2) Summary schedule of prior audit findings discussed in§ 200.511(b); 
(3) Auditor
's report(s) discussed in§ 200.515; and 

(4) Corrective action plan discussed in§ 200.511(c). 
(d) Submission to FAC.The auditee must electronically submit the data collection form described in 
paragraph (b)of this section and the reporting package described inparagraph (c)of this section to the 
FAC. 

(e) Requests for management letters issued by the auditor.Auditees must submit, when requested by a 
Federal agency or pass-through entity, a copy of any management letters issued by the auditor. 

(f) Report retention requirements.Auditees must keep a copy of the data collection form described in 
paragraph (b)of this section and a copy of the reporting package described in paragraph (c) on file for 
three years from the date of submission to the FAC. Copies of audit records must be maintained in 
accordance with§ 200.336. 

(g) FAC responsibilities.The FAC must make available the reporting packages received in accordance with 
paragraph (c)of this section and§ 200.507(c)to the public, except for Indian Tribes exercising the option 
inparagraph (b)(3)of this section, and maintain a database of completed audits, provide appropriate 
information to Federal agencies, and follow up with known auditees that have not submitted the required 
data collection forms and reporting packages. 

(h) Electronic filing.Nothing in this part must preclude electronic submissions to the FAC in such a manner as 
may be approved by OMB. 

FEDERAL AGENCIES 

§ 200.513 Responsibilities. 

(a) Cognizant agency for audit responsibilities.

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.513(a)(1) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) A non-Federal entity expending more than $50 million a year in Federal awards must have a 
cognizant agency for audit. The cognizant agency for audit must be the Federal agency that provides 
the largest amount of direct funding (as listed on the non-Federal entity's Schedule of expenditures 
of Federal awards, see§ 200.510(b)) unless OMB designates a specific cognizant agency for audit. 
When the direct funding represents less than 25 percent of the total expenditures (as direct and 
subawards) by the non-Federal entity, then the Federal agency with the predominant amount of total 
funding is the designated cognizant agency for audit. 

(2) To provide for continuity of cognizance, the determination of the predominant amount of direct 
funding must be based upon direct Federal awards expended in the non-Federal entity's fiscal years 
ending in 2019 and every fifth year after that. 

(3) Notwithstanding how audit cognizance is determined, a Federal agency may reassign cognizance to 
another Federal agency that provides substantial funding to an auditee if it agrees to be the 
cognizant agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the 
new cognizant agency for audit must notify the FAC, the auditee, and the auditor (if known) of the 
change. 

(4) The cognizant agency for audit must: 
(i) Provide technical audit advice and liaison assistance to auditees and auditors. 
(ii) Obtain or conduct quality control reviews on selected audits made by non-Federal auditors and 
provide the results to other interested organizations. 

(iii) Cooperate and support the Federal agency designated by OMB to lead a government-wide 
analysis to assess the quality of single audits. The government-wide analysis may rely on the 
current and ongoing quality control review work performed by Federal agencies, State auditors, 
and professional audit associations. This government-wide audit analysis must be performed 
at an interval determined by OMB, and the results must be posted publicly. In providing support 
to the government-wide analysis, a Federal agency must provide the following: 

(A) An assessment of the extent to which single audits conform to the requirements, 
standards, and procedures of this part; and 

(B) Recommendations to address audit quality issues, including recommendations for any 
changes to this part's requirements, standards, and procedures. 

(iv) Promptly inform the appropriate Federal law enforcement officials and impacted Federal 
agencies of any direct reporting by the auditee or its auditor required by GAGAS, Federal 
statute, or regulation. 

(v) Advise the community of independent auditors of any noteworthy or important factual trends 
related to the quality of audits stemming from quality control reviews. Significant problems or 
quality issues consistently identified through quality control reviews of audit reports must be 
referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies. 

(vi) Advise the auditor, Federal awarding agencies, and, where appropriate, the auditee of any 
deficiencies found in the audits when the deficiencies require corrective action by the auditor. 
When advised of deficiencies, the auditee must work with the auditor to take corrective action. 
If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency for audit must notify the auditor, the 
auditee, and applicable Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities of the facts and 

2 CFR 200.513(a)(4)(vi) (enhanced display) page 140 of 208

2 CFR 200.513(a)(4)(vii) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

make recommendations for follow-up action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard 
performance by auditors must be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and 
professional bodies for disciplinary action. 

(vii) Coordinate, to the extent practical, audits or reviews made by or for Federal agencies that are in 
addition to the audits made pursuant to this part, so that the additional audits or reviews build 
upon, rather than duplicate, audits performed in accordance with this part. 

(viii) Coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings that affect the Federal 
programs of more than one agency when requested by any Federal agency whose awards are 
included in the audit finding of the auditee. Cross-cutting audit finding means an audit finding 
where the same underlying condition or issue affects all Federal awards (including Federal 
awards of more than one Federal agency or pass-through entity); for example, a cross-cutting 
audit finding may include an issue related to the recipient's accounting system. 

(ix) Coordinate the audit work and reporting responsibilities among auditors to achieve the most 
cost-effective audit. 

(x) Provide advice to auditees as to how to handle changes in fiscal year. 
(b) Oversight agency for audit responsibilities.An auditee who does not have a designated cognizant agency 
for audit will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency determined in accordance with§ 200.1 
oversight agency for audit.A Federal agency with oversight for an auditee may reassign oversight to 
another Federal agency that agrees to be the oversight agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any 
reassignment, both the old and the new oversight agency for audit must provide notice of the change to 
the FAC, the auditee, and, if known, the auditor. The oversight agency for audit: 

(1) Must provide technical advice and assistance to auditees and auditors. 
(2) May assume all or some of the responsibilities normally performed by a cognizant agency for audit. 
(c) Awarding Federal agency responsibilities.In addition to all other requirements of this part, the awarding 
Federal agency must: 

(1) Ensure that audits are completed, and reports are received in a timely manner in accordance with the 
requirements of this part. 

(2) Provide technical advice and assistance to auditees and auditors. 
(3) Follow-up on audit findings to ensure that non-Federal entities take appropriate and timely corrective 
action. Follow-up includes: 

(i) Issuing a management decision in accordance with§ 200.521; 
(ii) Monitoring the non-Federal entity's progress implementing a corrective action; 
(iii) Using a cooperative audit resolution approach to improve Federal program outcomes through 
better audit resolution, follow-up, and corrective action, which means the use of audit follow-up 
techniques promoting prompt corrective action by improving communication, fostering 
collaboration, promoting trust, and developing an understanding between the Federal agency 
and the non-Federal entity. This approach is based upon: 

(A) A strong commitment by Federal agency and non-Federal entity leadership to Federal 
program integrity; 

2 CFR 200.513(c)(3)(iii)(A) (enhanced display) page 141 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.513(c)(3)(iii)(B) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(B) Federal agencies strengthening partnerships and working cooperatively with non-Federal 
entities and their auditors; non-Federal entities and their auditors working cooperatively 
with Federal agencies; 

(C) A focus on current conditions and corrective action going forward; 
(D) Federal agencies offering appropriate relief for past noncompliance when audits show 
prompt corrective action has occurred; and 

(E) Federal agency leadership sending a clear message that continued failure to correct 
conditions identified by audits likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, or abuse is 
unacceptable and will result in sanctions. 

(iv) Tracking the effectiveness of the Federal agency's follow-up processes, the effectiveness of 
single audits in improving non-Federal entity accountability, and the use of single audits in 
making Federal award decisions. The Federal agency should develop a baseline, metrics, and 
targets to track, over time, the effectiveness of the Federal agency's process to follow up on 
audit findings. 

(4) Provide OMB with annual updates to the compliance supplement. These updates include working 
with OMB to ensure that the compliance supplement focuses the auditor on testing the compliance 
requirements most likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, abuse, or generate audit 
findings for which the Federal agency will take action in accordance with§ 200.505. Prior to 
submitting compliance supplement drafts to OMB, Federal agencies should engage with external 
audit stakeholders, the Federal agency's Office of Inspector General, and the National Single Audit 
Coordinator (NSAC). 

(5) Provide OMB with the name of a single audit accountable official from among the senior policy 
officials of the Federal agency. The accountable official must be: 

(i) Responsible for ensuring that the Federal agency fulfills the requirements of this section and 
effectively uses the single audit process to reduce improper payments and improve Federal 
program outcomes. 

(ii) Accountable for improving the effectiveness of the Federal agency's single audit processes in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iv). 

(iii) Responsible for designating the Federal agency's key management single audit liaison. 
(6) Provide OMB with the name of a key management single audit liaison. The liaison must: 
(i) Serve as the Federal agency's point of contact for the single audit process within and outside 
the Federal Government. 

(ii) Promote interagency coordination, consistency, and information sharing. This includes 
coordinating audit follow-up, identifying higher risk non-Federal entities, providing input on 
single audit and follow-up policy, enhancing the utility of the FAC, and identifying ways to use 
single audit results to improve Federal award accountability and best practices. 

(iii) Oversee training for the Federal agency's program management personnel related to the single 
audit process. 

(iv) Promote the Federal agency's use of a cooperative audit resolution approach as described in 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii)of this section.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(v) Coordinate the Federal agency's audit follow-up processes and ensure non-Federal entities 
implement corrective actions for audit findings. 

(vi) Ensure the Federal agency fulfills its responsibility, as a cognizant agency for audit, to 
coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings under(a)(4)(viii)of this 
section. Cross-cutting audit findings means an audit finding where the same underlying 
condition or issue affects all Federal awards (including Federal awards of more than one 
Federal agency or pass-through entity). For example, this may include an issue related to the 
recipient's accounting system. 

(vii) Ensure the Federal agency provides OMB with annual updates to the compliance supplement 
consistent with the compliance supplement preparation guide. 

(viii) Support the mission of the Federal agency's single audit accountable official and coordinate 
with the Federal agency's Office of Inspector General and National Single Audit Coordinator 
(NSAC). 

AUDITORS 

§ 200.514 Standards and scope of audit. 

(a) General.The audit must be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit must also cover the entire 
operations of the auditee, or, at the option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that 
cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that expended or otherwise administered 
Federal awards during the audit period. In these instances, the audit must include the financial 
statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and other 
organizational unit, which must be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and 
schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same audit period. 

(b) Financial statements.The auditor must determine whether the auditee's financial statements are 
presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a 
special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by State law). The 
auditor must also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all 
material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole. 

(c) Internal control. 
(1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based 
upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

(2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an 
understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low 
assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs. 

(3) Except as provided inparagraph (c)(4)of this section, the auditor must: 
(i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance for major programs to support a low 
assessed level of control risk for assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each 
major program; and 

(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned inparagraph (c)(3)(i)of this section. 
2 CFR 200.514(c)(3)(ii) (enhanced display) page 143 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.514(c)(4) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program are likely 
to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing 
described inparagraph (c)(3)of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. 
However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with§ 
200.516, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional 
compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control. 

(d) Compliance. 
(1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has 
complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that 
may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs. 

(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance 
requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement. 

(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance 
supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. 
Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements, and the changes are not reflected 
in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and 
modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance 
supplement, the auditor must follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not 
included. 

(4) The compliance testing must include tests of transactions or other auditing procedures necessary to 
provide the auditor with sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on compliance. 

(e) Audit follow-up.The auditor must follow up on prior audit findings regardless of whether a prior audit 
finding is related to a major program in the current year. Audit follow-up includes performing procedures 
to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in 
accordance with the requirements of§ 200.511. When the auditor concludes that the summary schedule 
of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding, the auditor must 
report this condition as a current-year audit finding.

§ 200.515 Audit reporting. 

The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports. It may be organized differently 
from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in 
accordance with this part and include the following: 

(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) on whether the financial statement(s) of the auditee is presented 
fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a special 
purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by State law). The auditor must 
also decide whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material 
respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.

(b) A report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance with provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts, and award agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. This report must describe the scope of internal control and compliance testing and the 
results of the tests. Where applicable, the report must refer to the separate schedule of findings and 
questioned costs described inparagraph (d)of this section. 

(c) A report on compliance for each major program and a report on internal control over compliance. This 
report must describe the scope of testing of internal control over compliance and include an opinion (or 
disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the 
terms and conditions of Federal awards that could have a direct and material effect on each major 
program and refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described inparagraph (d) 
of this section. 

(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which must include the following three components: 
(1) A summary of the auditor's results, which must include: 
(i) The type of report the auditor issued (unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or 
disclaimer of opinion) on whether the audited financial statements were prepared in 
accordance with GAAP; 

(ii) A statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control 
were disclosed by the audit of the financial statements; 

(iii) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance that is material to the 
financial statements of the auditee; 

(iv) A statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control 
over major programs were disclosed by the audit; 

(v) The type of report the auditor issued (unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or 
disclaimer of opinion) on compliance for major programs; 

(vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings that the auditor is required to 
report under§ 200.516(a); 

(vii) An identification of major programs by listing each individual major program; however, in the 
case of a cluster of programs, only the cluster name as shown on the schedule of expenditures 
of Federal Awards is required; 

(viii) The dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in 
§ 200.518(b)(1)or(3)when a recalculation of the Type A threshold is required for large loan or 
loan guarantees; and 

(ix) A statement as to whether the auditee qualified as a low-risk auditee under§ 200.520. 
(2) Findings relating to the financial statements required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS. 
(3) Findings and questioned costs for Federal awards which must include audit findings as defined in§ 
200.516(a)and be reported in the following manner: 

(i) Audit findings (for example, internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or 
fraud) that relate to the same issue must be presented as a single audit finding. Where 
practical, audit findings should be organized by Federal agency or pass-through entity.

(ii) Audit findings that relate to both the financial statements (paragraph (d)(2)of this section) and 
Federal awards (thisparagraph (d)(3)) must be reported in both sections of the schedule. 
However, the reporting in one section of the schedule may be in summary form and reference a 
detailed reporting in the other section. 

(e) Nothing in this part precludes combining the reporting required by this section with the reporting required

§ 200.516 Audit findings. 

(a) Audit findings reported.The auditor must report the following as an audit finding in the schedule of 
findings and questioned costs: 

(1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs. The 
auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or a 
material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance 
requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement. 

(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and 
conditions of Federal awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether 
noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of 
Federal awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of 
compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement. 

(3) Known questioned costs when either known or likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a 
type of compliance requirement for a major program. When reporting questioned costs, the auditor 
must include information to provide proper perspective for evaluating the prevalence and 
consequences of the questioned costs. 

(4) Known questioned costs greater than $25,000 for a Federal program that is not audited as a major 
program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required to perform audit procedures for such 
a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is 
not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for 
a Federal program that is not audited as a major program (for example, as part of audit follow-up or 
other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, the auditor must 
report this as an audit finding. 

(5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for each major program is 
other than an unmodified opinion. This must be included unless the circumstances are otherwise 
reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

(6) Known or likely fraud affecting a Federal award, unless the fraud is otherwise reported as an audit 
finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs. This paragraph does not require the auditor 
to publicly report information that could compromise investigative or legal proceedings or to make 
an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside the auditor's 
reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS. 

(7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of 
prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with§ 200.511(b)materially 
misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.

(b) Audit finding detail and clarity.Audit findings must be presented with sufficient detail and clarity for the 
auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies or pass-
through entities to arrive at a management decision. As applicable, the following information must be 
included in audit findings: 

(1) The Federal program and specific Federal award identification, including the Assistance Listings title 
and number, Federal award identification number and year, the name of the Federal agency, and 
name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the Assistance Listings title 
and number or Federal award identification number, is unavailable, the auditor must provide the best 
information available to describe the Federal award. 

(2) The criteria or specific requirement for the audit finding (for example, the specific Federal statute, 
regulation, or term and condition of the Federal award). The criteria or specific requirement provides 
a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings. The criteria should generally identify 
the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation. 

(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding. 
(4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors 
responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or 
desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action 

(5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency or 
pass-through entity to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper 
corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to 
establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria. 

(6) The identification of known questioned costs, by applicable Assistance Listing number(s) and 
Federal award identification number(s), and how these questioned costs were computed. 

(7) When there are known questioned costs but the dollar amount is undetermined or not reported, a 
description of why the dollar amount was undetermined or otherwise could not be reported. 

(8) Information to provide proper perspective for evaluating the prevalence and consequences of the 
audit finding. For example, whether the audit finding represents an isolated instance or a systemic 
problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of 
cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. In addition, the audit finding should 
indicate whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample. 

(9) The identification of whether the audit finding is a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit. 
The audit finding must identify the applicable prior year audit finding reference numbers in these 
instances. 

(10) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding. 
(11) Views of responsible officials of the auditee. 
(c) Reference numbers.Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs must include a 
reference number in the format meeting the requirements of the data collection form submission (see§ 
200.512(b)).

§ 200.517 Audit documentation. 

(a) Retention of audit documentation.The auditor must retain audit documentation and reports for a 
minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee. The cognizant 
agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity 
may extend the retention period by providing written notification to the auditor. When the auditor is aware 
that the Federal agency, pass-through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor must 
contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to the destruction of the audit 
documentation and reports. 
(b) Access to audit documentation.Audit documentation must be made available upon request to the 
cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, cognizant agency for indirect cost, a Federal 
agency, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to 
carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this part. Access to audit 
documentation includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of audit documentation as is 
reasonable and necessary. 
§ 200.518 Major program determination. 

(a) General.The auditor must use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major 
programs. This risk-based approach must consider current and prior audit experience, oversight by 
Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process 
described inparagraphs (b)through(h)of this section must be followed. 
(b) Step one. 
(1) The auditor must identify and label the larger Federal programs as Type A programs. Type A 
programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period 
exceeding the levels outlined in table 1: 
TABLE 1 TO PARAGRAPH (b)(1) 

Total Federal awards expended 


Equal to or exceed $1,000,000 but less than or equal to 
$34 million 
Exceed $34 million but less than or equal to $100 million 

Exceed $100 million but less than or equal to $1 billion 
Exceed $1 billion but less than or equal to $10 billion 

Exceed $10 billion but less than or equal to $20 billion 
Exceed $20 billion

(2) Federal programs not labeled Type A underparagraph (b)(1)of this section must be labeled Type B 
programs.

2 CFR 200.518(b)(3) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(3) Including large loans and loan guarantees (loans) must not result in the exclusion of other programs 
as Type A programs. A Federal program providing loans is considered a large loan program when it 
exceeds four times the largest non-loan program. The auditor must identify each large loan program 
as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs. This recalculation 
of the Type A program is performed after removing the total of all large loan programs. For this 
paragraph, a program is only considered a Federal program providing loans if the value of Federal 
awards expended for loans within the program comprises 50 percent or more of the total Federal 
awards expended for the program. A cluster of programs is treated as one program, and the value of 
Federal awards expended under a loan program is determined as described in§ 200.502. 

(4) For biennial audits (see§ 200.504), the determination of Type A and Type B programs must be based 
on the Federal awards expended during the two-year audit period. 

(c) Step two. 
(1) The auditor must identify Type A programs that are low-risk. In making this determination, the auditor 
must consider whether the requirements in§ 200.519(c), the results of audit follow-up, or any 
changes in personnel or systems affecting the program indicate significantly increased risk and 
preclude the program from being low-risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it must 
have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the 
most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, the 
program must not have had: 

(i) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report 
on internal control for major programs as required under§ 200.515(c); 

(ii) A modified opinion on the program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under 
§ 200.515(c); or 

(iii) Known or likely questioned costs that exceed five percent of the total Federal awards expended 
for the program. 

(2) Notwithstandingparagraph (c)(1)of this section, OMB may approve a Federal agency request that a 
Type A program not be considered low-risk for a specific recipient. For example, it may be necessary 
for a large Type A program to be audited as a major program each year for a particular recipient for 
the Federal agency to comply with31 U.S.C. 3515. The Federal agency must notify the auditee and, if 
known, the auditor of OMB's approval at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to 
be audited. 

(d) Step three. 
(1) The auditor must identify high-risk Type B programs using professional judgment and the criteria in§ 
200.519. However, the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than at 
least one-fourth of the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under step two. 
Except for known material weakness in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in§ 
200.519(b)(1),(2), and(c)(1), a single criterion in risk would rarely cause a Type B program to be 
considered high-risk. When identifying which Type B programs to assess for risk, the auditor is 
encouraged to use an approach that provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs 
to be audited as major programs over a period of time.

2 CFR 200.518(d)(2) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(2) The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on relatively small Federal programs. 
Therefore, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed 
25 percent (0.25) of the Type A threshold determined in step one. 

(e) Step four.At a minimum, the auditor must audit all of the following as major programs: 
(1) All Type A programs not identified as low-risk under step two. 
(2) All Type B programs identified as high-risk under step three. 
(3) Additional programs as necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule described in 
paragraph (f). This rule may require the auditor to audit more programs as major programs than the 
number of Type A programs. 

(f) Percentage of coverage rule.When the auditee meets the criteria in§ 200.520, the auditor only needs to 
audit the major programs identified inparagraphs (e)(1)and(2)of this section and such additional 
Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, all major programs encompass at 
least 20 percent (0.20) of total Federal awards expended. Otherwise, the auditor must audit the major 
programs identified inparagraphs (e)(1)and(2)of this section and such additional Federal programs with 
Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 40 percent (0.40) 
of total Federal awards expended. 

(g) Documentation of risk.The auditor must include in the audit documentation the risk analysis used for 
determining major programs. 

(h) Auditor
's judgment.The auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major 

programs must be presumed correct when the determination was performed and documented in 
accordance with this part. Challenges by a Federal agency or pass-through entity must only be for clearly 
improper use of the requirements in this part. However, a Federal agency or pass-through entity may 
provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program. The auditor must consider this 
guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed. 

§ 200.519 Criteria for Federal program risk. 

(a) General.The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of 
noncompliance occurring that could be material to the Federal program. The auditor must consider 
criteria, such as those described inparagraphs (b),(c), and(d)of this section, to identify risk in Federal 
programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program 
with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity. 

(b) Current and prior audit experience. 
(1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Therefore, 
consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs. This includes 
considering factors such as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, 
regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, and the competence and experience of 
personnel who administer the Federal programs. 

(i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. 
When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor must consider whether weaknesses are 
isolated in a single operating unit (for example, one college campus) or pervasive throughout 
the entity.

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR 200.519(b)(1)(ii) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(ii) A weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk when significant parts of 
a Federal program are passed to subrecipients through subawards. 

(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, especially when the situations identified in the audit 
findings could significantly impact a Federal program or have not been corrected. 

(3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than those recently 
audited as major programs without audit findings. 

(c) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities. 
(1) The oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities may be used to assess risk. For 
example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no 
significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant 
problems would indicate higher risk. 

(2) With the concurrence of OMB, a Federal agency may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. 
OMB will identify these Federal programs in the compliance supplement. 

(d) Inherent risk of the Federal program. 
(1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity 
of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For 
example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third-party contracts or have eligibility 
criteria may be higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may be at high 
risk for noncompliance with the requirements of§ 200.430but otherwise be at low risk. 

(2) The phase of a Federal program in its lifecycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, 
a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established 
program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, 
regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk. 

(3) The phase of a Federal program in its lifecycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during 
the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due 
to the start-up or closeout of program activities and staff. 

(4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with 
substantially smaller Federal awards expended. 

§ 200.520 Criteria for a low-risk auditee. 

An auditee that meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two audit periods must qualify as a 
low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage in accordance with§ 200.518. 

(a) Single audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, 
including submitting the data collection form and the reporting package to the FAC within the timeframe 
specified in§ 200.512. A non-Federal entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee. 

(b) The auditor
's opinion on whether the financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally 

accepted accounting principles (or a special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or 
regulatory as required by State law), and the auditor's in-relation-to opinion on the schedule of 
expenditures of Federal awards were unmodified.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(c) No internal control deficiencies were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of 
GAGAS. 

(d) The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern. 
(e) None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two 
audit periods in which they were classified as Type A programs: 

(1) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on 
internal control for major programs as required under§ 200.515(c); 

(2) A modified opinion on a major program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under§ 
200.515(c); or 

(3) Known or likely questioned costs that exceeded five percent (.05) of the total Federal awards 
expended for a Type A program during the audit period. 

MANAGEMENT DECISIONS 

§ 200.521 Management decisions. 

(a) General.The management decision must clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the 
reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial 
adjustments or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for 
follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through 
entity may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for 
auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The 
management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, 
the Federal agency or pass-through entity may also issue a management decision on findings relating to 
the financial statements, which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS. 

(b) Federal agency.The cognizant agency for audit is responsible for coordinating a management decision for 
audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency (see§ 200.513(a)(4)(viii)). The 
awarding Federal agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings that affect 
the Federal awards it makes to a non-Federal entity (see§ 200.513(c)(3)(i)). 

(c) Pass-through entity.The pass-through entity is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit 
findings that affect subawards it issues to subrecipients under a Federal award (see§ 200.332(e)). 

(d) Time requirements.The Federal agency or pass-through entity responsible for issuing a management 
decision must do so within six months of the FAC's acceptance of the audit report. The auditee must 
initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no 
later than upon receipt of the audit report. 

(e) Reference numbers.Management decisions must include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to 
each audit finding in accordance with§ 200.516(c).

(ii) For electronic NOFOs and other information about them, comply with Section 508 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d). 

(2) Considerations for developing NOFOs.Federal agencies may: 
(i) Link to standard content to include required information rather than including the full language 
in the NOFO. The NOFO should make clear if linked information is critical—for example, 
standard terms and conditions, administrative and national policy requirements, and standard 
templates. 

(ii) Include links to relevant regulations and other sources. 
(iii) Use cross-references between the sections, including hyperlinks in electronic versions. 
(3) Required Consistency.Potential applicants must be able to find similar information across all Federal 
NOFOs. To that end, Federal agencies must include the same or similar section headings and a table 
of contents with at least these sections: 

(i) Basic Information 
(ii) Eligibility 
(iii) Program Description 
(iv) Application Contents and Format 
(v) Submission Requirements and Deadlines 
(vi) Application Review Information 
(vii) Award Notices 
(viii) Post-Award Requirements and Administration 
(b) Required Sections and Information. 
As required below, the Federal agency must include the following sections and information in the text of a 
NOFO and a table of contents. 

(1) Basic Information. 
This section provides sufficient information to help an applicant make an informed decision about 
whether to submit a proposal. 

(i) This section must include the following: 
(A) Federal Agency Name. 
(B) Funding Opportunity Title. 
(C) I Announcement Type (whether the funding opportunity is the initial announcement or a 
modification of a previously announced opportunity). 

(D) Funding Opportunity Number (required, if the Federal agency has assigned a number to 
the funding opportunity announcement).

also include the date on which those materials will be released; and any other additional 
information, as deemed applicable by the Federal agency. If possible, the Federal agency 
should provide an anticipated award date. If the NOFO is evaluated on a “rolling” basis, the 
Federal agency should provide an estimate of the time needed to process an application 
and notify the applicant of the Federal agency's decision. 

(H) Executive Summary. A brief description that is written in plain language and summarizes 
the goals and objectives of the program, the target audience, and eligible recipients. The 
text of the executive summary should not exceed 500 words 

(I) Agency contact information.

(C) A reference to the regulation or requirement that describes the restriction, if applicable. 
For example, if entities that have been found to be in violation of a particular Federal 
statute are ineligible, say so. 

(ii) Review Criteria.This section must address the review criteria that the Federal agency will use to 
evaluate applications for merit. This information includes the merit and other review criteria 
evaluators will use to judge applications, including any statutory, regulatory, or other

it is not an eligibility criterion in Section 2b. For example, to assign a certain number 
of additional points to applicants who offer cost sharing or to break ties among 
applications with equivalent scores after evaluation against all other factors. If cost 
sharing will not be considered in the evaluation, the announcement should say so. Do 
not include statements that cost sharing is encouraged without providing clarity 
about what that means. 

(5) The relevant information if the Federal agency permits applicants to nominate 
reviewers of their applications or suggest those they feel may be inappropriate due to 
a conflict of interest.

(1) A brief description of the factors used for the Federal agency's risk review as required 
by§ 200.206. 

(2) If the Federal agency expects that any award under the NOFO will be more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold during its period of performance, include the 
following information: 

(i) That before making a Federal award with a total amount of Federal share 
greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, the Federal agency must 
review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the 
responsibility/qualification records available inSAM.gov(see41 U.S.C. 2313). 

(ii) That an applicant can review and comment on any information in the 
responsibility/qualification records available inSAM.gov.

following selection. 

(i) It must include the following: 
(A) If the Federal agency's practice is to provide a separate notice stating that an application 
has been selected before it makes the Federal award, indicate that the letter is not an 
authorization to begin performance and that the Federal award is the authorizing 
document. 

(B) If pre-award costs are allowed, beginning performance is at the applicant's own risk. 
(C) This section should indicate that the notice of Federal award signed by the grants officer, 
or equivalent, is the official document that obligates funds, and whether it is provided 
through postal mail or by electronic means and to whom.

have difficulty complying. This section must include the following: 
(A) A statement related to the “general” terms and conditions of the award, including 
requirements that the Federal agency normally includes. 

(B) Any relevant specific terms and conditions. 
(C) Any special requirements that could apply to specific awards after the review of

Appendix II to Part 200—Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal 
Awards 

In addition to other provisions required by the Federal agency or non-Federal entity, all contracts made by the non-
Federal entity under the Federal award must contain provisions covering the following, as applicable. 

(A) Contracts for more than the simplified acquisition threshold, which is the inflation adjusted amount 
determined by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council 
(Councils) as authorized by41 U.S.C. 1908, must address administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in 
instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and 
penalties as appropriate. 

(B) All contracts in excess of $10,000 must address termination for cause and for convenience by the non-
Federal entity including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. 

(C) Equal Employment Opportunity. Except as otherwise provided under41 CFR Part 60, all contracts that 
meet the definition of “federally assisted construction contract” in41 CFR Part 60-1.3must include the 
equal opportunity clause provided under41 CFR 60-1.4(b), in accordance withExecutive Order 11246, 
“Equal Employment Opportunity” (30 FR 12319,12935,3 CFR Part, 1964-1965Comp., p. 339), as 
amended byExecutive Order 11375, “AmendingExecutive Order 11246Relating to Equal Employment 
Opportunity,” and implementing regulations at41 CFR part 60, “Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.”

supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5, “Labor Standards Provisions 
Applicable to Contracts Covering Federally Financed and Assisted Construction”). In accordance with the 
statute, contractors must be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the 
prevailing wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, 
contractors must be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The non-Federal entity must place 
a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each 
solicitation. The decision to award a contract or subcontract must be conditioned upon the acceptance of 
the wage determination. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the 
Federal awarding agency. The contracts must also include a provision for compliance with the Copeland 
“Anti-Kickback” Act (40 U.S.C. 3145), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part

awarded by the non-Federal entity in excess of $100,000 that involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers must include a provision for compliance with40 U.S.C. 3702and3704, as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). Under40 U.S.C. 3702of the Act, each contractor must 
be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 
40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is 
compensated at a rate of not less than one and a half times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in 
excess of 40 hours in the work week. The requirements of40 U.S.C. 3704are applicable to construction

as amended—Contracts and subgrants of amounts in excess of $150,000 must contain a provision that 
requires the non-Federal award to agree to comply with all applicable standards, orders or regulations 
issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387). Violations must be reported to the Federal awarding agency and the

must not be made to parties listed on the governmentwide exclusions in the System for Award 
Management (SAM), in accordance with the OMB guidelines at2 CFR 180that implement Executive 
Orders 12549 (3 CFR part 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235), “Debarment

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 A.1.a. 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

This appendix provides criteria for identifying and computing indirect (or indirect (F&A)) rates at IHEs 
(institutions). Indirect (F&A) costs are those that are incurred for common or joint objectives and 
therefore cannot be identified readily and specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional 
activity, or any other institutional activity. See subsection B.1 for a discussion of the components of 
indirect (F&A) costs. 

1. Major Functions/Activities of an IHE 
Refers to instruction, organized research, other sponsored activities and other institutional activities 
as defined in this section: 

a. 
Instructionmeans the teaching and training activities of an institution. Except for research 
training as provided in subsection b, this term includes all teaching and training activities, 
whether they are offered for credits toward a degree or certificate or on a non-credit basis, and 
whether they are offered through regular academic departments or separate divisions, such as 
a summer school division or an extension division. Also considered part of this major function 
are departmental research, and, where agreed to, university research. 

(1) Sponsored instruction and trainingmeans specific instructional or training activity 
established by grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. For purposes of the cost 
principles, this activity may be considered a major function even though an institution's 
accounting treatment may include it in the instruction function. 
(2) Departmental researchmeans research, development and scholarly activities that are not 
organized research and, consequently, are not separately budgeted and accounted for. 
Departmental research, for purposes of this document, is not considered as a major 
function, but as a part of the instruction function of the institution. 
(3) Only mandatory cost sharing or cost sharing specifically committed in the project budget 
must be included in the organized research base for computing the indirect (F&A) cost 
rate or reflected in any allocation of indirect costs. Salary costs above statutory limits are 
not considered cost sharing. 
b. 
Organized researchmeans all research and development activities of an institution that are 

separately budgeted and accounted for. It includes: 

(1) Sponsored researchmeans all research and development activities that are sponsored by 
Federal and non-Federal agencies and organizations. This term includes activities 
involving the training of individuals in research techniques (commonly called research 
training) where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and 
development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction 
function. 
(2) University researchmeans all research and development activities that are separately 
budgeted and accounted for by the institution under an internal application of institutional 
funds. University research, for purposes of this document, must be combined with 
sponsored research under the function of organized research.

c. 
d. 
Other sponsored activitiesmeans programs and projects financed by Federal and non-Federal 
agencies and organizations which involve the performance of work other than instruction and 
organized research. Examples of such programs and projects are health service projects and 
community service programs. However, when any of these activities are undertaken by the 
institution without outside support, they may be classified as other institutional activities. 

Other institutional activitiesmeans all activities of an institution except for instruction, 
departmental research, organized research, and other sponsored activities, as defined in this 
section; indirect (F&A) cost activities identified in this Appendix paragraph B, Identification and 
assignment of indirect (F&A) costs; and specialized services facilities described in§ 200.468 
of this part. 

2. Criteria for Distribution 
a. 
Base period.A base period for distribution of indirect (F&A) costs is the period during which the 

costs are incurred. The base period normally should coincide with the fiscal year established by 

the institution, but in any event the base period should be so selected as to avoid inequities in 
the distribution of costs. 

b. 
Need for cost groupings.The overall objective of the indirect (F&A) cost allocation process is to 

distribute the indirect (F&A) costs described in Section B, Identification and assignment of 

indirect (F&A) costs, to the major functions of the institution in proportions reasonably 
consistent with the nature and extent of their use of the institution's resources. In order to 

achieve this objective, it may be necessary to provide for selective distribution by establishing 

separate groupings of cost within one or more of the indirect (F&A) cost categories referred to 

in subsection B.1. In general, the cost groupings established within a category should 

constitute, in each case, a pool of those items of expense that are considered to be of like 

nature in terms of their relative contribution to (or degree of remoteness from) the particular 

cost objectives to which distribution is appropriate. Cost groupings should be established 

considering the general guides provided in subsection c of this section. Each such pool or cost 

grouping should then be distributed individually to the related cost objectives, using the 

distribution base or method most appropriate in light of the guidelines set forth in subsection d 
of this section. 

c. 
General considerations on cost groupings.The extent to which separate cost groupings and 

selective distribution would be appropriate at an institution is a matter of judgment to be 

determined on a case-by-case basis. Typical situations which may warrant the establishment of 

two or more separate cost groupings (based on account classification or analysis) within an 

indirect (F&A) cost category include but are not limited to the following: 

(1) If certain items or categories of expense relate solely to one of the major functions of the 
institution or to less than all functions, such expenses should be set aside as a separate 
cost grouping for direct assignment or selective allocation in accordance with the guides 
provided in subsections b and d. 
(2) If any types of expense ordinarily treated as general administration or departmental 
administration are charged to Federal awards as direct costs, expenses applicable to 
other activities of the institution when incurred for the same purposes in like

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 A.2.c.(3) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

circumstances must, through separate cost groupings, be excluded from the indirect 
(F&A) costs allocable to those Federal awards and included in the direct cost of other 
activities for cost allocation purposes. 

(3) If it is determined that certain expenses are for the support of a service unit or facility 
whose output is susceptible of measurement on a workload or other quantitative basis, 
such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for distribution on such 
basis to organized research, instructional, and other activities at the institution or within 
the department. 

(4) If activities provide their own purchasing, personnel administration, building maintenance 
or similar service, the distribution of general administration and general expenses, or 
operation and maintenance expenses to such activities should be accomplished through 
cost groupings which include only that portion of central indirect (F&A) costs (such as for 
overall management) which are properly allocable to such activities. 

(5) If the institution elects to treat fringe benefits as indirect (F&A) charges, such costs should 
be set aside as a separate cost grouping for selective distribution to related cost 
objectives. 

(6) The number of separate cost groupings within a category should be held within practical 
limits, after taking into consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the 
degree of precision attainable through less selective methods of distribution. 

Selection of distribution method.

d. 
(1) Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the method or base to be used 
in distributing individual cost groupings. The essential consideration in selecting a base is 
that it be the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives in 
accordance with benefits derived; with a traceable cause-and-effect relationship; or with 
logic and reason, where neither benefit nor a cause-and-effect relationship is 
determinable. 

(2) If a cost grouping can be identified directly with the cost objective benefitted, it should be 
assigned to that cost objective. 

(3) If the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature, the distribution may be 
based on a cost analysis study which results in an equitable distribution of the costs. 
Such cost analysis studies may take into consideration weighting factors, population, or 
space occupied if appropriate. Cost analysis studies, however, must 

(a) be appropriately documented in sufficient detail for subsequent review by the 
cognizant agency for indirect costs, 

(b) distribute the costs to the related cost objectives in accordance with the relative 
benefits derived, 

(c) be statistically sound, 
(d) be performed specifically at the institution at which the results are to be used, and

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(e) be reviewed periodically, but not less frequently than rate negotiations, updated if 
necessary, and used consistently. Any assumptions made in the study must be 
stated and explained. The use of cost analysis studies and periodic changes in the 
method of cost distribution must be fully justified. 
(4) If a cost analysis study is not performed, or if the study does not result in an equitable 
distribution of the costs, the distribution must be made in accordance with the appropriate 
base cited in Section B, unless one of the following conditions is met: 
(a) It can be demonstrated that the use of a different base would result in a more 
equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more readily available base would not 
increase the costs charged to Federal awards, or 
(b) The institution qualifies for, and elects to use, the simplified method for computing 
indirect (F&A) cost rates described in Section D. 
(5) Notwithstanding subsection (3), effective July 1, 1998, a cost analysis or base other than 
that in Section B must not be used to distribute utility or student services costs. Instead, 
subsection B.4.c, may be used in the recovery of utility costs. 
e. 
Order of distribution. 

(1) Indirect (F&A) costs are the broad categories of costs discussed in Section B.1. 
(2) Depreciation, interest expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and general 
administrative and general expenses should be allocated in that order to the remaining 
indirect (F&A) cost categories as well as to the major functions and specialized service 
facilities of the institution. Other cost categories may be allocated in the order determined 
to be most appropriate by the institutions. When cross allocation of costs is made as 
provided in subsection (3), this order of allocation does not apply. 
(3) Normally an indirect (F&A) cost category will be considered closed once it has been 
allocated to other cost objectives, and costs may not be subsequently allocated to it. 
However, a cross allocation of costs between two or more indirect (F&A) cost categories 
may be used if such allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If a cross 
allocation is used, an appropriate modification to the composition of the indirect (F&A) 
cost categories described in Section B is required. 
B. Identification and Assignment of Indirect (F&A) Costs 
1. Definition of Facilities and Administration 
See§ 200.414which provides the basis for these indirect cost requirements. 

2. Depreciation 
a. 
The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs of the institution's buildings, capital 
improvements to land and buildings, and equipment which are computed in accordance with§ 

200.436.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this 
category must be allocated in the following manner: 
a. 
(1) Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a single function, and on capital 
improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be assigned to that function. 
(2) Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and on capital improvements and 
equipment used in such buildings, must be allocated to the individual functions performed in 
each building on the basis of usable square feet of space, excluding common areas such as 
hallways, stairwells, and rest rooms. 
(3) Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment related to space (e.g., 
individual rooms, laboratories) used jointly by more than one function (as determined by the 
users of the space) must be treated as follows. The cost of each jointly used unit of space 
must be allocated to benefitting functions on the basis of: 
(a) The employee full-time equivalents (FTEs) or salaries and wages of those individual 
functions benefitting from the use of that space; or 
(b) Institution-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages applicable to the benefitting major 
functions (see Section A.1) of the institution. 
(4) Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as paved parking areas, fences, 
sidewalks, and the like, not included in the cost of buildings, must be allocated to user 
categories of students and employees on a full-time equivalent basis. The amount allocated to 
the student category must be assigned to the instruction function of the institution. The 
amount allocated to the employee category must be further allocated to the major functions of 
the institution in proportion to the salaries and wages of all employees applicable to those 
functions. 
3. Interest 
Interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, as defined in§ 
200.449, must be classified as an expenditure under the category Facilities. These costs must be 
allocated in the same manner as the depreciation on the buildings, equipment and capital improvements 
to which the interest relates. 

4. Operation and Maintenance Expenses 
The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration, 
supervision, operation, maintenance, preservation, and protection of the institution's physical plant. 
They include expenses normally incurred for such items as janitorial and utility services; repairs and 
ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance 
and operation of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness; 
environmental safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and all other insurance relating to 
property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. The 
operation and maintenance expense category should also include its allocable share of fringe 
benefit costs, depreciation, and interest costs. 
b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this 
category must be allocated in the same manner as described in subsection 2.b for depreciation.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

c. 
A utility cost adjustment of up to 1.3 percentage points may be included in the negotiated indirect 

cost rate of the IHE for organized research, per the computation alternatives inparagraphs (c)(1)and 
(2)of this section: 

(1) Where space is devoted to a single function and metering allows unambiguous measurement 
of usage related to that space, costs must be assigned to the function located in that space. 

(2) Where space is allocated to different functions and metering does not allow unambiguous 
measurement of usage by function, costs must be allocated as follows: 

(i) Utilities costs should be apportioned to functions in the same manner as depreciation, 
based on the calculated difference between the site or building actual square footage for 
monitored research laboratory space (site, building, floor, or room), and a separate 
calculation prepared by the IHE using the “effective square footage” described in 
subsection (c)(2)(ii) of this section. 

(ii) “Effective square footage”allocated to research laboratory space must be calculated as 
the actual square footage times the relative energy utilization index (REUI) posted on the 
OMB Web site at the time of a rate determination. 

A. 
B. 
This index is the ratio of a laboratory energy use index (lab EUI) to the corresponding 

index for overall average college or university space (college EUI). 

In July 2012, values for these two indices (taken respectively from the Lawrence 

Berkeley Laboratory “Labs for the 21st Century” benchmarking tool and the US 
Department of Energy “Buildings Energy Databook” and were 310 kBtu/sq ft-yr. and 
155 kBtu/sq ft-yr., so that the adjustment ratio is 2.0 by this methodology. To retain 
currency, OMB will adjust the EUI numbers from time to time (no more often than 
annually nor less often than every 5 years), using reliable and publicly disclosed data. 
Current values of both the EUIs and the REUI will be posted on the OMB website. 

5. General Administration and General Expenses 
a. 
The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the general executive and 

administrative offices of educational institutions and other expenses of a general character which do 
not relate solely to any major function of the institution;i.e.,solely to 

(1) instruction, 
(2) organized research, 
(3) other sponsored activities, or 
(4) other institutional activities. The general administration and general expense category should 
also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance expense, 
depreciation, and interest costs. Examples of general administration and general expenses 
include: Those expenses incurred by administrative offices that serve the entire university 
system of which the institution is a part; central offices of the institution such as the President's 
or Chancellor's office, the offices for institution-wide financial management, business services, 
budget and planning, personnel management, and safety and risk management; the office of 
the General Counsel; and the operations of the central administrative management information

systems. General administration and general expenses must not include expenses incurred 
within non-university-wide deans' offices, academic departments, organized research units, or 
similar organizational units. (See subsection 6.) 

b. 
In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this 

category must be grouped first according to common major functions of the institution to which they 

render services or provide benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group must then be allocated 
to serviced or benefitted functions on the modified total cost basis. Modified total costs consist of 

the same elements as those in Section C.2. When an activity included in this indirect (F&A) cost 

category provides a service or product to another institution or organization, an appropriate 

adjustment must be made to either the expenses or the basis of allocation or both, to assure a 

proper allocation of costs. 

6. Departmental Administration Expenses 
a. 
The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for administrative and 

supporting services that benefit common or joint departmental activities or objectives in academic 

deans' offices, academic departments and divisions, and organized research units. Organized 

research units include such units as institutes, study centers, and research centers. Departmental 

administration expenses are subject to the following limitations. 

(1) Academic deans' offices. Salaries and operating expenses are limited to those attributable to 
administrative functions. 
(a) Salaries and fringe benefits attributable to the administrative work (including bid and 
proposal preparation) of faculty (including department heads) and other professional 
personnel conducting research and/or instruction, must be allowed at a rate of 3.6 percent 
of modified total direct costs. This category does not include professional business or 
professional administrative officers. This allowance must be added to the computation of 
the indirect (F&A) cost rate for major functions in Section C; the expenses covered by the 
allowance must be excluded from the departmental administration cost pool. No 
documentation is required to support this allowance. 
(b) Other administrative and supporting expenses incurred within academic departments are 
allowable provided they are treated consistently in like circumstances. This would include 
expenses such as the salaries of secretarial and clerical staffs, the salaries of 
administrative officers and assistants, travel, office supplies, stockrooms, and the like. 
(3) Other fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages included in subsections (1) and 
(2) are allowable, as well as an appropriate share of general administration and general 
expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation. 
(4) Federal agencies may authorize reimbursement of additional costs for department heads and 
faculty only in exceptional cases where an institution can demonstrate undue hardship or 
detriment to project performance. 
b. 
The following guidelines apply to the determination of departmental administrative costs as direct or 
indirect (F&A) costs.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) In developing the departmental administration cost pool, special care should be exercised to 
ensure that costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently 
as either direct or indirect (F&A) costs. For example, salaries of technical staff, laboratory 
supplies (e.g.,chemicals), telephone toll charges, animals, animal care costs, computer costs, 
travel costs, and specialized shop costs must be treated as direct costs wherever identifiable to 
a particular cost objective. Direct charging of these costs may be accomplished through 
specific identification of individual costs to benefitting cost objectives, or through recharge 
centers or specialized service facilities, as appropriate under the circumstances. See§§ 
200.413(c)and200.468. 
(2) Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs, and memberships must normally 
be treated as indirect (F&A) costs. 
c. 
In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this 
category must be allocated as follows: 

(1) The administrative expenses of the dean's office of each college and school must be allocated 
to the academic departments within that college or school on the modified total cost basis. 
(2) The administrative expenses of each academic department, and the department's share of the 
expenses allocated in subsection (1) must be allocated to the appropriate functions of the 
department on the modified total cost basis. 
7. Sponsored Projects Administration 
a. 
The expenses under this heading are limited to those incurred by a separate organization(s) 

established primarily to administer sponsored projects, including such functions as grant and 

contract administration (Federal and non-Federal), special security, purchasing, personnel, 

administration, and editing and publishing of research and other reports. They include the salaries 

and expenses of the head of such organization, assistants, and immediate staff, together with the 

salaries and expenses of personnel engaged in supporting activities maintained by the organization, 

such as stock rooms, print shops, and the like. This category also includes an allocable share of 

fringe benefit costs, general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance 

expenses, and depreciation. Appropriate adjustments will be made for services provided to other 

functions or organizations. 

b. 
c. 
In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this 

category must be allocated to the major functions of the institution under which the sponsored 

projects are conducted on the basis of the modified total cost of sponsored projects. 

An appropriate adjustment must be made to eliminate any duplicate charges to Federal awards 

when this category includes similar or identical activities as those included in the general 

administration and general expense category or other indirect (F&A) cost items, such as accounting, 

procurement, or personnel administration. 

8. Library Expenses 
a. 
The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the operation of the library, 

including the cost of books and library materials purchased for the library, less any items of library 

income that qualify as applicable credits under§ 200.406. The library expense category should also 

include the fringe benefits applicable to the salaries and wages included therein, an appropriate

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

share of general administration and general expense, operation and maintenance expense, and 

depreciation. Costs incurred in the purchases of rare books (museum-type books) with no value to 
Federal awards should not be allocated to them. 

b. 
In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this 

category must be allocated first on the basis of primary categories of users, including students, 

professional employees, and other users. 

c. 
(1) The student category must consist of full-time equivalent students enrolled at the institution, 
regardless of whether they earn credits toward a degree or certificate. 
(2) The professional employee category must consist of all faculty members and other 
professional employees of the institution, on a full-time equivalent basis. This category may 
also include post-doctorate fellows and graduate students. 
(3) The other users category must consist of a reasonable factor as determined by institutional 
records to account for all other users of library facilities. 
Amount allocated in paragraph b of this section must be assigned further as follows: 

(1) The amount in the student category must be assigned to the instruction function of the 
institution. 
(2) The amount in the professional employee category must be assigned to the major functions of 
the institution in proportion to the salaries and wages of all faculty members and other 
professional employees applicable to those functions. 
(3) The amount in the other users category must be assigned to the other institutional activities 
function of the institution. 
9. Student Administration and Services 
a. 
The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration of student 

affairs and for services to students, including expenses of such activities as deans of students, 

admissions, registrar, counseling and placement services, student advisers, student health and 

infirmary services, catalogs, and commencements and convocations. The salaries of members of 

the academic staff whose responsibilities to the institution require administrative work that benefits 

sponsored projects may also be included to the extent that the portion charged to student 

administration is determined in accordance withsubpart E of this Part. This expense category also 

includes the fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages included therein, an 

appropriate share of general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance, 

interest expense, and depreciation. 

b. 
In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses in this category must 
be allocated to the instruction function, and subsequently to Federal awards in that function. 

10. Offset for Indirect (F&A) Expenses Otherwise Provided for by the Federal Government 
a. 
The items to be accumulated under this heading are the reimbursements and other payments from 

the Federal Government which are made to the institution to support solely, specifically, and directly, 

in whole or in part, any of the administrative or service activities described in subsections 2 through 
9. 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 10.a. (enhanced display) page 172 of 208

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 10.b. 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

b. 
The items in this group must be treated as a credit to the affected individual indirect (F&A) cost 

category before that category is allocated to benefitting functions. 

C. Determination and Application of Indirect (F&A) Cost Rate or Rates 
1. Indirect (F&A) Cost Pools 
a. 
(1) Subject to subsection b, the separate categories of indirect (F&A) costs allocated to each major 
function of the institution as prescribed in Section B, must be aggregated and treated as a 
common pool for that function. The amount in each pool must be divided by the distribution 
base described in subsection 2 to arrive at a single indirect (F&A) cost rate for each function. 

(2) The rate for each function is used to distribute indirect (F&A) costs to individual Federal awards 
of that function. Since a common pool is established for each major function of the institution, 
a separate indirect (F&A) cost rate would be established for each of the major functions 
described in Section A.1 under which Federal awards are carried out. 

(3) Each institution's indirect (F&A) cost rate process must be appropriately designed to ensure 
that Federal sponsors do not in any way subsidize the indirect (F&A) costs of other sponsors, 
specifically activities sponsored by industry and foreign governments. Accordingly, each 
allocation method used to identify and allocate the indirect (F&A) cost pools, as described in 
Sections A.2 and B.2 through B.9, must contain the full amount of the institution's modified 
total costs or other appropriate units of measurement used to make the computations. In 
addition, the final rate distribution base (as defined in subsection 2) for each major function 
(organized research, instruction, etc., as described in Section A.1 functions of an institution) 
must contain all the programs or activities which utilize the indirect (F&A) costs allocated to 
that major function. At the time an indirect (F&A) cost proposal is submitted to a cognizant 
agency for indirect costs, each institution must describe the process it uses to ensure that 
Federal funds are not used to subsidize industry and foreign government funded programs. 

2. The Distribution Basis 
Indirect (F&A) costs must be distributed to applicable Federal awards and other benefitting activities 
within each major function (see section A.1) on the basis of modified total direct costs (MTDC), 
consisting of all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the 
first $50,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period covered by the subaward). MTDC is defined in§ 

200.1. For this purpose, an indirect (F&A) cost rate should be determined for each of the separate indirect 
(F&A) cost pools developed pursuant to subsection 1. The rate in each case should be stated as the 
percentage which the amount of the particular indirect (F&A) cost pool is of the modified total direct 
costs identified with such pool. 
3. Negotiated Lump Sum for Indirect (F&A) Costs 
A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect (F&A) costs may be appropriate for self-contained, off-
campus, or primarily subcontracted activities where the benefits derived from an institution's indirect 
(F&A) services cannot be readily determined. Such negotiated indirect (F&A) costs will be treated as an 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 1.a.(3) (enhanced display) page 173 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 1.a.(3) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

offset before allocation to instruction, organized research, other sponsored activities, and other 
institutional activities. The base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be appropriately 
adjusted. 

4. Predetermined Rates for Indirect (F&A) Costs 
Public Law 87-638 (76 Stat. 437) as amended (41 U.S.C. 4708) authorizes the use of predetermined rates 
in determining the “indirect costs” (indirect (F&A) costs) applicable under research agreements with 
educational institutions. The stated objectives of the law are to simplify the administration of cost-type 
research and development contracts (including grants) with educational institutions, to facilitate the 
preparation of their budgets, and to permit more expeditious closeout of such contracts when the work is 
completed. In view of the potential advantages offered by this procedure, negotiation of predetermined 
rates for indirect (F&A) costs for a period of two to four years should be the norm in those situations 
where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties 
involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect (F&A) costs during the ensuing 
accounting periods. 

5. Negotiated Fixed Rates and Carry-Forward Provisions 
When a fixed rate is negotiated in advance for a fiscal year (or other time period), the over- or under-
recovery for that year may be included as an adjustment to the indirect (F&A) cost for the next rate 
negotiation. When the rate is negotiated before the carry-forward adjustment is determined, the carry-
forward amount may be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation. When such adjustments are to 
be made, each fixed rate negotiated in advance for a given period will be computed by applying the 
expected indirect (F&A) costs allocable to Federal awards for the forecast period plus or minus the carry-
forward adjustment (over- or under-recovery) from the prior period, to the forecast distribution base. 
Unrecovered amounts under lump-sum agreements or cost-sharing provisions of prior years must not be 
carried forward for consideration in the new rate negotiation. There must, however, be an advance 
understanding in each case between the institution and the cognizant agency for indirect costs as to 
whether these differences will be considered in the rate negotiation rather than making the determination 
after the differences are known. Further, institutions electing to use this carry-forward provision may not 
subsequently change without prior approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. In the event that 
an institution returns to a post-determined rate, any over- or under-recovery during the period in which 
negotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions were followed will be included in the subsequent post-
determined rates. Where multiple rates are used, the same procedure will be applicable for determining 
each rate. 

6. Provisional and Final Rates for Indirect (F&A) Costs 
Where the cognizant agency for indirect costs determines that cost experience and other pertinent facts 
do not justify the use of predetermined rates, or a fixed rate with a carry-forward, or if the parties cannot 
agree on an equitable rate, a provisional rate must be established. To prevent substantial overpayment or 
underpayment, the provisional rate may be adjusted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs during the 
institution's fiscal year. Predetermined or fixed rates may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 1.a.(3) (enhanced display) page 174 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 7.a. 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

close of the institution's fiscal year. If a provisional rate is not replaced by a predetermined or fixed rate 
prior to the end of the institution's fiscal year, a final rate will be established and upward or downward 
adjustments will be made based on the actual allowable costs incurred for the period involved. 

7. Fixed Rates for the Life of the Sponsored Agreement 
a. 
Except as provided inparagraph (c)(1) of § 200.414, Federal agencies must use the negotiated rates 
in effect at the time of the initial award throughout the life of the Federal award. Award levels for 
Federal awards may not be adjusted in future years as a result of changes in negotiated rates. 
“Negotiated rates” per the rate agreement include final, fixed, and predetermined rates and exclude 
provisional rates. “Life” for the purpose of this subsection means each competitive segment of a 
project. A competitive segment is a period of years approved by the Federal awarding agency at the 
time of the Federal award. If negotiated rate agreements do not extend through the life of the Federal 
award at the time of the initial award, then the negotiated rate for the last year of the Federal award 
must be extended through the end of the life of the Federal award. 

b. 
Except as provided in§ 200.414, when an educational institution does not have a negotiated rate 
with the Federal Government at the time of an award (because the educational institution is a new 
recipient or the parties cannot reach agreement on a rate), the provisional rate used at the time of 
the award must be adjusted once a rate is negotiated and approved by the cognizant agency for 
indirect costs. 

8. Limitation on Reimbursement of Administrative Costs 
a. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, the administrative costs charged to Federal 
awards awarded or amended (including continuation and renewal awards) with effective dates 
beginning on or after the start of the institution's first fiscal year which begins on or after October 1, 
1991, must be limited to 26% of modified total direct costs (as defined in subsection 2) for the total 
of General Administration and General Expenses, Departmental Administration, Sponsored Projects 
Administration, and Student Administration and Services (including their allocable share of 
depreciation, interest costs, operation and maintenance expenses, and fringe benefits costs, as 
provided by Section B, and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the 
subcategories of facilities in Section B. 

b. 
Institutions should not change their accounting or cost allocation methods if the effect is to change 
the charging of a particular type of cost from F&A to direct, or to reclassify costs, or increase 
allocations from the administrative pools identified in paragraph B.1 of this Appendix to the other 
F&A cost pools or fringe benefits. Cognizant agencies for indirect cost are authorized to allow 
changes where an institution's charging practices are at variance with acceptable practices followed 
by a substantial majority of other institutions. 

9. Alternative Method for Administrative Costs 
a. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, an institution may elect to claim a fixed 
allowance for the “Administration” portion of indirect (F&A) costs. The allowance could be either 24% 
of modified total direct costs or a percentage equal to 95% of the most recently negotiated fixed or 
predetermined rate for the cost pools included under “Administration” as defined in Section B.1, 
whichever is less. Under this alternative, no cost proposal need be prepared for the “Administration”

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 9.b. 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

portion of the indirect (F&A) cost rate nor is further identification or documentation of these costs 
required (see subsection c). Where a negotiated indirect (F&A) cost agreement includes this 
alternative, an institution must make no further charges for the expenditure categories described in 
Section B.5, Section B.6, Section B.7, and Section B.9. 

b. 
c. 
In negotiations of rates for subsequent periods, an institution that has elected the option of 
subsection a may continue to exercise it at the same rate without further identification or 
documentation of costs. 

If an institution elects to accept a threshold rate as defined in subsection a of this section, it is not 
required to perform a detailed analysis of its administrative costs. However, in order to compute the 
facilities components of its indirect (F&A) cost rate, the institution must reconcile its indirect (F&A) 
cost proposal to its financial statements and make appropriate adjustments and reclassifications to 
identify the costs of each major function as defined in Section A.1, as well as to identify and allocate 
the facilities components. Administrative costs that are not identified as such by the institution's 
accounting system (such as those incurred in academic departments) will be classified as 
instructional costs for purposes of reconciling indirect (F&A) cost proposals to financial statements 
and allocating facilities costs. 

10. Individual Rate Components 
In order to provide mutually agreed-upon information for management purposes, each indirect (F&A) cost 
rate negotiation or determination must include development of a rate for each indirect (F&A) cost pool as 
well as the overall indirect (F&A) cost rate. 

11. Negotiation and Approval of Indirect (F&A) Rate 
a. 
Cognizant agency for indirect costs is defined in Subpart A. 

(1) Cost negotiation cognizance is assigned to the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) or the Department of Defense's Office of Naval Research (DOD), normally depending on 
which of the two agencies (HHS or DOD) provides more funds directly to the educational 
institution for the most recent three years. Information on funding must be derived from 
relevant data gathered by the National Science Foundation. In cases where neither HHS nor 
DOD provides Federal funding directly to an educational institution, the cognizant agency for 
indirect costs assignment must default to HHS. Notwithstanding the method for cognizance 
determination described in this section, other arrangements for cognizance of a particular 
educational institution may also be based in part on the types of research performed at the 
educational institution and must be decided based on mutual agreement between HHS and 
DOD. Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a subrecipient, see § 200.332. 
(2) After cognizance is established, it must continue for a five-year period. 
b. 
c. 
Acceptance of rates. See§ 200.414. 

Correcting deficiencies. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate changes needed to 
correct systems deficiencies relating to accountability for Federal awards. Cognizant agencies for 
indirect costs must address the concerns of other affected agencies, as appropriate, and must 
negotiate special rates for Federal agencies that are required to limit recovery of indirect costs by 
statute.

d. 
e. 
f. 
Resolving questioned costs. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must conduct any necessary 
negotiations with an educational institution regarding amounts questioned by audit that are due the 
Federal Government related to costs covered by a negotiated agreement. 
Reimbursement. Reimbursement to cognizant agencies for indirect costs for work performed under 
this Part may be made by reimbursement billing under the Economy Act,31 U.S.C. 1535. 
Procedure for establishing facilities and administrative rates must be established by one of the 
following methods: 
(1) Formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect costs is responsible for negotiating and 
approving rates for an educational institution on behalf of all Federal agencies. Federal 
awarding agencies that do not have cognizance for indirect costs must notify the cognizant 
agency for indirect costs of specific concerns (i.e., a need to establish special cost rates) which 
could affect the negotiation process. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must address the 
concerns of all interested agencies, as appropriate. A pre-negotiation conference may be 
scheduled among all interested agencies, if necessary. The cognizant agency for indirect costs 
must then arrange a negotiation conference with the educational institution. 
(2) Other than formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect costs and educational 
institution may reach an agreement on rates without a formal negotiation conference; for 
example, through correspondence or use of the simplified method described in this section D 
of this Appendix. 
g. Formalizing determinations and agreements. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must formalize 
all determinations or agreements reached with an educational institution and provide copies to other 
agencies having an interest. Determinations should include a description of any adjustments, the 
actual amount, both dollar and percentage adjusted, and the reason for making adjustments. 
h. Disputes and disagreements. Where the cognizant agency for indirect costs is unable to reach 
agreement with an educational institution with regard to rates or audit resolution, the appeal system 
of the cognizant agency for indirect costs must be followed for resolution of the disagreement. 

12. Standard Format for Submission 
For facilities and administrative (indirect (F&A)) rate proposals, educational institutions must use the 
standard format, shown in section E of this appendix, to submit their indirect (F&A) rate proposal to the 
cognizant agency for indirect costs. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may, on an institution-byinstitution 
basis, grant exceptions from all or portions of Part II of the standard format requirement. This 
requirement does not apply to educational institutions that use the simplified method for calculating 
indirect (F&A) rates, as described in Section D of this Appendix. 

As provided in section C.10 of this appendix, each F&A cost rate negotiation or determination must 
include development of a rate for each F&A cost pool as well as the overall F&A rate.

a. 
Where the total direct cost of work covered by this Part at an institution does not exceed $10 million 
in a fiscal year, the simplified procedure described in subsections 2 or 3 may be used in determining 
allowable indirect (F&A) costs. Under this simplified procedure, the institution's most recent annual 
financial report and immediately available supporting information must be utilized as a basis for 
determining the indirect (F&A) cost rate applicable to all Federal awards. The institution may use 
either the salaries and wages (see subsection 2) or modified total direct costs (see subsection 3) as 
the distribution basis. 
b. The simplified procedure should not be used where it produces results which appear inequitable to 
the Federal Government or the institution. In any such case, indirect (F&A) costs should be 
determined through use of the regular procedure. 

2. Simplified Procedure—Salaries and Wages Base 
a. Establish the total amount of salaries and wages paid to all employees of the institution. 
b. Establish an indirect (F&A) cost pool consisting of the expenditures (exclusive of capital items and 
other costs specifically identified as unallowable) which customarily are classified under the 
following titles or their equivalents: 
(1) General administration and general expenses (exclusive of costs of student administration and 
services, student activities, student aid, and scholarships). 
(2) Operation and maintenance of physical plant and depreciation (after appropriate adjustment for 
costs applicable to other institutional activities). 
(3) Library. 
(4) Department administration expenses, which will be computed as 20 percent of the salaries and 
expenses of deans and heads of departments. 
In those cases where expenditures classified under subsection (1) have previously been 
allocated to other institutional activities, they may be included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool. 
The total amount of salaries and wages included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool must be 
separately identified. 
c. Establish a salary and wage distribution base, determined by deducting from the total of salaries and 
wages as established in subsection a from the amount of salaries and wages included under 
subsection b. 
d. Establish the indirect (F&A) cost rate, determined by dividing the amount in the indirect (F&A) cost 
pool, subsection b, by the amount of the distribution base, subsection c. 
e. Apply the indirect (F&A) cost rate to direct salaries and wages for individual agreements to 
determine the amount of indirect (F&A) costs allocable to such agreements. 

3. Simplified Procedure—Modified Total Direct Cost Base 
a. Establish the total costs incurred by the institution for the base period. 
b. Establish an indirect (F&A) cost pool consisting of the expenditures (exclusive of capital items and 
other costs specifically identified as unallowable) which customarily are classified under the 
following titles or their equivalents:

(1) General administration and general expenses (exclusive of costs of student administration and 
services, student activities, student aid, and scholarships). 
(2) Operation and maintenance of physical plant and depreciation (after appropriate adjustment for 
costs applicable to other institutional activities). 
(3) Library. 
(4) Department administration expenses, which will be computed as 20 percent of the salaries and 
expenses of deans and heads of departments. In those cases where expenditures classified 
under subsection (1) have previously been allocated to other institutional activities, they may be 
included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool. The modified total direct costs amount included in the 
indirect (F&A) cost pool must be separately identified. 
c. Establish a modified total direct cost distribution base, as defined in Section C.2, The distribution 
basis, that consists of all institution's direct functions. 
d. Establish the indirect (F&A) cost rate, determined by dividing the amount in the indirect (F&A) cost 
pool, subsection b, by the amount of the distribution base, subsection c. 
e. Apply the indirect (F&A) cost rate to the modified total direct costs for individual agreements to 
determine the amount of indirect (F&A) costs allocable to such agreements. 
E. Documentation Requirements 
The standard format for documentation requirements for indirect (indirect (F&A)) rate proposals for claiming costs 
under the regular method is available on the OMB website. 

F. Certification 
1. Certification of Charges 
To assure that expenditures for Federal awards are proper and in accordance with the agreement 
documents and approved project budgets, the annual and/or final fiscal reports or vouchers requesting 
payment under the agreements will include a certification, signed by an authorized official of the 
university, which reads “By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the 
report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the 
purposes and intent set forth in the award documents. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative 
penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001 and 
Title 31, Sections 3729-3733 and 3801-3812)”. 

2. Certification of Indirect (F&A) Costs 
Policy.Cognizant agencies must not accept a proposed indirect cost rate unless such costs have 
been certified by the educational institution using the Certificate of indirect (F&A) Costs set forth in 
subsection F.2.c 
The certificate must be signed on behalf of the institution by the chief financial officer or an

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

An indirect (F&A) cost rate is not binding upon the Federal Government if the most recent required 
proposal from the institution has not been certified. Where it is necessary to establish indirect (F&A) 
cost rates, and the institution has not submitted a certified proposal for establishing such rates in 
accordance with the requirements of this section, the Federal Government must unilaterally 
establish such rates. Such rates may be based upon audited historical data or such other data that 
have been furnished to the cognizant agency for indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated 
that all unallowable costs have been excluded. When indirect (F&A) cost rates are unilaterally 
established by the Federal Government because of failure of the institution to submit a certified 
proposal for establishing such rates in accordance with this section, the rates established will be set 
at a level low enough to ensure that potentially unallowable costs will not be reimbursed. 

c. 
Certificate.The certificate required by this section must be in the following form: 

Certificate of Indirect (F&A) Costs 

This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief: 

(1) I have reviewed the indirect (F&A) cost proposal submitted herewith; 
(2) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect (F&A) costs 
rate for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of 
the Federal agreement(s) to which they apply and with the cost principles applicable to those 
agreements. 

(3) This proposal does not include any costs which are unallowable undersubpart E of this part 
such as (without limitation): Public relations costs, contributions and donations, entertainment 
costs, fines and penalties, lobbying costs, and defense of fraud proceedings; and 

(4) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal agreements on the basis of 
a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the agreements to which 
they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. 

I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.

Appendix IV to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate 
Determination for Nonprofit Organizations 

A. General 
1. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily 
identified with a particular final cost objective. Direct cost of minor amounts may be treated as 
indirect costs under the conditions described in§ 200.413(d). After direct costs have been 
determined and assigned directly to awards or other work as appropriate, indirect costs are those 
remaining to be allocated to benefitting cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated to a Federal 
award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has 
been assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost. 
2. “Major nonprofit organizations”are defined inparagraph (a) of § 200.414. See indirect cost rate 
reporting requirements in sections B.2.e and B.3.g of this Appendix. 
a. 
B. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates 
1. General 
If a nonprofit organization has only one major function, or where all its major functions benefit 
from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs and 
the computation of an indirect cost rate may be accomplished through simplified allocation 
procedures, as described in section B.2 of this Appendix. 
b. If an organization has several major functions which benefit from its indirect costs in varying 
degrees, allocation of indirect costs may require the accumulation of such costs into separate 
cost groupings which then are allocated individually to benefitting functions by means of a 
base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. The indirect costs allocated to each 
function are then distributed to individual Federal awards and other activities included in that 
function by means of an indirect cost rate(s). 
c. The determination of what constitutes an organization's major functions will depend on its 
purpose in being; the types of services it renders to the public, its clients, and its members; and 
the amount of effort it devotes to such activities as fundraising, public information and 
membership activities. 
d. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing indirect cost rates along with the 
conditions under which each method should be used are described in section B.2 through B.5 
of this Appendix. 
e. The base period for the allocation of indirect costs is the period in which such costs are 
incurred and accumulated for allocation to work performed in that period. The base period 
normally should coincide with the organization's fiscal year but, in any event, must be so 
selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of the costs.

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 2.c.(4) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

2. Simplified Allocation Method 
Where an organization's major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the 
same degree, the allocation of indirect costs may be accomplished by 
(i) separating the organization's total costs for the base period as either direct or indirect, and 
(ii) dividing the total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an equitable 
distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect cost rate which is used to 
distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The rate should be expressed as the 
percentage which the total amount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. 
This method should also be used where an organization has only one major function 
encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, and may be used where the 
level of Federal awards to an organization is relatively small. 
b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital expenditures and unallowable 
costs. However, unallowable costs which represent activities must be included in the direct 
costs under the conditions described in§ 200.413(e). 
c. The distribution base may be total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other 
distorting items, such as subawards for $50,000 or more), direct salaries and wages, or other 
base which results in an equitable distribution. The distribution base must exclude participant 
support costs as defined in§ 200.1. 
d. Except where a special rate(s) is required in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, the 
indirect cost rate developed under the above principles is applicable to all Federal awards of the 
organization. If a special rate(s) is required, appropriate modifications must be made in order to 
develop the special rate(s). 
e. For an organization that receives more than $10 million in direct Federal funding in a fiscal year, 
a breakout of the indirect cost component into two broad categories, Facilities and 
Administration as defined inparagraph (a) of § 200.414, is required. The rate in each case must 
be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect cost category (i.e., 
Facilities or Administration) is of the distribution base identified with that category. 

a. 
3. Multiple Allocation Base Method 
a. General. Where an organization's indirect costs benefit its major functions in varying degrees, 
indirect costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings, as described in 
subparagraph b. Each grouping must then be allocated individually to benefitting functions by 
means of a base which best measures the relative benefits. The default allocation bases by 
cost pool are described in section B.3.c of this Appendix. 
b. Identification of indirect costs. Cost groupings must be established so as to permit the 
allocation of each grouping on the basis of benefits provided to the major functions. Each 
grouping must constitute a pool of expenses that are of like character in terms of functions 
they benefit and in terms of the allocation base which best measures the relative benefits 
provided to each function. The groupings are classified within the two broad categories: 
“Facilities” and “Administration,” as described in section A.3 of this Appendix. The indirect cost 
pools are defined as follows:

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 2.c.(4) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) Depreciation. The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs of the 
organization's buildings, capital improvements to land and buildings, and equipment which 
are computed in accordance with§ 200.436. 

(2) Interest. Interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital 
improvements are computed in accordance with§ 200.449. 

(3) Operation and maintenance expenses. The expenses under this heading are those that 
have been incurred for the administration, operation, maintenance, preservation, and 
protection of the organization's physical plant. They include expenses normally incurred 
for such items as: janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations 
of buildings, furniture and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance and operation of 
buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness; 
environmental safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and other insurance 
relating to property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management; and 
central receiving. The operation and maintenance expenses category must also include its 
allocable share of fringe benefit costs, depreciation, and interest costs. 

(4) General administration and general expenses. The expenses under this heading are those 
c. 
that have been incurred for the overall general executive and administrative offices of the 
organization and other expenses of a general nature which do not relate solely to any 
major function of the organization. This category must also include its allocable share of 
fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance expense, depreciation, and interest costs. 
Examples of this category include central offices, such as the director's office, the office of 
finance, business services, budget and planning, personnel, safety and risk management, 
general counsel, management information systems, and library costs. 

In developing this cost pool, special care should be exercised to ensure that costs 
incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently as either 
direct or indirect costs. For example, salaries of technical staff, project supplies, project 
publication, telephone toll charges, computer costs, travel costs, and specialized services 
costs must be treated as direct costs wherever identifiable to a particular program. The 
salaries and wages of administrative and pooled clerical staff should normally be treated 
as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate as described in§ 

200.413. Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs, periodicals and 
memberships should normally be treated as indirect costs. 
Allocation bases. Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the base to be used 
in allocating the expenses in each grouping to benefitting functions. The essential 
consideration in selecting a method or a base is that it is the one best suited for assigning the 
pool of costs to cost objectives in accordance with benefits derived; a traceable cause and 
effect relationship; or logic and reason, where neither the cause nor the effect of the 
relationship is determinable. When an allocation can be made by assignment of a cost 
grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must be made in that manner. When 
the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature, the allocation must be made 
through the use of a selected base which produces results that are equitable to both the 
Federal Government and the organization. The distribution must be made in accordance with 
the bases described herein unless it can be demonstrated that the use of a different base 
would result in a more equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more readily available base

would not increase the costs charged to Federal awards. The results of special cost studies 
(such as an engineering utility study) must not be used to determine and allocate the indirect 
costs to Federal awards. 

(1) Depreciation. Depreciation expenses must be allocated in the following manner: 
(a) Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a single function, and on 
capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be assigned to 
that function. 

(b) Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and on capital 
improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be allocated to the 
individual functions performed in each building on the basis of usable square feet of 
space, excluding common areas, such as hallways, stairwells, and restrooms. 

(c) Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment related space (e.g., 
individual rooms, and laboratories) used jointly by more than one function (as 
determined by the users of the space) must be treated as follows. The cost of each 
jointly used unit of space must be allocated to the benefitting functions on the basis 
of: 

(i) the employees and other users on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis or salaries 
and wages of those individual functions benefitting from the use of that space; 
or 

(ii) organization-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages applicable to the 
benefitting functions of the organization. 

(d) Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as paved parking areas, 
fences, sidewalks, and the like, not included in the cost of buildings, must be 
allocated to user categories on a FTE basis and distributed to major functions in 
proportion to the salaries and wages of all employees applicable to the functions. 

(2) Interest. Interest costs must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation on the 
buildings, equipment and capital equipment to which the interest relates. 

(3) Operation and maintenance expenses. Operation and maintenance expenses must be 
allocated in the same manner as the depreciation. 

(4) General administration and general expenses. General administration and general 
expenses must be allocated to benefitting functions based on modified total costs (MTC). 
The MTC is the modified total direct costs (MTDC), as described in§ 200.1, plus the 
allocated indirect cost proportion. The expenses included in this category could be 
grouped first according to major functions of the organization to which they render 
services or provide benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group must then be 
allocated to benefitting functions based on MTC. 

Order of distribution. 

d. 
(1) Indirect cost categories consisting of depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, 
and general administration and general expenses must be allocated in that order to the 
remaining indirect cost categories as well as to the major functions of the organization.

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 2.c.(4) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

Other cost categories should be allocated in the order determined to be most appropriate 
by the organization. This order of allocation does not apply if cross allocation of costs is 
made as provided in section B.3.d.2 of this Appendix. 

(2) Normally, an indirect cost category will be considered closed once it has been allocated to 
other cost objectives, and costs must not be subsequently allocated to it. However, a 
cross allocation of costs between two or more indirect costs categories could be used if 
such allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If a cross allocation is 
used, an appropriate modification to the composition of the indirect cost categories is 
required. 
e. 
Application of indirect cost rate or rates. Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required 

in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, the separate groupings of indirect costs 

allocated to each major function must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that 

function. The costs in the common pool must then be distributed to individual Federal awards 

included in that function by use of a single indirect cost rate. 

f. 
g. 
Distribution basis. Indirect costs must be distributed to applicable Federal awards and other 

benefitting activities within each major function on the basis of MTDC (see definition in§ 

200.1). 

Individual Rate Components. An indirect cost rate must be determined for each separate 

indirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case must be stated as the percentage which the 

amount of the particular indirect cost pool is of the distribution base identified with that pool. 

Each indirect cost rate negotiation or determination agreement must include development of 

the rate for each indirect cost pool as well as the overall indirect cost rate. The indirect cost 

pools must be classified within two broad categories: “Facilities” and “Administration,” as 

described in§ 200.414(a). 

4. Direct Allocation Method 
a. 
Some nonprofit organizations treat all costs as direct costs except general administration and 

general expenses. These organizations generally separate their costs into three basic 

categories: 

(i) General administration and general expenses, 
(ii) fundraising, and 
(iii) other direct functions (including projects performed under Federal awards). Joint costs, 
such as depreciation, rental costs, operation and maintenance of facilities, telephone 
expenses, information technology, and the like are prorated individually as direct costs to 
each category and to each Federal award or other activity using a base most appropriate 
to the particular cost being prorated. 
b. 
This method is acceptable, provided each joint cost is prorated using a base which accurately 

measures the benefits provided to each Federal award or other activity. The bases must be 

established in accordance with reasonable criteria and be supported by current data. This 

method is compatible with the Standards of Accounting and Financial Reporting for Voluntary 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 2.c.(4) (enhanced display) page 185 of 208

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

Health and Welfare Organizations issued jointly by the National Health Council, Inc., the 
National Assembly of Voluntary Health and Social Welfare Organizations, and the United Way of 
America. 

c. 
Under this method, indirect costs consist exclusively of general administration and general 
expenses. In all other respects, the organization's indirect cost rates must be computed in the 
same manner as that described in section B.2 of this Appendix. 

5. Special Indirect Cost Rates 
In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities of an organization or for each major 
function of the organization may not be appropriate, since it would not take into account those 
different factors which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to a particular segment 
of work. For this purpose, a particular segment of work may be that performed under a single 
Federal award or it may consist of work under a group of Federal awards performed in a common 
environment. These factors may include the physical location of the work, the level of administrative 
support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the scientific disciplines or 
technical skills involved, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. When a 
particular segment of work is performed in an environment which appears to generate a significantly 
different level of indirect costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect cost pool 
applicable to such work. The separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of 
the regular allocation process, and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be 
used, provided it is determined that (i) the rate differs significantly from that which would have been 
obtained under sections B.2, B.3, and B.4 of this Appendix, and (ii) the volume of work to which the 
rate would apply is material. 

C. Negotiation and Approval of Indirect Cost Rates 
1.Definitions 
As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings set forth in this section: 

a. 
b. 
c. 
Cognizant agency for indirect costsmeans the Federal agency responsible for negotiating and 

approving indirect cost rates for a nonprofit organization on behalf of all Federal agencies. 

Predetermined ratemeans an indirect cost rate, applicable to a specified current or future 
period, usually the organization's fiscal year. The rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be 
incurred during the period. A predetermined rate is not subject to adjustment. 

Fixed ratemeans an indirect cost rate which has the same characteristics as a predetermined 
rate, except that the difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period 
covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a 
subsequent period. 

d. 
Final ratemeans an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified past period which is based on 

the actual costs of the period. A final rate is not subject to adjustment. 

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 2.c.(4) (enhanced display) page 186 of 208 


Provisional rate or billing ratemeans a temporary indirect cost rate applicable to a specified 
period which is used for funding, interim reimbursement, and reporting indirect costs on 
Federal awards pending the establishment of a final rate for the period. 
Indirect cost proposalmeans the documentation prepared by an organization to substantiate its 
claim for the reimbursement of indirect costs. This proposal provides the basis for the review 
and negotiation leading to the establishment of an organization's indirect cost rate. 
Cost objectivemeans a function, organizational subdivision, contract, Federal award, or other 
work unit for which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and 
measure the cost of processes, projects, jobs and capitalized projects.

f. 
g. 
2. Negotiation and Approval of Rates 
a. Unless different arrangements are agreed to by the Federal agencies concerned, the Federal 
agency with the largest dollar value of Federal awards directly funded to an organization will be 
designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs for the negotiation and approval of the 
indirect cost rates and, where necessary, other rates such as fringe benefit and computer 
charge-out rates. Once an agency is assigned cognizance for a particular nonprofit 
organization, the assignment will not be changed unless there is a shift in the dollar volume of 
the Federal awards directly funded to the organization for at least three years. All concerned 
Federal agencies must be given the opportunity to participate in the negotiation process but, 
after a rate has been agreed upon, it will be accepted by all Federal agencies. When a Federal 
agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards 
necessitate special indirect cost rates in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, it will, 
prior to the time the rates are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs. (See 
also§ 200.414.) If the nonprofit does not receive any funding from any Federal agency, the 
pass-through entity is responsible for the negotiation of the indirect cost rates in accordance 
with§ 200.332(a)(4). 
b. Except as otherwise provided in§ 200.414(f), a nonprofit organization which has not previously 
established an indirect cost rate with a Federal agency must submit its initial indirect cost 
proposal immediately after the organization is advised that a Federal award will be made and, 
in no event, later than three months after the effective date of the Federal award. 
c. Unless approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs in accordance with§ 200.414(g), 
organizations that have previously established indirect cost rates must submit a new indirect 
cost proposal to the cognizant agency for indirect costs within six months after the close of 
each fiscal year. 
d. A predetermined rate may be negotiated for use on Federal awards where there is reasonable 
assurance, based on past experience and reliable projection of the organization's costs, that the 
rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on the organization's actual costs. 
e. Fixed rates may be negotiated where predetermined rates are not considered appropriate. A 
fixed rate, however, must not be negotiated if 
(i) all or a substantial portion of the organization's Federal awards are expected to expire 
before the carry-forward adjustment can be made;

2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 2.c.(4) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(ii) the mix of Federal and non-Federal work at the organization is too erratic to permit an 
equitable carry-forward adjustment; or 

(iii) the organization's operations fluctuate significantly from year to year. 
f. 
Provisional and final rates must be negotiated where neither predetermined nor fixed rates are 

appropriate. Predetermined or fixed rates may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the 
close of the organization's fiscal year. If that event does not occur, a final rate will be 
established and upward or downward adjustments will be made based on the actual allowable 
costs incurred for the period involved. 

g. 
h. 
i. 
The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the 

cognizant agency for indirect costs and the nonprofit organization. The cognizant agency for 
indirect costs must make available copies of the agreement to all concerned Federal agencies. 

If a dispute arises in a negotiation of an indirect cost rate between the cognizant agency for 

indirect costs and the nonprofit organization, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with 
the appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. 

To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agencies in connection with 

the negotiation and approval process, OMB will lend assistance as required to resolve such 
problems in a timely manner. 

D. Certification of Indirect (F&A) Costs 
(1) Required Certification. No proposal to establish indirect (F&A) cost rates must be acceptable unless 
such costs have been certified by the nonprofit organization using the Certificate of Indirect (F&A) 
Costs set forth in section j. of this appendix. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the 
organization by an individual at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer for the 
organization. 

(2) Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a certification in the following form: 
Certificate of Indirect (F&A) Costs 

This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief: 

(1) I have reviewed the indirect (F&A) cost proposal submitted herewith; 
(2) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect (F&A) costs rate 
for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal 
awards to which they apply and withsubpart E of this part. 

(3) This proposal does not include any costs which are unallowable undersubpart E of this partsuch as 
(without limitation): Public relations costs, contributions and donations, entertainment costs, fines 
and penalties, lobbying costs, and defense of fraud proceedings; and 

(4) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a 
beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to which 
they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements.

Appendix V to Part 200—State/Local Governmentwide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans 

A. General 
1. 
Most governmental units provide certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, 

purchasing, accounting, etc., to operating agencies on a centralized basis. Since federally-supported 

awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process whereby 

these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable 

and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan provides that process. All costs and 

other data used to distribute the costs included in the plan should be supported by formal 

accounting and other records that will support the propriety of the costs assigned to Federal awards. 

2. 
Guidelines and illustrations of central service cost allocation plans are provided in a brochure 

published by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled “A Guide for State, Local and 

Indian Tribal Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and 

Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government.”A copy of this brochure may be 
obtained from the HHS Cost Allocation Services or at their website. 

B.Definitions 
1. 
2. 
Agency or operating agencymeans an organizational unit or sub-division within a governmental unit 

that is responsible for the performance or administration of Federal awards or activities of the 

governmental unit. 

Allocated central servicesmeans central services that benefit operating agencies but are not billed to 

the agencies on a fee-for-service or similar basis. These costs are allocated to benefitted agencies 

on some reasonable basis. Examples of such services might include general accounting, personnel 

administration, purchasing, etc. 

3. 
4. 
Billed central servicesmeans central services that are billed to benefitted agencies or programs on 

an individual fee-for-service or similar basis. Typical examples of billed central services include 

computer services, transportation services, insurance, and fringe benefits. 

Cognizant agency for indirect costsis defined in§ 200.1. The determination of cognizant agency for 
indirect costs for states and local governments is described in section F.1.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

5. 
Major local governmentmeans local government that receives more than $100 million in direct 
Federal awards subject to this Part. 

C. Scope of the Central Service Cost Allocation Plans 
The central service cost allocation plan will include all central service costs that will be claimed (either as 
a billed or an allocated cost) under Federal awards and will be documented as described in section E. 
omitted from the plan will not be reimbursed. 

D. Submission Requirements 
1. 
Each state will submit a plan to the Department of Health and Human Services for each year in which 
it claims central service costs under Federal awards. The plan should include 

(a) a projection of the next year's allocated central service cost (based either on actual costs for 
the most recently completed year or the budget projection for the coming year), and 
(b) a reconciliation of actual allocated central service costs to the estimated costs used for either 
the most recently completed year or the year immediately preceding the most recently 
completed year. 
2. 
3. 
Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency for indirect 

costs annually. 

All other local governments claiming central service costs must develop a plan in accordance with 
the requirements described in this Part and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation 
for audit. These local governments are not required to submit their plans for Federal approval unless 
they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Where a local 
government only receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for 
monitoring the subrecipient's plan. 

4. 
All central service cost allocation plans will be prepared and, when required, submitted within six 
months prior to the beginning of each of the governmental unit's fiscal years in which it proposes to 
claim central service costs. Extensions may be granted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on 
a case-by-case basis. 

E. Documentation Requirements for Submitted Plans 
The documentation requirements described in this section may be modified, expanded, or reduced by the 
cognizant agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis. For example, the requirements may be 
reduced for those central services which have little or no impact on Federal awards. Conversely, if a 
review of a plan indicates that certain additional information is needed, and will likely be needed in future 
years, it may be routinely requested in future plan submissions. Items marked with an asterisk (*) should 
be submitted only once; subsequent plans should merely indicate any changes since the last plan.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

All proposed plans must be accompanied by the following: an organization chart sufficiently detailed 
to show operations including the central service activities of the state/local government whether or 
not they are shown as benefitting from central service functions; a copy of the Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report (or a copy of the Executive Budget if budgeted costs are being proposed) to 
support the allowable costs of each central service activity included in the plan; and, a certification 
(see subsection 4.) that the plan was prepared in accordance with this Part, contains only allowable 
costs, and was prepared in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among the various 
Federal awards and between Federal and non-Federal awards/activities. 

2. Allocated Central Services 
For each allocated central service*, the plan must also include the following: a brief description of 
the service, an identification of the unit rendering the service and the operating agencies receiving 
the service, the items of expense included in the cost of the service, the method used to distribute 
the cost of the service to benefitted agencies, and a summary schedule showing the allocation of 
each service to the specific benefitted agencies. If any self-insurance funds or fringe benefits costs 
are treated as allocated (rather than billed) central services, documentation discussed in 
subsections 3.b. and c. must also be included. 

3. Billed Services 
a. General.The information described in this section must be provided for all billed central 
services, including internal service funds, self-insurance funds, and fringe benefit funds. 
b. Internal service funds. 
(1) For each internal service fund or similar activity with an operating budget of $5 million or 
more, the plan must include: A brief description of each service; a balance sheet for each 
fund based on individual accounts contained in the governmental unit's accounting 
system; a revenue/expenses statement, with revenues broken out by source,e.g.,regular 
billings, interest earned, etc.; a listing of all non-operating transfers (as defined by GAAP) 
into and out of the fund; a description of the procedures (methodology) used to charge the 
costs of each service to users, including how billing rates are determined; a schedule of 
current rates; and, a schedule comparing total revenues (including imputed revenues) 
generated by the service to the allowable costs of the service, as determined under this 
part, with an explanation of how variances will be handled. 

(2) Revenues must consist of all revenues generated by the service, including unbilled and 
uncollected revenues. If some users were not billed for the services (or were not billed at 
the full rate for that class of users), a schedule showing the full imputed revenues 
associated with these users must be provided. Expenses must be broken out by object 
cost categories (e.g., salaries, supplies, etc.). 

c. 
Self-insurance funds.For each self-insurance fund, the plan must include: the fund balance 

sheet; a statement of revenue and expenses including a summary of billings and claims paid by 
agency; a listing of all non-operating transfers into and out of the fund; the type(s) of risk(s) 
covered by the fund (e.g., automobile liability, workers' compensation, etc.); an explanation of 
how the level of fund contributions are determined, including a copy of the current actuarial

report (with the actuarial assumptions used) if the contributions are determined on an actuarial 
basis; and, a description of the procedures used to charge or allocate fund contributions to 
benefitted activities. Reserve levels in excess of claims 

(1) submitted and adjudicated but not paid, 
(2) submitted but not adjudicated, and 
(3) incurred but not submitted must be identified and explained. 
d. 
Fringe benefits.For fringe benefit costs, the plan must include: a listing of fringe benefits 
provided to covered employees, and the overall annual cost of each type of benefit; current 
fringe benefit policies; and procedures used to charge or allocate the costs of the benefits to 
benefitted activities. In addition, for pension and post-retirement health insurance plans, the 
following information must be provided: the governmental unit's funding policies, e.g., 
legislative bills, trust agreements, or state-mandated contribution rules, if different from 
actuarially determined rates; the pension plan's costs accrued for the year; the amount funded, 
and date(s) of funding; a copy of the current actuarial report (including the actuarial 
assumptions); the plan trustee's report; and, a schedule from the activity showing the value of 
the interest cost associated with late funding. 

4. Required Certification 
Each central service cost allocation plan will be accompanied by a certification in the following form: 

CERTIFICATE OF COST ALLOCATION PLAN 

This is to certify that I have reviewed the cost allocation plan submitted herewith and to the best of 
my knowledge and belief: 

(1) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish cost allocations or billings for 
[identify period covered by plan] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of this Part 
and the Federal award(s) to which they apply. Unallowable costs have been adjusted for in 
allocating costs as indicated in the cost allocation plan. 
(2) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a 
beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to 
which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. Further, the same costs 
that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as direct costs. Similar types of 
costs have been accounted for consistently.

F. Negotiation and Approval of Central Service Plans 
1. Federal Cognizant Agency for Indirect Costs Assignments for Cost Negotiation 
In general, unless different arrangements are agreed to by the concerned Federal agencies, for 
central service cost allocation plans, the cognizant agency responsible for review and approval is the 
Federal agency with the largest dollar value of total Federal awards with a governmental unit. For 
indirect cost rates and departmental indirect cost allocation plans, the cognizant agency is the 
Federal agency with the largest dollar value of direct Federal awards with a governmental unit or 
component, as appropriate. Once designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the Federal 
agency must remain so for a period of five years. In addition, the following Federal agencies 
continue to be responsible for the indicated governmental entities: 

Department of Health and Human Services —Public assistance and state-wide cost allocation plans 
for all states (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), state and local hospitals, 
libraries and health districts. 

Department of the Interior —Indian tribal governments, territorial governments, and state and local 
park and recreational districts. 
Department of Labor —State and local labor departments. 
Department of Education —School districts and state and local education agencies. 
Department of Agriculture —State and local agriculture departments. 
Department of Transportation —State and local airport and port authorities and transit districts. 
Department of Commerce —State and local economic development districts. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development —State and local housing and development districts. 
Environmental Protection Agency —State and local water and sewer districts. 
2. Review 
All proposed central service cost allocation plans that are required to be submitted will be reviewed, 
negotiated, and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a timely basis. The cognizant 
agency for indirect costs will review the proposal within six months of receipt of the proposal and 
either negotiate/approve the proposal or advise the governmental unit of the additional 
documentation needed to support/evaluate the proposed plan or the changes required to make the 
proposal acceptable. Once an agreement with the governmental unit has been reached, the 
agreement will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies, unless prohibited or limited by statute. 
Where a Federal awarding agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its 
Federal awards necessitate special consideration, the funding agency will, prior to the time the plans 
are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... Protection Agency” 

3. Agreement 
The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant 
agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if 
the agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute or the information upon which the plan was 
negotiated is later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate. The results of the negotiation 
must be made available to all Federal agencies for their use. 

4.Adjustments 
Negotiated cost allocation plans based on a proposal later found to have included costs that: (a) are 
unallowable (i) as specified by law or regulation, (ii) as identified in subpart F, General Provisions for 
selected Items of Cost of this Part, or (iii) by the terms and conditions of Federal awards, or (b) are 
unallowable because they are clearly not allocable to Federal awards, must be adjusted, or a refund 
must be made at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, including earned or imputed 
interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with 
applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations. Adjustments or cash refunds 
may include, at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, earned or imputed interest from 
the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with 
applicable cognizant agency claims collection regulations. These adjustments or refunds are 
designed to correct the plans and do not constitute a reopening of the negotiation. 

G. Other Policies 
1. Billed Central Service Activities 
Each billed central service activity must separately account for all revenues (including imputed 
revenues) generated by the service, expenses incurred to furnish the service, and profit/loss. 

2. Working Capital Reserves 
Internal service funds are dependent upon a reasonable level of working capital reserve to operate 
from one billing cycle to the next. Charges by an internal service activity to provide for the 
establishment and maintenance of a reasonable level of working capital reserve, in addition to the 
full recovery of costs, are allowable. A working capital reserve as part of retained earnings of up to 
60 calendar days cash expenses for normal operating purposes is considered reasonable. A working 
capital reserve exceeding 60 calendar days may be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect 
costs in exceptional cases. 

3. Carry-Forward Adjustments of Allocated Central Service Costs 
Allocated central service costs are usually negotiated and approved for a future fiscal year on a 
“fixed with carry-forward” basis. Under this procedure, the fixed amounts for the future year covered 
by agreement are not subject to adjustment for that year. However, when the actual costs of the year 
involved become known, the differences between the fixed amounts previously approved and the 

2 CFR Appendix-V-to-Part-200 F.1. “Environmental Protection Agency” (enhanced display) page 194 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 2 CFR Appendix-V-to-Part-200 F.1. “Environmental 
Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... Protection Agency” 

actual costs will be carried forward and used as an adjustment to the fixed amounts established for 
a later year. This “carry-forward” procedure applies to all central services whose costs were fixed in 
the approved plan. However, a carry-forward adjustment is not permitted, for a central service 
activity that was not included in the approved plan, or for unallowable costs that must be reimbursed 
immediately. 

4. Adjustments of Billed Central Services 
Billing rates used to charge Federal awards must be based on the estimated costs of providing the 
services, including an estimate of the allocable central service costs. A comparison of the revenue 
generated by each billed service (including total revenues whether or not billed or collected) to the 
actual allowable costs of the service will be made at least annually, and an adjustment will be made 
for the difference between the revenue and the allowable costs. These adjustments will be made 
through one of the following adjustment methods: (a) a cash refund including earned or imputed 
interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with 
applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations to the Federal Government for the 
Federal share of the adjustment, (b) credits to the amounts charged to the individual programs, (c) 
adjustments to future billing rates, or (d) adjustments to allocated central service costs. 
Adjustments to allocated central services will not be permitted where the total amount of the 
adjustment for a particular service (Federal share and non-Federal) share exceeds $500,000. 
Adjustment methods may include, at the option of the cognizant agency, earned or imputed interest 
from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance 
with applicable cognizant agency claims collection regulations. 

5. Records Retention 
All central service cost allocation plans and related documentation used as a basis for claiming 
costs under Federal awards must be retained for audit in accordance with the records retention 
requirements contained insubpart D of this part. 

6. Appeals 
If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and 
the governmental unit, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures of 
the cognizant agency for indirect costs. 

7.OMB Assistance 
To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agencies or governmental units in connection with 
the negotiation and approval process, OMB will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely 
manner.

Appendix VI to Part 200—Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans 

A. General 
Federally-financed programs administered by state public assistance agencies are funded predominately 
by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In support of its stewardship requirements, HHS 
has published requirements for the development, documentation, submission, negotiation, and approval 
of public assistance cost allocation plans in Subpart E of45 CFR Part 95. All administrative costs (direct 
and indirect) are normally charged to Federal awards by implementing the public assistance cost 
allocation plan. This Appendix extends these requirements to all Federal awarding agencies whose 
programs are administered by a state public assistance agency. Major federally-financed programs 
typically administered by state public assistance agencies include: Temporary Aid to Needy Families 
(TANF), Medicaid, Food Stamps, Child Support Enforcement, Adoption Assistance and Foster Care, and 
Social Services Block Grant. 

B.Definitions 
1. 
State public assistance agencymeans a state agency administering or supervising the administration 

of one or more public assistance programs operated by the state as identified in Subpart E of45 CFR 
Part 95. For the purpose of this Appendix, these programs include all programs administered by the 
state public assistance agency. 

2. 
State public assistance agency costsmeans all costs incurred by, or allocable to, the state public 

assistance agency, except expenditures for financial assistance, medical contractor payments, food 

stamps, and payments for services and goods provided directly to program recipients. 

C. Policy 
State public assistance agencies will develop, document and implement, and the Federal Government will 
review, negotiate, and approve, public assistance cost allocation plans in accordance with Subpart E of45 
CFR Part 95. The plan will include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency. Where 
a letter of approval or disapproval is transmitted to a state public assistance agency in accordance with 
Subpart E, the letter will apply to all Federal agencies and programs. The remaining sections of this 
Appendix (except for the requirement for certification) summarize the provisions of Subpart E of45 CFR 
Part 95. 

D. Submission, Documentation, and Approval of Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans 
1. 
2. 
State public assistance agencies are required to promptly submit amendments to the cost allocation 

plan to HHS for review and approval. 

Under the coordination process outlined in section E, affected Federal agencies will review all new 

plans and plan amendments and provide comments, as appropriate, to HHS. The effective date of 
the plan or plan amendment will be the first day of the calendar quarter following the event that 
required the amendment, unless another date is specifically approved by HHS. HHS, as the 
cognizant agency for indirect costs acting on behalf of all affected Federal agencies, will, as 
necessary, conduct negotiations with the state public assistance agency and will inform the state 
agency of the action taken on the plan or plan amendment.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

E. Review of Implementation of Approved Plans 
1. 
Since public assistance cost allocation plans are of a narrative nature, the review during the plan 
approval process consists of evaluating the appropriateness of the proposed groupings of costs 
(cost centers) and the related allocation bases. As such, the Federal Government needs some 
assurance that the cost allocation plan has been implemented as approved. This is accomplished by 
reviews by the Federal awarding agencies, single audits, or audits conducted by the cognizant 
agency for indirect costs. 

2. 
3. 
Where inappropriate charges affecting more than one Federal awarding agency are identified, the 
cognizant HHS cost negotiation office will be advised and will take the lead in resolving the issue(s) 
as provided for in Subpart E of45 CFR Part 95. 

If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan or from a disallowance involving two or more Federal 
awarding agencies, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures set out 
in45 CFR Part 16. Disputes involving only one Federal awarding agency will be resolved in 
accordance with the Federal awarding agency's appeal process. 

4. 
To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal awarding agencies or governmental 
units in connection with the negotiation and approval process, the Office of Management and Budget 
will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely manner. 

F.Unallowable Costs 
Claims developed under approved cost allocation plans will be based on allowable costs as identified in this Part. 
Where unallowable costs have been claimed and reimbursed, they will be refunded to the program that reimbursed 
the unallowable cost using one of the following methods: (a) a cash refund, (b) offset to a subsequent claim, or (c) 
credits to the amounts charged to individual Federal awards. Cash refunds, offsets, and credits may include at the 
option of the cognizant agency for indirect cost, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and 
delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency for indirect cost 
claims collection regulations.

Proposals 

Link to an amendment published at89 FR 30207, Apr. 22, 2024. 

A. General 
1. 
Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint purposes. These costs benefit 
more than one cost objective and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective 
without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. After direct costs have been determined and 
assigned directly to Federal awards and other activities as appropriate, indirect costs are those 
remaining to be allocated to benefitted cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated to a Federal 
award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has 
been assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost.

2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR Appendix-VII-to-Part-200 A.2. 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

Indirect costs include 

(a) the indirect costs originating in each department or agency of the governmental unit carrying 
out Federal awards and 
(b) the costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost 
allocation plan (as described in Appendix V to this part) and not otherwise treated as direct 
costs. 
3. 
Indirect costs are normally charged to Federal awards by the use of an indirect cost rate. A separate 

indirect cost rate(s) is usually necessary for each department or agency of the governmental unit 

claiming indirect costs under Federal awards. Guidelines and illustrations of indirect cost proposals 

are provided in a brochure published by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled “A 

Guide for States and Local Government Agencies: Cost Principles and Procedures for Establishing Cost 

Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Grants and Contracts with the Federal Government.”A copy 

of this brochure may be obtained from HHS Cost Allocation Services or at their website. 

4. 
Because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices of governmental units, the types of 

costs which may be classified as indirect costs cannot be specified in all situations. However, typical 

examples of indirect costs may include certain state/local-wide central service costs, general 

administration of the non-Federal entity accounting and personnel services performed within the 

non-Federal entity, depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining 
facilities. 

5. 
This Appendix does not apply to state public assistance agencies. These agencies should refer 
instead to Appendix VI to this part. 

B.Definitions 
1. 
Basemeans the accumulated direct costs (normally either total direct salaries and wages or total 

direct costs exclusive of any extraordinary or distorting expenditures) used to distribute indirect 
costs to individual Federal awards. The direct cost base selected should result in each Federal 

award bearing a fair share of the indirect costs in reasonable relation to the benefits received from 
the costs. 

2. 
Base periodfor the allocation of indirect costs is the period in which such costs are incurred and 

accumulated for allocation to activities performed in that period. The base period normally should 

coincide with the governmental unit's fiscal year, but in any event, must be so selected as to avoid 

inequities in the allocation of costs. 

3. 
4. 
5. 
Cognizant agency for indirect costsmeans the Federal agency responsible for reviewing and 

approving the governmental unit's indirect cost rate(s) on the behalf of the Federal Government. The 

cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment is described in Appendix V, section F. 

Final ratemeans an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified past period which is based on the 
actual allowable costs of the period. A final audited rate is not subject to adjustment. 

Fixed ratemeans an indirect cost rate which has the same characteristics as a predetermined rate, 

except that the difference between the estimated costs and the actual, allowable costs of the period 

covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent 

period.

6. Indirect cost poolis the accumulated costs that jointly benefit two or more programs or other cost 
objectives. 
7. Indirect cost rateis a device for determining in a reasonable manner the proportion of indirect costs 
each program should bear. It is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the indirect costs to a direct 
cost base. 
8. Indirect cost rate proposalmeans the documentation prepared by a governmental unit or subdivision 
thereof to substantiate its request for the establishment of an indirect cost rate. 
9. Predetermined ratemeans an indirect cost rate, applicable to a specified current or future period, 
usually the governmental unit's fiscal year. This rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be 
incurred during the period. Except under very unusual circumstances, a predetermined rate is not 
subject to adjustment. (Because of legal constraints, predetermined rates are not permitted for 
Federal contracts; they may, however, be used for grants or cooperative agreements.) Predetermined 
rates may not be used by governmental units that have not submitted and negotiated the rate with 
the cognizant agency for indirect costs. In view of the potential advantages offered by this 
procedure, negotiation of predetermined rates for indirect costs for a period of two to four years 
should be the norm in those situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available 
are deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the 
probable level of indirect costs during the ensuing accounting periods. 
10. Provisional ratemeans a temporary indirect cost rate applicable to a specified period which is used 
for funding, interim reimbursement, and reporting indirect costs on Federal awards pending the 
establishment of a “final” rate for that period. 
C. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates 
1. General 
a. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has only one major function, or where all its 
major functions benefit from the indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the 
allocation of indirect costs and the computation of an indirect cost rate may be accomplished 
through simplified allocation procedures as described in subsection 2. 
b. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has several major functions which benefit 
from its indirect costs in varying degrees, the allocation of indirect costs may require the 
accumulation of such costs into separate cost groupings which then are allocated individually 
to benefitted functions by means of a base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. 
The indirect costs allocated to each function are then distributed to individual Federal awards 
and other activities included in that function by means of an indirect cost rate(s). 
c. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing indirect cost rates along with the 
conditions under which each method should be used are described in subsections 2, 3 and 4. 

2.Simplified Method 
a. 
Where a non-Federal entity's major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the 
same degree, the allocation of indirect costs may be accomplished by 

2 CFR Appendix-VII-to-Part-200 C.2.a. (enhanced display) page 199 of 208 


2 CFR Part 200 (up to date as of 1/08/2025) 

2 CFR Appendix-VII-to-Part-200 C.2.a.(1) 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

(1) classifying the non-Federal entity's total costs for the base period as either direct or 
indirect, and 
(2) dividing the total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an equitable 
distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect cost rate which is used to 
distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The rate should be expressed as the 
percentage which the total amount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. 
This method should also be used where a governmental unit's department or agency has 
only one major function encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, and 
may be used where the level of Federal awards to that department or agency is relatively 
small. 
b. 
c. 
Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital expenditures and unallowable 

costs. However, unallowable costs must be included in the direct costs if they represent 

activities to which indirect costs are properly allocable. 

The distribution base may be 

(1) total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items, such as pass-
through funds, subcontracts in excess of $50,000, and participant support costs), 
(2) direct salaries and wages, or 
(3) another base which results in an equitable distribution. 
3. Multiple Allocation Base Method 
a. 
Where a non-Federal entity's indirect costs benefit its major functions in varying degrees, such 

costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings. Each grouping must then be 

allocated individually to benefitted functions by means of a base which best measures the 
relative benefits. 

b. 
The cost groupings should be established so as to permit the allocation of each grouping on 

the basis of benefits provided to the major functions. Each grouping should constitute a pool of 

expenses that are of like character in terms of the functions they benefit and in terms of the 

allocation base which best measures the relative benefits provided to each function. The 

number of separate groupings should be held within practical limits, taking into consideration 

the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision needed. 

c. 
Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the base to be used in allocating the 

expenses in each grouping to benefitted functions. When an allocation can be made by 

assignment of a cost grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must be made 

in that manner. When the expenses in a grouping are more general in nature, the allocation 

should be made through the use of a selected base which produces results that are equitable 

to both the Federal Government and the governmental unit. In general, any cost element or 

related factor associated with the governmental unit's activities is potentially adaptable for use 

as an allocation base provided that: 

(1) it can readily be expressed in terms of dollars or other quantitative measures (total direct 
costs, direct salaries and wages, staff hours applied, square feet used, hours of usage, 
number of documents processed, population served, and the like), and 
(2) it is common to the benefitted functions during the base period.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

d. 
Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required in accordance with paragraph (C)(4) of 

this Appendix, the separate groupings of indirect costs allocated to each major function must 

be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The costs in the common pool 

must then be distributed to individual Federal awards included in that function by use of a 

single indirect cost rate. 

The distribution base used in computing the indirect cost rate for each function may be 

(1) total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items such as pass-
through funds, subawards in excess of $50,000, and participant support costs), 
(2) direct salaries and wages, or 
(3) another base which results in an equitable distribution. An indirect cost rate should be 
developed for each separate indirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case should be 
stated as the percentage relationship between the particular indirect cost pool and the 
distribution base identified with that pool. 
4. Special Indirect Cost Rates 
a. 
In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities of a non-Federal entity or for each 

major function of the agency may not be appropriate. It may not take into account those 

different factors which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to a particular 

program or group of programs. The factors may include the physical location of the work, the 

level of administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, 

the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. When a particular Federal 

award is carried out in an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level 

of indirect costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to that 

Federal award. The separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the 

regular allocation process, and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be 

used, provided that: 

(1) The rate differs significantly from the rate which would have been developed under 
paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3) of this Appendix, and 
(2) the Federal award to which the rate would apply is material in amount. 
Where Federal statutes restrict the reimbursement of certain indirect costs, it may be necessary 

to develop a special rate for the affected Federal award. Where a “restricted rate” is required, 

the same procedure for developing a non-restricted rate will be used except for the additional 

step of the elimination from the indirect cost pool those costs for which the law prohibits 
reimbursement. 

D. Submission and Documentation of Proposals 
1. Submission of Indirect Cost Rate Proposals 
a. 
All departments or agencies of the governmental unit desiring to claim indirect costs under 

Federal awards must prepare an indirect cost rate proposal and related documentation to 

support those costs. The proposal and related documentation must be retained for audit in 

accordance with the records retention requirements contained in§ 200.334.

2 CFR Appendix-VII-to-Part-200 D.1.b. 

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 


A governmental department or agency (such as a state or local Department of Health, 
Department of Transportation, or Department of Housing) that receives more than $35 million 
in direct Federal funding during its fiscal year must submit its indirect cost rate proposal to its 
cognizant agency for indirect costs. 
c. If a governmental department or agency (such as a state or local Department of Health, 
Department of Transportation, or Department of Housing) receives $35 million or less in direct 
Federal funding during its fiscal year, it must develop an indirect cost proposal in accordance 
with the requirements of this part and maintain the proposal and related supporting 
documentation for audit. This established rate must be accepted by any Federal agency to 
which the governmental department or agency applies for funding. Federal agencies must not 
compel the governmental department or agency to accept the de minimis rate or some other 
rate established by the Federal agency. These governmental departments or agencies are not 
required to submit their proposals unless they are specifically requested to do so by an 
awarding Federal agency. The Federal agency's review should be limited to ensuring the 
proposal is consistent with the principles of this part. Where a non-Federal entity only receives 
funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for negotiating and/or 
monitoring the subrecipient's indirect costs. 
c. Each Indian tribal government desiring reimbursement of indirect costs must submit its indirect 
cost proposal to the Department of the Interior (its cognizant agency for indirect costs). 
d. Indirect cost proposals must be developed (and, when required, submitted) within six months 
after the close of the governmental unit's fiscal year, unless an exception is approved by the 
cognizant agency for indirect costs. If the proposed central service cost allocation plan for the 
same period has not been approved by that time, the indirect cost proposal may be prepared 
including an amount for central services that is based on the latest federally approved central 
service cost allocation plan. The difference between these central service amounts and the 
amounts ultimately approved will be compensated for by an adjustment in a subsequent 
period. 

b. 
2. Documentation of Proposals 
The following must be included with each indirect cost proposal: 

a. The rates proposed, including subsidiary work sheets and other relevant data, cross referenced 
and reconciled to the financial data noted in subsection b. Allocated central service costs will 
be supported by the summary table included in the approved central service cost allocation 
plan. This summary table is not required to be submitted with the indirect cost proposal if the 
central service cost allocation plan for the same fiscal year has been approved by the cognizant 
agency for indirect costs and is available to the funding agency. 
b. A copy of the financial data (financial statements, comprehensive annual financial report, 
executive budgets, accounting reports, etc.) upon which the rate is based. Adjustments 
resulting from the use of unaudited data will be recognized, where appropriate, by the Federal 
cognizant agency for indirect costs in a subsequent proposal. 
c. The approximate amount of direct base costs incurred under Federal awards. These costs 
should be broken out between salaries and wages and other direct costs.

d. 
A chart showing the organizational structure of the agency during the period for which the 

proposal applies, along with a functional statement(s) noting the duties and/or responsibilities 
of all units that comprise the agency. (Once this is submitted, only revisions need be submitted 
with subsequent proposals.) 

3. Required certification. 
Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a certification in the following form: 

Certificate of Indirect Costs 

This is to certify that I have reviewed the indirect cost rate proposal submitted herewith and to the best of my 
knowledge and belief: 

(1) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect costs rates for [identify 
period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal award(s) to 
which they apply and the provisions of this Part. Unallowable costs have been adjusted for in allocating 
costs as indicated in the indirect cost proposal 

(2) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or 
causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the agreements to which they are allocated in 
accordance with applicable requirements. Further, the same costs that have been treated as indirect 
costs have not been claimed as direct costs. Similar types of costs have been accounted for consistently 
and the Federal Government will be notified of any accounting changes that would affect the 
predetermined rate. 

I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.

E. Negotiation and Approval of Rates 
1. 
Indirect cost rates will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by the cognizant agency on a timely basis. 

Once a rate has been agreed upon, it will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies unless prohibited 
or limited by statute. Where a Federal awarding agency has reason to believe that special operating 
factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special indirect cost rates, the funding agency will, prior 
to the time the rates are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

2. 
3. 
The use of predetermined rates, if allowed, is encouraged where the cognizant agency for indirect costs 
has reasonable assurance based on past experience and reliable projection of the non-Federal entity's 
costs, that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on actual costs. Long-term agreements utilizing 
predetermined rates extending over two or more years are encouraged, where appropriate. 

The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency 
for indirect costs and the governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if the 
agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute, or the information upon which the plan was 
negotiated is later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate. The agreed upon rates must be made 
available to all Federal agencies for their use. 

4. Refunds must be made if proposals are later found to have included costs that 
(a) are unallowable 
(i) as specified by law or regulation, 
(ii) as identified in§ 200.420, or 
(iii) by the terms and conditions of Federal awards, or 
(b) are unallowable because they are clearly not allocable to Federal awards. These adjustments or 
refunds will be made regardless of the type of rate negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or 
provisional). 
F. Other Policies 
1. Fringe Benefit Rates 
If overall fringe benefit rates are not approved for the governmental unit as part of the central service cost 
allocation plan, these rates will be reviewed, negotiated and approved for individual recipient agencies 
during the indirect cost negotiation process. In these cases, a proposed fringe benefit rate computation 
should accompany the indirect cost proposal. If fringe benefit rates are not used at the recipient agency 
level (i.e., the agency specifically identifies fringe benefit costs to individual employees), the governmental 
unit should so advise the cognizant agency for indirect costs. 

2. Billed Services Provided by the Recipient Agency 
In some cases, governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit) provide 
and bill for services similar to those covered by central service cost allocation plans (e.g., computer 
centers). Where this occurs, the governmental departments or agencies (components of the 
governmental unit)should be guided by the requirements in Appendix V relating to the development of 
billing rates and documentation requirements, and should advise the cognizant agency for indirect costs 
of any billed services. Reviews of these types of services (including reviews of costing/billing 
methodology, profits or losses, etc.) will be made on a case-by-case basis as warranted by the 
circumstances involved.

Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit... 

In certain situations, governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit), 
because of the nature of their Federal awards, may be required to develop a cost allocation plan that 
distributes indirect (and, in some cases, direct) costs to the specific funding sources. In these cases, a 
narrative cost allocation methodology should be developed, documented, maintained for audit, or
