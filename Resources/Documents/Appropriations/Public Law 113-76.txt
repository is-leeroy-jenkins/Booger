        transmit to the Secretary of Energy and the Committees on 
        Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the

[[Page 128 STAT. 179]]

        Senate a report containing the Commission's findings and 
        conclusions.
            (2) The Commission shall address whether the Department of 
        Energy's national laboratories--
                    (A) are properly aligned with the Department's 
                strategic priorities;
                    (B) have clear, well understood, and properly 
                balanced missions that are not unnecessarily redundant 
                and duplicative;
                    (C) have unique capabilities that have sufficiently 
                evolved to meet current and future energy and national 
                security challenges;
                    (D) are appropriately sized to meet the Department's 
                energy and national security missions; and
                    (E) are appropriately supporting other Federal 
                agencies and the extent to which it benefits DOE 
                missions.
            (3) The Commission shall also determine whether there are 
        opportunities to more effectively and efficiently use the 
        capabilities of the national laboratories, including 
        consolidation and realignment, reducing overhead costs, 
        reevaluating governance models using industrial and academic 
        bench marks for comparison, and assessing the impact of DOE's 
        oversight and management approach. In its evaluation, the 
        Commission should also consider the cost and effectiveness of 
        using other research, development, and technology centers and 
        universities as an alternative to meeting DOE's energy and 
        national security goals.
            (4) The Commission shall analyze the effectiveness of the 
        use of laboratory directed research and development (LDRD) to 
        meet the Department of Energy's science, energy, and national 
        security goals. The Commission shall further evaluate the 
        effectiveness of the Department's oversight approach to ensure 
        LDRD-funded projects are compliant with statutory requirements 
        and congressional direction, including requirements that LDRD 
        projects be distinct from projects directly funded by 
        appropriations and that LDRD projects derived from the 
        Department's national security programs support the national 
        security mission of the Department of Energy. Finally, the 
        Commission shall quantify the extent to which LDRD funding 
        supports recruiting and retention of qualified staff.
            (5) The Commission's charge may be modified or expanded upon 
        approval of the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate.

section,
            (1) ``Performance Partnership Pilot'' (or ``Pilot'') is a 
        project that seeks to identify, through a demonstration, cost-
        effective strategies for providing services at the State, 
        regional, or local level that--

                          (ii) at least one of which is administered (in 
                      whole or in part) by a State, local, or tribal 
                      government; and
                    (B) achieve better results for regions, communities, 
                or specific at-risk populations through making better 
                use of the budgetary resources that are available for 
                supporting such programs.
            (2) ``To improve outcomes for disconnected youth'' means to 
        increase the rate at which individuals between the ages of 14 
        and 24 (who are low-income and either homeless, in foster care, 
        involved in the juvenile justice system, unemployed, or not 
        enrolled in or at risk of dropping out of an educational 
        institution) achieve success in meeting educational, employment, 
        or other key goals.
            (3) The ``lead Federal administering agency'' is the Federal 
        agency, to be designated by the Director of the Office of 
        Management and Budget (from among the participating Federal 
        agencies that have statutory responsibility for the Federal 
        discretionary funds that will be used in a Performance 
        Partnership Pilot), that will enter into and administer the 
        particular Performance Partnership Agreement on behalf of that 
        agency and the other participating Federal agencies.

    (b) Use of Discretionary Funds in Fiscal Year 2014.--Federal 
agencies may use Federal discretionary funds that are made available in 
this Act to carry out up to 10 Performance Partnership Pilots. Such 
Pilots shall:
            (1) be designed to improve outcomes for disconnected youth, 
        and
            (2) involve Federal programs targeted on disconnected youth, 
        or designed to prevent youth from disconnecting from school or 
        work, that provide education, training, employment, and other 
        related social services.

    (c) Performance Partnership Agreements.--Federal agencies may use 
Federal discretionary funds, as authorized in subsection (b), to 
participate in a Performance Partnership Pilot only in accordance with

                    (A) the head of the lead Federal administering 
                agency, on behalf of all of the participating Federal 
                agencies (subject to the head of the lead Federal 
                administering agency having received from the heads of 
                each of the other participating agencies their written 
                concurrence for entering into the Agreement), and
                    (B) the respective representatives of all of the 
                State, local, or tribal governments that are 
                participating in the Agreement; and
            (2) specifies, at a minimum, the following information:
                    (A) the length of the Agreement (which shall not 
                extend beyond September 30, 2018);
                    (B) the Federal programs and federally funded 
                services that are involved in the Pilot;
                    (C) the Federal discretionary funds that are being 
                used in the Pilot (by the respective Federal account 
                identifier,

[[Page 128 STAT. 415]]

                and the total amount from such account that is being 
                used in the Pilot), and the period (or periods) of 
                availability for obligation (by the Federal Government) 
                of such funds;
                    (D) the non-Federal funds that are involved in the 
                Pilot, by source (which may include private funds as 
                well as governmental funds) and by amount;
                    (E) the State, local, or tribal programs that are 
                involved in the Pilot;
                    (F) the populations to be served by the Pilot;
                    (G) the cost-effective Federal oversight procedures 
                that will be used for the purpose of maintaining the 
                necessary level of accountability for the use of the 
                Federal discretionary funds;
                    (H) the cost-effective State, local, or tribal 
                oversight procedures that will be used for the purpose 
                of maintaining the necessary level of accountability for 
                the use of the Federal discretionary funds;
                    (I) the outcome (or outcomes) that the Pilot is 
                designed to achieve;
                    (J) the appropriate, reliable, and objective 
                outcome-measurement methodology that the Federal 
                Government and the participating State, local, or tribal 
                governments will use, in carrying out the Pilot, to 
                determine whether the Pilot is achieving, and has 
                achieved, the specified outcomes that the Pilot is 
                designed to achieve;
                    (K) the statutory, regulatory, or administrative 
                requirements related to Federal mandatory programs that 
                are barriers to achieving improved outcomes of the 
                Pilot; and
                    (L) in cases where, during the course of the Pilot, 
                it is determined that the Pilot is not achieving the 
                specified outcomes that it is designed to achieve,
                          (i) the consequences that will result from 
                      such deficiencies with respect to the Federal 
                      discretionary funds that are being used in the 
                      Pilot, and
                          (ii) the corrective actions that will be taken 
                      in order to increase the likelihood that the 
                      Pilot, upon completion, will have achieved such 
                      specified outcomes.

    (d) Agency Head Determinations.--A Federal agency may participate in 
a Performance Partnership Pilot (including by providing Federal 
discretionary funds that have been appropriated to such agency) only 
upon the written determination by the head of such agency that the 
agency's participation in such Pilot--
            (1) will not result in denying or restricting the 
        eligibility of any individual for any of the services that (in 
        whole or in part) are funded by the agency's programs and 
        Federal discretionary funds that are involved in the Pilot, and
            (2) based on the best available information, will not 
        otherwise adversely affect vulnerable populations that are the 
        recipients of such services.

In making this determination, the head of the agency may take into 
consideration the other Federal discretionary funds that will be used in 
the Pilot as well as any non-Federal funds (including from private 
sources as well as governmental sources) that will be used in the Pilot.
    (e) Transfer Authority.--For the purpose of carrying out the Pilot 
in accordance with the Performance Partnership Agreement, and subject to 
the written approval of the Director of the

[[Page 128 STAT. 416]]

Office of Management and Budget, the head of each participating Federal 
agency may transfer Federal discretionary funds that are being used in 
the Pilot to an account of the lead Federal administering agency that 
includes Federal discretionary funds that are being used in the Pilot. 
Subject to the waiver authority under subsection (f), such transferred 
funds shall remain available for the same purposes for which such funds 
were originally appropriated:  Provided, That such transferred funds 
shall remain available for obligation by the Federal Government until 
the expiration of the period of availability for those Federal 
discretionary funds (which are being used in the Pilot) that have the 
longest period of availability, except that any such transferred funds 
shall not remain available beyond September 30, 2018.
    (f) Waiver Authority.--In connection with a Federal agency's 
participation in a Performance Partnership Pilot, and subject to the 
other provisions of this section (including subsection (e)), the head of 
the Federal agency to which the Federal discretionary funds were 
appropriated may waive (in whole or in part) the application, solely to 
such discretionary funds that are being used in the Pilot, of any 
statutory, regulatory, or administrative requirement that such agency 
head--
            (1) is otherwise authorized to waive (in accordance with the 
        terms and conditions of such other authority), and
            (2) is not otherwise authorized to waive, provided that in 
        such case the agency head shall--
                    (A) not waive any requirement related to 
                nondiscrimination, wage and labor standards, or 
                allocation of funds to State and substate levels;
                    (B) issue a written determination, prior to granting 
                the waiver, with respect to such discretionary funds 
                that the granting of such waiver for purposes of the 
                Pilot--
                          (i) is consistent with both--
                                    (I) the statutory purposes of the 
                                Federal program for which such 
                                discretionary funds were appropriated, 
                                and
                                    (II) the other provisions of this 
                                section, including the written 
                                determination by the agency head issued 
                                under subsection (d);
                          (ii) is necessary to achieve the outcomes of 
                      the Pilot as specified in the Performance 
                      Partnership Agreement, and is no broader in scope 
                      than is necessary to achieve such outcomes; and
                          (iii) will result in either--
                                    (I) realizing efficiencies by 
                                simplifying reporting burdens or 
                                reducing administrative barriers with 
                                respect to such discretionary funds, or
                                    (II) increasing the ability of 
                                individuals to obtain access to services 
                                that are provided by such discretionary 
                                funds; and
                    (C) provide at least 60 days advance written notice 
                to the Committees on Appropriations and other committees 
                of jurisdiction in the House of Representatives and the 
                Senate.

other entity carrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or

                providing substantial reimbursement of such taxes; or
                    (B) the foreign policy interests of the United 
                States outweigh the purpose of this section to ensure

                taxation.
            (2) The Secretary of State shall consult with the Committees

        States foreign assistance for such country generally, or an 
        individual agreement between the Government of the United States

fiscal year if the USAID Administrator determines and reports promptly 
to the Committees on Appropriations that the termination of assistance

of availability:  Provided, That such designated funds that continue to 
be available for an additional fiscal year shall be obligated only for 
the purpose of such designation.

    (b) Phased Transfers.--Transfers of project-based assistance under 
this section may be done in phases to accommodate the financing and 
other requirements related to rehabilitating or constructing the project 
or projects to which the assistance is transferred, to ensure that such 
project or projects meet the standards under subsection (c).
    (c) The transfer authorized in subsection (a) is subject to the 
following conditions:
            (1) Number and bedroom size of units.--

                transferring project shall be no less than when 
                transferred to the receiving project or projects and the 
                net dollar amount of Federal assistance provided to the 
                transferring project shall remain the same in the 
                receiving project or projects.
                    (B) For unoccupied units in the transferring 
                project: the Secretary may authorize a reduction in the 
                number of dwelling units in the receiving project or 
                projects to allow for a reconfiguration of bedroom sizes 
                to meet current market demands, as determined by the 
                Secretary and provided there is no increase in the 
                project-based assistance budget authority.
            (2) The transferring project shall, as determined by the 
        Secretary, be either physically obsolete or economically 
        nonviable.

[[Page 128 STAT. 627]]

            (3) The receiving project or projects shall meet or exceed 
        applicable physical standards established by the Secretary.
            (4) The owner or mortgagor of the transferring project shall 
        notify and consult with the tenants residing in the transferring 
        project and provide a certification of approval by all 
        appropriate local governmental officials.
            (5) The tenants of the transferring project who remain 
        eligible for assistance to be provided by the receiving project 
        or projects shall not be required to vacate their units in the 
        transferring project or projects until new units in the 
        receiving project are available for occupancy.
            (6) The Secretary determines that this transfer is in the 
        best interest of the tenants.
            (7) If either the transferring project or the receiving 
        project or projects meets the condition specified in subsection 
        (d)(2)(A), any lien on the receiving project resulting from 
        additional financing obtained by the owner shall be subordinate 
        to any FHA-insured mortgage lien transferred to, or placed on, 
        such project by the Secretary, except that the Secretary may 
        waive this requirement upon determination that such a waiver is 
        necessary to facilitate the financing of acquisition, 
        construction, and/or rehabilitation of the receiving project or 
        projects.
            (8) If the transferring project meets the requirements of 
        subsection (d)(2), the owner or mortgagor of the receiving 
        project or projects shall execute and record either a 
        continuation of the existing use agreement or a new use 
        agreement for the project where, in either case, any use 
        restrictions in such agreement are of no lesser duration than 
        the existing use restrictions.
            (9) The transfer does not increase the cost (as defined in 
        section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended) 
        of any FHA-insured mortgage, except to the extent that 
        appropriations are provided in advance for the amount of any 
        such increased cost.

        assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 
        1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f).

    (b) For purposes of determining the eligibility of a person to 
receive assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 
1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), any financial assistance (in excess of amounts 
received for tuition and any other required fees and charges) that an 
individual receives under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1001 et seq.), from private sources, or an institution of higher 
education (as defined under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1002)), shall be considered income to that individual, except for a 
person over the age of 23 with dependent children.
    Sec. 216.  The funds made available for Native Alaskans under the

    Sec. 218.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in fiscal

owned or has a mortgage held by the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, and during the process of foreclosure on any property with 
a contract for rental assistance payments under section 8 of the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 or other Federal programs, the Secretary 
shall maintain any rental assistance payments under section 8 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 and other programs that are attached 
to any dwelling units in the property. To the extent the Secretary 
determines, in consultation with the tenants and the local government, 
that such a multifamily property owned or held by the Secretary is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, 
State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 524 
of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 
(``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be remedied in 
a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in consultation with the 
tenants of that property, contract for project-based rental assistance 
payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties, 
or provide other rental assistance. The Secretary shall also take 
appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts remain in 
effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual 
abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major 
threats to health and safety after written notice to and informed 
consent of the affected tenants and use of other available remedies, 
such as partial abatements or receivership. After disposition of any 
multifamily property described under this section, the contract and 
allowable rent levels on such properties shall be subject to the 
requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.
    Sec. 219.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the recipient 
of a grant under section 202b of the Housing Act of

nonprofit organization described in section 831 of the American 
Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000.

Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured projects with 
assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the united States

                which will be obligated to promptly make all required 
                repairs and to accept renewal of the assistance contract

project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the exercise of 
contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for 
imminent major threats to health and safety after written notice to and 
informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other remedies set 
forth above. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation 
with the tenants and the local government, that the property is not

payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties, 
or provide other rental assistance. The Secretary shall report semi-
annually on all properties covered by this section that are assessed 
through the Real Estate Assessment Center and have physical inspection 
scores of less than 30 or have consecutive physical inspection scores of 
less than 60. The report shall include:
            (1) The enforcement actions being taken to address such 
        conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties and 
        termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have such 
        conditions multiple times; and
            (2) Actions that the Department of Housing and Urban 
        Development is taking to protect tenants of such identified 
        properties.

other Act, for purposes authorized under section 8 (only with respect to 
the tenant-based rental assistance program) and section 9 of the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.), may be used by any

Provided, That in addition, $67,500,000 shall be made available until

conditions:
            (1) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (``NRC'') 
        shall make grants to counseling intermediaries approved by the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (with match to 
        be determined by the NRC based on affordability and the economic 
        conditions of an area; a match also may be waived by the NRC 
        based on the aforementioned conditions) to provide mortgage 
        foreclosure mitigation assistance primarily to States and areas 
        with high rates of defaults and foreclosures to help eliminate 
        the default and foreclosure of mortgages of owner-occupied 
        single-family homes that are at risk of such foreclosure. Other 
        than areas with high rates of defaults and foreclosures, grants 
        may also be provided to approved counseling intermediaries based 
        on a geographic analysis of the Nation by the NRC which 
        determines where there is a prevalence of mortgages that are 
        risky and likely to fail, including any trends for mortgages 
        that are likely to default and face foreclosure. A State Housing 
        Finance Agency may also be eligible where the State Housing 
        Finance Agency meets all the requirements under this paragraph. 
        A HUD-approved counseling intermediary shall meet certain 
        mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance counseling 
        requirements, as determined

[[Page 128 STAT. 639]]

        by the NRC, and shall be approved by HUD or the NRC as meeting 
        these requirements.
            (2) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance shall only be 
        made available to homeowners of owner-occupied homes with 
        mortgages in default or in danger of default. These mortgages 
        shall likely be subject to a foreclosure action and homeowners 
        will be provided such assistance that shall consist of 
        activities that are likely to prevent foreclosures and result in 
        the long-term affordability of the mortgage retained pursuant to 
        such activity or another positive outcome for the homeowner. No 
        funds made available under this paragraph may be provided 
        directly to lenders or homeowners to discharge outstanding 
        mortgage balances or for any other direct debt reduction 
        payments.
            (3) The use of mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance by 
        approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing Finance 
        Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the borrower's 
        financial situation, an evaluation of the current value of the 
        property that is subject to the mortgage, counseling regarding 
        the assumption of the mortgage by another non-Federal party, 
        counseling regarding the possible purchase of the mortgage by a 
        non-Federal third party, counseling and advice of all likely 
        restructuring and refinancing strategies or the approval of a 
        work-out strategy by all interested parties.
            (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds 
        under this paragraph to its own charter members with expertise 
        in foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a certification 
        by the NRC that the procedures for selection do not consist of 
        any procedures or activities that could be construed as an 
        unacceptable conflict of interest or have the appearance of 
        impropriety.
            (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing 
        Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall have 
        demonstrated experience in successfully working with financial 
        institutions as well as borrowers facing default, delinquency 
        and foreclosure as well as documented counseling capacity, 
        outreach capacity, past successful performance and positive 
        outcomes with documented counseling plans (including post 
        mortgage foreclosure mitigation counseling), loan workout 
        agreements and loan modification agreements. NRC may use other 
        criteria to demonstrate capacity in underserved areas.
            (6) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to $3,000,000 may be made available to build the mortgage 
        foreclosure and default mitigation counseling capacity of 
        counseling intermediaries through NRC training courses with HUD-
        approved counseling intermediaries and their partners, except 
        that private financial institutions that participate in NRC 
        training shall pay market rates for such training.
            (7) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to 5 percent may be used for associated administrative 
        expenses for the NRC to carry out activities provided under this 
        section.
            (8) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance grants may 
        include a budget for outreach and advertising, and training, as 
        determined by the NRC.
            (9) The NRC shall continue to report bi-annually to the 
        House and Senate Committees on Appropriations as well as

[[Page 128 STAT. 640]]

        the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services 
        Committee on its efforts to mitigate mortgage default.
