        or entity or an employee of the person or entity, that 
        is receiving financial assistance provided by the 
        Corporation; or
            (19) unless such person or entity enters into a 
        contractual agreement to be subject to all provisions 
        of Federal law relating to the proper use of Federal

        provided by the Corporation shall be considered to be 
        Federal funds provided by grant or contract.
    (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit 
a recipient from using funds from a source other than the Legal 
Services Corporation for the purpose of contacting, 
communicating with, or responding to a request from, a State or 
local government agency, a State or local legislative body or 
committee, or a member thereof, regarding funding for the

        which the tribal funds are provided; or
            (B) using funds received from a source other than 
        the Legal Services Corporation to provide legal 
        assistance to a covered individual if such funds are 
        used for the specific purposes for which such funds 
        were received, except that such funds may not be 
        expended by recipients for any purpose prohibited by 
        this Act or by the Legal Services Corporation Act.
    (e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit 
a recipient from using funds derived from a source other than 
the Legal Services Corporation to comment on public rulemaking 
or to respond to a written request for information or testimony 
from a Federal, State or local agency, legislative body or 
committee, or a member of such an agency, body, or committee,

    This title may be cited as the ``Prison Litigation Reform

SEC. 802. APPROPRIATE REMEDIES FOR PRISON CONDITIONS.

    (a) In General.--Section 3626 of title 18, United States 
Code, is amended to read as follows:

``Sec. 3626. Appropriate remedies with respect to prison conditions

    ``(a) Requirements for Relief.--
            ``(1) Prospective relief.--(A) Prospective relief 
        in any civil action with respect to prison conditions 
        shall extend no further than necessary to correct the 
        violation of the Federal right of a particular 
        plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or 
        approve any prospective relief unless the court finds 
        that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further 
        than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal 
        right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to 
        correct the violation of the Federal right. The court 
        shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on 
        public safety or the operation of a criminal justice 
        system caused by the relief.
            ``(B) The court shall not order any prospective 
        relief that requires or permits a government official 
        to exceed his or her authority under State or local law 
        or otherwise violates State or local law, unless--
                    ``(i) Federal law permits such relief to be 
                ordered in violation of State or local law;
                    ``(ii) the relief is necessary to correct 
                the violation of a Federal right; and
                    ``(iii) no other relief will correct the 
                violation of the Federal right.
            ``(C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
        authorize the courts, in exercising their remedial 
        powers, to order the construction of prisons or the 
        raising of taxes, or to repeal or detract from 
        otherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers 
        of the courts.
            ``(2) Preliminary injunctive relief.--In any civil 
        action with respect to prison conditions, to the extent 
        otherwise authorized by law, the court may enter a 
        temporary restraining order or an order for preliminary 
        injunctive relief. Preliminary injunctive relief must 
        be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to 
        correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary 
        relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to 
        correct that harm. The court shall give substantial 
        weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the 
        operation of a criminal justice system caused by the 
        preliminary relief and shall respect the principles of 
        comity set out in paragraph (1)(B) in tailoring any 
        preliminary relief. Preliminary injunctive relief shall 
        automatically expire on the date that is 90 days after 
        its entry, unless the court makes the findings required 
        under subsection (a)(1) for the entry of prospective 
        relief and makes the order final before the expiration 
        of the 90-day period.
            ``(3) Prisoner release order.--(A) In any civil 
        action with respect to prison conditions, no prisoner 
        release order shall be entered unless--
                    ``(i) a court has previously entered an 
                order for less intrusive relief that has failed 
                to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right 
                sought to be remedied through the prisoner 
                release order; and
                    ``(ii) the defendant has had a reasonable 
                amount of time to comply with the previous 
                court orders.
            ``(B) In any civil action in Federal court with 
        respect to prison conditions, a prisoner release order 
        shall be entered only by a three-judge court in 
        accordance with section 2284 of title 28, if the 
        requirements of subparagraph (E) have been met.
            ``(C) A party seeking a prisoner release order in 
        Federal court shall file with any request for such 
        relief, a request for a three-judge court and materials 
        sufficient to demonstrate that the requirements of 
        subparagraph (A) have been met.
            ``(D) If the requirements under subparagraph (A) 
        have been met, a Federal judge before whom a civil 
        action with respect to prison conditions is pending who 
        believes that a prison release order should be 
        considered may sua sponte request the convening of a 
        three-judge court to determine whether a prisoner 
        release order should be entered.
            ``(E) The three-judge court shall enter a prisoner 
        release order only if the court finds by clear and 
        convincing evidence that--
                    ``(i) crowding is the primary cause of the 
                violation of a Federal right; and
                    ``(ii) no other relief will remedy the 
                violation of the Federal right.
            ``(F) Any State or local official or unit of 
        government whose jurisdiction or function includes the 
        appropriation of funds for the construction, operation, 
        or maintenance of program facilities, or the 
        prosecution or custody of persons who may be released 
        from, or not admitted to, a prison as a result of a 
        prisoner release order shall have standing to oppose 
        the imposition or continuation in effect of such relief 
        and to seek termination of such relief, and shall have 
        the right to intervene in any proceeding relating to 
        such relief.
    ``(b) Termination of Relief.--
            ``(1) Termination of prospective relief.--(A) In 
        any civil action with respect to prison conditions in 
        which prospective relief is ordered, such relief shall 
        be terminable upon the motion of any party or 
        intervener--
                    ``(i) 2 years after the date the court 
                granted or approved the prospective relief;
                    ``(ii) 1 year after the date the court has 
                entered an order denying termination of 
                prospective relief under this paragraph; or
                    ``(iii) in the case of an order issued on 
                or before the date of enactment of the Prison 
                Litigation Reform Act, 2 years after such date 
                of enactment.
            ``(B) Nothing in this section shall prevent the 
        parties from agreeing to terminate or modify relief 
        before the relief is terminated under subparagraph (A).
            ``(2) Immediate termination of prospective 
        relief.--In any civil action with respect to prison 
        conditions, a defendant or intervener shall be entitled 
        to the immediate termination of any prospective relief 
        if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of 
        a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly 
        drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the 
        violation of the Federal right, and is the least 
        intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of 
        the Federal right.
            ``(3) Limitation.--Prospective relief shall not 
        terminate if the court makes written findings based on 
        the record that prospective relief remains necessary to 
        correct a current or ongoing violation of the Federal 
        right, extends no further than necessary to correct the 
        violation of the Federal right, and that the 
        prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least 
        intrusive means to correct the violation.
            ``(4) Termination or modification of relief.--
        Nothing in this section shall prevent any party or 
        intervener from seeking modification or termination 
        before the relief is terminable under paragraph (1) or 
        (2), to the extent that modification or termination 
        would otherwise be legally permissible.
    ``(c) Settlements.--
            ``(1) Consent decrees.--In any civil action with 
        respect to prison conditions, the court shall not enter 
        or approve a consent decree unless it complies with the 
        limitations on relief set forth in subsection (a).
            ``(2) Private settlement agreements.--(A) Nothing 
        in this section shall preclude parties from entering 
        into a private settlement agreement that does not 
        comply with the limitations on relief set forth in 
        subsection (a), if the terms of that agreement are not 
        subject to court enforcement other than the 
        reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the 
        agreement settled.
            ``(B) Nothing in this section shall preclude any 
        party claiming that a private settlement agreement has 
        been breached from seeking in State court any remedy 
        available under State law.
    ``(d) State Law Remedies.--The limitations on remedies in 
this section shall not apply to relief entered by a State court 
based solely upon claims arising under State law.
    ``(e) Procedure for Motions Affecting Prospective Relief.--
            ``(1) Generally.--The court shall promptly rule on 
        any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in 
        a civil action with respect to prison conditions.
            ``(2) Automatic stay.--Any prospective relief 
        subject to a pending motion shall be automatically 
        stayed during the period--
                    ``(A)(i) beginning on the 30th day after 
                such motion is filed, in the case of a motion 
                made under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection 
                (b); or
                    ``(ii) beginning on the 180th day after 
                such motion is filed, in the case of a motion 
                made under any other law; and
                    ``(B) ending on the date the court enters a 
                final order ruling on the motion.
    ``(f) Special Masters.--
            ``(1) In general.--(A) In any civil action in a 
        Federal court with respect to prison conditions, the 
        court may appoint a special master who shall be 
        disinterested and objective and who will give due 
        regard to the public safety, to conduct hearings on the

respect to prison conditions under section 1979 of the Revised 
Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983), or any other 
Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or

action is frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon 
which relief can be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a

malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be 
granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is 
immune from such relief, the court may dismiss the underlying 
claim without first requiring the exhaustion of administrative 
remedies.

prisoner who is confined to any jail, prison, or other 
correctional facility, in which attorney's fees are authorized

        in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.
    ``(2) Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action

attorney's fees is not greater than 150 percent of the 
judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.

technology without removing the prisoner from the facility in 
which the prisoner is confined.
    ``(2) Subject to the agreement of the official of the 
Federal, State, or local unit of government with custody over 
the prisoner, hearings may be conducted at the facility in 
which the prisoner is confined. To the extent practicable, the 
court shall allow counsel to participate by telephone, video 
conference, or other communications technology in any hearing 
held at the facility.
    ``(g) Waiver of Reply.--(1) Any defendant may waive the 
right to reply to any action brought by a prisoner confined in 
any jail, prison, or other correctional facility under section 
1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 
1983) or any other Federal law. Notwithstanding any other law 
or rule of procedure, such waiver shall not constitute an 
admission of the allegations contained in the complaint. No 
relief shall be granted to the plaintiff unless a reply has 
been filed.

complaint brought under this section if it finds that the 
plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity to prevail on the 
merits.

SEC. 2852. PRIMARY PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.

      (a) Purpose.--The primary purpose of the Consensus 
Commission is to assist in developing a long-term reform plan 
that has the support of the District of Columbia community 
through the participation of representatives of various 
critical segments of such community in helping to develop and 
approve the plan.
      (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) experience has shown that the failure of the 
        District of Columbia educational system has been due 
        more to the failure to implement a plan than the 
        failure to develop a plan;
            (2) national studies indicate that 50 percent of 
        secondary school graduates lack basic literacy skills, 
        and over 30 percent of the 7th grade students in the 
        District of Columbia public schools drop out of school 
        before graduating;
            (3) standard student assessments indicate only 
        average performance for grade level and fail to 
        identify individual students who lack basic skills, 
        allowing too many students to graduate lacking these 
        basic skills and diminishing the worth of a diploma;
            (4) experience has shown that successful schools 
        have good community, parent, and business involvement;
            (5) experience has shown that reducing dropout 
        rates in the critical middle and secondary school years 
        requires individual student involvement and attention 
        through such activities as arts or athletics; and
            (6) experience has shown that close coordination 
        between educators and business persons is required to 
        provide noncollege-bound students the skills necessary 
        for employment, and that personal attention is vitally 
        important to assist each student in developing an 
        appropriate career path.

    Sec. 326. (a) Land Exchange.--The Secretary of the Interior 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``Secretary'') is authorized to 
convey to the Boise Cascade Corporation (hereinafter referred

Interior, as Tract No. GC-19858 and Tract No. GC-19859, 
respectively.
    (b) Appraisal.--The properties so exchanged either shall be 
approximately equal in fair market value or if they are not 
approximately equal, shall be equalized by the payment of cash 
to the Corporation or to the Secretary as required or in the 
event the value of the Corporation's lands is greater, the 
acreage may be reduced so that the fair market value is 
approximately equal: Provided, That the Secretary shall order 
appraisals made of the fair market value of each tract of land 
included in the exchange without consideration for improvements 
thereon: Provided further, That any cash payment received by 
the Secretary shall be covered in the Reclamation Fund and

States shall have no responsibility or liability with respect 
to any hazardous wastes or other substances placed on any of 
the lands covered by this Act after their transfer to the 
ownership of any party, but nothing in this Act shall be 
construed as either diminishing or increasing any 
responsibility or liability of the United States based on the 
condition of such lands on the date of their transfer to the 
ownership of another party. The Corporation shall indemnify the 
United States for liabilities arising under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (42

Appropriations for Disaster Assistance and Rescissions Act, 
minus the funds necessary to make payments to States or local 
governments under other law concerning the distribution of 
revenues derived from the affected lands, which are in excess 
of $37,500,000 (hereinafter ``excess revenues'') shall be 
deposited into the Funds. The distribution of excess revenues 
between the Agriculture Fund and Interior Fund shall be 
calculated by multiplying the total of excess revenues times a 
fraction with a denominator of the total revenues received from 
all sales released under such section 2001(k) and numerators of 
the total revenues received from such sales on lands within the 
National Forest System and the total revenues received from 
such sales on lands administered by the Bureau of Land 
Management, respectively: Provided, That revenues or portions 
thereof from sales released under such section 2001(k), minus 
the amounts necessary for State and local government payments 
and other necessary deposits, may be deposited into the Funds 
immediately upon receipt thereof and subsequently redistributed 
between the Funds or paid into the United States Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts as may be required when the calculation 
of excess revenues is made.
    (b)(1) From the funds deposited into the Agriculture Fund 
and into the Interior Fund pursuant to subsection (a)--
            (A) seventy-five percent shall be available, 
        without fiscal year limitation or further 
        appropriation, for preparation of timber sales, other 
        than salvage sales as defined in section 2001(a)(3) of 
        the fiscal year 1995 Supplemental Appropriations for 
        Disaster Assistance and Rescissions Act, which--
                    (i) are situated on lands within the 
                National Forest System and lands administered 
                by the Bureau of Land Management, respectively;

                    (ii) are in addition to timber sales for 
                which funds are otherwise available in this Act 
                or other appropriations Acts; and
            (B) twenty-five percent shall be available, without 
        fiscal year limitation or further appropriation, to 
        expend on the backlog of recreation projects on lands 
        within the National Forest System and lands 
        administered by the Bureau of Land Management, 
        respectively.
    (2) Expenditures under this subsection for preparation of 
timber sales may include expenditures for Forest Service 
activities within the forest land management budget line item 
and associated timber roads, and Bureau of Land Management 
activities within the Oregon and California grant lands account 
and the forestry management area account, as determined by the 
Secretary concerned.
    (c) Revenues received from any timber sale prepared under 
subsection (b) or under this subsection, minus the amounts 
necessary for State and local government payments and other 
necessary deposits, shall be deposited into the Fund from which 
funds were expended on such sale. Such deposited revenues shall 
be available for preparation of additional timber sales and 
completion of additional recreation projects in accordance with 
the requirements set forth in subsection (b).
    (d) The Secretary concerned shall terminate all payments 
into the Agriculture Fund or the Interior Fund, and pay any 
unobligated funds in the affected Fund into the United States 
Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, whenever the Secretary 
concerned makes a finding, published in the Federal Register, 
that sales sufficient to achieve the total allowable sales 
quantity of the National Forest System for the Forest Service 
or the allowable sales level for the Oregon and California 
grant lands for the Bureau of Land Management, respectively, 
have been prepared.
    (e) Any timber sales prepared and recreation projects 
completed under this section shall comply with all applicable 
environmental and natural resource laws and regulations.
    (f) The Secretary concerned shall report annually to the 
Committees on Appropriations of the United States Senate and 
the House of Representatives on expenditures made from the Fund 
for timber sales and recreation projects, revenues received 
into the Fund from timber sales, and timber sale preparation 
and recreation project work undertaken during the previous year 
and projected for the next year under the Fund. Such 
information shall be provided for each Forest Service region 
and Bureau of Land Management State office.
    (g) The authority of this section shall terminate upon the 
termination of both Funds in accordance with the provisions of 
subsection (d).

        Fellowship, or American Jazz Masters Fellowship.
            (b) The Chairperson shall establish procedures to 
        ensure that no funding provided through a grant, except 
        a grant made to a State or regional group, may be used 
        to make a grant to any other organization or individual 
        to conduct activity independent of the direct grant 
        recipient. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit 
        payments made in exchange for goods and services.
            (c) No grant shall be used for seasonal support to 
        a group, unless the application is specific to the 
        contents of the season, including identified programs 
        and/or projects.

Rangeland Reform Program.--None of the funds made available

        people of the United States'';
            (2) ``The arts and humanities reflect the high 
        place accorded by the American people . . . to the 
        fostering of mutual respect for the diverse beliefs and 
        values of all persons and groups'';
            (3) ``Public funding of the arts and humanities is 
        subject to the conditions that traditionally govern the

        contribute to public support and confidence in the use 
        of taxpayer funds''; and

        Government must ultimately serve public purposes the 
        Congress defines''.
    (b) Additional Congressional Findings.--Congress further 
finds and declares that the use of scarce funds, which have 
been taken from all taxpayers of the United States, to promote, 
disseminate, sponsor, or produce any material or performance 
that--
            (1) denigrates the religious objects or religious 
        beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion, or
            (2) depicts or describes, in a patently offensive 
        way, sexual or excretory activities or organs,
is contrary to the express purposes of the National Foundation 
on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended.
    (c) Prohibition on Funding That Is Not Consistent With the 
Purposes of the Act.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, none of the scarce funds which have been taken from all 
taxpayers of the United States and made available under this 
Act to the National Endowment for the Arts may be used to 
promote, disseminate, sponsor, or produce any material or 
performance that--
            (1) denigrates the religious objects or religious 
        beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion, or
            (2) depicts or describes, in a patently offensive 
        way, sexual or excretory activities or organs,
and this prohibition shall be strictly applied without regard 
to the content or viewpoint of the material or performance.
    (d) Section Not To Affect Other Works.--Nothing in this

             optional, alternative medicaid payment method


      Sec. 519. (a) Election.--A heavily impacted high-DSH 
State (as defined in subsection (d)) may elect to receive 
payments for expenditures under title XIX of the Social 
Security Act for the period beginning October 1, 1995, and 
ending June 30, 1996 (in this section referred to as the ``9-
month period''), for State fiscal year 1996-1997, and (subject 
to subsection (c)(4) for State fiscal year 1997-1998 in 
accordance with the alternative payment method specified in 
subsection (b) rather than in accordance with section 1903(a) 
of such Act.
      (b) Alternative Payment Method.--
            (1) In general.--Under the alternative payment 
        method specified in this subsection--
                    (A) any percentage otherwise specified in 
                section 1903(a) of the Social Security Act for 
                expenditures in the 9-month period or a State 
                fiscal year for which the election is in effect 
                shall be equal to 100 percent minus the non-
                Federal participation percentage (specified 
                under paragraph (2)) for the State for that 
                period or State fiscal year, and
                    (B) the total payment for the 9-month 
                period or a State fiscal year in which the 
                election is in effect may not exceed the 
                maximum Federal financial participation 
                specified in paragraph (5) for the period or 
                year.

        In applying subparagraph (B), there shall not be 
        counted as payments for any period or fiscal year any 
        payment that is attributable to an expenditure which is 
        exempt under subsection (c)(1). In applying such 
        subparagraph to the 9-month period, there shall be 
        counted payments (other than those described in the 
        previous sentence) that are attributable to an 
        expenditure for periods occurring in the 9-month period 
        and before the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (2) Non-federal participation percentage.--For 
        purposes of paragraph (1), the ``non-Federal 
        participation percentage'' for a State for the 9-month 
        period or State fiscal year is equal to the ratio of--
                    (A) the State's base State expenditures (as 
                defined in paragraph (3)) plus the applicable 
                percentage (as defined in paragraph (4)) of the 
                difference between the amount of such 
                expenditures and the amount of the State 
                expenditures that would be required for the 
                State to qualify for the maximum Federal 
                financial participation specified in paragraph 
                (5) under title XIX of the Social Security Act 
                if this section did not apply for such period 
                or State fiscal year; to
                    (B) the total expenditures under the State 
                plan of the State under such title for such 
                period or State fiscal year.

        Such ratio shall be calculated as if total expenditures 
        under the State plan were no greater than necessary for 
        the State to receive the maximum Federal financial 
        participation specified in paragraph (5).
            (3) Base state expenditures.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term ``base State expenditures'' 
        means--
                    (A) for the 9-month period, $266,250,000, 
                or
                    (B) for State fiscal year 1996-1997, 
                $355,000,000, or
                    (C) for State fiscal year 1997-1998, 
                $355,000,000.
            (4) Applicable percentage.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the ``applicable percentage''--
                    (A) for the 9-month period is 20 percent,
                    (B) for State fiscal year 1996-1997 is 35 
                percent, and
                    (C) for State fiscal year 1997-1998 is 55 
                percent.
            (5) Maximum federal participation.--For purposes of 
        this section, the maximum Federal financial 
        participation specified in this paragraph for a State--
                    (A) for the 9-month period, $1,966,500,000.
                    (B) for State fiscal year 1996-1997 is 
                $2,622,000,000, and
                    (C) for State fiscal year 1997-1998 is 
                $2,622,000,000.
      (c) Additional Rules.--
            (1) Limiting application to expenditures for 
        periods in which election in effect.--This section (and 
        the maximum Federal financial participation specified 
        in subsection (b)(5)) shall not apply to any 
        expenditure that is applicable to a reporting period 
        that is not covered under an election under subsection 
        (a), including any expenditure applicable to any 
        reporting period before October 1, 1995.
            (2) Election process.--An election of a State under 
        subsection (a) shall be made, by notice from the 
        Governor of the State to the Secretary of Health and 
        Human Services, not later than 30 days after the date 
        of the enactment of this Act.
            (3) Limitation.--For any period (on or after the 
        date of an election under this section) in which an 
        election is in effect for a State under this section--
                    (A) the Federal Government has no 
                obligation to provide payment with respect to 
                items and services provided under title XIX of 
                the Social Security Act in excess of the 
                maximum Federal financial participation 
                specified in subsection (b)(5) and such title 
                shall not be construed as providing for an 
                entitlement, under Federal law in relation to 
                the Federal Government, in an individual or 
                person (including any provider) at the time of 
                provision or receipt of services; and
                    (B) the State shall provide an entitlement 
                to any person to receive any service or other 
                benefit to the extent that such person would, 
                but for this paragraph, be entitled to such 
                service or other benefit under such title.
            (4) Condition for state fiscal year 1997-1998.--

of such funds in any fiscal year, for any operating subsidy 
purpose authorized in section 9. Except for assistance used for 
operating subsidy purposes under the preceding sentence, 
assistance provided to a public housing agency under this 
section shall principally be used for the physical improvement, 
replacement of public housing, other capital purposes, and for 
associated management improvements, and such other 
extraordinary purposes as may be approved by the Secretary. 
Low-income and very low-income units assisted under this 
paragraph shall be eligible for operating subsidies, unless the 
Secretary determines that such units or projects do not meet 
other requirements of this Act.
    ``(2) A public housing agency may provide assistance to 
developments that include units, other than units assisted 
under this Act (except for units assisted under section 8 
hereof) (`mixed income developments'), in the form of a grant, 
loan, operating assistance, or other form of investment which 
may be made to--
            ``(A) a partnership, a limited liability company, 
        or other legal entity in which the public housing 
        agency or its affiliate is a general partner, managing 
        member, or otherwise participates in the activities of 
        such entity; or

        agency the option to purchase the development within 20 
        years after initial occupancy in accordance with 
        section 42(i)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,

        by low-income and very low-income families referred 
        from time to time by the public housing agency. The 
        number of such units shall be:
                    ``(i) in the same proportion to the total 
                number of units in such development that the 
                total financial commitment provided by the 
                public housing agency bears to the value of the 
                total financial commitment in the development, 
                or
                    ``(ii) not be less than the number of units

units subject only to the applicable local real estate taxes, 
notwithstanding that the low-income units assisted by public 
housing funds would otherwise be subject to section 6(d) of the 
Housing Act of 1937.
    ``(4) If an entity that owns or operates a mixed-income 
project under this subsection enters into a contract with a 
public housing agency, the terms of which obligate the entity 
to operate and maintain a specified number of units in the 
project as public housing units in accordance with the 
requirements of this Act for the period required by law, such 
contractual terms may provide that, if, as a result of a 
reduction in appropriations under section 9, or any other 
change in applicable law, the public housing agency is unable 
to fulfill its contractual obligations with respect to those 
public housing units, that entity may deviate, under procedures 
and requirements developed through regulations by the 
Secretary, from otherwise applicable restrictions under this 
Act regarding rents, income eligibility, and other areas of 
public housing management with respect to a portion or all of 
those public housing units, to the extent necessary to preserve 
the viability of those units while maintaining the low-income 
character of the units, to the maximum extent practicable.''.

        States Housing Act of 1937, as amended by subsection 
        (a) of this section, shall be effective only with

        of 1937 is amended by adding at the end the following 
        new sentence:

        revitalization, density reduction, or achievement of a 
        broader range of household income; and
            (5) for which the estimated cost of continued 
        operation and modernization of the developments as 
        public housing exceeds the cost of providing tenant-
        based assistance under section 8 of the United States 
        Housing Act of 1937 for all families in occupancy, 
        based on appropriate indicators of cost (such as the

                developments for removal from the inventory of

                identify one or more public housing 
                developments which the Secretary determines 
                should have been identified under subsection 
                (a); or
                    (C) one or more of the developments 
                identified by the public housing agency 
                pursuant to subsection (a) should not, in the 
                determination of the Secretary, have been 
                identified under that subsection;
        the Secretary may designate the developments to be

                amounts provided to the agency which are 
                attributable pursuant to the formula for 
                allocating such assistance to the development 
                removed from the inventory of that agency; and

        (a), the Secretary may direct the public housing agency 
        to cease additional spending in connection with the

         public housing/section 8 moving to work demonstration


    Sec. 204. (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this demonstration 
is to give public housing agencies and the Secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development the flexibility to design and test 
various approaches for providing and administering housing 
assistance that: reduce cost and achieve greater cost 
effectiveness in Federal expenditures; give incentives to 
families with children where the head of household is working, 
seeking work, or is preparing for work by participating in job 
training, educational programs, or programs that assist people 
to obtain employment and become economically self-sufficient; 
and increase housing choices for low-income families.
    (b) Program Authority.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development shall conduct a demonstration program under this 
section beginning in fiscal year 1996 under which up to 30 
public housing agencies (including Indian housing authorities) 
administering the public or Indian housing program and the 
section 8 housing assistance payments program may be selected 
by the Secretary to participate. The Secretary shall provide 
training and technical assistance during the demonstration and 
conduct detailed evaluations of up to 15 such agencies in an 
effort to identify replicable program models promoting the 
purpose of the demonstration. Under the demonstration, 
notwithstanding any provision of the United States Housing Act 
of 1937 except as provided in subsection (e), an agency may 
combine operating assistance provided under section 9 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937, modernization assistance 
provided under section 14 of such Act, and assistance provided 
under section 8 of such Act for the certificate and voucher 
programs, to provide housing assistance for low-income 
families, as defined in section 3(b)(2) of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937, and services to facilitate the transition 
to work on such terms and conditions as the agency may propose 
and the Secretary may approve.
    (c) Application.--An application to participate in the 
demonstration--
            (1) shall request authority to combine assistance

            (3) shall include a plan developed by the agency 
        that takes into account comments from the public 
        hearing and any other public comments on the proposed 
        program, and comments from current and prospective 
        residents who would be affected, and that includes 
        criteria for--
                    (A) families to be assisted, which shall 
                require that at least 75 percent of the

                same total number of eligible low-income 
                families as would have been served had the 
                amounts not been combined;
                    (D) maintaining a comparable mix of 
                families (by family size) as would have been 
                provided had the amounts not been used under 
                the demonstration; and
                    (E) assuring that housing assisted under

Comprehensive Grant Program Allocations.--The amount of 
assistance received under section 8, section 9, or pursuant to

demonstration under this part shall not be diminished by its 
participation.

        reasonably necessary to disclose the amounts and the 
        disposition of amounts under this demonstration, to 
        ensure compliance with the requirements of this 
        section, and to measure performance.
            (2) Reports.--Each agency shall submit to the 
        Secretary a report, or series of reports, in a form and

                assisted activities in addressing the 
                objectives of this part.
            (3) Access to documents by the secretary.--The 
        Secretary shall have access for the purpose of audit

        records that are pertinent to assistance in connection 
        with, and the requirements of, this section.

                fha multifamily demonstration authority


    Sec. 210. (a) On and after October 1, 1995, and before 
October 1, 1997, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
shall initiate a demonstration program with respect to 
multifamily projects whose owners agree to participate and 
whose mortgages are insured under the National Housing Act and 
that are assisted under section 8 of the United States Housing 
Act of 1937 and whose present section 8 rents are, in the 
aggregate, in excess of the fair market rent of the locality in 
which the project is located. These programs shall be designed 
to test the feasibility and desirability of the goal of 
ensuring, to the maximum extent practicable, that the debt 
service and operating expenses, including adequate reserves, 
attributable to such multifamily projects can be supported with 
or without mortgage insurance under the National Housing Act 
and with or without above-market rents and utilizing project-
based assistance or, with the consent of the property owner, 
tenant-based assistance, while taking into account the need for 
assistance of low- and very low-income families in such 
projects. In carrying out this demonstration, the Secretary may 
use arrangements with third parties, under which the Secretary 
may provide for the assumption by the third parties (by 
delegation, contract, or otherwise) of some or all of the 
functions, obligations, and benefits of the Secretary.
            (1) Goals.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban 
        Development shall carry out the demonstration programs 
        under this section in a manner that--
                    (A) will protect the financial interests of 
                the Federal Government;
                    (B) will result in significant 
                discretionary cost savings through debt 
                restructuring and subsidy reduction; and
                    (C) will, in the least costly fashion, 
                address the goals of--
                            (i) maintaining existing housing 
                        stock in a decent, safe, and sanitary 
                        condition;
                            (ii) minimizing the involuntary 
                        displacement of tenants;
                            (iii) restructuring the mortgages 
                        of such projects in a manner that is 
                        consistent with local housing market 
                        conditions;
                            (iv) supporting fair housing 
                        strategies;
                            (v) minimizing any adverse income 
                        tax impact on property owners; and
                            (vi) minimizing any adverse impact 
                        on residential neighborhoods.
        In determining the manner in which a mortgage is to be 
        restructured or the subsidy reduced, the Secretary may 
        balance competing goals relating to individual projects 
        in a manner that will further the purposes of this 
        section.
            (2) Demonstration approaches.--In carrying out the 
        demonstration programs, subject to the appropriation in 
        subsection (f), the Secretary may use one or more of 
        the following approaches:
                    (A) Joint venture arrangements with third 
                parties, under which the Secretary may provide 
                for the assumption by the third parties (by 
                delegation, contract, or otherwise) of some or 
                all of the functions, obligations, and benefits 
                of the Secretary.

                           sense of congress


    It is the sense of the Congress that accounting for 
taxpayers' funds must be a top priority for all Federal 
agencies and Government corporations. The Congress is deeply 
concerned about the findings of the recent audit of the 
Corporation for National and Community Service required under 
the Government Corporation Control Act of 1945. The Congress 
urges the President to expeditiously nominate a qualified Chief 
Financial Officer for the Corporation. Further, to the maximum 
extent practicable and as quickly as possible, the Corporation 
should implement the recommendations of the independent 
auditors contracted for by the Corporation's Inspector General, 
as well as the Chief Financial Officer, to improve the 
financial management of taxpayers' funds. Should the Chief 
Financial Officer determine that additional resources are 
needed to implement these recommendations, the Corporation 
should submit a reprogramming proposal for up to $3,000,000 to 
carry out reforms of the financial management system.

assessment and collection of fees to be assessed and collected 
beginning in fiscal year 1996 applicable to persons subject to 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency's radiological

assessed pursuant to this section during fiscal year 1996 shall 
approximate, but not be less than, 100 per centum of the 
amounts anticipated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency

reflect the full amount of costs of providing radiological 
emergency planning, preparedness, response and associated 
services. Such fees will be assessed in a manner that reflects 
the use of agency resources for classes of regulated persons 
and the administrative costs of collecting such fees. Fees 
received pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the 
general fund of the Treasury as offsetting receipts. Assessment 
and collection of such fees are only authorized during fiscal 
year 1996.

person except as consistent with this section.
    (b) Russian HEU.--(1) On or before December 31, 1996, the 
United States Executive Agent under the Russian HEU Agreement 
shall transfer to the Secretary without charge title to an 
amount of uranium hexafluoride equivalent to the natural 
uranium component of low-enriched uranium derived from at least 
18 metric tons of highly enriched uranium purchased from the 
Russian Executive Agent under the Russian HEU Agreement. The 
quantity of such uranium hexafluoride delivered to the 
Secretary shall be based on a tails assay of 0.30 U\235\. 
Uranium hexafluoride transferred to the Secretary pursuant to 
this paragraph shall be deemed under United States law for all 
purposes to be of Russian origin.
    (2) Within 7 years of the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary shall sell, and receive payment for, the uranium 
hexafluoride transferred to the Secretary pursuant to paragraph 
(1). Such uranium hexafluoride shall be sold--
            (A) at any time for use in the United States for

Executive Agent, or upon request of the Russian Executive 
Agent, then the United States Executive Agent shall engage an 
independent entity through a competitive selection process to 
auction an amount of uranium hexafluoride or U3O8 (in 
the event that the conversion component of such hexafluoride 
has previously been sold) equivalent to the natural uranium 
component of such low-enriched uranium. An agreement executed 
pursuant to a request of the Russian Executive Agent, as 
contemplated in this paragraph, may pertain to any deliveries 
due during any period remaining under the Russian HEU 
Agreement. Such independent entity shall sell such uranium 
hexafluoride in one or more lots to any person or entity to 
maximize the proceeds from such sales, for disposition 
consistent with the limitations set forth in this subsection. 
The independent entity shall pay to the Russian Executive Agent 
the proceeds of any such auction less all reasonable 
transaction and other administrative costs. The quantity of 
such uranium hexafluoride auctioned shall be based on a tails 
assay of 0.30 U\235\. Title to uranium hexafluoride auctioned 
pursuant to this paragraph shall transfer to the buyer of such 
material upon delivery of such material to the buyer. Uranium 
hexafluoride auctioned pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
deemed under United States law for all purposes to be of

    (b) New Principal Amounts.--
            (1) Principal amount.--Effective October 1, 1996, 
        an old capital investment has a new principal amount 
        that is the sum of--
                    (A) the present value of the old payment 
                amounts for the old capital investment, 
                calculated using a discount rate equal to the 
                Treasury rate for the old capital investment; 
                and
                    (B) an amount equal to $100,000,000 
                multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the 
                principal amount of the old payment amounts for 
                the old capital investment and whose 
                denominator is the sum of the principal amounts 
                of the old payment amounts for all old capital 
                investments.
            (2) Determination.--With the approval of the 
        Secretary of the Treasury based solely on consistency 
        with this section, the Administrator shall determine 
        the new principal amounts under subsection (b) and the 
        assignment of interest rates to the new principal 
        amounts under subsection (c).
            (3) Old payment amounts.--For the purposes of this 
        subsection, ``old payment amounts'' means, for an old 
        capital investment, the annual interest and principal 
        that the Administrator would have paid to the United 
        States Treasury from October 1, 1996, if this section 
        had not been enacted, assuming that--
                    (A) the principal were repaid--
                            (i) on the repayment date the 
                        Administrator assigned before October 
                        1, 1994, to the old capital investment, 
                        or
                            (ii) with respect to an old capital 
                        investment for which the Administrator 
                        has not assigned a repayment date 
                        before October 1, 1994, on a repayment 
                        date the Administrator shall assign to 
                        the old capital investment in 
                        accordance with paragraph 10(d)(1) of 
                        the version of Department of Energy

                        1994; and
                    (B) interest were paid--
                            (i) at the interest rate the 
                        Administrator assigned before October 
                        1, 1994, to the old capital investment, 
                        or
                            (ii) with respect to an old capital 
                        investment for which the Administrator 
                        has not assigned an interest rate 
                        before October 1, 1994, at a rate 
                        determined by the Secretary of the 
                        Treasury, taking into consideration 
                        prevailing market yields, during the 
                        month preceding the beginning of the 
                        fiscal year in which the related 
                        project, facility, or separable unit or 
                        feature is placed in service, on 
                        outstanding interest-bearing 
                        obligations of the United States with 
                        periods to maturity comparable to the 
                        period between the beginning of the 
                        fiscal year and the repayment date for 
                        the old capital investment.
    (c) Interest Rate for New Principal Amounts.--
            As of October 1, 1996, the unpaid balance on the 
        new principal amount established for an old capital 
        investment under subsection (b) bears interest annually 
        at the Treasury rate for the old capital investment 
        until the earlier of the date that the new principal 
        amount is repaid or the repayment date for the new 
        principal amount.
    (d) Repayment Dates.--
            As of October 1, 1996, the repayment date for the 
        new principal amount established for an old capital 
        investment under subsection (b) is no earlier than the 
        repayment date for the old capital investment assumed 
        in subsection (b)(3)(A).
    (e) Prepayment Limitations.--
            During the period October 1, 1996, through 
        September 30, 2001, the total new principal amounts of 
        old capital investments, as established under 
        subsection (b), that the Administrator may pay before 
        their respective repayment dates shall not exceed 
        $100,000,000.
    (f) Interest Rates for New Capital Investments During 
Construction.--
            (1) New capital investment.--The principal amount

        to the one-year rate for the fiscal year on the sum 
        of--
                    (A) construction expenditures that were 
                made from the date construction commenced 
                through the end of the fiscal year, and

        the United States with periods to maturity of 
        approximately one year.
    (g) Interest Rates for New Capital Investments.--
            The unpaid balance on the principal amount of a new 
        capital investment bears interest at the Treasury rate

                the appropriate interest account in the amount 
                of the payment at the time the payment is 
                tendered;
            (2) apart from charges necessary to repay the new 
        principal amount of an old capital investment as 
        established under subsection (b) and to pay the 
        interest on the principal amount under subsection (c),

                under applicable law, including section 7(g) of

                      DEBT COLLECTION IMPROVEMENTS

SEC. 31001. DEBT COLLECTION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1996.

    (a)(1) This section may be cited as the ``Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996''.
    (2)(A) In General.--The provisions of this section and the 
amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date 
of the enactment of this Act.
    (B) Offsets From Social Security Payments, Etc.--
Subparagraph (A) of section 3716(c)(3) of title 31, United 
States Code (as added by subsection (d)(2) of this section), 
shall apply only to payments made after the date which is 4 
months after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (b) The purposes of this section are the following:
            (1) To maximize collections of delinquent debts 
        owed to the Government by ensuring quick action to 
        enforce recovery of debts and the use of all 
        appropriate collection tools.
            (2) To minimize the costs of debt collection by 
        consolidating related functions and activities and 
        utilizing interagency teams.
            (3) To reduce losses arising from debt management 
        activities by requiring proper screening of potential 
        borrowers, aggressive monitoring of all accounts, and 
        sharing of information within and among Federal 
        agencies.
            (4) To ensure that the public is fully informed of 
        the Federal Government's debt collection policies and 
        that debtors are cognizant of their financial 
        obligations to repay amounts owed to the Federal 
        Government.
            (5) To ensure that debtors have all appropriate due 
        process rights, including the ability to verify, 
        challenge, and compromise claims, and access to 
        administrative appeals procedures which are both 
        reasonable and protect the interests of the United 
        States.
            (6) To encourage agencies, when appropriate, to 
        sell delinquent debt, particularly debts with 
        underlying collateral.
            (7) To rely on the experience and expertise of 
        private sector professionals to provide debt collection 
        services to Federal agencies.
    (c) Chapter 37 of title 31, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) in each of sections 3711, 3716, 3717, and 3718, 
        by striking ``the head of an executive or legislative 
        agency'' each place it appears and inserting ``the head 
        of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency''; and
            (2) by amending section 3701(a)(4) to read as 
        follows:
            ``(4) `executive, judicial, or legislative agency' 
        means a department, agency, court, court administrative 
        office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, 
        or legislative branch of Government, including 
        government corporations.''.
    (d)(1) Persons Subject to Administrative Offset.--Section 
3701(c) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to read as 
follows:
    ``(c) In sections 3716 and 3717 of this title, the term 
`person' does not include an agency of the United States 
Government.''.
    (2) Requirements and Procedures.--Section 3716 of title 31, 
United States Code, is amended--
            (A) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
    ``(b) Before collecting a claim by administrative offset, 
the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency must 
either--
            ``(1) adopt, without change, regulations on 
        collecting by administrative offset promulgated by the 
        Department of Justice, the General Accounting Office, 
        or the Department of the Treasury; or
            ``(2) prescribe regulations on collecting by 
        administrative offset consistent with the regulations 
        referred to in paragraph (1).'';
            (B) by amending subsection (c)(2) to read as 
        follows:
            ``(2) when a statute explicitly prohibits using 
        administrative offset or setoff to collect the claim or 
        type of claim involved.'';
            (C) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection 
        (e); and
            (D) by inserting after subsection (b) the following 
        new subsections:
    ``(c)(1)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this 
subsection, a disbursing official of the Department of the 
Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal 
Service, or any other government corporation, or any disbursing 
official of the United States designated by the Secretary of 
the Treasury, shall offset at least annually the amount of a 
payment which a payment certifying agency has certified to the 
disbursing official for disbursement, by an amount equal to the 
amount of a claim which a creditor agency has certified to the 
Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection.
    ``(B) An agency that designates disbursing officials 
pursuant to section 3321(c) of this title is not required to 
certify claims arising out of its operations to the Secretary 
of the Treasury before such agency's disbursing officials 
offset such claims.
    ``(C) Payments certified by the Department of Education 
under a program administered by the Secretary of Education 
under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall not be 
subject to administrative offset under this subsection.
    ``(2) Neither the disbursing official nor the payment 
certifying agency shall be liable--
            ``(A) for the amount of the administrative offset 
        on the basis that the underlying obligation, 
        represented by the payment before the administrative 
        offset was taken, was not satisfied; or
            ``(B) for failure to provide timely notice under 
        paragraph (8).
    ``(3)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law 
(including sections 207 and 1631(d)(1) of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 407 and 1383(d)(1)), section 413(b) of Public 
Law 91-173 (30 U.S.C. 923(b)), and section 14 of the Act of 
August 29, 1935 (45 U.S.C. 231m)), except as provided in clause 
(ii), all payments due to an individual under--
            ``(I) the Social Security Act,
            ``(II) part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act, or
            ``(III) any law administered by the Railroad 
        Retirement Board (other than payments that such Board 
        determines to be tier 2 benefits),
shall be subject to offset under this section.
    ``(ii) An amount of $9,000 which a debtor may receive under 
Federal benefit programs cited under clause (i) within a 12-
month period shall be exempt from offset under this subsection. 
In applying the $9,000 exemption, the disbursing official 
shall--
            ``(I) reduce the $9,000 exemption amount for the 
        12-month period by the amount of all Federal benefit 
        payments made during such 12-month period which are not 
        subject to offset under this subsection; and
            ``(II) apply a prorated amount of the exemption to 
        each periodic benefit payment to be made to the debtor 
        during the applicable 12-month period.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of a 
periodic benefit payment shall be the amount after any 
reduction or deduction required under the laws authorizing the 
program under which such payment is authorized to be made 
(including any reduction or deduction to recover any 
overpayment under such program).
    ``(B) The Secretary of the Treasury shall exempt from 
administrative offset under this subsection payments under 
means-tested programs when requested by the head of the 
respective agency. The Secretary may exempt other payments from 
administrative offset under this subsection upon the written 
request of the head of a payment certifying agency. A written 
request for exemption of other payments must provide 
justification for the exemption under standards prescribed by 
the Secretary. Such standards shall give due consideration to 
whether administrative offset would tend to interfere 
substantially with or defeat the purposes of the payment 
certifying agency's program. The Secretary shall report to the 
Congress annually on exemptions granted under this section.
    ``(C) The provisions of sections 205(b)(1) and 1631(c)(1) 
of the Social Security Act shall not apply to any 
administrative offset executed pursuant to this section against 
benefits authorized by either title II or title XVI of the 
Social Security Act, respectively.
    ``(4) The Secretary of the Treasury may charge a fee 
sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing this 
subsection. The fee may be collected either by the retention of 
a portion of amounts collected pursuant to this subsection, or 
by billing the agency referring or transferring a claim for 
those amounts. Fees charged to the agencies shall be based on 
actual administrative offsets completed. Amounts received by 
the United States as fees under this subsection shall be 
deposited into the account of the Department of the Treasury 
under section 3711(g)(7) of this title, and shall be collected 
and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of that 
section.
    ``(5) The Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with 
the Commissioner of Social Security and the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, may prescribe such rules, 
regulations, and procedures as the Secretary of the Treasury 
considers necessary to carry out this subsection. The Secretary 
shall consult with the heads of affected agencies in the 
development of such rules, regulations, and procedures.
    ``(6) Any Federal agency that is owed by a person a past 
due, legally enforceable nontax debt that is over 180 days 
delinquent, including nontax debt administered by a third party 
acting as an agent for the Federal Government, shall notify the 
Secretary of the Treasury of all such nontax debts for purposes 
of administrative offset under this subsection.
    ``(7)(A) The disbursing official conducting an 
administrative offset with respect to a payment to a payee 
shall notify the payee in writing of--
            ``(i) the occurrence of the administrative offset 
        to satisfy a past due legally enforceable debt, 
        including a description of the type and amount of the 
        payment otherwise payable to the payee against which 
        the offset was executed;
            ``(ii) the identity of the creditor agency 
        requesting the offset; and
            ``(iii) a contact point within the creditor agency 
        that will handle concerns regarding the offset.
    ``(B) If the payment to be offset is a periodic benefit 
payment, the disbursing official shall take reasonable steps, 
as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide the 
notice to the payee not later than the date on which the payee 
is otherwise scheduled to receive the payment, or as soon as 
practical thereafter, but no later than the date of the 
administrative offset. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, 
the failure of the debtor to receive such notice shall not 
impair the legality of such administrative offset.
    ``(8) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
shall take precedence over requests for administrative offset 
pursuant to other laws.
    ``(d) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the 
use of any other administrative offset authority existing under 
statute or common law.''.
    (3) Nontax Debt or Claim Defined.--Section 3701 of title 
31, United States Code, is amended in subsection (a) by adding 
at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(8) `nontax' means, with respect to any debt or 
        claim, any debt or claim other than a debt or claim 
        under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.''.
    (4) Treasury Check Withholding.--Section 3712 of title 31, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(e) Treasury Check Offset.--
            ``(1) In general.--To facilitate collection of 
        amounts owed by presenting banks pursuant to subsection 
        (a) or (b), upon the direction of the Secretary, a 
        Federal reserve bank shall withhold credit from banks 
        presenting Treasury checks for ultimate charge to the 
        account of the United States Treasury. By presenting 
        Treasury checks for payment a presenting bank is deemed 
        to authorize this offset.
            ``(2) Attempt to collect required.--Prior to 
        directing offset under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary 
        shall first attempt to collect amounts owed in the 
        manner provided by sections 3711 and 3716.''.
    (e) Section 3716 of title 31, United States Code, as 
amended by subsection (d)(2) of this section, is further 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:
    ``(f) The Secretary may waive the requirements of sections 
552a(o) and (p) of title 5 for administrative offset or claims 
collection upon written certification by the head of a State or 
an executive, judicial, or legislative agency seeking to 
collect the claim that the requirements of subsection (a) of 
this section have been met.
    ``(g) The Data Integrity Board of the Department of the 
Treasury established under 552a(u) of title 5 shall review and 
include in reports under paragraph (3)(D) of that section a 
description of any matching activities conducted under this 
section. If the Secretary has granted a waiver under subsection 
(f) of this section, no other Data Integrity Board is required 
to take any action under section 552a(u) of title 5.''.
    (f) Section 3716 of title 31, United States Code, as 
amended by subsections (d) and (e) of this section, is further 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(h)(1) The Secretary may, in the discretion of the 
Secretary, apply subsection (a) with respect to any past-due, 
legally-enforceable debt owed to a State if--
            ``(A) the appropriate State disbursing official 
        requests that an offset be performed; and
            ``(B) a reciprocal agreement with the State is in 
        effect which contains, at a minimum--
                    ``(i) requirements substantially equivalent 
                to subsection (b) of this section; and
                    ``(ii) any other requirements which the 
                Secretary considers appropriate to facilitate 
                the offset and prevent duplicative efforts.
    ``(2) This subsection does not apply to--
            ``(A) the collection of a debt or claim on which 
        the administrative costs associated with the collection 
        of the debt or claim exceed the amount of the debt or

        payment exempted by the Secretary of the Treasury at 
        the request of a Federal agency.
    ``(3) In applying this section with respect to any debt 
owed to a State, subsection (c)(3)(A) shall not apply.''.
    (g)(1) Title 31.--Title 31, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (A) in section 3322(a), by inserting ``section 3716 
        and section 3720A of this title and'' after ``Except as

amended--
            (A) in subsection (a)--
                    (i) by adding at the end of paragraph (1) 
                the following: ``All Federal agencies to which 
                debts are owed and which have outstanding 
                delinquent debts shall participate in a 
                computer match at least annually of their 
                delinquent debt records with records of Federal 
                employees to identify those employees who are 
                delinquent in repayment of those debts. The 
                preceding sentence shall not apply to any debt 
                under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
                Matched Federal employee records shall include, 
                but shall not be limited to, records of active 
                Civil Service employees government-wide,

        modifications to the standard or policy; and
            (4) report annually to the Congress on--
                    (A) deficiencies in the standards and

                indebtedness; and

       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing vote of the two Houses on the 
amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3019) making 
appropriations for fiscal year 1996 to make a further 
downpayment toward a balanced budget, and for other purposes, 
submit the following joint statement to the House and the 
Senate in explanation of the effects of the action agreed upon 
by the managers and recommended in the accompanying report.
      Report language included by the Senate in the report 
accompanying S. 1594 (S. Rept. 104-236) which is not changed by 
the conference are approved by the committee of conference. The 
statement of the managers while repeating some report language 
for emphasis, is not intended to negate the language referred 
to above unless expressly provided herein.

                    TITLE I--OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS

DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED 
                                AGENCIES

      Section 101(a). The text of the language included under 
section 101(a) of this conference agreement represents the 
final agreement on appropriations for the Departments of 
Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related 
Agencies for fiscal year 1996, with the exception of those 
Department of Justice General Provisions that were enacted into 
law in Public Law 104-99. It marks the end of the process that 
began with H.R. 2076, reported by the House Committee on 
Appropriations (H. Rept. 104-196) on July 19, 1995, and passed 
by the House on July 26, 1995. The bill was then reported by 
the Senate Committee on Appropriations (S. Rept. 104-139) on 
September 12, 1995, and passed by the Senate on September 29, 
1995. The conference report (H. Rept. 104-378, star print) was 
filed on December 1, 1995, and adopted in the House on December 
6, 1995, and in the Senate on December 7, 1995. The President 
vetoed the bill on December 19, 1995, and on January 3, 1996, 
although a majority of the House voted for the conference 
report, the House did not override the veto by the required 
two-thirds vote. Since that time, funding for many of the 
programs in this bill has been provided on a temporary basis, 
although a number of critical law enforcement, judicial, 
consular, diplomatic security, and small business programs were 
provided full-year spending authority. While this conference 
agreement includes the full text of the fiscal year 1996 
Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related 
Agencies appropriations bill, with the exception noted above, 
much of the language is identical to the language included in 
the conference report on H.R. 2076. As a result, only the 
changes from the conference report on H.R. 2076 are addressed 
in the statement of managers that follows. With the exceptions 
that follow, the statement of managers in the conference report 
on H.R. 2076 (H. Rept. 104-378, star print) and the applicable 
portions of the House and Senate reports on H.R. 2076, remain 
controlling and are incorporated by reference.

                         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

                         General Administration

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $74,282,000 for General 
Administration, as provided in both the House and Senate bills. 
The conference agreement also includes a provision that 
modifies the language, proposed in the House bill and not 
included in the Senate bill, that limits the number of 
positions and amounts for the Department Leadership program. 
The conference agreement does not limit funding under the 
Department Leadership program to the Offices of the Attorney 
General and the Deputy Attorney General, as proposed in the 
House bill. The Senate bill did not include this provision.

                         counterterrorism fund

      The conference agreement includes $16,898,000 for the 
Counterterrorism Fund, as provided in both the House and Senate 
bills. The conferees understand that balances of $24,445,000 
remain available from the 1995 Supplemental Appropriation, 
Public Law 104-19, for authorized purposes of this Fund. The 
Senate bill included a provision in Title III which designated 
$7,000,000 for emergency expenses to enhance Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) efforts in the United States to combat 
Middle Eastern terrorism, including efforts to prevent 
fundraising in the United States on the behalf of organizations 
that support terrorism to undermine the peace process. These 
funds would have been available only pursuant to an official 
budget request that declares the funds to be an emergency.
      The conferees support the purposes set forth in the 
Senate amendment. However, the conferees have not included the 
emergency appropriation for the FBI proposed by the Senate 
because the conferees were informed that the Department of 
Justice did not plan to submit an emergency request for funding 
as required by the Senate bill and the Department of Justice 
currently has sufficient funding available to enhance the FBI's 
efforts to combat the flow of dollars to support Middle Eastern 
terrorism. The conferees note that there are funding balances 
available in the Department of Justice Counterterrorism Fund 
which can be applied to this effort. Accordingly, the Attorney 
General is directed to submit a proposal by May 15, 1996 to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations to reprogram no 
less than $4,000,000 in funds from the Counterterrorism Fund to 
enable the FBI to carry out enhanced efforts in the United 
States to combat Middle Eastern terrorism, and specifically to 
enhance FBI efforts to prevent fundraising on behalf of 
organizations that promote terrorism.

                            Legal Activities

         salaries and expenses, united states marshals service

      The conferees are concerned about growing detention needs 
identified by the Marshals Service in many areas of the 
country. The conferees understand that the General Services 
Administration is planning a shared-use detention facility 
adjacent to the new courthouse in Portland, Oregon, and expect 
the Department of Justice to fully cooperate in this planning 
effort.

           salaries and expenses, community relations service

      The conference agreement provides $5,319,000 for the 
Community Relations Service (CRS) as proposed by both the House 
and Senate. The conferees have also agreed to include a 
provision added by the Senate, which allows the transfer of 
additional amounts, pursuant to reprogramming requirements 
under section 605, if the Attorney General determines that 
emergent circumstances require additional funding for conflict 
prevention and resolution activities. The language included in 
the Senate bill has been modified to assure that the transfer 
will not be subject to limitations that apply to other 
Department of Justice transfers.

                    Federal Bureau of Investigation

                         salaries and expenses

                     (including transfer of funds)

      The conference agreement includes $2,407,483,000 as 
proposed by both the House and Senate. Of the amount in the 
House and Senate bills, $9,500,000 was provided for the FBI to 
purchase DNA equipment for State and local forensic 
laboratories. The conferees have agreed to expand the allowed 
use of these funds, and make up to the full $9,500,000 
available for a new State Identification Grants project which 
would allow States to purchase computerized identification 
systems that are compatible and integrated with the National 
Crime Information Center and the Integrated Automated 
Fingerprint Identification Systems of the FBI. Funds would only 
be available for this new purpose upon enactment of an 
authorization. The Senate bill, in section 118, included the 
authorization and funding for this program. The House bill did 
not contain a provision on this matter.
      The conferees have also included a technical change to 
clarify that funds provided for the Department of Justice 
Working Capital Fund to support the NCIC 2000 project are in 
addition to funds provided under this heading.

                    Drug Enforcement Administration

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $810,168,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA) as proposed by the Senate, instead of $805,688,000 as 
proposed by the House. The additional funds are to support 
DEA's enforcement activities on the Southwest border and in 
rural communities.

                 Immigration and Naturalization Service

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes a technical change to 
amounts made available through fiscal year 1997, to reflect a 
bipartisan, bicameral agreement with the Administration on INS 
training and hiring priorities for fiscal year 1996, as 
proposed by both the House and Senate bills. The conference 
agreement also corrects a technical error in the amounts 
allocated under the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, as 
proposed by both the House and Senate bills.
      Realignment of Border Patrol positions from interior 
stations.--The conferees are concerned with the manner in which 
INS is developing its plan to realign Border Patrol positions 
from the interior to the front lines of the border. In an 
effort to balance the goal of the Congress to add 1,000 Border 
Patrol agents to the front lines of the border and the concerns 
of the Department of Justice and INS over the ability to hire 
and train a growing workforce of inexperienced agents, the 
Committees provided resources for 800 new Border Patrol agents 
and the realignment of 200 Border Patrol agent positions from 
interior locations to the front lines of the border. On 
February 1, 1996, the Committees provided guidance to the 
Department of Justice on how INS should implement this 
realignment. Specifically, the Committee directed that any 
agent redeployment to the border should not create a void in 
the INS enforcement presence in interior locations and that the 
backfill plan for affected interior posts should include the 
following considerations: (1) personnel/relocation issues of 
agents currently occupying interior positions; (2) the 
appropriate mix of personnel required to maintain the current 
functions and activities in interior locations; and (3) the 
number of INS personnel in interior locations should be 
maintained unless local law enforcement and other elected 
officials have had an opportunity to review and comment on any 
proposed reduction in personnel at any of these posts. The 
conferees are aware that there is concern in some communities 
about the potential effect of removing a uniformed presence of 
immigration officers from these locations. The conferees 
recognize that in some interior stations, particularly those 
located in Southwest border States, the ``mix'' of personnel 
should not be limited to INS officers, but should be comprised 
of a balanced mix of both Border Patrol agents and INS 
officers, with each carrying out the functions for which they 
are trained. The conferees therefore direct INS to adjust any 
preliminary plans to realign all Border Patrol agent positions 
from any one interior location to address the need to continue 
the functions and activities at current levels that require 
uniformed Border Patrol agents. Furthermore, the conferees 
expect INS to submit a redeployment plan that addresses these 
concerns for approval by the Committees on Appropriations of 
both the House and Senate by May 15, 1996.

                         Federal Prison System

                         salaries and expenses

      The conferees are aware of a recent report issued by the 
National Institute of Corrections (NIC) which identifies 
serious problems with regard to the District of Columbia 
Department of Corrections operation of and facilities located 
at the Lorton Correctional Complex. Pursuant to the relevant 
section of the District of Columbia Appropriations Chapter, the 
conferees direct that the Bureau of Prisons spend $200,000 of 
the amount provided for the NIC to do a study, on behalf of the 
District of Columbia, for alternatives to correct the problems 
identified in the recent NIC report. The conferees direct that 
this plan be completed by December 31, 1996 and forwarded to 
the President, Congress, and the District of Columbia Financial 
Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority.

                       Office of Justice Programs

               state and local law enforcement assistance

              violent crime reduction trust fund programs

      Local Law Enforcement Block Grant.--The conference 
agreement includes $503,000,000 for the Local Law Enforcement 
Block Grant program, instead of $1,903,000,000 as proposed by 
the House and $783,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of this 
amount, the conference agreement provides $11,000,000 for the 
Boys and Girls Clubs of America, $15,000,000 for the 
Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. and up to 
$18,000,000 for drug courts subject to the reprogramming 
requirement in section 605. The Senate bill included 
$20,000,000 for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, 
$20,000,000 for the Metropolitan Police Department in 
Washington, D.C. and $25,000,000 for drug courts. The House 
bill did not include separate earmarks for these programs.
      As proposed in both bills, the conference agreement 
provides that the funding will be distributed to local 
governments under the allocation and purposes set forth in H.R. 
728, as passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 
1995, with some modifications included in the conference report 
on H.R. 2076. The conferees have added language to recognize 
Puerto Rico as a unit of local government for the purpose of 
allocation of these funds and have added language prohibiting 
the use of grants awarded under the block grant as matching 
funds for any other Federal grant program.
      The conferees have also agreed that the funding provided 
under the block grant for Boys and Girls Clubs of America is 
made available for the same purposes and in the same manner as 
funds appropriated under previous appropriations acts for the 
Department of Justice and will continue to be matched at no 
less than the same ratio to private sector funds for the 
establishment of new Boys and Girls Clubs. The conferees expect 
that this funding will provide at least 100 new Boys and Girls 
Clubs to serve up to 100,000 children throughout the United 
States.
      In addition, the conferees are aware of the negative 
impact that the financial crisis in the Nation's Capital has 
had on the Metropolitan Police Department's ability to 
effectively fight crime and have provided $15,000,000 
specifically for this purpose, in lieu of any funds that would 
have been available under the formula allocation of the block 
grant. This is of great concern to the citizens of the city, 
the Mayor, the District Council, the D.C. Financial 
Responsibility Authority and the Congress. The amounts provided 
are intended to support the priorities identified by the Chief 
of Police to supplement budgeted amounts for the MPD as part of 
a long-range strategy. The conferees agree that the allocation 
of these funds is to be made by the Chief of Police, after 
appropriate consultation with the Committees on Appropriations 
and the Committees on Judiciary of both the House and Senate. 
The conferees have included language requiring that these 
funds, as other Federal funds appropriated to the District, are 
to be held by the Control Authority and allocated to the MPD by 
the Authority, based on compliance with the Chief of Police's 
plan.
      The conference agreement does not include $80,000,000 for 
the Crime Prevention Block Grant program authorized in Subtitle 
B of title III of the 1994 Crime Bill, as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill did not include funding for this 
program.

                  Community Oriented Policing Services

              violent crime reduction trust fund programs

      The conference agreement includes $1,400,000,000 for 
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), instead of 
$975,000,000 as proposed by the Senate and no funding for this 
program as proposed by the House. Of the amount provided, 
$10,000,000 is included for the Police Corps program. The 
conferees have also included a technical change referencing the 
authorizations for the Police Corps program under the 1994 
Crime Bill, as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees agree that the funding provided should be 
used for the purpose of providing grants which will yield at 
least 19,000 additional police officers on the street in order 
to reach the goal of 100,000 additional police officers by the 
year 2000 which will require similar funding levels in fiscal 
years 1997 through 1999 with the balance to be funded in the 
year 2000. The conferees note that with this funding, two years 
into the six-year Community Policing program, at least 45,000 
police will have been hired. A clear path to achieving the 
mutual objective of putting more police on the street has been 
established. In addition, the conferees have provided 
$503,000,000 for the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant that 
should provide for even more police being hired at an even 
faster pace.
      The conferees agree that the primary objective of COPS 
funding is to hire new police officers in the most cost-
effective manner possible. The conferees direct that, from this 
point forward, the COPS office use grant funds to the maximum 
extent possible to hire more police, and should not use these 
funds for non-hiring projects. Funding for these purposes, such 
as equipment, training and overtime, is available to localities 
through the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant and need not be 
duplicated under this program. The conferees have also included 
language that limits the amount spent on program management and 
administration to 130 positions and $14,602,000.

               General Provisions--Department of Justice

      The conference agreement includes the following General 
Provisions for the Department of Justice that were not enacted 
into law under Public Law 104-99. The conferees have also 
included language under section 616 to reinforce that the 
General Provisions for the Department of Justice enacted under 
section 211 of Public Law 104-99 shall continue to remain in 
effect. A Department of Justice legal opinion dated February 
27, 1996, states that all the General Provisions for the 
Department of Justice included in the conference report on H.R. 
2076, with the exception of section 114, were enacted into law 
under Public Law 104-99 on January 26, 1996. The Senate bill 
repeated all general provisions, except for sections 116 
through 119 which were permanent changes to law, and the House 
bill did not include any of the general provisions with the 
exception of section 114.
      The conferees note that under section 106, which is 
currently enacted in law, the Department of Justice was 
provided the authority to spend up to $10,000,000 for rewards 
for information regarding acts of terrorism against the United 
States. The conferees agree that the Attorney General, before 
making any international reward, should continue to consult and 
coordinate with the Secretary of State.
      Sec. 114.--The conferees have agreed to include section 
114 and have revised the language proposed in the House and 
Senate bills which authorizes a new Violent Offender 
Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants program 
to replace the program currently authorized in Title II of the 
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The 
House bill included the revised Violent Offender Incarceration 
and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants program as passed in 
the conference report on H.R. 2076. The Senate bill included a 
revision to the language included in the conference report on 
H.R. 2076.
      As provided in both the House and Senate bills, the 
conference agreement includes $617,500,000 under the Violent 
Crime Reduction Programs for State and Local Law Enforcement 
Assistance for this provision. Of the funds provided, and after 
amounts allocated for incarceration for criminal aliens, the 
Cooperative Agreement Program and incarceration of Indians on 
Tribal lands, $403,875,000 is available for State Prison Grants 
and the administration of this program.
      The conferees agree that the Violent Offender 
Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants program 
should reward and provide an incentive to States that are 
taking the necessary steps to keep violent criminals off the 
streets. The conferees further agree that the program currently 
authorized in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
of 1994 fails to provide an adequate incentive for States to 
adopt tougher sentencing policies. The conferees are also 
concerned that sufficient seed money to States is needed to 
encourage States to adopt truth-in-sentencing. Thus, of the 
amount available, the conferees have agreed that 50 percent 
would be set aside for Truth-in-Sentencing Grants and the 
remaining 50 percent would be distributed as General Grants to 
all states that qualify. Under the revised language, States 
would no longer be forced to choose between mutually exclusive 
grant programs. States qualifying for Truth-in-Sentencing 
Grants would receive those funds in addition to any General 
Grant funds they are eligible to receive. The conferees further 
intend that in the future the percentage of prison grant funds 
dedicated to General Grants should decline in order to provide 
a greater incentive for States to adopt truth-in-sentencing 
policies.
      The conferees have therefore adopted language that 
provides that all States that provide assurances to the 
Attorney General that the State has implemented, or will 
implement, correctional policies and programs that (a) ensure 
that violent offenders serve a substantial portion of the 
sentences imposed; (b) are designed to provide sufficiently 
severe punishment for violent offenders, including violent 
juvenile offenders; and (c) ensure that the prison time served 
is appropriately related to the determination that the inmate 
is a violent offender and for a period of time deemed necessary 
to protect the public, will receive ``seed'' funding to 
increase their capacity of prison space. A State will receive 
additional funding from General Grants if the State can 
demonstrate that, in addition to the above assurances, the 
State has (a) increased the number of persons sentenced to 
prison who have been arrested for violent crimes; or (b) 
increased the sentences of persons convicted of violent crimes 
or the average prison time actually served; or (c) increased by 
over 10 percent over the last three years the number of persons 
sent to prison for committing violent crime.
    A State will be eligible to receive a Truth-in-Sentencing 
Grant in addition to General Grant funding it is eligible for, 
if the State has adopted truth-in-sentencing laws which require 
persons sentenced to prisons for violent crimes to serve at 
least 85 percent of their sentence. In addition, if a State 
practices indeterminate sentencing, that is, a State in which 
the sentence imposed by the court may involve a range of 
imprisonment, it may be eligible to receive a Truth-in-
Sentencing Grant if (1) the State has ``sentencing and release 
guidelines'' (which refers to guidelines that by law are 
utilized both by courts for guidance in imposing a sentence and 
by parole release authorities in establishing a presumptive 
release date when the offender has entered prison) and violent 
offenders serve on average not less than 85 percent of the 
period to the presumptive release date prescribed by these 
guidelines, or (2) the State demonstrates that violent 
offenders serve on average not less than 85 percent of the 
maximum prison term allowed under the sentence imposed by the 
court.
      The revised language included in this section authorizes 
$10,267,600,000 for fiscal years 1996 through 2000 for States 
to build or expand correctional facilities for the purpose of 
incapacitating criminals convicted of part I violent crimes, or 
persons adjudicated delinquent for an act which if committed by 
an adult, would be a part I violent crime. It does not allow 
funds to be used to operate prisons as provided in the current 
program and it requires a ten percent match by the State 
instead of a 25 percent match as included in the current 
program. The conferees agree that in developing criteria for 
determining the eligibility for funding to build or expand 
bedspace, the Department of Justice should include a 
requirement that States demonstrate the ability to fully 
support, operate and maintain the prison for which the State is 
seeking construction funds.
      Other provisions of the new authorization require that 
States share up to 15 percent of the funds received with 
counties and other units of local government for the 
construction and expansion of correctional facilities, 
including jails, to the extent that such units of local 
government house state prisoners due to States carrying out the 
policies of the Act. In addition, under exigent circumstances, 
States may also use fundsto expand juvenile correctional 
facilities, including pretrial detention facilities and juvenile boot 
camps. In order to be eligible for grants, States are also required to 
implement policies that provide for the recognition of the rights and 
needs of crime victims.
      In addition, of the total amount provided, $200,000,000 
is available for payments to States for the incarceration of 
criminal aliens. The conferees intend that this funding should 
be merged with and administered under the State Criminal Alien 
Assistance Program (SCAAP), including the normal authority to 
utilize up to one percent of the funds for administrative 
purposes. The conferees expect the Department of Justice to 
provide these funds to eligible States in a timely manner.
      Sec. 120.--The conference agreement includes a new 
general provision, as proposed by the Senate as section 116, 
which extends the Department of Justice's pilot debt collection 
project through September 30, 1997. The House bill did not 
include this provision.
      Sec. 121.--The conference agreement includes a new 
general provision, proposed by the Senate as section 117, which 
amends the 1994 Crime Bill to define ``educational expenses'' 
to be funded under the Police Corps program. The conference 
agreement modifies the language proposed by the Senate to 
assure that the course of education being pursued under this 
program is related to law enforcement purposes. The House bill 
did not include this provision.
      Sec. 122.--The conference agreement includes a technical 
correction, similar to section 109 as proposed by the Senate, 
to the U.S. Code citation regarding the Assets Forfeiture Fund 
to conform to changes enacted into law under Public Law 104-66 
and Public Law 104-99 and to ensure the intended effect of 
these changes. The House bill did not include this technical 
correction.

              DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND RELATED AGENCIES

                         DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

                  Trade and Infrastructure Development

                 U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration

      The conference agreement, like the House and Senate 
bills, does not include funding for the U.S. Travel and Tourism 
Administration. Its functions are in the process of being 
transferred to the International Trade Administration, and no 
further funding is required.

                Economic and Information Infrastructure

       national telecommunications and information administration

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate clarifying the authority of the Secretary of 
Commerce to charge Federal agencies for spectrum management, 
analysis, operations and related services, which was not 
addressed in the House bill, and making technical changes to 
language included in the House bill regarding the retention and 
use of all funds so collected.

                         Science and Technology

             National Institute of Standards and Technology

                     industrial technology services

      The conference agreement includes $301,000,000 for 
Industrial Technology Services, of which $80,000,000 is for the 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program, and of which 
$221,000,000 is for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). The 
House bill included $80,000,000 for the MEP, and $100,000,000 
in contingentappropriations for ATP. The Senate bill included 
$80,000,000 for MEP, and $235,000,000 in contingent appropriations for 
ATP.
      The amount provided for ATP in this agreement represents 
the Commerce Department's most recent estimate of the amount 
required to pay for continuation grants required in fiscal year 
1996 for ATP awards made in fiscal year 1995 and prior years. 
The conferees are agreed that the Commerce Department and NIST 
should accord highest priority to honoring these prior year 
commitments. The Department shall submit a plan indicating how 
it intends to spend the funds available for ATP this year 
within 30 days of the enactment of this Act.
      The conferees remain supportive of biotechnology research 
and innovation centers which provide technical and financial 
assistance, education and training to help create and promote 
promising new companies. The conferees note that the Department 
has previously provided support for these centers in several 
States, including Massachusetts, and believe that such support 
is in keeping with the Department's mission of promoting both 
economic and trade opportunities. Therefore, the conferees 
believe that the Department should make available sufficient 
funds for continuing operations of these centers at levels 
consistent with previous years.

            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

                  operations, research, and facilities

                     (including transfer of funds)

      The conference agreement includes a direct appropriation 
of $1,792,677,000 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's Operations, Research, and Facilities account, 
as proposed by the House, instead of $1,799,677,000 as proposed 
by the Senate. The conference agreement does not include 
$7,000,000 proposed in the Senate bill for the Global Learning 
and Observations to Benefit the Environment program. The House 
bill and the conference agreement do not include funding for 
this program.
      In addition, the following clarifications of issues in 
the statement of managers accompanying the conference report on 
H.R. 2076 are provided:
      The conferees do not expect NOAA to undertake a deep 
ocean isolation study during fiscal year 1996.
      Funds for mapping, charting, and geodesy services are to 
be used to acquire such services through contracts entered into 
with qualified private sector contractors when such contracts 
are the most cost-effective method of obtaining those services.
      Because of the reduced funding level for the fleet and 
the emphasis on contracting for services, the conferees would 
like NOAA to submit a plan for purchases of fleet vessel 
equipment prior to expending funds for this purpose.
      The conferees agree with language included in the Senate 
report on H.R. 2076 regarding NOAA utilization of the UNOLS 
(university) fleet for its research needs.
      The conferees strongly concur with the House, Senate, and 
joint House/Senate conference reports to H.R. 2076 regarding 
NMFS and NOAA actions on sea turtle conservation and shrimp 
fishery issues except that the conferees direct that any 
revisions, if necessary, that are based on the NMFS November 
14, 1994 or subsequent Biological Opinions shall include the 
results of the independent scientific peer review and 
alternatives for lessening the economic impact on the shrimp 
fishing industry as directed in both the House and Senate 
reports to H.R. 2076. Additionally, the conferees direct NMFS 
and the Department of Commerce to provide within 30 days of 
enactment of this Act a detailed written report to the 
Committees on Appropriations that includes: (1) the results of 
the independent peer review of the NMFS November 14, 1994 
Biological Opinion on sea turtle conservation as directed in 
the conference report to H.R. 2076; (2) the findings and 
recommendations of the scientific expert working group directed 
to be established in the House and Senate reports to H.R. 2076; 
(3) the results of the meetings with the shrimp fishing 
industry and the conservation community as directed by the 
House and Senate reports to H.R. 2076; and (4) conclusions of 
the economic impact analysis directed to be completed in the 
House and Senate reports to H.R. 2076. The conferees are 
concerned that NOAA and the Department of Commerce are 
proceeding with additional restrictions on the shrimp fishery 
before the results of these analyses and reviews are completed 
and despite NMFS and Coast Guard data confirming that shrimp 
fishermen are complying with existing fishing restrictions at a 
97 to 99 percent rate.

                       Technology Administration

       Office of the Under Secretary/Office of Technology Policy

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement provides $7,000,000 for the 
Office of Technology Policy, instead of $5,000,000 as proposed 
by the House, and $5,000,000 and an additional $2,000,000 in 
contingent appropriations as proposed by the Senate.
      The $2,000,000 provided over the House amount, which is 
also $2,000,000 over the amount provided in the conference 
report on H.R. 2076, is to be used to support the civilian 
technology initiatives with which the Technology Administration 
is involved,including international science and technology 
policy assessment, industrial competitiveness studies, support for the 
U.S./Israel Secretariat and the National Medal of Technology. The funds 
are not intended to be used to supplant the need for the downsizing of 
employment that is nearing completion in the Technology Administration.
      The Senate bill provided an additional $2,000,000 in 
contingent appropriations for the U.S.-Israel Science and 
Technology Commission, which is not included in the conference 
agreement. As provided in both the House and Senate reports on 
H.R. 2076, the Committees continue to support the U.S.-Israel 
Science and Technology Commission. The conferees expect the 
Commerce Department to provide its commitment of $2,500,000 for 
this program in fiscal year 1996 from within available 
resources, subject to the standard transfer and reprogramming 
procedures set forth under sections 205 and 605 of this section 
of the bill.

               General Provisions--Department of Commerce

      Sec. 206. The conference agreement does not include 
language proposed by the Senate to prohibit the use of funds by 
the Secretary of Commerce to issue final determinations under 
the Endangered Species Act. The House bill contained no 
provision on this matter under this Chapter. Language on this 
issue is not necessary under this Chapter because the issue is 
being addressed on a government-wide basis under the Department 
of Interior and Related Agencies Chapter.
      Sec. 210. The conference agreement includes a modified 
general provision proposed by the House, but not in the Senate 
bill, to prohibit the use of funds to develop or implement new 
individual fishing quota, individual transferable quota, or 
individual transferable effort allocation programs until 
offsetting fees to pay for the cost of administering such 
programs are authorized. The House provision applied only to 
individual transferable quota programs. In addition, the 
conference agreement adds language not in the House bill to 
clarify that the restriction does not apply to any program 
approved prior to January 4, 1995.
      Sec. 211. The conference agreement includes a general 
provision, similar to language proposed under title III of the 
Senate bill, to amend Section 308(d) of the Interjurisdictional 
Fisheries Act of 1986 to increase flexibility in providing 
grants to commercial fishermen for uninsured losses resulting 
from a fishery resource disaster arising from a natural 
disaster. The changes from the language proposed by the Senate 
are designed to provide further assurances that any fishing 
boat bought back under this program must be scrapped or 
otherwise disposed of in a way that prevents the boat from 
reentering any fishery. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.
      Sec. 212. The conference report includes a general 
provision, not in either bill, giving the Secretary of Commerce 
authority to award contracts for mapping and charting 
activities in accordance with the Brooks Act, Title IX of the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 
U.S.C. 541 et seq.). The statement of managers accompanying the 
conference report on H.R. 2076 indicated that the conferees 
expected NOAA to award contracts in accordance with this Act, 
but the Department has indicated that statutory language is 
required to carry out the conferees' intent.

                DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCIES

                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE

                   Administration of Foreign Affairs

                    diplomatic and consular programs

      The conference agreement, like the House and Senate 
versions of H.R. 3019, strikes language included in the 
conference report on H.R. 2076 which prohibited the extension 
of machine readable visa fees after April 1, 1996. In section 
112 of Public Law 104-92, a full year extension of the 
authority to collect the fee was enacted into law.
      The statement of managers in the conference agreement on 
H.R. 2076 (H. Rep. 104-378) contained an incorrect description 
of the contents of the agreement relating to funding for the 
Diplomatic Telecommunications Service (DTS). That conference 
report included language that provided $24,856,000 for DTS 
operation of existing base services, and not to exceed 
$17,144,000 for enhancements to remain available until 
expended, of which $9,600,000 was not to be made available 
until expiration of 15 days after submission of the pilot 
project report. The conferees have agreed to reduce the amount 
withheld from $9,600,000 to $2,500,000.

           security and maintenance of united states missions

      The conference report includes $385,760,000 for Security 
and Maintenance of United States Missions, as proposed in both 
the House and Senate bills, but does not include an additional 
contingent appropriation of $8,500,000 as proposed in title IV 
of the Senate bill.
      The additional rescission in this account proposed by the 
Senate is addressed separately under the Rescissions section.

              International Organizations and Conferences

              contributions to international organizations

      The conference agreement includes $892,000,000 for 
Contributions to International Organizations, to pay the costs 
assessed to the United States for membership in international 
organizations, compared to $700,000,000 and an additional 
$158,000,000 in contingent appropriations in the House bill, 
and $700,000,000 and an additional $223,000,000 in contingent 
appropriations in the Senate bill.
      In addition, the conference agreement includes language 
withholding $80,000,000 of the total provided, to be made 
available on a quarterly basis upon certification by the 
Secretary of State that the United Nations has taken no action 
to increase funding for any United Nations program without 
identifying an offsetting decrease elsewhere in the United 
Nations budget and cause the United Nations to exceed its no 
growth budget for the biennium 1996-1997 adopted in December, 
1995. The House bill contained a proviso withholding one-half 
of the proposed contingent funding for this account until the 
Secretary of State certified that the United Nations had taken 
no action to cause it to exceed its no growth budget for the 
biennium 1996-1997 adopted in December, 1995. The Senate bill 
contained no provision on this matter.
      From within the funds provided under this heading, 
funding is to be provided at the full fiscal year 1996 request 
level to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World 
Trade Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and 
the related North Atlantic Assembly. Funding is also provided 
at the full fiscal year 1996 request level to the United 
Nations, to fully fund the United States commitment at the 25 
percent assessment rate, provided that the certifications that 
it is not overspending its no-growth budget are made. No funds 
are to be provided to the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment 
Organization, the Inter-American Indian Institute, the Pan American 
Railway Congress Association, the Permanent International Association 
of Road Congresses, and the World Tourism Organization. Should the 
requested funding level, which is provided in this conference 
agreement, fall short of actual assessments, the shortfall should be 
allocated among the remaining organizations and be prioritized 
according to the importance of each international organization to the 
national interest of the United States.

        contributions for international peacekeeping activities

      The conference agreement includes $359,000,000 for 
Contributions for International Organizations, compared with 
$225,000,000 and an additional $200,000,000 in contingent 
appropriations in the House bill, and $225,000,000 and an 
additional $215,000,000 in contingent appropriations in the 
Senate bill.
      In addition, the conference agreement includes a 
technical correction in language included in the conference 
report on H.R. 2076, as proposed in both the House and Senate 
versions of H.R. 3019.
      The conference agreement retains the limitations on 
expenditure of these funds, as contained in both the House and 
Senate bills and the conference report on H.R. 2076.

                            RELATED AGENCIES

                  Arms Control and Disarmament Agency

                arms control and disarmament activities

      The conference agreement includes $38,700,000, instead of 
$35,700,000, as proposed by the Senate, and $32,700,000, as 
proposed by the House.

                    United States Information Agency

               educational and cultural exchange programs

      The conference agreement does not include bill language 
proposed by the Senate to provide $1,800,000 to the Mike 
Mansfield Fellowship Program. The House bill contained no 
provision on this matter.
      While the conferees have not included the language 
proposed by the Senate, they have agreed that the USIA shall 
disburse funds in the amount of $1,800,000 to the Mansfield 
Center for Pacific Affairs to cover the Center's costs in fully 
implementing the Mike Mansfield Fellowships including the 
posting of seven 1995 fellows and their immediate families in 
Japan in order that the fellows may work in a Japanese 
government agency for one year, preparation and training for 
ten 1996 fellows, the recruitment and selection of the ten 1997 
fellows, and attendant administrative costs.

      General Provisions--Department of State and Related Agencies

      Sec. 405.--The conference agreement provides a full-year 
waiver of the limitation on operations of the Department of 
State, the U.S. Information Agency, and the Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency in the absence of an authorization, as 
proposed in the Senate bill. The House bill included a waiver 
until April 1, 1996.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision, 
included in the Senate bill as section 407, to extend the 
authorization for the Au Pair program through the year 1999. 
The House bill contained no similar provision. This provision 
is not required, because a free-standing two-year authorization 
for the program has been enacted into law (P.L. 104-72).
      Sec. 407.--The conference agreement includes language, as 
provided in both the House and Senate bills, to allow the 
Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Program to use one-third of 
earned but unused trust income each year for three years 
beginning in fiscal year 1996.
      Sec. 410.--The conference agreement includes a provision 
authorizing continuing contract authority for the construction 
of a USIA international broadcasting facility on Tinian, 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as proposed by 
the Senate bill. The House bill contained no similar provision.
      The conferees agree that prior to the award of a contract 
for this facility, USIA is required to submit a final plan for 
this facility, including expected cost, construction time, 
funding requirements, and expected utilization of the facility, 
according to the standard reprogramming requirements of the 
Committees on Appropriations of the House and the Senate, the 
House International Relations Committee, and the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee.
      Sec. 411.--The conference agreement includes language 
proposed in section 3010 of the Senate bill relating to the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency that makes unexpended 
carryover appropriated in fiscal year 1995 for activities 
related to the implementation of the Chemical Weapons 
Convention available for ACDA operations. The House bill 
contained no provision on this issue.

                            RELATED AGENCIES

                     Competitiveness Policy Council

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $50,000 for the 
Competitiveness Policy Council instead of $100,000 as proposed 
by the Senate and no funding as proposed by the House. The 
conference agreement also includes language stating that this 
is the final Federal payment to the Council. As a result, the 
conferees expect the Council to use the remaining funds to 
proceed with the orderly termination of the Council.

                   Federal Communications Commission

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement provides $185,709,000 in total 
resources for the Federal Communications Commission, 
$10,000,000 more than provided in the conference report on H.R. 
2076 and in the House bill, and $10,000,000 less than provided 
in the Senate bill. The additional $10,000,000 over the House 
bill is to be derived from increased fees and is being provided 
to the Commission to cover costs associated with implementation 
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
      The conference agreement also includes bill language 
revisions to the FCC fee schedule relating to ten specific 
television broadcasting fee categories, as proposed in the 
Senate bill. The House bill contained no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language, not in either 
the House or Senate bill, to allow the Federal Communications 
Commission to address an issue that appears to present unique 
circumstances that require immediate attention. WQED, which 
operates two non-commercial stations in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, has indicated it is in financial difficulty, and 
is seeking the opportunity to obtain a determination on an 
expedited basis as to whether it could convert one of its 
stations to a commercial station and then assign the license 
for the station, using the proceeds to relieve its financial 
difficulties. The language included in the conference report 
addresses this situation by assuring speedy consideration of 
the issue by the FCC. The language requires the FCC to make a 
determination on a petition submitted by WQED within 30 days, 
and gives the FCC the authority to provide WQED the relief it 
is seeking as one of the options that the FCC can consider in 
making its determination.
      The Conference agreement does not include language 
proposed in the Senate bill requiring the FCC to pay the 
travel-related expenses of the Federal-State Joint Board on 
Universal Service, but the conferees expect that these expenses 
will be covered within the additional resources provided by the 
agreement. The House bill contained no similar provision.

                       Legal Services Corporation

               payment to the legal services corporation

      The conference agreement provides $278,000,000 for the 
Legal Services Corporation, as proposed by the House, instead 
of $300,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. In addition, the 
conference agreement does not include $9,000,000 in additional 
contingent appropriations, as proposed by the Senate under 
title IV of the Senate bill.
      Within the total amounts provided, the conferees agree 
that the funds should be distributed as follows: (1) 
$269,400,000 for basic field programs and required independent 
audits carried out in accordance with section 509; (2) 
$1,500,000 for the Office of Inspector General; and (3) 
$7,100,000 for management and administration. The conferees are 
aware that the Legal Services Corporation has recently 
identified $400,000 in prior year carryover funds. The 
conferees expect the Committees on Appropriations of the House 
and Senate to be notified prior to any further expenditure of 
these funds in accordance with section 605 of this Act. The 
conference agreement does not include language, proposed by the 
Senate, for payment of attorneys fees for a specific civil 
action.
      The Legal Services Corporation historically has 
distributed funding for basic field programs (for all eligible 
clients) on an equal figure per poor person based on the 1990 
census, with an exception that adjusts the formula for certain 
isolated states and territories. The conferees are encouraged 
that the Corporation has worked expeditiously to distribute 
funding on a competitive award basis, and urge the Corporation 
to continue implementation of the system that has been 
developed to continue providing grants to all eligible 
populations.

         administrative provisions--legal services corporation

      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate under section 504 to provide an exception to the 
prohibition contained therein that would permit recipients of 
LSC grants to use funds derived from non-Federal sources to 
comment on public rulemakings or to respond to a written 
request for information or testimony from a governmental body, 
so long as the response is made only to the parties that make 
the request and the recipient does not arrange for the request 
to be made. The House bill contained no similar exception to 
the prohibition contained in the bill.
      The conference agreement corrects a code citation in 
section 504(a)(10)(c), as proposed in the Senate bill. The 
House bill contained the code citation provided in the 
conference report on H.R. 2076.
      The conference agreement includes language under section 
508 to allow for the collection of attorneys fees for cases or 
matters pending prior to enactment of this Act. This provision 
does not allow the collection of attorneys fees for any new or 
additional claim or matter not initiated prior to enactment of 
this Act. Neither the House nor Senate bill contained a 
provision on this matter.
      The conference agreement makes a modification to language 
included in section 508 in both the House and Senate bills to 
provide for a limited transition time for LSC grantees to 
dispose of pending cases and matters initiated prior to 
enactment of this Act, which would now be prohibited under this 
Act. The agreement provides LSC grantees until August 1, 1996 
to dispose of all such cases.
      The conference agreement contains modifications to 
language in section 509 proposed by the Senate related to the 
procedures by which LSC grantees are audited and the manner in 
which recipients contract with licensed independent certified 
public accountants for financial and compliance audits. Also 
included are modifications to language proposed by the Senate 
to clarify that only the Office of the Inspector General shall 
have oversight responsibility to ensure the quality and 
integrity of the financial and compliance audit process. 
Language is also included, as proposed by the Senate, to 
clarify the Corporation management's duties and 
responsibilities to resolve deficiencies and non-compliance 
reported by the Office of the Inspector General. Further, 
language is included, as proposed by the Senate, authorizing 
the Office of the Inspector General to conduct additional on-
site monitoring, audits, and inspections necessary for 
programmatic, financial and compliance oversight. The House 
bill contained the provisions included in the conference report 
on H.R. 2076.

                      Ounce of Prevention Council

      The conference agreement includes $1,500,000 for the 
Ounce of Prevention Council as proposed by the Senate. The 
House bill did not include funding for this organization.
      Sec. 609. The conference agreement includes a general 
provision prohibiting use of funds to pay for expansion of 
diplomatic or consular operations in Vietnam unless the 
President certifies within 60 days that Vietnam is cooperating 
in full faith with the U.S. on POW/MIA issues. The conference 
report on H.R. 2076 and the House bill contained a provision 
prohibiting use of funds unless the President certifies that 
Vietnam is fully cooperating with the U.S. on these issues. The 
Senate bill did not include a provision on this matter.
      Secs. 616-617. The conference agreement includes two 
provisions clarifying the relationship of provisions in the 
Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related 
Agencies appropriations bill to several full-year provisions 
provided in previous continuing resolutions and the Balanced 
Budget Downpayment Act, I.
      The Senate bill included a provision repealing the 
section of the Balanced Budget Downpayment Act, I that set out 
the operating rates for programs funded under the Commerce, 
Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies 
appropriations bill.
      The House bill included a provision, section 105, that 
addressed the relationship of the provisions of this bill to 
previous year 1996 appropriations measures for all the 
appropriations bills included in H.R. 3019.

                              RESCISSIONS

                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE

                   Administration of Foreign Affairs

            acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad

                              (rescission)

      The conference agreement includes a rescission of 
$64,500,000 from balances in the Acquisition and Maintenance of 
Buildings Abroad account, compared with a rescission of 
$60,000,000 included in the conference report on H.R. 2076 and 
proposed in the House bill and a rescission of $95,500,000 
proposed in the Senate bill.

                          DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

      Section 101(b) of H.R. 3019 provides appropriations for 
programs, projects and activities provided for in the 
conference report (House Report 104-455 filed January 31, 1996) 
that accompanied the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 
1996 (H.R. 2546). The conference report was adopted in the 
House of Representatives on January 31, 1996, but was not voted 
on by the Senate because of a filibuster. The Senate voted on a 
motion to invoke cloture and close further debate on four 
separate occasions. The required 60 votes were not attained on 
any of those votes which occurred on February 27, 1996 (54-44); 
February 29, 1996 (52-42); March 5, 1996 (53-43); and March 12, 
1996 (56-44). H.R. 3019 as passed the House on March 7, 1996, 
did not include funding for the District of Columbia 
government; however, the bill as passed the Senate on March 19, 
1996, included the conference report (House Report 104-455) 
that accompanied H.R. 2546 with certain modifications that are 
explained later in this statement. The language and allocations 
set forth in House Report 104-294, Senate Report 104-144, and 
House Report 104-455 are to be complied with unless 
specifically addressed to the contrary in the accompanying bill 
and statement of the managers. The conference agreement also 
includes various technical changes to headings and section 
references.

                    D.C. Chartered Health Plan, Inc.

      The conferees note that language in section 3008 of H.R. 
3019, the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations 
Act of 1996, under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on the 
Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, 
provides a waiver to the D.C. Chartered Health Plan, Inc., a 
private provider of managed health care in the District that 
was established in 1988 and provides health care to 40 percent 
of the Medicaid AFDC beneficiaries in the District. The 
conferees have been informed that this waiver will result in 
the city incurring lower annual Medicaid costs of approximately 
$50,000,000. These savings will be shared equally by the 
Federal government and the District.

                            Infant Mortality

      The conferees are deeply concerned that the status of 
infant mortality and morbidity in the Nation's Capital 
continues to be the poorest in the United States. The 
Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education 
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1991 
(H.R. 5257) included funds in the budget for the National 
Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) ``to 
conduct research on pregnancy and perinatology with special 
emphasis on the determinants and consequences of environmental 
contributions, including crack cocaine abuse, to the low birth 
weight and infant mortality problems in the District.'' (Senate 
Report 101-516, page 118). The report further states that ``The 
plan should include research projects * * * and the means to 
contract with a local host institution to provide the clinical 
facilities and associated infrastructure to operate them''.
      The conferees request that the NICHD continue its 
research on pregnancy and perinatology as directed in Senate 
Report 101-516 and conduct its study within the jurisdictional 
bounds of the Nation's Capital as spelled out in that report. 
Further, the conferees urge NICHD to solicit bids only within 
the District of Columbia, consistent with the intent of 
Congress as originally reflected in Senate Report 101-516.

                          D.C. Canine Facility

      As noted on page 120 of the conference report (House 
Report 104-455) that accompanied the District of Columbia 
Appropriations Act, 1996 (H.R. 2546), the Metropolitan Police 
Department has had a long-standing need to construct a 
modernized canine training facility at a location near D.C. 
Village. The funding for this project has been available for 
some time; however, for various reasons construction of the 
facility has been delayed and contract bids have been allowed 
to expire. The conferees have been informed that the District 
government has identified approximately $750,000 for 
construction of the facility and again is proceeding with the 
required contracting procedures. The schedule provided by 
District officials calls for the contract to be awarded in July 
with construction to begin immediately thereafter so that the 
facility can be occupied by February 1997. The conferees direct 
District officials to expedite this long overdue project and to 
immediately advise the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations of any delays. District officials are requested 
to provide monthly progress reports with detailed explanations 
for deviations from the schedule. The reports are to be 
provided to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
on the first day of each month following the enactment of this 
Act.
      The present canine facility being used by the 
Metropolitan Police Department is located on property that is 
being transferred to the Architect of the Capitol as required 
by Public Law 98-340 and referenced in section 1565 of this 
Act. For several years the plan has been to use the existing 
facility, when it becomes available, for the U.S. Capitol 
Police who have been occupying temporary structures while 
waiting for the Metropolitan Police to move to their new 
quarters. During the transition period while the new D.C. 
canine facility is being constructed, the conferees believe 
that co-location of the Metropolitan Police and the U.S. 
Capitol Police canine forces is more economical than providing 
two separate facilities. The conferees therefore direct the 
Metropolitan Police Department to share the existing canine 
facility at D.C. Village with the U.S. Capitol Police and its 
canine training program. The conferees request monthly reports 
from both police forces on the status of this sharing 
arrangement. The first report is due April 30, 1996, with 
subsequent reports due on the last day of each month until the 
Metropolitan Police move into the new D.C. canine facility.

                Title I--Fiscal Year 1996 Appropriations

               federal contribution for education reform

      The conference action deletes this paragraph and the 
Federal appropriation of $14,930,000 instead of reallocating 
the low-income scholarship funding of $5,250,000 to repair, 
modernization, maintenance and planning consistent with 
subtitles A and F of title II of the bill, the August 14, 1995, 
recommendations of the ``Superintendent's Task Force on 
Education Infrastructure for the 21st Century'', and the June 
13, 1995, ``Accelerating Education Reform in the District of 
Columbia: Building on BESST'' (which is the acronym for the 
Superintendent's educational reform agenda ``Bringing Education 
Services to Students'') as proposed by the Senate.

                   governmental direction and support

      The conference action includes a proviso transferred from 
the deleted paragraph ``Education Reform'' that directs the 
District government to enter into negotiations with Gallaudet 
University for the purpose of transferring the Hamilton Junior 
High School building from the District's public school system 
to Gallaudet. The conferees expect that such a transaction, 
which would require the agreement of both Gallaudet and the 
District government, would result in substantial proceeds being 
made available for improving the District's public school 
facilities in the same ward. The Hamilton School, which is in 
the midst of the Gallaudet campus, was appraised at 
approximately $4,000,000 in 1990, though it may be worth 
somewhat less at present. There is some evidence that the title 
to the land on which Hamilton is located is vested in the 
Federal government. The conferees are hopeful that a mutually 
satisfactory arrangement can be worked out voluntarily between 
the two parties, with area students the beneficiaries.

                            education reform

      The conference action deletes this paragraph which 
appropriated $14,930,000 from the District's general fund for 
Education Reform initiatives. The proviso in this paragraph 
relating to Gallaudet University has been transferred to the 
heading ``Governmental Direction and Support''.

                           general provisions

      Lorton Correctional Complex.--The conference action 
amends section 151 of H.R. 2546 (House Report 104-455) 
concerning the Lorton Correctional Complex to reflect the 
findings of a report dated January 30, 1996, issued recently by 
the National Institute of Corrections (NIC) which identifies 
very serious problems with the operation, management, and 
physical plant. The amendment agreed to by the conferees 
addresses many of the concerns raised by the NIC report and 
conforms the initial language to changed timetables. Subsection 
(a) added by the conferees directs the NIC acting for and on 
behalf of the District of Columbia to hire a consultant to 
develop a plan for short-term improvements on a limited number 
of administrative and physical plant reforms that can be 
completed within a three to five month time-frame. The language 
also requires the NIC to submit their report to the President, 
the Congress, the Mayor, and the District of Columbia Financial 
Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority no later 
than September 30, 1996. Subsection (b) directs the NIC acting 
for and on behalf of the District of Columbia to hire a 
consultant to develop at least four optional long-term plans 
for the Lorton Correctional Complex, including: (1) a plan 
under which the Lorton Correctional Complex will be closed and 
inmates transferred to new facilities constructed and operated 
by private entities; (2) a plan under which the Lorton 
Correctional Complex will remain in operation under the 
management of the District of Columbia subject to such 
modification as the District considers appropriate; (3) a plan 
under which the Federal government will operate the Lorton 
Correctional Complex and the inmates will be sentenced and 
treated in accordance with guidelines applicable to Federal 
prisoners; and (4) a plan under which the Lorton Correctional 
Complex will be operated under private management. The language 
also requires the NIC to submit their report to the President, 
the Congress, the Mayor, and the District of Columbia Financial 
Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority no later 
than December 31, 1996.
      Adoptions by unmarried couples.--The conference action 
deletes section 152 of H.R. 2546 (House Report 104-455) that 
would have prohibited adoptions by unmarried couples except in 
those cases where one of the individuals was the natural 
parent.
      Chief Financial Officer powers.--The conference action 
inserts a new section 152 effective during fiscal years 1996 
and 1997 which clarifies certain duties and responsibilities of 
the Chief Financial Officer to enable the CFO to exercise his 
authority with the independence called for under Public Law 
104-8, approved April 17, 1995, which created the District of 
Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance 
Authority and established the Chief Financial Officer position. 
The Treasurer of the District, the Controller of the District 
and the head of the Office of Financial Information Services 
were placed under the CFO's authority by Public Law 104-8. The 
clarifying language places the directors of the Office of the 
Budget and the Department of Finance and Revenue as well as all 
other District of Columbia executive branch accounting, budget, 
and financial management personnel under the CFO's authority 
thereby providing the CFO with control over all financial 
activities of the District government as envisioned by Public 
Law 104-8. All of these individuals will be appointed by, serve 
at the pleasure of, and act under the direction and control of 
the CFO.
      Property conveyance.--The conference action inserts a new 
section 156 requiring the transfer of certain property to the 
Architect of the Capitol. Public Law 98-340, approved July 3, 
1984, provided for a multi-jurisdictional land exchange to 
allow the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to 
complete construction of the Green Line, which was the last 
segment of the region's rapid rail system. This land exchange 
resulted from a decision to place a Metro station and parking 
facility across the Anacostia River near the juncture of the 
South Capitol Street Bridge and I-295, and involved the 
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the District of 
Columbia, the National Park Service, and the Architect of the 
Capitol. The Agreement, which was entered into 12 years ago, 
included a commitment by the District of Columbia to transfer a 
portion of D.C. Village to the Architect of the Capitol in 
exchange for land under the Architect of the Capitol's 
jurisdiction that was transferred for the Metro facility. All 
work called for under the Agreement has been completed, 
including the relocation of Shepherd Parkway. The conferees 
have included language in section 156 of this Act which 
requires the District government to provide the Architect of 
the Capitol with a deed for the property in accordance with the 
Agreement not later than 30 days after the enactment of H.R. 
3019.

              Title II--District of Columbia School Reform

      The conference action amends the District of Columbia 
school reforms reflected in the conference report (House Report 
104-455) on H.R. 2546, the District of Columbia Appropriations 
Act for fiscal year 1996. The conference agreement deletes 
``Subtitle C--Even Start''; ``Subtitle G--Residential School''; 
and ``Subtitle N--Low-Income Scholarships'' that were included 
in House Report 104-455. The conference agreement incorporates 
the provisions of ``Subtitle H--Progress Reports and 
Accountability'' that was included in House Report 104-455 as 
the last two sections of subtitle A. The conference agreement 
also incorporates many of the provisions of ``Subtitle J--
Management and Fiscal Accountability'' and ``Subtitle K--
Personal Accountability and Preservation of School-Based 
Resources'' into various general provisions under title I. The 
remaining sections of subtitles J and K have been consolidated 
into a new ``Subtitle G--Management and Fiscal Accountability; 
Preservation of School-Based Resources''.
      Recently, the Council of the District of Columbia passed 
D.C. Bill 11-318, the Public Charter Schools Act of 1996. On 
March 26, 1996, the Mayor returned the bill to the Council 
without his signature. In his letter the Mayor states that 
``The legislation creates extensive regulations for proposed 
charter schools without providing significant independent 
authority.'' His letter further states ``In addition, proposed 
charter schools might not have available to them certain 
regional and central system support provided to other schools 
within the system.'' The conferees are committed to ensuring 
that charter schools become a reality in the District and have 
therefore included Subtitle B--Public Charter Schools, in title 
II of the conference agreement. This subtitle addresses the 
concerns expressed by the Mayor.
      The conference agreement includes residential education 
as a program that can be provided in a public charter school 
and requires the District to provide the $130,000 prorata share 
of Public Charter School Board operating expenses for the 
remainder of fiscal year 1996. In addition, the conferees note 
that other portions of this conference agreement provide the 
U.S. Department of Education with additional funds to support 
charter school activities in the various states. The conferees 
intend that the Department provide the District of Columbia 
with appropriate financial and technical assistance to support 
the start-up of the Charter School Board.
      The conference agreement amends ``Subtitle D--World Class 
Schools Task Force'' by changing the letter designation from 
``D'' to ``C'' and including language to provide funding 
authorizations in fiscal year 1997. The conference agreement 
also makes other technical changes in dates as appropriate.
      The conferees are deeply concerned about the state of the 
facilities in the District of Columbia public school system. 
Subtitle E--School Facilities Repair and Improvement, calls for 
the U.S. General Services Administration to provide technical 
assistance to the District of Columbia public schools in the 
development of a facilities revitalization plan. It also 
provides waivers to allow private companies to donate materials 
and services to rehabilitate school facilities. The conference 
agreement includes narrowly drawn waivers to ensure that 
private sector individuals and District of Columbia government 
employees may donate their services. The language also ensures 
that employees of the District of Columbia government will not 
be called upon to ``volunteer'' to provide services for which 
they would be paid as a part of their employment.
      The conferees encourage the District of Columbia Public 
Schools in their efforts to establish a residential school to 
serve the residents of the District of Columbia. The conferees 
look forward to having the thoughts and plans of the 
Superintendent and other school officials during consideration 
of the District's fiscal year 1997 budget and financial plan. 
Without the availability of Federal funds, the authorizing 
language included in the conference report (House Report 104-
455) on H.R. 2546 as ``Subtitle G--Residential School'' has 
been deleted.
      The conferees believe that leveraging private sector 
funds to provide the public schools with access to state-of-
the-art technology and implementing a regional workforce 
training initiative are essential to creating a model public 
education system in the Nation's Capital. In the absence of 
Federal funds for fiscal year 1996, the conferees have amended 
the authorizations included in the conference report (House 
Report 104-455) on H.R. 2546 for these programs to begin in 
fiscal year 1997. The conference agreement deletes section 
2704(e) ``Professional Development Program for Teachers and 
Administrators'' that had been included in the conference 
report (House Report 104-455) on H.R. 2546.

            DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES

      Section 101(c) provides fiscal year 1996 appropriations 
for the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies which 
are effective upon enactment of this Act as if it had been 
enacted into law as the regular appropriations Act.
      The conference agreement on section 101(c) incorporates 
many of the provisions of the conference agreement on H.R. 
1977, House Report 104-402. Report language and allocations set 
forth in the conference agreement on H.R. 1977 that are not 
changed by the conference agreement on section 101(c) of H.R. 
3019 are approved by the committee of conference. The report 
language and allocations adopted by the conference agreement on 
H.R. 1977 are unchanged unless expressly provided herein.

                  TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

                       Bureau of Land Management

                   management of lands and resources

      $567,453,000 is appropriated for Management of Lands and 
Resources instead of $568,062,000 as proposed by the conference 
agreement on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier agreement 
is a decrease of $609,000 for headquarters administration.
      Bill Language. Language restricting the use of funds for 
the Mojave National Preserve in California has been deleted. 
This issue is dealt with in more detail in section 119 of this 
Act under the heading General Provisions, Department of the 
Interior.

                       payments in lieu of taxes

      $113,500,000 is appropriated for Payments in Lieu of 
Taxes instead of $101,500,000 as proposed by the conference 
agreement on H.R. 1977.

                   oregon and california grant lands

      $97,452,000 is appropriated for Oregon and California 
Grant Lands instead of $93,379,000 as proposed by the 
conference agreement on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier 
agreement is an increase of $4,073,000 for collocation of the 
Oregon State office of the Bureau of Land Management with the 
Pacific northwest regional office of the Forest Service.

                United States Fish and Wildlife Service

                          resource management

      $501,010,000 is appropriated for Resource Management 
instead of $497,943,000 as proposed by the conference agreement 
on H.R. 1977. Changes from the earlier agreement include a 
decrease of $183,000 for headquarters administration and an 
increase of $3,250,000 for the endangered species program.
      The managers understand that the Service has been 
directed by the U.S. district court for the western district of 
Washington to finalize critical habitat designation for the 
marbled murrelet by May 15, 1996 and that the Department of 
Justice has filed a motion to stay enforcement of the order. 
The managers expect the Service, to the extent it proceeds with 
the critical habitat designation process for the marbled 
murrelet, to consider carefully the concerns of all interested 
parties including the States and private landowners. Potential 
economic impacts on private landowners should be fully 
evaluated and, to the extent practicable, every attempt should 
be made to ameliorate adverse impacts and use Federal lands in 
establishing critical habitat. If the May 15 deadline remains 
in effect and proves to be unrealistic, the Service should so 
notify the court and petition for an extension.
      Bill Language. Language has been included placing a 
moratorium on the use of funds by the Secretaries of the 
Interior and Commerce for endangered species listing 
activities, except for delisting, reclassification and 
emergency listings. An earmark of $4 million is included for 
those activities not subject to the moratorium. The managers 
have also provided authority to the President to suspend the 
moratorium if he determines that such a suspension is 
appropriate based on public interest in sound environmental 
management, sustainable resource use, protection of national or 
local interests or protection of cultural, biological or 
historic resources. Any such suspension must be reported to the 
Congress.

                         National Park Service

                 operation of the national park system

      $1,082,481,000 is appropriated for Operation of the 
National Park System instead of $1,083,151,000 as proposed by 
the conference agreement on H.R. 1977. The change to the 
previous agreement is a decrease of $670,000 for headquarters 
administration.
    The managers understand that the Service and the Federal 
Highway Administration are in the process of realigning and 
widening the 15th Street corridor at Raoul Wallenberg Place in 
Washington, DC. The managers are aware of concerns that this 
effort will have a negative impact on the size and quality of 
the sports field located across the street from the Holocaust 
Memorial Museum. The managers expect the Service to provide an 
assessment to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
on the impact theconstruction of this corridor will have on 
said field including any alterations to the current size and quality of 
the playing area and an estimate of the length of time the field will 
remain unusable for sporting events. This assessment should also 
include a cost estimate for (1) preservation or realignment of the 
field needed to allow sports activities to continue; (2) leveling of 
the field and repair of the field's surface with new grass; and (3) 
annual maintenance of the field. This assessment should be completed as 
expeditiously as possible.
      Bill Language. Language restricting the use of funds for 
the Mojave National Preserve in California has been deleted. 
This issue is dealt with in more detail in section 119 of this 
Act under the heading General Provisions, Department of the 
Interior.

                              construction

      The managers on the part of the House do not agree with 
the Senate position, expressed in a colloquy during Senate 
debate on H.R. 3019, with respect to the Natchez Trace Parkway.

                    United States Geological Survey

                 surveys, investigations, and Research

      $730,163,000 is appropriated for Surveys, Investigations, 
and Research instead of $730,503,000 as proposed by the 
conference agreement on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier 
agreement is a decrease of $340,000 for headquarters 
administration.
      The managers agree that, within the funds provided for 
natural resources research in the State of Florida, the Survey 
should maintain the same level of funding as was provided in 
fiscal year 1995 by the National Biological Service for manatee 
research as part of the Sirenia Project.

                      Minerals Management Service

                royalty and offshore minerals management

      $182,555,000 is appropriated for Royalty and Offshore 
Minerals Management instead of $182,994,000 as proposed by the 
conference agreement on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier 
agreement is a decrease of $439,000 for headquarters 
administration.

                        Bureau of Indian Affairs

                      operation of indian programs

      Bill Language. Language is included to permit the use of 
prior year unobligated balances for employee severance, 
relocation, and related expenses until September 30, 1996 
instead of March 30, 1996 as proposed by the conference 
agreement on H.R. 1977.

                          Departmental Offices

                        Departmental Management

                         salaries and expenses

      $56,912,000 is appropriated for Salaries and Expenses 
instead of $57,796,000 as proposed by the conference agreement 
on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier agreement is a 
decrease of $884,000 for headquarters administration in the 
departmental direction account. Because it is halfway through 
the fiscal year, the managers agree that maximum flexibility is 
permitted in allocating this reduction within that account.

                        Office of the Solicitor

                         salaries and expenses

      $34,427,000 is appropriated for Salaries and Expenses 
instead of $34,608,000 as proposed by the conference agreement 
on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier agreement is a 
decrease of $181,000 for headquarters administration.

             GENERAL PROVISIONS, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

      Language is included in section 119 on the management of 
the Mojave National Preserve. The managers have agreed to 
remove the statutory restrictions on the National Park Service 
and the Bureau of Land Management which were included in the 
conference agreement on H.R. 1977. The Park Service, under this 
provision, is permitted to manage the Preserve but limited in 
its management practices to those ``historical management 
practices'' of the Bureau of Land Management until the Service 
has completed a conceptual management plan and received 
approval of that plan from the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations. The provision also limits operating funds to 
$1,100,000 unless approval for an additional amount is obtained 
from the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The 
managers agree that this provision will expire on September 30, 
1996. The managers have also provided authority to the 
President to suspend the restrictions in section 119 if he 
determines that such a suspension is appropriate based on 
public interest in sound environmental management, sustainable 
resource use, protection of national or local interests or 
protection of cultural, biological or historic resources. Any 
such suspension must be reported to the Congress.

                       TITLE II--RELATED AGENCIES

                       DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

                             Forest Service

                       state and private forestry

      $136,884,000 is appropriated for State and Private 
Forestry instead of $136,794,000 as proposed by the conference 
agreement on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier agreement 
is an increase of $90,000 for collocation of the Oregon State 
office of the Bureau of Land Management with the Pacific 
northwest regional office of the Forest Service.
      Bill Language. Earmarks $200,000 as proposed by the 
Senate, for a grant to the World Forestry Center for research 
on land exchange efforts in the Umpqua River Basin Region in 
Oregon.

                         national forest system

      $1,257,057,000 is appropriated for the National Forest 
System instead of $1,256,253,000 as proposed by the conference 
agreement on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier agreement 
is an increase of $804,000 for collocation of the Oregon State 
office of the Bureau of Land Management with the Pacific 
northwest regional office of the Forest Service.
      Bill Language. The managers have not agreed to a specific 
dollar limitation on travel expenses within the National Forest 
System as proposed by the Senate.

                              construction

      $163,600,000 is appropriated for Construction instead of 
$163,500,000 as proposed by the conference agreement on H.R. 
1977. The change from the earlier agreement is an increase of 
$100,000 for collocation of the Oregon State office of the 
Bureau of Land Management with the Pacific northwest regional 
office of the Forest Service.
      Bill Language. Language has been included to permit the 
transfer of trail construction funds, appropriated in fiscal 
year 1995 for the construction of the Columbia Gorge Discovery 
Center, to the group titled the ``Non-Profit Citizens for the 
Columbia Gorge Discovery Center'', as proposed by the Senate.

                            land acquisition

      $39,400,000 is appropriated for Land Acquisition instead 
of $41,200,000 as proposed by the conference agreement on H.R. 
1977, a reduction of $1,800,000 below the earlier agreement, 
including decreases of $1,700,000 for Federal land acquisition 
and $100,000 for acquisition management. The managers are very 
concerned that the Service has proceeded with specific land 
acquisitions this year without the approval of the House and 
Senate appropriations committees, and bill language has been 
included requiring the Service to obtain the approval of the 
committees before proceeding with any further land acquisitions 
in fiscal year 1996.

                southeast alaska economic disaster fund

      $110,000,000 is appropriated for the Southeast Alaska 
Economic Disaster Fund. No funds were provided for this new 
account in the conference agreement on H.R. 1977. These funds 
are provided for grants to communities affected by the 
declining timber program on the Tongass National Forest. This 
issue is discussed in more detail in section 325 of Title III--
General Provisions.

               administrative provisions, forest service

      The Tongass National Forest provisions addressed under 
this heading in the conference agreement on H.R. 1977 have been 
moved to section 325 under Title III--General Provisions.

                          DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

                 fossil energy research and development

      $417,018,000 is appropriated for Fossil Energy Research 
and Development instead of $417,169,000 as proposed by the 
conference agreement on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier 
agreement is a decrease of $151,000 for headquarters 
administration.
      The managers understand that the fiscal year 1997 budget 
will reflect the transfer of the health and safety research 
programs of the Bureau of Mines to the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the Department of 
Health and Human Services. The managers encouraged such a 
transfer in the fiscal year 1996 conference agreement on H.R. 
1977 and see no reason to delay the transfer. The managers 
strongly encourage the Department of Energy to enter into an 
interagency agreement with NIOSH for the fiscal year 1996 
funding. In determining the allocation of funds for the 
transferred functions, the managers expect the DOE and NIOSH to 
consider the concerns of all interested parties, including 
industry and labor. The managers also expect the agencies to 
recognize the importance of maintaining a health and safety 
research presence in the East and in the West.

                          energy conservation

      $553,189,000 is appropriated for Energy Conservation 
instead of $553,293,000 as proposed by the conference agreement 
on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier agreement is a 
decrease of $104,000 for headquarters administration.

                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

                         Indian Health Service

                         indian health services

      Bill Language. The managers have not agreed to earmark 
funds for inhalant abuse treatment programs as proposed by the 
Senate. The managers understand that the Indian Health Service 
provides for both direct care and referrals for adolescents 
afflicted with inhalant abuse problems and encourage IHS to 
continue to refer patients, as appropriate,for treatment of 
such abuse. The managers are aware of the particular expertise of the 
Our Home Inhalant Abuse Center, and encourage IHS to continue to refer 
patients to this facility, as appropriate.

                         OTHER RELATED AGENCIES

                        Smithsonian Institution

                         salaries and expenses

      $311,188,000 is appropriated for Salaries and Expenses 
instead of $308,188,000 as proposed by the conference agreement 
on H.R. 1977. The change from the earlier agreement is an 
increase of $3,000,000 for voluntary separation incentive 
payments and other costs associated with employee separations 
pursuant to the authority provided for employee ``buy-outs'' in 
section 339 of this Act.

                     TITLE III--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      Section 314. Deletes the language dealing with the 
Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project proposed 
in the conference agreement on H.R. 1977 and replaces it with a 
limitation on the use of funds for implementing regulations or 
requirements to regulate non-Federal lands with respect to this 
project.
      Section 325. Bill language is included providing for a 
one-year moratorium on establishment of a new Tongass Land 
Management Plan for the Tongass National Forest in southeast 
Alaska. The moratorium would be in effect for one year after 
the date of enactment of this Act rather than for two fiscal 
years as proposed by the conference agreement on H.R. 1977. In 
amending or revising the current plan, the Secretary may 
establish habitat conservation areas, and impose any 
restriction or land use designations deemed appropriate, so 
long as the number of acres in the timber base and resulting 
allowable sale quantity is not less than the amounts identified 
in the preferred alternative (alternative P) in the October 
1992 Tongass land and resource management plan. The Secretary 
may implement compatible standards and guidelines, as 
necessary, to protect habitat and preserve multiple uses of the 
Tongass National Forest.
      The language has been augmented from the version included 
in H.R. 1977 to address the Administration's concerns about 
clearcutting. The provision makes it clear that nothing in this 
section shall be interpreted as mandating clearcutting or 
unsustainable timber harvesting. The language also makes it 
clear that any revision, amendment, or modification shall be 
based on research results obtained through the application of 
the scientific method and sound, verifiable scientific data. 
Data are sound, verifiable, and scientific only when they are 
collected and analyzed using the scientific method. The 
scientific method requires the statement of an hypothesis 
capable of proof or disproof; preparation of a study plan 
designed to collect accurate data to test the hypothesis; 
collection and analysis of the data in conformance with the 
study plan; and confirmation, modification, or denial of the 
hypothesis based upon peer-reviewed analysis of the collected 
data. The data used shall include information collected in the 
southeast Alaska ecosystem.
      The section also includes language to allow certain 
timber sales, that have cleared the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) and the Alaska National Interest Lands 
Conservation Act (ANILCA) review processes, to be awarded if 
the Forest Service determines that additional analysis under 
NEPA and ANILCA is not necessary.
      The managers have also provided authority to the 
President to suspend the provisions mentioned above with 
respect to the Tongass National Forest in Alaska if he 
determines that such a suspension is appropriate based on 
public interest in sound environmental management or protection 
of cultural, biological or historic resources. Any such 
suspension must be reported to the Congress. Language is 
included to clarify that if the suspension is exercised, the 
duration of the suspension would not exceed the period in which 
the provisions of the section would otherwise be in effect.
      The managers are very concerned about the negative 
impacts on the southeastern Alaska economy of a declining 
Federal timber program on the Tongass National Forest. The 
managers are aware of concerns that proposed modifications to 
the Tongass Land Management Plan give insufficient attention to 
the economic ramifications of a reduced timber sales program, 
and urge the Administration to consider strongly the 
socioeconomic impacts of its proposed alternatives. In 
implementing this section, the Forest Service shall prepare a 
city-by-city socioeconomic analysis of the effect of reducing 
the suitable timber land base or timber sales levels on the 
communities of southeast Alaska and on the potential of 
restoring a timber economy in Wrangell and Sitka.
      To address these job losses and economic impacts, a new 
southeast Alaska disaster assistance fund totaling $110 million 
has been established under the Forest Service. The funds are 
provided as direct grants to the affected communities to employ 
former timber workers and for community development projects, 
and as direct payments in proportion to the percentage of 
Tongass timber receipts realized by these communities in fiscal 
year 1995.
      The grants are provided with broad authority for the 
community to pursue economic and infrastructure development 
projects that employ displaced timber workers. This fund is 
intended to be an interim measure until uncertainties with the 
available timber supply are resolved and a timber economy 
revitalized. The managers encourage the affected communities to 
develop comprehensive plans for how they intend to spend these 
funds.
      The managers strongly urge the Administration to comply 
with the requirement of the Tongass Timber Reform Act to meet 
``market demand'' for timber sales on theTongass. The President 
may nevertheless choose to suspend this section.
      The managers agree that the availability of funds from 
this new disaster assistance fund is contingent upon the 
President executing the waiver authority. In the event 
legislation is enacted in the future that increases the timber 
sales program to meet market demand on the Tongass National 
Forest, it would be the expectation of the managers that these 
funds would be no longer available.
      Travel. The managers have not agreed to place a statutory 
limit on the use of travel funds as proposed by the House. The 
managers expect each agency under the jurisdiction of the 
Interior and Related Agencies bill to monitor carefully travel 
expenses and to avoid non-essential travel.
      Section 336. Inserts new language placing a moratorium on 
the issuance of a final rulemaking on jurisdiction, management 
and control over navigable waters in the State of Alaska with 
respect to subsistence fishing. The moratorium is for fiscal 
year 1996 rather than through May 15, 1997, as proposed by the 
Senate. The managers are concerned that recent court decisions 
place requirements on the Departments of the Interior and 
Agriculture to assume management authority in navigable waters 
and that such management could cost each agency several 
millions of dollars annually. In an era of declining budgets, 
this added burden would have an adverse impact on other 
important programs. The managers urge the State of Alaska and 
all parties involved to work toward developing a viable, long 
term solution to the subsistence problem. The solution should 
provide for State management of fish and wildlife in Alaska 
while protecting those who depend on subsistence resources.
      Employee Details. The managers have not agreed to place a 
statutory limitation on the temporary detail of employees 
within the Department of the Interior as proposed by the House. 
The Department should continue to report quarterly on the use 
of employee details and should not use such personnel details 
to offset programmatic or administrative reductions.
      Section 337. Directs the Department of the Interior to 
transfer to the Daughters of the American Colonists a plaque in 
the possession of the National Park Service. The Park Service 
currently has this plaque in storage and this provision 
provides for its return to the organization that originally 
placed the plaque on the Great Southern Hotel in Saint Louis, 
Missouri in 1933 to mark the site of Fort San Carlos.
      Section 338. Inserts new language requiring that funds 
obligated for salaries and expenses of the Pennsylvania Avenue 
Development Corporation and for international forestry 
activities of the Forest Service be offset from other specified 
sources upon enactment of this Act.
      Section 339. Provides one-time authority for the 
Smithsonian Institution to offer early retirement opportunities 
and retirement bonuses to employees through October 1, 1996.
      Greens Creek Land Exchange. The managers have not agreed 
to bill language, proposed by the Senate in Title III, section 
3015 of the Senate passed version of H.R. 3019, which would 
have incorporated the Greens Creek Land Exchange Act of 1996 
into this Act. This legislation was signed into law (Public Law 
104-123) on April 1, 1996.

                               CHAPTER 5

            DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES

      Agency Priorities. The managers have not agreed to 
statutory language, proposed by the Senate in section 1203 of 
Title II, chapter 12, which would have mandated the allocation 
of emergency supplemental funds based on agency prioritization 
processes. The managers understand that the initial estimates 
of emergency requirements that have been provided are based on 
very preliminary information and that those initial estimates, 
because of time constraints, may not have included every 
project which needs to be addressed. The managers expect each 
agency to develop on-the-ground estimates of all its natural 
disaster related needs and to address these needs consistent 
with agency priorities.
      Contingent Appropriations. The availability of those 
portions of the appropriations detailed in this chapter that 
are in excess of the Administration's budget request for 
emergency supplemental appropriations are contingent upon 
receipt of a budget request that includes a Presidential 
designation of such amounts as emergency requirements as 
defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985, as amended.

      The managers have neither agreed to bill language, 
proposed by the Senate, earmarking specific funds for Devils 
Lake, ND nor to report language earmarking funds for other 
locations. The Service should carefully consider the needs at 
Devils Lake, ND and at Kenai, AK as it allocates funds.

                         National Park Service

                              construction

amended.
      The managers have not agreed to bill language, proposed

APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, 
                  AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES

      Section 101(d) of H.R. 3019 provides appropriations for 
programs, projects and activities in the Departments of Labor, 
Health and Human Services and Education and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act, 1996. In implementing this agreement, the 
departments and agencies should comply with the language and 
instructions set forth in House Report 104-209 and Senate 
Reports 104-145 and 104-236. In those cases where this language 
and instruction specifically addresses the allocation of funds 
which parallels the funding levels specified in the 
Congressional budget justifications accompanying the fiscal 
year 1996 budget or the underlying authorizing statute, the 
conferees concur with those recommendations. With respect to 
the provisions in the above House and Senate reports that 
specifically allocate funds that are not allocated by formula 
in the underlying statute or identified in the budget 
justifications, the conferees have reviewed each and have 
included those in which they concur in this joint statement.
      None of the appropriations provided herein are contingent 
upon any subsequent actions by the Congress or the President.
      The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and 
Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 
1996, put in place by this bill, incorporates the following 
agreements of the managers:

                      TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

                 Employment and Training Administration

                    training and employment services

      The conference agreement includes $4,146,278,000, instead 
of $3,108,978,000 as proposed by the House and $4,322,278,000 
as proposed by the Senate. The agreement includes $625,000,000 
for the summer youth employment program, instead of 
$635,000,000 as proposed by the Senate and no funding as 
proposed by the House.
      The conference recognizes that in many high unemployment 
and high poverty areas, the number of low-income youth seeking 
summer employment far exceeds the number of job opportunities. 
The conference also recognizes, however, that the current 
federally-funded summer jobs program has not lived up to its 
potential for providing meaningful work experience and teaching 
solid job skills to such youth. The conference is also aware 
that the relevant authorizing committees are developing job 
training reform legislation to consolidate over 90 separate 
programs and to block grant funds and authority to States and 
localities. The conference, therefore, considers funds for the 
fiscal year 1996 summer jobs program to be transition funding--
in future years to be folded into the new consolidated block 
grants for at-risk youth. Governors and localities will have 
considerable flexibility to use these funds in subsequent years 
to develop meaningful programs for at-risk youth that teach 
youngsters job skills in demand and sound work habits; that are 
closely linked to the needs of employers; andthat offer 
integrated work and academic learning opportunities to youth who 
demonstrate a willingness to learn and responsible behavior.
      The agreement includes an amount of $2,500,000 for the 
fiscal year 1996 Paralympic Games, instead of $5,000,000 as 
proposed in the House and Senate bills. These funds will be 
used by the organizer of the games for the following activities 
prior to, during, and immediately following the games: (1) 
training and employment costs of volunteers working in the 
games; (2) training and staff costs for the days of the games; 
(3) training and travel for officials of the games. The grantee 
shall provide such information as shall be required by the 
Department of Labor, including a detailed statement of work and 
budget, and financial reports providing a breakout of the costs 
of the activities performed under the grant. The conferees have 
also provided funding for the Paralympic Games in the 
Department of Education and in the Social Security 
Administration.
      The agreement includes language to permit service 
delivery areas to transfer funds between titles II-B and II-C 
of the Job Training Partnership Act, with the approval of the 
Governor of the State. The House and Senate bills only 
permitted the transfer to take place from title II-C to title 
II-B. In addition, the agreement permits the transfer of funds 
between title II-A and title III of the Act as proposed by the 
Senate, instead of permitting the transfer of funds between all 
title II programs and title III as proposed by the House.
      It is the intent of the conferees that in committing 
National Reserve account funds appropriated under title III of 
the Job Training Partnership Act, the Secretary of Labor 
encourage Governors to contract, where possible, with the 
private sector for the provision of outplacement services to 
Federal employees seeking employment in the private sector.
      The conferees have included funds to continue the 
National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee 
(NOICC) and its affiliated State committees during the 
anticipated transition to a new administrative structure 
proposed in pending authorizing legislation and urge that the 
Departments of Labor and Education rely on NOICC advice and 
personnel during this transition.
      The conference agreement for the Job Training Partnership 
Act pilots and demonstrations maintains the current level for 
the Microenterprise Grants program and the American Samoan 
employment and training program, and includes the level 
recommended in the Senate report accompanying H.R. 2127 for an 
industrial employment program for the disabled.

            community service employment for older americans

      The conference agreement includes $373,000,000, instead 
of $350,000,000 as proposed by both the House and the Senate. 
The agreement earmarks 22 percent of the funds for the States 
and 78 percent for national contractors as proposed by the 
Senate, instead of 35 percent for the States and 65 percent for 
the contractors as proposed by the House.

     state unemployment insurance and employment service operations

      The conference agreement includes $110,000,000 for the 
one-stop career centers program as proposed by the Senate, 
instead of $92,000,000 as proposed by the House.

        payments to the unemployment trust fund and other funds

                              (rescission)

      The conference agreement rescinds $266,000,000 from this 
account as proposed by the Senate, instead of $250,000,000 as 
proposed by the House.

                  Employment Standards Administration

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $266,644,000, instead 
of $255,734,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate.

             Occupational Safety and Health Administration

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $304,984,000, instead 
of $280,000,000 as proposed by the House and $288,985,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      It is the intent of the conferees that the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration give high priority to 
effective voluntary cooperative efforts such as the Voluntary 
Protection Program.

                        Departmental Management

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $141,350,000, instead 
of $136,300,000 as proposed by the House and $140,380,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. Additional funding is provided to avoid 
lengthy staff furloughs in the Benefits Review Board.
      The conferees have provided $8,900,000 for the Bureau of 
International Labor Affairs. This amount includes full funding 
for activities to combat international child labor problems as 
outlined in the Senate report on H.R. 2127.
      The conferees understand that there is some question 
concerning the funding level for ILAB needed to avoid personnel 
furloughs. The conferees reiterate that they have provided 
transfer authority to the Secretary to deal with such 
exigencies and encourage him to propose reprogramming of funds 
if necessary to avoid furloughs.
      In addition, the agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate to restrict certain activities of the Office of the 
Solicitor and the Benefits Review Board with respect to cases 
under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. The 
language provides that if the Board, prior to September 12, 
1996, fails to act on any Longshore decision that has been 
appealed to it and has been pending before it for more than 12 
months, the decision shall be considered affirmed by the Board 
on that date and shall be considered the final order of the 
Board for purposes of obtaining a review in the U.S. Courts of 
Appeal. Further, beginning on September 13, 1996, the Board 
shall decide all appeals under the Longshore Act not later than 
one year after the appeal was filed; if the Board fails to do 
so, then the decision shall be considered the final order of 
the Board for purposes of obtaining a review in the U.S. Courts 
of Appeal. The petitioner has the option to continue the 
proceeding before the Board for a period of 60 days; if no 
decision is made during that time, the decision shall be 
considered the final order of the Board for purposes of 
obtaining a review in the U.S. Courts of Appeals. The House 
bill had no similar provision. The language is not applicable 
to the review of any decisions under the Black Lung Benefits 
Act.
      The conferees intend that, to the extent possible, 
funding for technical assistance and training for local 
displaced homemaker programs should not be reduced by more than 
the overall percentage reduction for the Women's Bureau.
      The conferees support the ongoing efforts to rid the 
International Brotherhood of Teamsters of organized crime 
influence pursuant to the consent decree. Consistent with 
direction provided in both the House and Senate committee 
reports on the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill, the 
conferees provide that up to $5,600,000 of the amounts 
available for obligation to the Department of Labor during 
fiscal year 1996 may be allocated for this purpose, subject to 
normal reprogramming requirements of the committees.
      The conferees have agreed to include a fund transfer 
provision (section 103) to give the Department more flexibility 
in managing its appropriations. However, the continuation of 
this provision in the future will depend on the Department's 
achieving and maintaining audited financial statements in 
accordance with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and 
Office of Management and Budget Bulletin No. 93-06.

                           General Provisions

      The conference agreement includes a general provision 
proposed by the House modified to set aside section 427(c) of 
the Job Training Partnership Act in cases where a Job Corps 
center does not meet national performance standards established 
by the Secretary. The Senate bill had no similar provision. 
Section 427(c) prohibits the Department of Labor from 
contracting with a private contractor to operate a Job Corps 
civilian conservation center.
      The conference agreement includes a general provision as 
proposed by the Senate modified to prohibit the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration and the State programs that 
operate with Federal funds from promulgating or issuing any 
proposed or final standard or guideline with respect to 
ergonomic protection but permits the agency to conduct any 
peer-reviewed risk assessment activity regarding ergonomics. 
The House bill would have also prohibited the development of 
any standard or guideline and the recording and reporting of 
any occupational injuries and illnesses related to ergonomic 
protection.

           TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

              Health Resources and Services Administration

                     health resources and services

      The conference agreement appropriates $3,077,857,000 
instead of $3,052,752,000 as proposed by the House and 
$2,954,864,000 in regular funding and $55,256,000 in 
contingency funding as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes the legal citation for 
the Native Hawaiian Health Care program as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill did not include the citation. The 
conferees have increased funding for the consolidated health 
centers line so that health care activities funded under the 
Native Hawaiian Health Care program can be supported under the 
broader health centers line if the agency feels it is 
appropriate.
      The conference agreement includes an additional 
$62,700,000 over fiscal year 1995 for title II of the Ryan 
White AIDS CARE Act for a total funding level of $260,847,000. 
The House bill included an increase of $52,000,000 over the 
fiscal year 1995 level. The Senate amendment provided the 
additional $52,000,000 but as part of its contingent funding 
section. The conference agreement incorporates bill language in 
the Senate amendment that would make clear that the $52,000,000 
is to be used for the AIDS drug assistance portion of title II 
and distributed according to the current formula. The 
conference agreement also identifies in bill language the 
amounts appropriated for titles I and II of the Ryan White AIDS 
CARE Act as provided in the House bill.
      The conference agreement does not include $3,256,000 in 
contingency funding for the National Health Service Corps 
(NHSC) as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement 
provides $115,745,000 in non-contingent funding. The House bill 
did not include contingent funding for NHSC.
      The conference agreement includes language as proposed by 
the House limiting new cities entering the title I Ryan White 
program to those permitted in the pending reauthorization bill. 
The Senate amendment had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language holding the 
formula grant funding for current title I grantees under the 
Ryan White AIDS CARE Act to no less than 99 percent of their 
fiscal year 1995 funding level by reallocating supplemental 
grant funds. The Senate amendment included a hold harmless 
provision assuring 100 percent of the fiscal year 1995 funding 
level in fiscal year 1996 for current title I grantees. The 
House bill had no comparable provision.
      The conference agreement deletes language proposed in the 
Senate amendment and last year's bill identifying funding for 
Area Health Education Centers and overriding set-asides in the 
authorizing statute pertaining to the types of centers that may 
be funded. The house bill had no comparable provision. The 
conferees understand that this language is no longer necessary.
      The conference agreement modifies a technical legal 
citation contained in both the House bill and Senate amendment 
pertaining to the Federal Tort Claims Act.
      The conferees intend that the agency may use up to 
$3,000,000 of the funding provided for the National Health 
Service Corps for State offices of rural health.
      The conferees strongly believe that the family planning 
program should be formally administered, as well as funded, in 
the Health Resources and Services Administration as a separate 
program within the Office of the Administrator, but have chosen 
to leave the decision regarding administration to the Secretary 
and have not mandated the transfer.
      The conferees include $20,000,000 for health care 
facilities grants, of which $10,000,000 is designated for the 
facility requested in the President's fiscal year 1996 budget, 
and $10,000,000 is designated for items identified in the 
Senate report accompanying the amendment to H.R. 3019 
pertaining to oral health care and health care for 
disadvantaged women. Also included as part of this second 
$10,000,000 is funding to improve rural health care access.

               Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

                disease control, research, and training

                              (rescission)

      Full year funding for the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) was provided in P.L. 104-91, the continuing 
resolution enacted January 6, 1996.
      The conference agreement includes language as proposed by 
the House rescinding obligated, but unexpended, balances from 
grants to States in fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 for 
immunization activities. The agreement includes language as 
proposed by the House providing authority to transfer funds 
available from the sale of surplus vaccine from the vaccine 
stockpile to other activities within the jurisdiction of the 
agency, with prompt notification of Congress of any transfer. 
These two provisions were included in nearly identical form in 
sections 209 and 211 of the Senate amendment. The conference 
agreement incorporates one technical citation change on the 
second provision contained in the Senate amendment.
      The conferees are agreed that funding for the research 
and training activities of the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health has been provided on a 
consolidated basis as proposed by the Senate. The table printed 
in the Congressional Record accompanying H.R. 3019 as passed by 
the House had allocated funds separately for research and 
training activities.
      The conferees are supportive of CDC proceeding with a 
school-based immunization demonstration program to carry 
forward the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices for early adolescents, to the extent 
this is possible using available funds, including section 317 
carryover funds.
      The conferees are aware of the benefits of community 
health promotion programs that control the spread of infectious 
diseases, reduce chronic disease, and lower risk factors and 
encourage the Director to support activities to evaluate 
innovative health information dissemination programs for the 
development of models for public outreach and professional 
development.
      The conferees intend that as CDC applies the $31,000,000 
administrative reduction that was included in P.L. 104-91 
providing full year funding for the agency that equipment 
expenditures be included in the definition of administrative 
expenses.
      The conferees confirm their understanding that the 
National Immunization Survey will be continued in fiscal year 
1996.

                     National Institutes of Health

      The National Institutes of Health (NIH) were funded for 
the full year in P.L. 104-91, the continuing resolution enacted 
January 6, 1996.
      The conferees have specifically endorsed the following 
initiatives mentioned in the Senate report:
      (a) The neurodegenerative disorders initiative within the 
Office of the Director;
      (b) The Office of Rare Disease Research program;
      (c) The Institutional Development Award Program (IDeA) 
grant program; and
      (d) The Office of Dietary Supplements program.
      Of the $20,000,000 provided within the National Center 
for Research Resources for extramural facility construction, 
the conferees intend that $2,500,000 be reserved for 
construction and renovation projects at qualified regional 
primate centers.
      The conferees are very supportive of the efforts of the 
National Institute on Aging to enhance research on Alzheimer's 
disease and urge the Institute to consider it a top priority. 
The conferees understand that promising research opportunities 
in the neuroscience of Alzheimer's disease exist, including 
research on the formation and maintenance of synapses, the 
mechanisms of beta-amyloid formation, and the biochemical 
action mechanisms of drugs used in the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease. The Institute is strongly encouraged to focus 
additional attention on these promising areas, including 
consideration of expanding the number of Alzheimer's Disease 
research centers.
      The conferees are supportive of expanding alternative 
resources to the use of animals, particularly through ensuring 
regular access to human tissues and organs. The conferees 
recommend that the Director of NIH give consideration to 
establishing a multi-Institute initiative to support an 
expanded human tissue resource and ensure that the needs of the 
scientific community can be served.
      The conferees are agreed that sufficient funds have been 
provided within the Office of the Director to provide core 
support for the National Bioethics Advisory Commission.
      The conferees intend NIH to hold administrative costs 
within the research management and support category to 7.5 
percent below fiscal year 1995 levels (with an additional 2.5 
percent reduction to congressional and public affairs 
functions) as indicated in the House report on H.R. 2127. 
However, the conferees do not intend that public education 
programs that are placed within the research management and 
support budget of some Institutes be considered part of the 
cost pool to be reduced.
      The conferees request NIH to expeditiously complete 
review of its intramural primate facilities and promptly begin 
the surplusing of those facilities NIH deems to be excess 
property.
      Public Law 104-91, which provided full year funding for 
the National Institutes of Health, includes $26,598,000 for the 
Office of AIDS Research(OAR), including $10,000,000 for the 
Director's emergency discretionary fund authorized by section 2356 of 
the Public Health Service Act. Funding for AIDS research for fiscal 
year 1996 was provided in the manner set forth in H.R. 2127 as passed 
by the House, which provided appropriations to each Institute including 
funding for AIDS. The bill as reported in the Senate had appropriated 
funds for AIDS research to the Office of AIDS Research, as had been 
done in fiscal year 1995. The conferees are agreed that the fiscal year 
1996 funding structure for AIDS research activities of the NIH is not a 
precedent for the allocation of AIDS research funding for fiscal year 
1997. The conferees continue to strongly support the critical work of 
the Director of the OAR to coordinate the scientific, budgetary, 
legislative, and policy elements of the NIH AIDS research program and 
agree that the funding structure for AIDS research in fiscal year 1996 
should not diminish this important responsibility. The conferees note 
that section 212, providing 3 percent transfer authority within the 
total identified by the NIH for AIDS research, enhances the Director's 
authority to ensure that AIDS research supported by the NIH is carried 
out in accordance with the AIDS research plan.

       Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

      The conference report provides $1,883,715,000 for the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, of 
which $275,420,000 is provided for the mental health block 
grant, and $1,234,107,000 is provided for the substance abuse 
block grant. The agreement also funds consolidated substance 
abuse treatment and substance abuse prevention demonstration 
programs at $90,000,000 each. The House bill included 
$1,883,715,000 and the Senate bill included $1,800,469,000.
      The conferees understand that SAMHSA has undertaken an 
agency reorganization to streamline administrative functions. 
In addition, the agency will begin implementation of new 
knowledge development and application (KDA) grants in fiscal 
year 1996. The conferees continue to encourage SAMHSA to focus 
on evaluation and reporting of outcomes for activities funded 
under the block grants, demonstrations and KDAs. The conferees 
understand that KDA grants will generally fund applied research 
and evaluation, not services. The agreement specifically 
directs that any KDA grant include a plan to measure and 
publicly report outcomes relating to the grantee's stated goals 
and, where relevant, the incidence of substance abuse among 
individuals studied. The conferees strongly encourage SAMHSA to 
aggressively and effectively disseminate the results of KDA 
grants and to integrate these results into services funded in 
whole or in part by the Federal block grants as well as non-
federally funded substance abuse and mental health services. In 
determining the allocation of funding to existing substance 
abuse demonstration projects, the conferees encourage the 
agency to give full consideration to those projects which 
impact pregnant women and children.
      The conferees recommend that in awarding KDA grants to 
eligible grantees the Secretary give priority to the 
development of knowledge and specific interventions that 
improve the quality and access to services in areas where there 
is a high incidence of substance abuse and mental illness 
coupled with other contributing conditions such as high rates 
of co-morbidities, particularly HIV infection, long waiting 
lists for treatment, or homelessness.

               Agency for Health Care Policy and Research

                    health care policy and research

      The conference agreement provides a total funding level 
of $125,310,000 as proposed by the House instead of 
$128,470,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of this amount, 
$65,186,000 is provided in Federal funds and $60,124,000 is 
provided through one percent evaluation funding. The House bill 
provided $94,186,000 in Federal funds and $31,124,000 in one 
percent funding, while the Senate amendment provided 
$65,390,000 in Federal funds and $63,080,000 in one percent 
evaluation funding.

                  Health Care Financing Administration

                           program management

      The conference agreement makes available $1,734,810,000 
as proposed by the House instead of $2,111,406,000 as proposed 
by the Senate and provides an additional $396,000,000 within 
title VI of the bill for payment safeguard activities, 
providing total program management funding of $2,130,810,000. 
The Senate amendment had no comparable title VI provision. The 
funding in title VI would be canceled if there is a subsequent 
appropriation enacted for Medicare contractors in an 
authorizing bill.
      The conferees strongly encourage Medicare contractors to 
promptly purchase and utilize commercially available automated 
data processing systems designed to detect abusive Medicare 
billings.
      The conferees encourage the Health Care Financing 
Administration to conduct a demonstration program to evaluate 
whether cardiac case management of patients suffering from 
congestive heart failure would increase the quality of care 
delivered and patient satisfaction, as well as deliver such 
care in a more cost effective manner than current practice.
      The conferees specifically endorse the following:
      (a) No funds may be used for implementation of the 
Medicare/Medicaid data bank as mentioned in the House report;
      (b) HCFA is encouraged to give full and fair 
consideration to a proposal to develop a comprehensive health 
care information management system that would link patient care 
data across the full range of health care as mentioned in the 
Senate report.

                Administration for Children and Families

               low income home energy assistance program

                         (Including Rescission)

      The conference agreement provides a rescission of 
$100,000,000 in previously appropriated 1996 funding as 
recommended in the House and Senate bills. Total fiscal year 
1996 funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program 
(LIHEAP) is $900,000,000. The conferees intend that up to 
$22,500,000 of the amounts provided for LIHEAP for fiscal year 
1996 be used for the leveraging incentive fund. The conference 
agreement provides $300,000,000 for the contingency fund for 
fiscal year 1997, instead of providing that amount for fiscal 
year 1996 as proposed by the Senate. The agreement also extends 
the availability for another year of any funds remaining 
unobligated in the contingency fund at the end of fiscal year 
1996. Finally, the agreement does not provide advance fiscal 
year 1997 funding for the LIHEAP program, the same as the House 
bill and $1,000,000,000 less than the Senate bill. Funding for 
FY 1997 will be considered as part of the regular fiscal year 
1997 appropriations bill.

                     refugee and entrant assistance

      The conference agreement provides $402,172,000 for 
Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs, instead of 
$397,872,000 as proposed in both the House and Senate bills. 
The agreement includes $55,397,000 for the Targeted Assistance 
program, an increase of $4,300,000 above the amount provided in 
the House and Senate bills and the same amount provided in 
fiscal year 1995. The conferees expect that domestic health 
assessment activities within the preventive health program will 
be administered in accordance with the decisions of the 
Secretary of Health & Human Services and direct the Department 
to notify the Appropriations Committee of such decisions in a 
timely manner. The conferees agree to the allocation of 
targeted assistance contained in the House Report 104-209.

                      social services block grant

      The conference agreement provides a mandatory 
appropriation for the Social Services Block Grant of 
$2,381,000,000. The House bill provided $2,520,000,000, and the 
Senate bill provided $2,310,000,000.

                 children and families services program

      The conference agreement includes $4,788,364,000, instead 
of $4,715,580,000 as proposed by the House and $4,743,604,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees agree with language in Senate Report 104-
145 which would allocate $1,500,000 under the developmental 
disabilities program for the fifth year of a 5-year 
demonstration project known as transition and natural supports 
in the workplace.
      It has come to the attention of the conferees that 
eligible Community Development Corporations serving remote 
rural areas have encountered difficulty in meeting some of the 
criteria for competing for Community Economic Development (CED) 
grants. The conferees strongly urge the Office of Community 
Services to adjust the criteria used in evaluating applications 
to take into account the unique aspects of job creation in 
remote rural areas, particularly as they relate to cost per job 
requirements.
      With respect to Head Start, the conference agreement does 
not include $250,000 proposed in Senate Report 104-145 to 
continue a demonstration program to train Head Start teachers 
in scientific principles. No funds were included for the 
program in the House bill.
      With respect to the transitional living program for 
runaway and homeless youth, the conferees are agreed that the 
increase provided over the fiscal year 1995 amount shall be for 
nine grantees whose grants expired in September, 1995 and who 
were unable to compete for fiscal year 1996 grants because of a 
departmental administrative oversight.
      The conference agreement includes an earmark of 
$435,463,000 for the Community Services Block Grant Act as 
proposed by the Senate. The House had earmarked the same amount 
in a different manner.

                        Administration on Aging

                        aging services programs

      The conference agreement includes $829,393,000, instead 
of $801,232,000 as proposed by the House and $831,027,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The agreement eliminates as separate line items the 
ombudsman program and the prevention of elder abuse program. 
Funds for these programs are earmarked in the bill within the 
supportive services and centers line item at the fiscal year 
1995 level.
      The agreement includes a legislative provision as 
proposed by the Senate that would prevent any State from having 
its administrative costs under title III of the Older Americans 
Act reduced by more than five percent below the fiscal year 
1995 level. The House had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes three specific funding 
levels identified in Senate Report 104-145 with respect to the 
aging research program.

                        Office of the Secretary

                    general departmental management

      The conference agreement includes $146,127,000, instead 
of $143,127,000 as proposed by the House and $137,127,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees have included an additional $2,000,000 for 
the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and 
Human Services. The conferees intend that none of these 
additional funds shall be available to the Office of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, the immediate office of the 
Assistant Secretary for Health, the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation or the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Public Affairs. The Secretary is requested to 
notify the Appropriations Committees of any employees detailed 
into these offices. The conferees commend the Secretary for the 
recent reorganization of her office and her decision to replace 
the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health with a smaller 
office which would serve as the senior advisor for health 
policy. The conferees direct that the Secretary provide the 
Appropriations Committees with the estimated funding levels and 
FTE levels for each of the individual offices for fiscal year 
1996 funded from this account as soon as possible after 
enactment of this bill.
      The conferees are agreed that funds are to be made 
available to the Office of Women's Health from funds available 
to the Department to carry out development and implementation 
of the national women's health clearinghouse.
      Sufficient funds have been included by the conferees for 
the continuation of the existing human services transportation 
technical assistance program at the fiscal year 1995 funding 
level.
      The agreement does not include a legal citation for the 
National Vaccine program as proposed by the Senate. The House 
bill included no citation. No funding is provided within this 
account for this program.
      The agreement includes a House provision identifying 
$7,500,000 for extramural construction within the Office of 
Minority Health. The Senate bill did not include this 
provision.

                      Office of Inspector General

      The conference agreement includes total funding for the 
Office of Inspector General of $79,162,000 as proposed by the 
Senate instead of $73,956,000 as proposed by the House. Of the 
total amount, $43,000,000 is provided in title VI of the Labor-
HHS-Education Appropriations Act as proposed by the House, and 
the balance of the funds are provided in this account.
      The agreement includes language proposed by the Senate, 
not included by the House, which would allow the Inspector 
General to expend funds transferred to it by the Departments of 
Justice or Treasury or the Postal Service as a result of asset 
forfeitures. The forfeitures would be from investigations in 
which the IG participated.

            public health and social services emergency fund

      The conference agreement includes $9,000,000 for the 
Emergency Fund as proposed by the Senate. The House bill 
included no provision for this.
      With respect to the $2,000,000 identified for the 
implementation of clinical trials related to the early 
detection of breast cancer, the conferees are agreed that those 
departmental agencies and institutes with substantial 
experience and expertise in these matters must be directly 
involved in the administration of this effort.

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS

      The conference agreement includes a limitation in the 
House bill which prohibits the use of funds for a statutory 
set-aside earmarking the first $5,000,000 of any funds 
appropriated for NIH extramural facility construction for 
primate centers. Instead, the conferees have reserved 
$2,500,000 of the NIH funds provided for extramural 
construction for primate centers. The Senate amendment had no 
similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes a provision limiting 
the amount of one percent evaluation set-aside funding that can 
be tapped from the Public Health Service agencies to amounts 
identified in the conference report prior to a report to 
Congress. The agreement also includes language prohibiting 
other taps and assessments unless reported to Congress. The 
House bill and the Senate amendment had similar language for 
the first provision; the House bill included language similar 
to the second provision.
      The conference agreement includes a general provision as 
proposed by the House that prohibits the funding of the Federal 
Council on Aging and the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and 
Neglect. The Senate had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement deletes language included in the 
Senate amendment pertaining to a rescission of Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding and a reallocation 
of funds in the agency's vaccine stockpile surplus. These 
provisions were included under a CDC heading in the House bill, 
which is reflected in the conference agreement.

                          (Transfer of Funds)

      The conference agreement includes a general provision as 
proposed by the House that would authorize the Department of 
Health and Human Services to transfer up to one percent of 
funds in any appropriation account to any other account in the 
Department, provided that the receiving account is not 
increased by more than three percent thereby and that the 
Appropriations Committees are notified at least 15 days in 
advance of any transfer. The Senate had no similar provision.
      The conferees have agreed to include this transfer 
provision to give the Department more flexibility in managing 
its appropriations. However, the continuation of this provision 
in the future will depend on the Department's achieving and 
maintaining audited financial statements in accordance with the 
Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and Office of Management 
and Budget Bulletin No. 93-06.

                          (Transfer of Funds)

      The conference agreement includes language permitting the 
Director of the National Institutes of Health jointly with the 
Director of the Office of AIDS Research to transfer up to 3 
percent among the Institutes, Centers, and the National Library 
of Medicine from the total identified in their apportionment 
for AIDS research. The transfer must take place within 30 days 
of enactment of the Act and Congress is to be promptly 
notified. The House bill and the Senate amendment had similar 
provisions.
      The conference agreement includes a provision in the 
House bill permitting the National Library of Medicine at the 
National Institutes of Health to enter into personal services 
contracts. The Senate amendment had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice a 
general provision proposed by the Senate that would deem an 
AFDC waiver submitted by the State of Texas under section 1115 
of the Social Security Act approved upon the date of enactment 
of this Act, notwithstanding the Secretary's authority to 
approve the application. The House had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes a provision in the 
Senate amendment requiring the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services to reimburse Medicaid claims for State-operated 
psychiatric hospitals between December 31, 1993 and December 
31, 1995 that the Secretary would otherwise intend to defer for 
reimbursement. The provision caps the total amount of claims 
that could be reimbursed at $54,000,000. The conferees added a 
provision establishing a new Medicaid matching formula for a 
State highly affected by disproportionate share hospital 
payments, effective for State fiscal years 1996-97 and 1997-98. 
The House bill had no similar provisions.
      The conferees are aware of a number of outstanding 
Medicaid issues which could not be addressed in this bill. Of 
particular concern is the 100 percent cap on funding for public 
hospitals as well as the dilemma faced by several States that 
have included a modified Federal matching payment in their 
fiscal year 1997 budgets, reflecting the effort made by the 
Congress in Medicaid Reform to address the current inequity 
faced by States with rates between 40 and 50 percent. The 
conferees understand the difficulties that many State Medicaid 
programs are experiencing, and urge that these important 
matters be addressed expeditiously by the authorizing 
committees.

                   TITLE III--DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

                            Education Reform

      The conference agreement includes $530,000,000 for 
Education Reform programs. Included in this amount is 
$350,000,000 for the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and 
language, proposed by the House, which prohibits the use of 
funds for Goals 2000 national programs. Also included is 
$180,000,000 for school-to-work programs. The House bill 
provided $484,500,000 for Education Reform activities, 
including a contingent appropriation of $389,500,000. The 
Senate amendment provided $536,000,000 and included 
$151,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 funding.
      The conference agreement amends the Goals 2000: Educate 
America Act. Specifically, the agreement includes language in 
title VII of the bill which:
      Permits school districts, in States that elect not to 
participate in the Goals 2000 program, to apply directly to the 
Secretary of Education for Goals 2000 funding, if the State 
education agency approves;
      Eliminates the requirement that States submit their 
improvement plans to the Secretary of Education for approval;
      Deletes the requirement for the composition of State and 
local panels that develop State and local improvement plans;
      Eliminates the National Education Standards and 
Improvement Council;
      Removes the requirement for States to develop 
opportunity-to-learn standards;
      Clarifies that no State, local education agency, or 
school shall be required, as a condition of receiving 
assistance under this title to provide outcomes-based 
education, or school-based health clinics; and
      Clarifies that nothing in the Goals 2000 legislation will 
require or permit any State or Federal official to inspect a 
home, judge how parents raise their children, or remove 
children from their parents.
      The conferees agree that a State education agency must 
give approval in order for a local educational agency to apply 
to the Secretary of Education for funding. A State educational 
agency is permitted to make a blanket approval or disapproval 
regarding the participation of local education agencies.
      Regarding the provision on alternatives to secretarial 
approval of State plans, the conferees agree that submission of 
such report and notification of amendments to previous State 
plans meets the requirements of section 306.
      The conferees agree that local education agencies, as 
part of their school improvement plan, can use their Goals 2000 
funds for the acquisition of computer technology and the use of 
technology-enhanced curricula and instruction. The Department 
of Education is encouraged to advise States that their Goals 
2000 funds may be used for this purpose.
      The conference agreement includes a provision, proposed 
by the Senate, which authorizes the Secretary of Education to 
grant up to six additional State education agencies authority 
to waive Federal statutory or regulatory requirements for 
fiscal year 1996 and succeeding fiscal years. The House bill 
contained no similar provision.

                    education for the disadvantaged

      The conference agreement includes $7,228,116,000 for 
Education for the Disadvantaged of which $1,298,386,000 becomes 
available on October 1, 1996for academic year 1996-97. The 
House provided an appropriation of $6,049,113,000 for this activity and 
a contingent appropriation of $961,000,000 for a total funding level of 
$7,010,113,000. The Senate amendment provided a fiscal year 1996 
appropriation of $6,513,511,000 and a fiscal year 1997 appropriation of 
$814,489,000 for a total funding level of $7,328,000,000. With respect 
to the fiscal year 1997 funding, it is the intent of the conferees to 
provide all funding for title I for the 1997-98 school year through the 
appropriation of fiscal year 1997 funds in the fiscal year 1997 Labor, 
Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies bill. The 
conferees intend that the committee work to adjust the fiscal year 1997 
602(b) allocations such that title I can be returned to a normal 
appropriations and obligation pattern.
      The conference agreement provides that up to $3,500,000 
of title I funds be made available to the Secretary to obtain 
local-education-agency level census poverty data from the 
Bureau of the Census.
      The agreement does not include provisions, included in 
the House bill, which would have overridden the provisions of 
title I regarding minimum State grants and language which would 
have eliminated a State option to reserve a portion of their 
title I funds for school improvement activities.

                               impact aid

      The conference agreement provides $693,000,000 for the 
Impact Aid program, the same as the House bill and an increase 
of $1,841,000 over the Senate amount of $691,159,000. In 
combination with the $35,000,000 provided for Impact Aid in 
P.L. 104-61, this appropriation provides a total of 
$728,000,000 for Impact Aid in fiscal year 1996, the same 
amount provided by Congress in fiscal year 1995.
      Within the total provided, the conference agreement 
includes $581,707,000 for Basic Support Payments, $1,304,000 
less than the House bill amount of $583,011,000 and $537,000 
above the Senate bill level of $581,170,000. The agreement also 
includes $16,293,000 for Payments for Federal Property, an 
increase of $1,304,000 over both the House and Senate bill 
amounts of $14,989,000.
      The conference agreement modifies a provision proposed by 
the Senate (Section 306) regarding unobligated Impact Aid 
construction funds. The agreement provides that one-half of 
such unobligated funds shall be awarded for the construction of 
public elementary or secondary schools on Indian reservations, 
and that one-half of such funds shall be made available to 
school districts with military impact according to section 8007 
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as amended.

                      school improvement programs

      The conference agreement includes $1,223,708,000 for 
School Improvement programs. The House bill provided 
$946,227,000 for programs in this account. The Senate provided 
$1,156,987,000 including $208,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 
appropriations.
      The conferees specifically provide for the following 
activity included in the Senate report:
      The funds provided for the Education of Native Hawaiians 
are allocated as follows:

Curricula Development, Teacher Training and Recruitment.      $1,500,000
Community-Based Education Learning Centers..............         800,000
Hawaiian Higher Education Programs......................       1,400,000
Gifted and Talented Program.............................       1,200,000
Special Education Programs..............................       1,200,000
Native Hawaiian Education Council and Island Councils...         300,000
Family-Based Education Centers..........................       5,600,000

      The agreement provides $465,981,000 for Safe and Drug 
Free Schools and Communities instead of the $400,000,000 
provided by both the House and Senate bills. This funding 
level, the same as in fiscal year 1995, provides for 
$440,981,000 for State Grants and $25,000,000 for National 
Programs.

                   bilingual and immigrant education

      The conference agreement provides $178,000,000 for 
Bilingual and Immigrant Education instead of the $150,000,000 
provided in the House and Senate bills.
      The conferees provided no funding for support services or 
professional development activities given their belief that 
funds should be focused on the education of students and the 
other funding sources available to the Secretary to fund these 
activities. However, if the Secretary feels that funding these 
activities within this account is justified, the two Committees 
will consider a reprogramming request from the Department.

                           special education

      The conference agreement includes $3,245,447,000 for 
special education programs, the same amount recommended by both 
the House and Senate bills.
      The conferees have also modified a provision proposed by 
the Senate to enable the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the 
Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau to be 
eligible to receive both formula and discretionary grants. The 
agreement also includes language proposed by the Senate that 
permits the Department of Education to distribute funding to 
the federal center and regional centers in proportion to the 
funding levels made available in the previous fiscal year.
      The conferees agree that Centers for the Deaf under Post 
Secondary Education programs should be awarded on a competitive 
basis instead of continuing the four existing centers as 
proposed in the Senate report.

            rehabilitation services and disability research

      The conference agreement includes $2,456,120,000 for 
Rehabilitation Services and Disability Research instead of the 
$2,452,620,000 proposed in both the House and Senate bills.
      The conference agreement includes $7,000,000 to support 
the Department of Education's portion of the fiscal year 1996 
Paralympic Games through funding the Atlanta Paralympic 
Organizing Committee. The House bill included $4,500,000 while 
the Senate bill contained no similar provision. The grantee 
shall provide such information as shall be required by the 
Department of Education, including a detailed statement of work 
and budget, and financial reports providing a breakout of the 
costs of the activities performed under the grant. The 
conferees have also provided funding for the Paralympic Games 
in the Department of Labor and in the Social Security 
Administration.
      The conferees increased funding for this account by 
$1,000,000 and direct the Department to use these funds to 
enable the two active regional head injury centers first funded 
in 1992 to continue serving as national resources to assist the 
States in improving the quality and cost effectiveness of 
services for victims of traumatic brain injury. The conferees 
direct the Rehabilitation Services Administration to work with 
the staffs of these regional centers to further develop plans 
of operation, including appropriate methods of organizing and 
coordinating State, private provider and victim support 
resources to improve the quality of traumatic brain injury 
services and for disseminating this information on a national 
basis. The centers are to work with the Department to present 
to the committees, by September 30, 1996, an evaluation plan of 
the present and planned services of the Centers and, upon 
approval, to implement the plan. In addition, the Department is 
instructed to work with the centers to develop a funding 
strategy that will eliminate the need for further federal 
funding for this national demonstration activity and to report 
to the Committees with such a plan by September 30, 1996.

                     vocational and adult education

      The conference agreement provides $1,340,261,000 for 
Vocational and Adult Education. The House bill provided 
$1,257,134,000 while the Senate bill included $1,340,638,000. 
The conference agreement eliminates the requirement for the 
establishment of State vocational education councils as a 
condition of receiving funding under the Carl D. Perkins 
Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.
      While the conferees have eliminated funding for State 
councils, the conferees have no objection to States using a 
portion of their Vocational Education funds for State councils 
or human resource investment councils.
      The conference agreement includes $4,723,000 for prisoner 
literacy programs, instead of $5,100,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill contained no similar provision.

                      student financial assistance

      The conference agreement specifies appropriations for 
Student Financial Assistance in Titles I and III of the Act. In 
the aggregate, the agreement appropriates $6,258,587,000, 
instead of $6,643,246,000 as proposed by the House and 
$6,165,290,000 together with $90,000,000 in contingent funding 
as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement sets the 
maximum Pell Grant at $2,470, an increase of $30 over the House 
passed maximum grant of $2,440 and $30 below the $2,500 maximum 
grant in the Senate bill. The maximum grant of $2,470 is the 
highest maximum grant ever provided.
      In the aggregate, the agreement provides $4,914,000,000 
in new budget authority for the Pell Grant program. This amount 
combined with $1,304,000,000 in funding which carries forward 
from previous years, makes available $6,218,000,000 in budget 
authority for Pell Grants in fiscal year 1996. The Senate bill 
included $4,814,000,000 and the House bill included 
$5,423,331,000.
      The conference agreement places a cap of 3,650,000 on 
Pell Grant participants in the 1995-1996 school year, as 
proposed by the House instead of 3,634,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. This cap will not deny awards to any eligible students 
and has been imposed to reflect the actual number of students 
receiving grants and actual program costs.
      The conference agreement provides $93,297,000 for new 
contributions to institutional revolving loan funds, an 
increase of $93,297,000 over the House bill which did not 
provide new capital contributions and a decrease of $64,703,000 
below the Senate bill level of $158,000,000.
      The conference agreement provides $31,375,000 for State 
Student Incentive Grants, a decrease of $32,000,000 below the 
Senate bill level of $63,375,000. The House bill did not 
provide funding for this program. The conferees have provided 
this funding with the understanding that no new funding will be 
provided for the program in fiscal year 1997. The conferees 
reiterate that all States have participated in this program 
since 1978, a sufficient period of time to develop independent 
and self-sufficient State grant Programs. According to the 
Department of Education, the federal appropriation for State 
Student Incentive Grants represent less than 2.5% of total 
State student assistance. The conferees believe that States 
have operated this program with a combination of State and 
federal funds for several years, and the termination of federal 
support for this program should not result in the termination 
or substantial downsizing of continuing State grant programs.

                            Higher Education

      The conference agreement provides $836,964,000 for Higher 
Education programs, the same amount included in the House and 
Senate bills. The agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate requiring the Department to award the same number of 
new Byrd Scholarships in fiscal year 1996 as were awarded in 
fiscal year 1995 and to prorate downward the amounts for new 
and continuing Byrd Scholarships to accommodate the awarding of 
new scholarships. The House bill did not include a similar 
provision.

                           howard university

      The conference agreement provides $182,348,000 for Howard 
University, an increase of $7,677,000 over the amount provided 
in both the House and Senate bills. The agreement includes 
$152,859,000 for the Academic program, $7,677,000 more than the 
amount in the House and Senate bills, and $29,489,000 for the 
University Hospital, the same amount provided in the House and 
Senate bills. The agreement also allows the University to use a 
part of its Academic program appropriation for the endowment at 
its discretion. The conferees direct that Howard notify the 
Congress of any transfer from the Academic program to the 
Endowment fund at least 15 days prior to execution of the 
transfer. The agreement does not provide funding for the 
research or construction programs.

             education research, statistics and improvement

      The conference agreement includes $351,268,000 for 
Education Research, Statistics and Improvement. The House bill 
included a fiscal year 1996 appropriation of $328,268,000 for 
this activity and a contingency appropriation of $23,000,000 
for a total funding level of $351,268,000. The Senate bill 
provided a total funding level of $338,268,000 through a fiscal 
year 1996 appropriation of $328,268,000 and a fiscal year 1997 
appropriation of $10,000,000.
      The agreement includes a provision proposed by the House 
that prohibits the use of federal funds to fund the Goals 2000 
Community Partnership program.
      The conference agreement earmarks $3,000,000 within the 
Fund for the Improvement of Education as proposed by the Senate 
for programs such as those authorized by Part E of title III of 
the ESEA for equipment and materials necessary for hands-on 
instruction through assistance to State and local agencies.
      With respect to the Regional Educational Laboratories the 
agreement includes $51,000,000. The conferees note that the 
current laboratories' contracts have removed substantial funds 
from the programmatic control of the individual laboratories' 
governing boards and pulled the laboratories programs of work 
away from the needs of educators and policymakers in the ten 
individual laboratory regions. It is the intent of the 
conferees that no funds provided be used for any purpose other 
than work that is determined by the priorities of the regional 
governing board of each individual laboratory. All funds 
provided to the Regional Educational Laboratories shall be 
allocated according to each laboratory's percentage of the 
total amount that was provided to the ten regional educational 
laboratories by the Department of Education on December 11, 
1995. Any special services requested by the Department of 
Education, other than the OERI National Educational Research 
Policy and Priorities Board for the purpose of aiding their 
oversight of federal education research and development 
program, shall be provided only if each Regional Educational 
Laboratory agrees that the priorities are consistent with its 
mission and the costs of such special services are reimbursed 
to each laboratory from the discretionary funds available to 
the Department. Further, the conferees direct the Secretary to 
survey each regional educational laboratory to establish that 
all funds provided serve the priority R & D needs identified by 
the regional education board of each laboratory, document any 
resource allocation or work priority concerns reported by the 
laboratories and provide a report of all concerns to the House 
and Senate Appropriations Committees not later than January 31, 
1997.
      The agreement also includes a provision proposed by the 
Senate that extends star school partnership projects that 
received continuation grants in fiscal year 1996.
      Due to the lateness in the fiscal year, conferees have 
provided that the funds provided for the International 
Education Exchange program should be used to continue current 
grantees.
      The conferees have not provided funding for the extended 
time and learning program. The Senate bill had included 
$2,000,000 for this purpose. The House bill contained no 
similar provision.

                               libraries

      The conference agreement includes $132,505,000 for 
library programs instead of $131,505,000 as proposed by both 
the House and Senate bills.
      Within the funds appropriated for library research and 
demonstration, the conferees have provided $1,000,000 for the 
Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation for a multi-
media project to document Holocaust survivor testimony. The 
conferees acknowledge and support the mission of the U.S. 
Holocaust Memorial Council and the role the council plays in 
developing and coordinating programs relating to the Holocaust. 
The $1,000,000 contained in this bill are to supplement the 
work of the council. These funds have been included for the 
Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation project 
because of the extraordinary nature of the work and 
contribution of Mr. Steven Spielberg. The conferees concur with 
the view that this direct grant will put the imprimatur of the 
U.S. government in a unique manner to repudiate any future 
claims that the Holocaust never occurred. Because of the 
special nature of this grant, the conferees do not view this as 
a precedent for future requests.
      The conferees also have provided $1,000,000 for the final 
phase of the portals demonstration project and, finally the 
conferees have provided $1,000,000 for the National Museum of 
Women in the Arts for activities associated with the archiving 
of works by women artists.

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS

      The conference agreement includes a general provision as 
proposed by the House that would prohibit the use of funds 
appropriated in the bill for opportunity to learn standards or 
strategies. The Senate had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language which reduces 
the fund available to the Secretary for the administration of 
the student loan programs, as provided under section 458 of the 
Higher Education Act. Section 458 provides mandatory spending 
for student loan administration in amounts which exceed what 
the Secretary needs for fiscal year 1996. By limiting the 
amount available to $436,000,000, compared to the $550,000,000 
allowed by the Higher Education Act, the agreement achieves 
savings of $114,000,000. To ensure appropriate scoring of this 
action by the Congressional Budget Office, the agreement also 
limits the authority in section 458 which would otherwise 
permit the Secretary to draw funds from fiscal year 1997 
amounts into fiscal year 1996.
      The agreement further provides that the Secretary will 
pay to guaranty agencies the administrative cost allowances 
owed such agencies for fiscal year 1995 in the amount currently 
estimated, $95,000,000. The agreement also provides that the 
Secretary will calculate and pay administrative cost allowances 
for fiscal year 1996 at the rate of 0.85 percent of the total 
principal amount of loans upon which insurance was issued on or 
after October 1, 1995. The estimated amount of such payments is 
$81,000,000.
      The agreement prohibits the Secretary from requiring the 
return of reserve amounts held by guaranty agencies in fiscal 
year 1996 except after consultation with the House and Senate 
authorizing committees. Any such amounts returned must be 
deposited in the Treasury to help reduce the deficit.
      No funds available to the Secretary may be used by the 
Secretary to pay administrative fees to institutions 
participating in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program.
      The conference agreement restricts the authority of the 
Secretary to hire advertising agencies or other third parties 
to provide advertising services to the Department for any 
student loan program. The Committee does not intend this 
language to limit the ability of the Secretary to obtain 
outside assistance to develop and issue informational brochures 
or similar material for the programs that help students, 
guidance counselors, student aid administrators, or others, 
learn such things as how the programs work or their terms and 
conditions.
      The conference agreement includes a general provision as 
proposed by the House modified to prohibit the use of funds 
appropriated in the bill for four specific boards and 
commissions currently funded by the Department of Education. 
The Senate had no similar provision.

                          (transfer of funds)

      The conference agreement includes a general provision as 
proposed by the House that would authorize the Department of 
Education to transfer up to one percent of funds in any 
appropriation account to any other account in the Department, 
provided that the receiving account is not increased by more 
than three percent thereby and that the Appropriations 
Committees are notified at least 15 days in advance of any 
transfer. The Senate had no similar provision.
      The conferees have agreed to include this transfer 
provision to give the Department more flexibility in managing 
its appropriations. However, the continuation of this provision 
in the future will depend on the Department's achieving and 
maintaining audited 
financial statements in accordance with the Chief Financial 
Officers Act of 1990 and Office of Management and Budget 
Bulletin No. 93-06.

                       TITLE IV--RELATED AGENCIES

             Corporation for National and Community Service

                  domestic volunteer service programs

                           operating expenses

      The conference agreement appropriates $198,393,000 for 
the Domestic Volunteer Service programs, an increase of 
$2,123,000 over the House appropriation of $196,270,000 and a 
decrease of $2,901,000 below the Senate appropriation of 
$201,294,000. The agreement provides $41,385,000 for regular 
VISTA Operations. No funding is specifically provided for the 
VISTA Literacy program, however, the conferees agree that funds 
may be used to conduct literacy activities previously funded by 
the VISTA Literacy program.

               Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service

      The agreement provides $32,896,000 for the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service, the same as the House bill 
and an increase of $500,000 over the Senate bill.

                     National Labor Relations Board

      The agreement provides $170,743,000 for the National 
Labor Relations Board, instead of $167,245,000 provided in both 
the House and Senate bills. The agreement also deletes language 
proposed by the House concerning the issuance of section 10(j) 
injunctions. The agreement includes language to prohibit the 
agency from promulgating a final rule on the appropriateness of 
requested single location bargaining units in representation 
cases.

                     Social Security Administration

                  supplemental security income program

      The agreement provides $18,545,512,000 for the 
Supplemental Security Income program, a decrease of $49,500,000 
below the Senate bill and $208,322,000 below the House bill. Of 
this amount, the managers have provided $1,500,000 to support a 
demonstration project relating to the Paralympic Games. The 
grantee shall provide such information as shall be required by 
the Social Security Administration, including a detailed 
statement of the activities to be supported under the grant and 
the budget for each activity, and financial reports documenting 
how the funds were actually expended.
      The agreement makes available an additional amount of 
$15,000,000 for the processing of Continuing Disability Reviews 
(CDRs), which was not included in the House or Senate bills, 
subject to concomitant adjustment of the Subcommittee's 602(b) 
allocation as permitted by P.L. 104-121.

                 Limitation on Administrative Expenses

      The agreement limits administrative expenditures to 
$5,821,768,000 for the Social Security Administration, a 
decrease of $23,415,000 below the Senate bill and $88,500,000 
below the House bill. The agreement includes bill language 
proposed by the Senate permitting the agency to retain any 
unobligated funds at the end of the fiscal year for its 
automation initiative.
      The agreement also includes an additional limitation of 
$60,000,000 for the processing of Continuing Disability Reviews 
(CDRs), which was not included in the House or Senate bills, 
subject to concomitant adjustment of the Subcommittee's 602(b) 
allocation as permitted by P.L. 104-121.
      The conferees strongly urge that SSA work with an 
industry-based consortium dedicated to improving software 
productivity, and with experience institutionalizing software 
processes and methods; sufficient funds have been included in 
the conference agreement for this purpose.

                       Railroad Retirement Board

                      limitation on administration

      The agreement provides a limitation for administrative 
expenses of $73,169,000 which may be derived from railroad 
retirement accounts. In combination with a limitation of 
$16,786,000 from the railroad unemployment insurance 
administration fund, the agreement provides a total of 
$89,955,000 for the administrative expenses of the Railroad 
Retirement Board, an increase of $861,000 above the Senate bill 
and a decrease of $861,000 below the House bill.

   Limitation on Railroad Unemployment Insurance Administration Fund

      The agreement provides a limitation on administrative 
expenses of $16,786,000 from moneys credited to the railroad 
unemployment insurance administration fund. Combined with a 
limitation of $73,169,000 on administrative expenses derived 
from the railroad retirement accounts, the agreement provides 
$89,955,000 for the administrative expenses of the Railroad 
Retirement Board, an increase of $861,000 over the Senate bill 
and a decrease of $861,000 below the House bill.

                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      The conference agreement deletes language contained in 
the House bill stating that States remain free not to fund 
abortions with Federal funds provided in the bill to the extent 
that the State deems appropriate, except where the life of the 
mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. 
The Senate amendment contained no similar provision. The 
conference agreement includes, as did both the House bill and 
the Senate amendment, the language from previous years 
prohibiting Federal funding of abortion except in the cases of 
rape, incest and endangerment of the life of the mother.
      The conference agreement modifies a provision proposed by 
the House and Senate bills to exclude from participation in the 
Pell Grant program institutions which are ruled to be 
ineligible to participate in a federal student loan program as 
a result of default rate determinations issued by the Secretary 
subsequent to February 14, 1996.
      The conference agreement includes a general provision 
proposed by the Senate to limit expenditures on cash 
performance awards to no more than one percent of amounts 
appropriated for salaries for each agency funded in the bill. 
In addition, the provision reduces the amounts otherwise 
appropriated for salaries and expenses in the bill by 
$30,500,000, to be allocated by the Office of Management and 
Budget, as proposed by the Senate. The House bill had no 
similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language contained in 
the Senate amendment which amends the Public Health Service Act 
to prohibit the Federal government and State and local entities 
who receive Federal financial assistance from discriminating 
against entities which refuse to provide or refer for provision 
of abortions or training to perform abortions. The provision 
requires the Federal government and State and local entities to 
deem an entity accredited that would be accredited except for 
accreditation requirements pertaining to the provision of 
abortions and abortion training. The House bill contained a 
similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language contained in 
the House bill which modifies the Medicare certification survey 
schedule for home health agencies to permit States greater 
flexibility to target resources on problem agencies in order to 
free up funds for certification of new facilities. The 
agreement also contains language not contained in the House 
bill that would permit expanded use by Medicare providers of 
private accreditation by national bodies for initial 
certifications and recertifications for those national bodies 
that can demonstrate that their accreditation assures 
compliance with all Medicare requirements. This ``deeming'' 
provision would not apply to renal dialysis facilities and 
durable medical equipment suppliers. There is no intent to 
change current law or current policy with respect to the 
deeming of skilled nursing facilities. The agreement also 
includes language not included in the House bill requiring the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study of 
and to report on the effectiveness and appropriateness of the 
current mechanisms for surveying and certifying skilled nursing 
facilities and renal dialysis facilities. The Senate amendment 
contained no similar provision.
      The conferees are concerned that quality of care not 
decline for the large and growing number of Medicare 
beneficiaries receiving home health services. All agencies 
should be surveyed at reasonable intervals with no more than a 
15 month schedule for those agencies with poor prior 
performance. If there is a change in ownership, surveys shall 
occur no less frequently than on a 15 month schedule. Within 
one year of enactment of this legislation the conferees direct 
HCFA to report to Congress on the status of implementation of 
this policy and the impact on quality of care for 
beneficiaries. In particular, the report shall contain data 
supporting HCFA's contention that quality of care will improve 
if resources are targeted on problem agencies.
      The conferees expect that the study and report required 
in this provision will include careful analysis of the adequacy 
of current nursing facility accreditation standards. Attention 
should be given to the cost effectiveness of expanding the use 
of voluntary private accreditation, and whether it is a tool 
for quality enhancement and as a means to enable government 
agencies to focus federal attention more directly on those 
nursing facilities which need increased oversight. The study 
should also review the information of accrediting bodies to 
determine whether it might assist HCFA to access data needed to 
monitor the performance of nursing facilities. The study should 
evaluate State-level changes in standards for accreditation of 
nursing facilities to determine the extent to which they have 
strengthened the safety net that is vital to assure a baseline 
of quality and consumer protection. Finally, the conferees are 
interested in innovative regulatory and nonregulatory 
incentives for all nursing facilities to continually improve 
the quality of services provided to Medicare and Medicaid 
patients. Therefore, the Secretary should include in the report 
whether such incentives would encourage and reward optimal 
performance with particular emphasis on improved patient 
outcomes.
      The conference agreement includes language in the Senate 
amendment requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
to grant a waiver under the Medicaid program to Charter Health 
Plan, Inc. of the District of Columbia of the requirement that 
no more than 75 percent of a managed care provider's enrollment 
may be Medicaid patients. The House bill had no similar 
provision.
      The conference agreement includes language requiring the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services to compile data on the 
number of females in the U.S. who have been subjected to female 
genital mutilation, to conduct outreach to communities that 
practice female genital mutilation, and to develop curriculum 
recommendations for medical schools regarding the practice. The 
Senate amendment contained a similar provision, but also 
established criminal penalties for those who performed the 
procedure on minors. The House bill had no similar provisions.

                  TITLE VI--ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS

      The conference agreement includes title VI of the bill 
proposed by the House modified to exclude Social Security 
Administration funding for continuing disability reviews. The 
House bill established a separate title VI which provided 
partial appropriations for three different appropriation 
accounts. It included $396,000,000 for HCFA Program Management 
for payment safeguard activities, $43,000,000 for the HHS IG 
for Medicare-related activities and $111,000,000 for the Social 
Security Administration administrative account for continuing 
disability reviews. These amounts, when combined with the 
amounts appropriated for these activities in the regular titles 
of the bill, provided full-year appropriations. Under the 
language in title VI, if a subsequent appropriation is enacted 
in another bill for FY 1996 for these activities, then the 
amount appropriated in title VI would be canceled. The Senate 
had no similar provision.

                          CONFERENCE AGREEMENT

      The following table displays the amounts agreed to for 
each program, project or activity with appropriate comparisons:


 DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND 
                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES

      Section 101(e). The conferees agree that House report 
104-384 is to be used as the guiding document for the 
departments, agencies, commissions, corporations, and offices 
under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate subcommittees on 
the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban 
Development and Independent Agencies, along with House report 
104-201 and Senate report 104-140. The following explanations 
are to be taken as clarifications or supplements to the 
directions contained in House report 104-384, dated December 6, 
1995 and Senate report 104-236 dated March 6, 1996.

                TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

                      Departmental Administration

                       general operating expenses

      Limits the amount of funds available for payroll costs of 
the Office of the Secretary not to exceed $3,206,000, instead 
of $2,766,000 as proposed by the House and deleting such 
limitation as proposed by the Senate. Deletes the salary 
limitations proposed by the House and stricken by the Senate 
for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy and 
Planning, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Congressional Affairs, and the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Public and Intergovernmental Affairs. The 
limitation of salary funds for the Office of the Secretary is 
the amount requested in the 1996 Budget and will support the 
current employment level.

                      construction, major projects

      Deletes language proposing contingent appropriations of 
an additional $70,100,000 for construction, major projects as 
proposed by the House and $16,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The approved major construction projects are as 
specified in House Report 104-384, the Conference Report and 
Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference on 
H.R. 2099.

                       administrative provisions

      Inserts section 108 authorizing the construction of 
outpatient clinics in Brevard County, FL, Travis Air Force 
Base, CA, and Boston, MA; leases at Ft. Myers, FL and New York, 
NY; and a research facility at Portland, OR. The conferees urge 
the VA to review its options to acquire additional land for the 
expansion of the Camp Butler National Cemetery.
      Inserts, as section 109, language designating the Walla 
Walla VA Medical Center as the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial 
VA Medical Center. The Senate proposed this language as a 
miscellaneous provision.
      Deletes a miscellaneous provision as proposed by the 
Senate that would require the VA to develop a plan for the 
allocation of health care resources. This matter was addressed 
in amendment numbered 14 of House Report 104-384, the Joint 
Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference on H.R. 
2099. The conferees note that the VA is currently developing 
the allocation plan.

         TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT

               Annual Contributions for Assisted Housing

      The conferees recommend decreasing the amount 
appropriated for annual contributions for assisted housing in 
H.R. 2099, from $10,155,795,000 to $9,818,795,000. The decrease 
of $337,000,000 is comprised of three components. First, 
$69,000,000 is taken from amounts available for property 
disposition activities associated with selling mortgages and 
properties acquired or held by the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA). Despite the decrease, the conferees 
understand the reduction will not materially impact the 
Department's ability to meet its statutory and policy 
responsibilities in disposing of these properties on a timely 
basis.
      Second, the conferees agree to add $25,000,000 to the 
$233,168,000 provided for the section 811 housing program for 
the disabled, and to add $50,000,000 to the $780,190,000 
provided for the section 202 housing program for the elderly. 
However, rather than spending the additional funding on new 
construction or acquisition of buildings, the funds must be 
applied to extending the contract terms of the rental 
assistance program.
      Finally, funding for renewing expiring or terminating 
section 8 subsidy contracts has been reduced from 
$4,350,862,000 to $4,007,862,000. Though the decrease will not 
reduce the number of households assisted under this program 
from the level specified in H.R. 2099, it will reduce the term 
of the rental assistance contracts from two years.
      H.R. 2099, the 1996 VA/HUD and Independent Agencies 
appropriations measure, included a provision designed to 
replace the Low Income Housing Preservation and Resident 
Homeownership Act (LIHPRHA) with a less expensive program that 
avoids dependence on continuing section 8 rental subsidies 
while, at the same time, preserves affordable housing 
opportunities for low-income families.
      The recently enacted Housing Opportunity Program 
Extension Act of 1996 incorporated the provisions of the 
revised preservation program contained in H.R. 2099. Due to 
delays, however, the calendar deadlines utilized in this 
legislation for filing and for funding eligibility 
determinations are no longer valid and must be adjusted. 
Therefore, the conferees have adjusted dates to conform the 
provisions in the Extension Act.
      As a further refinement of the revised preservation 
program, the conferees have added a third criteria for the 
Department to utilize in setting appropriate rents for 
properties. This change will enable properties which utilize 
the capital loan/capital grant program to retain working 
families in affordable housing developments and to achieve an 
appropriate mix of income levels.

Public Housing Demolition, Site Revitalization, and Replacement Housing 
                                 Grants

      The conferees are aware of the urgent need to accelerate 
the demolition of distressed public housing developments and 
have agreed to provide $200,000,000 above the amount 
recommended in H.R. 2099 for the severely distressed public 
housing program. This addition increases funding for the 
program from $280,000,000 to $480,000,000.
      The HOPE VI program was created in 1992 as a means to 
replace obsolete public housing developments aggressively with 
homes that are architecturally appealing, have lower densities, 
and are better suited to the needs of low-income families and 
their surrounding neighborhoods. In the last four years, the 
Department has found it necessary to refine PHA plans after 
awarding the grants, usually because of complicated financing 
associated with the construction of these developments. The 
formal competition process required by the Act, however, 
constrains HUD from being able to make changes on a timely 
basis. Therefore, to facilitate actual site demolition and 
rehabilitation, the conferees have deleted a requirement for a 
formal competition regarding how these funds are awarded. In 
place of a formal competition, HUD plans to utilize a 
comprehensive, merit-based selection process.

             Drug Elimination Grants for Low-Income Housing

      The conference agreement permits the Secretary to waive 
the requirement to set aside a portion of these funds for the 
youth sport program, though the activity remains an eligible 
activity of the program. This requirement has been burdensome 
for both the Department and public housing authorities to 
administer.
      Noting the importance and need to fight crime in public 
housing and to create safe environments for low-income 
families, the conferees have decided to fully fund the Drug 
Elimination Grant program despite dwindling discretionary 
resources. There is, however, a significant crime problem that 
plaques the assisted housing portfolio. Unfortunately, the 
owners of these properties do not have access to funding from 
the drug elimination program. It is the opinion of the 
conferees that the authorizing committee should consider this 
problem and rectify it with appropriate legislation.

                   Community Planning and Development

                      community development grants

      At the request of the Secretary, the conferees agree to 
set-aside $50,000,000 from the community development block 
grant account for economic development initiatives to be made 
available pursuant to a competitive selection process.

                       Administrative Provisions

        Extend Administrative Provisions From the Rescission Act

      The conferees agree that it is critical to deregulate the 
public and assisted housing portfolios by providing them with 
the greatest degree of flexibility possible, and therefore 
agree to expand the eligible uses of modernization funds to 
capital purposes.
      The conferees believe that mixed-income developments, 
where the portion of apartments dedicated to low-income 
families are indistinguishable from the remaining market-rate 
apartments, will foster safe neighborhoods and will provide for 
fiscally viable developments. Therefore, the conferees 
recommend inclusion of several provisions designed to 
facilitate their creation and financing.

                         employment limitations

      The conferees agree to increase the number of assistant 
secretaries to eight from the seven provided in H.R. 2099, but 
have retained the provisions regarding the levels of Schedule C 
and noncareer SES employees. HUD is directed to present a plan 
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by 
September 30, 1996, that describes its reorganization strategy, 
including:
      (1) the organizational structure, including the number of 
field offices, regional offices, and FHA offices;
      (2) the programmatic staffing levels required to meet the 
needs and services identified in HUD's mission statement;
      (3) the responsibilities and duties of headquarters, the 
field offices, regional offices and FHA offices, the services 
they will provide, and the level of programmatic staff 
necessary to carry out these functions;
      (4) the relationship between Headquarters and the field 
offices, regional offices, and FHA offices; and
      (5) the annual schedule by which the Secretary intends to 
reduce staff to 7,500 by the year 2002.
      If the level of FTEs required to administer the programs 
effectively is greater than 7,500, the Secretary must justify 
the increase.

                         repeal of frost-leland

      Although the conferees agree to repeal the Frost-Leland 
amendment, it was not agreed that the City of Dallas be 
reimbursed for expenses it incurred demolishing a public 
housing project in West Dallas pursuant to a court order.

                         fha assignment program

      The conferees have amended provisions of the Balanced 
Budget Downpayment Act, I, which reformed the FHA Assignment 
Program. The first change corrects terminology included in that 
Act. Additionally, because of delays in enacting this 
appropriations measure, several dates used in the original 
legislation are no longer valid and have been changed. First, 
the effective date of the reform has been changed to the date 
of enactment of this legislation to prevent a circumstance 
where people who applied for assignment after March 15, 1996, 
would find the program retroactively terminated. Thirty days 
after enactment, HUD is required to issue regulations. The 
second date change allows the reforms to be utilized for all 
mortgages executed during fiscal year 1996 and in prior years.

 changes to state of new york's community development block grant and 
                             home programs

      To ensure that the CDBG Small Cities program in the State 
of New York is operated as efficiently as possible, the 
conferees agree to limit the amount of funds made available for 
multi-year commitments to 35 percent. Additionally, the 
conferees agree to provide the State of New York's HOME funds 
directly to the Chief Executive Officer of the State, to be 
used in accordance with provisions of law.

                    minimum rent tenant protections

      The conferees agree that every public housing and section 
8 housing resident who receives the benefit of housing 
assistance should contribute at least $25 towards their rent. 
There may be occasions, however, where families are 
experiencing serious financial hardship and cannot afford even 
the most minimal contribution. Therefore, a provision has been 
added to allow the Secretary or a public housing agency to 
waive the minimum rent requirement to provide a transition 
period for affected families not to exceed three months.
      The conferees have agreed to delete a provision proposed 
in H.R. 2099 which would have directed the transfer of fair 
housing enforcement responsibilities to the Department of 
Justice.

                    TITLE III--INDEPENDENT AGENCIES

                       Department of the Treasury

           community development financial institutions fund

                            program account

      The conferees agree to provide $45,000,000, instead of 
$50,000,000 as proposed by the Senate and $25,000,000 as 
proposed as a contingency by the House. The conferees also 
agree to remove legislative provisions restricting the size of 
the staff for this effort.

             Corporation for National and Community Service

       national and community service programs operating expenses

      Appropriates $400,500,000 for National and Community 
Service Programs Operating Expenses as proposed by the Senate, 
instead of termination, or $383,500,000 if offsetting savings 
were found, as proposed by the House. The recommended amount is 
$69,500,000 below the 1995 level and $416,976,000 below the 
budget request.
      The bill includes language eliminating grants to Federal 
agencies. This will permit all money to be directed outside of 
the Federal bureaucracy and should help reduce the cost per 
participant.
      The conferees are aware of recent commitments by the 
Corporation to improve the management of the AmeriCorps program 
and reduce costs. In addition to eliminating grants to federal 
agencies, such actions include decreasing the reliance on 
federal funds by increasing the matching requirement for 
private funds, reminding sponsors of all prohibited activities, 
including lobbying and partisan political activities, improving 
grant reviews, and expanding efforts in program evaluation. It 
is the conferees' intent that the appropriating and authorizing 
committees will carefully monitor the Corporation's activities 
to ensure that the agreed to reforms are carried out and to 
prevent any abuses in the future.
      The conferees agree to include the Sense of the Congress 
language proposed by the Senate. This language urges the 
President to nominate expeditiously a Chief Financial Officer 
and to implement as quickly as possible the recommendations of 
the independent auditors to improve the financial management of 
the Corporation's funds. The language also urges the 
Corporation to submit a reprogramming proposal for up to 
$3,000,000 to carry out financial management system reforms if 
the Chief Financial Officer determines such additional 
resources are needed.

                      office of inspector general

      Appropriates $2,000,000 for the Office of Inspector 
General. The conferees expect that the Inspector General will 
periodically report to the Congress on progress in improving 
the Corporation's financial management systems and in 
developing auditable financial statements.

                    Environmental Protection Agency

                         science and technology

      The conferees agree to a technical change to House Report 
104-384 related to the Mine Waste Technology program. The 
science and technology account includes $3,000,000 for this 
program, in lieu of funding in the hazardous substance 
superfund account.

                 environmental programs and management

      The conferees agree to provide $127,000,000 in addition 
to the amount proposed for environmental programs and 
management in H.R. 2099. Of this amount, the conferees agree 
that up to $40,000,000 is available for enforcement activities.
      In 1994, under the U.S. Global Climate Change Action 
Plan, the Administration approached developing countries about 
undertaking joint activities to reduce global emissions. The 
joint implementation project thus established encourages 
partnerships between businesses and non-governmental 
organizations in the United States and developing countries, 
offering the potential to achieve greater emission reductions 
worldwide than would be possible with each country acting 
alone. Recognizing that meaningful near-term reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions can only be realized through 
voluntary, public-private relationships such as the joint 
implementation program, the conferees urge that from the funds 
provided for the climate change action plan, the Agency provide 
$3,000,000 for completion of climate change country studies and 
development of developing country national action plans and 
$7,000,000 for joint implementation plan activities.

                        buildings and facilities

      The conferees agree to provide $50,000,000 in addition to 
the amount proposed for buildings and facilities in H.R. 2099. 
This additional funding is for the first phase of construction 
of a new consolidated research facility at Research Triangle 
Park, North Carolina. The conferees agree that the total 
construction cost for this new research facility shall not 
exceed $232,000,000.

                     hazardous substance superfund

      The conferees agree to provide $150,000,000 in addition 
to the amount proposed for hazardous substance superfund in 
H.R. 2099. The conferees agree that such additional funds, 
$100,000,000 of which become available on September 1, 1996, 
are for clean-up response and enforcement activities, subject 
to normal reprogramming guidelines. The conferees agree that 
$2,000,000 of this additional amount is for worker training 
grants under NIEHS, bringing this program to $18,500,000 for 
fiscal year 1996.

                   state and tribal assistance grants

      The conferees agree to provide $490,000,000 in addition 
to the amount proposed for environmental programs and 
infrastructure assistance under state and tribal assistance 
grants in H.R. 2099. Of this additional amount, $448,500,000 is 
for capitalization grants, $3,500,000 is for a water 
distribution system grant in the South Buffalo/Kittaning area, 
Pennsylvania, $25,000,000 is for a special projects grant for 
Boston Harbor for a total of $50,000,000 in fiscal year 1996, 
and $13,000,000 is for a construction grant for wastewater 
treatment facilities in Watertown, South Dakota. Of the 
$448,500,000, $225,000,000 is for Safe Drinking Water State 
Revolving Fund capitalization grants which, added to the 
$275,000,000 proposed in H.R. 2099 and the $225,000,000 
provided in previous appropriations acts, brings the total 
available for the Safe Drinking Water SRF to $725,000,000. All 
of these funds shall be available if authorization for such SRF 
is enacted prior to August 1, 1996, however, if no such 
authorization is enacted prior to August 1, 1996, these funds 
will become available for wastewater capitalization grants.
      The conferees understand the Agency has convened a 
federal advisory committee to address water pollution issues 
related to wet weather. The conferees believe that EPA should 
take advantage of the many stakeholders concerned about 
stormwater at the table and use this opportunity to see if 
these participants can reach consensus on a simplified, 
environmentally protective, workable, cost-effective stormwater 
program for municipalities regardless of population and all 
entities whether or not they are already covered under the 
Phase I NPDES program.
      Finally, the conferees note that $700,000 of funds 
proposed in H.R. 2099 for Manns Choice and $100,000 of funds 
proposed in H.R. 2099 for Taylor Township, Pennsylvania, be 
used for wastewater treatment facility improvements in Juniata 
Terrace Borough, Mifflin County, Pennsylvania ($250,000) and 
Curwensville Borough-Pike Township, Clearfield County, 
Pennsylvania ($150,000) and for combined sewer overflow 
improvements for Logan Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania 
($400,000).

                       administrative provisions

      The conferees have included bill language in section 304 
which transfers real property located in Bay City, Michigan to 
the City of Bay City or another municipal entity. In addition, 
up to $3,000,000 of previously appropriated funds shall be 
provided to the recipient of such real property for necessary 
environmental remediation and rehabilitation costs of the 
property. It is the intent of the Conferees that the recipient 
of the property shall accept full responsibility for compliance 
with any applicable environmental conditions and that the 
Agency's liability shall terminate upon transfer.
      The conferees have agreed to delete a provision proposed 
in H.R. 2099 which prohibited the use of funds to implement 
section 404(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as 
amended.

                   Executive Office of the President

  council on environmental quality and office of environmental quality

      The conferees agree to provide $1,150,000 in addition to 
the amount proposed in H.R. 2099, for a fiscal year 1996 total 
of $2,150,000 for CEQ. The conferees agree that CEQ and OEQ 
should not augment their workforce by utilizing personnel paid 
for by appropriations provided to any other Federal agency or 
department.

                Department of Health and Human Services

                       office of consumer affairs

      The conferees have agreed to provide $1,800,000 for the 
Office of Consumer Affairs. Neither the House or the Senate had 
included this funding in the bill.

             National Aeronautics and Space Administration

      The conferees agree to provide $83,000,000 for Science, 
Aeronautics and Technology in addition to the amounts proposed 
in H.R. 2099. Distribution of the additional funding is to be 
addressed in the NASA operating plan for fiscal year 1996 and 
is subject to final approval by the Committees on 
Appropriations of the House and Senate.
      The conferees do not agree that all NASA aircraft 
consolidation should be held in abeyance pending the final 
reports of the NASA Inspector General and the General 
Accounting Office as proposed by the Senate. The conferees note 
that in a letter dated March 8, 1996, the Inspector General 
endorsed an alternative aircraft consolidation plan which would 
leave in place five aircraft currently based at Lewis Research 
Center, Langley Research Center, and Wallops Island. Therefore, 
the conferees agree that the consolidation of these aircraft 
should await final resolution of the issues addressed in the 
initial report by the NASA Inspector General with regard to 
consolidation savings.
      The conferees are concerned with NASA's unexpected recent 
announcement regarding additional and accelerated personnel 
reductions at NASA headquarters. This announcement was made 
without prior consultation with the Congress. The proposed 
reduction is disproportionately excessive relative to the 
aggregate funding profile for this agency. Such substantial 
staffing reduction may jeopardize NASA's ability to manage 
adequately programs of continuing priority to the Congress and 
the Nation. Therefore, the conferees direct NASA to suspend 
immediate implementation of the administrative steps to execute 
this proposed reduction-in-force, pending full consideration by 
the Congress of the agency's budget for fiscal year 1997.
      The conference agreement also includes two new 
administrative provisions. The first provision ensures that 
section 212 of Public Law 104-99 remains in effect as if 
enacted as part of this Act. The second new provision urges 
NASA to fund Phase A studies for a radar satellite initiative.

                      National Science Foundation

      The conferees agree to provide an additional $40,000,000 
for Research and Related Activities for the National Science 
Foundation. The effect of this adjustment is a net reduction of 
$140,000,000 from the budget request as compared to a reduction 
of $180,000,000 proposed in H.R. 2099.

                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      The conference agreement includes a general provision 
which supersedes section 201(b) of Public Law 104-99.

                 TITLE II--SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS

                               CHAPTER 1

      DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG 
                  ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES

                       Department of Agriculture

                   Food Safety and Inspection Service

      The conferees retain bill language included by the Senate 
to earmark funds appropriated to the Food Safety and Inspection 
Service for in-plant inspection personnel. The House-passed 
bill contained no similar provision. Providing sufficient funds 
to fully cover the salaries and expenses of in-plant 
inspections mandated by current law was the priority of 
Congress in the fiscal year 1996 appropriations Act. The 
conferees regret that it has become necessary to earmark funds 
for in-plant inspector salaries and expenses, but because the 
agency could not provide assurances that it would fulfill the 
intent of Congress, the conferees found this as the only 
alternative available.

                 natural resources conservation service

               watershed and flood prevention operations

      The conference agreement provides a supplemental 
appropriation of $80,514,000 for Watershed and Flood Prevention 
Operations to repair damages to waterways and watersheds 
resulting from flooding in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast 
blizzards, floods, and other natural disasters instead of 
$73,200,000 as proposed by the House and $107,514,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conferees encourage the Department, 
when repairing projects with funds appropriated for Emergency 
Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, to do so with the 
intent of minimizing future costs and flooding.
      The conference agreement provides that the entire amount 
shall be available only to the extent that an official budget 
request for $80,514,000 is submitted that includes designation 
of the entire amount as an emergency requirement.
      The conference agreement also provides that if the 
Secretary of Agriculture determines that the cost of land and 
restoration of farm structures exceeds the fair market value of 
affected cropland, the Secretary may use sufficient amounts 
``not to exceed $7,288,000'' from funds provided under this 
heading to accept bids from willing sellers to provide 
conservation easements for cropland inundated by floods, as 
provided for by the Wetlands Reserve Program.

                    consolidated farm service agency

                     emergency conservation program

      The conference agreement provides a supplemental 
appropriation of $30,000,000 for the Emergency Conservation 
Program for expenses resulting from floods in the Pacific 
Northwest and other natural disasters as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $24,800,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
proposed by the Senate that the entire amount be available 
subject to an official budget request from the Administration.

            rural housing and community development service

              rural housing insurance fund program account

      The conference agreement provides a supplemental 
appropriation of $5,000,000 for section 502 direct loans and 
$1,500,000 for section 504 housing repair loans for emergency 
expenses resulting from flooding in the Pacific Northwest, the 
Northeast blizzards and floods, Hurricane Marilyn, and other 
natural disasters as proposed by the Senate. The House bill 
proposed a total of $6,500,000 for both section 502 direct 
loans and section 504 housing repair loans.
      The conference agreement provides that funds be used for 
the cost of modifying loans as defined in section 502 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
proposed by the Senate that the entire amount be available 
subject to an official budget request from the Administration.

                 very low-income housing repair grants

      The conference agreement provides a supplemental 
appropriation of $1,100,000 for emergency expenses resulting 
from flooding in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast blizzards 
and floods. Hurricane Marilyn, and other natural disasters as 
proposed by both the House and Senate. The conference agreement 
does not include a provision proposed by the Senate that the 
entire amount be available subject to an official budget 
request from the Administration.

                        rural utilities service

                   rural utilities assistance program

      The conference agreement provides a supplemental 
appropriation of $11,000,000 for direct loans and grants of the 
Rural Utilities Assistance Program and the Emergency Community 
Water Assistance Program to assist in the recovery from 
flooding in the Pacific Northwest and other natural disasters 
as proposed by the Senate. The House bill proposed separate 
appropriations of $5,000,000 for the Emergency Community Water 
Assistance Program and $6,000,000 for the Rural Utilities 
Assistance Program. The conference agreement also provides that 
funds be used for the cost of modifying loans as defined in 
section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as proposed 
by the House.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
proposed by the Senate that the entire amount be available 
subject to an official budget request from the Administration.

                      commodity credit corporation

              emergency livestock feed assistance program

      The conference agreement does not provide $10,000,000 of 
Commodity Credit Corporation funds for cost-sharing assistance 
under provisions consistent with the Emergency Livestock Feed 
Assistance Program as proposed by the House. The Senate bill 
contained no similar provision. The Department has indicated 
that livestock producers who are eligible for cost-sharing 
assistance under the Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance 
Program will continue to be eligible for this assistance 
provided a valid contract for this program has been signed 
prior to enactment of new legislation.

                  supplemental and rescission requests

      As part of its fiscal year 1996 supplemental and 
rescission requests, the Administration proposed a rescission 
of $12,000,000 from Cooperative State Research, Education, and 
Extension Service, Buildings and Facilities, and supplemental 
requests of $2,500,000 for the U.S.-Israel Binational 
Agricultural Research and Development Fund program and 
$9,500,000 for the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The 
conference agreement does not include these proposals.

                           general provisions

      The conference agreement deletes the administrative 
provision proposed by the Senate that would have allowed the 
Secretary to transfer funds provided in this Chapter between 
accounts included in this Chapter. The House bill contained no 
similar provision.

                             seafood safety

      The conference agreement provides that any domestic fish 
or fish product produced in compliance with food safety 
standards or procedures accepted by the Food and Drug 
Administration shall be deemed to have met any inspection 
requirements of the Department of Agriculture or other Federal 
agency for any Federal commodity purchase program, and that the 
Department or other Federal agency may utilize lot inspection 
to establish a reasonable degree of certainty that such fish or 
fish product meets Federal product specifications as proposed 
by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar provision.

                               farm loans

      The conference agreement includes language that allows 
the Department of Agriculture to make or guarantee an operating 
or an emergency loan to a loan applicant who was less than 90 
days delinquent on April 4, 1996, if the loan applicant had 
submitted an application for the loan prior to April 5, 1996. 
The recently enacted Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform 
Act altered conditions under which loans could be made at the 
time of enactment. This provision allows those borrowers, whose 
application had been submitted, to complete the process. The 
provision also provides that no applicant may be more than 90 
days delinquent.

                               CHAPTER 1A

                Department of Health and Human Services

                      food and drug administration

                      food and drug export reform

      The conference agreement includes a modification of 
language included in both the House and Senate versions of the 
bill allowing the export of certain unapproved drugs, 
biologicals, animal drugs, and medical devices. The provision 
allows pharmaceuticals and medical devices not approved in the 
United States to be exported to any country in the world if the 
product complies with the laws of that country and has valid 
marketing authorization in one of the following countries: 
Australia; Canada; Israel; Japan; New Zealand; Switzerland; 
South Africa; or the European Union or a country in the 
European Economic Area. The Secretary is given authority to add 
countries to the list based on criteria set forth in the 
conference agreement.
      The conference agreement also sets forth criteria upon 
which the Secretary may allow direct export of a drug not first 
approved in one of the listed countries. However, devices were 
not included because under current law devices may be exported 
to any country after the Secretary determines that the export 
of the device is not contrary to public health and the import 
is permitted into the importing country. In addition, the 
conference agreement sets forth conditions under which the 
Secretary may approve the export of a drug or device which is 
used for tropical diseases or other diseases not of significant 
prevalence in the United States. To approve an application 
under this section, the Secretary must find that the medical 
product will not expose patients to an unreasonable risk of 
illness or injury and that the probable health benefits 
outweigh the risk of injury or illness, taking into account 
currently available treatments and their economic 
accessibility.
      In general, a medical product may not be exported under 
this provision unless it is unadulterated, accords to the 
specifications of the foreign manufacturer, complies with the 
laws of the importing country, is labeled for export, and is 
not sold in the U.S. The drug or device must be manufactured in 
substantial conformity with good manufacturing practices 
applicable to that specific product or else be in compliance 
with recognized international standards. The Secretary may 
prohibit exports of products which are found to pose an 
imminent hazard.
      Any person who exports a drug or device may request the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify in writing 
that the exportation is legal. A fee of up to $175 is 
authorized for issuance of each written export certification. 
The conferees intend that fees be established on a sliding 
scale to minimize the impact on small business.

                   import components used for export

      The conference agreement also allows import of certain 
articles, which cannot now be lawfully imported, used in the 
manufacture of drugs, biological products, devices, foods 
(including dietary supplements), food additives, and color 
additives if the finished products are then exported. Under 
this provision, importers must provide the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services with notification of the initial 
importation, maintain records of such imports, and destroy any 
component not used in an exported product. The agreement also 
allows import of certain blood and tissue products provided 
they comply with the Public Health Service Act requirements, or 
the Secretary allows such imports. The Secretary could make 
such a determination, for example, where a blood component is 
imported from a country which has laws and regulations relating 
to the collection and processing of blood; the products are in 
compliance with such requirements; the importer assures that 
such products are segregated from U.S. products, that 
contamination of equipment is prevented, and that records are 
maintained and made available to the Secretary to verify such 
assurances; and that the importer performs such tests as the 
Secretary may require.

                            patent extension

      The conference agreement includes a provision that would 
extend a patent on a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. 
Congressional hearings held on this issue support the claims 
that the Food and Drug Administration took an unreasonable 
length of time in the approval process for this drug. The 
provision provides a two year extension.

                               CHAPTER 2

DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED 
                                AGENCIES

                         DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

                  Economic Development Administration

                economic development assistance programs

      The conference agreement includes $18,000,000 for 
emergency expenses related to recovery and mitigation efforts 
associated with flooding in the Pacific Northwest and other 
disasters, to remain available until expended and to be 
available only pursuant to an official budget request that 
declares the funds to be emergency. The Senate bill proposed 
$25,000,000 for emergency expenses resulting from flooding, and 
$2,500,000 to be transferred to Salaries and Expenses. The 
House bill contained no similar provision.

            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

                              construction

      The conference agreement includes $7,500,000 in emergency 
funds for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 
(NOAA) ``Construction'' account. The House bill provided no 
funds for this purpose; the Administration request was 
$10,000,000. These funds are to support the immediate repair of 
fish hatcheries along the Columbia River which experienced 
severe damage from the recent flooding in the Northwest.
      The conferees note that the National Marine Fisheries 
Service funds the Mitchell Act Hatcheries. If additional funds 
are needed for repairs in this instance, the conferees 
understand that funds are available within existing amounts at 
the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) and 
would encourage FEMA to give every consideration to 
applications received in relation to this flood damage.

                DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCIES

                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE

                   Administration of Foreign Affairs

                    diplomatic and consular programs

      The conference agreement includes no emergency funding 
for State Department operations to offset operating costs being 
incurred in Bosnia as a result of the Dayton Accords, as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill included $2,000,000.

                            RELATED AGENCIES

                    United States Information Agency

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes no emergency funding 
for United States Information Agency operations to offset 
operating costs being incurred in Bosnia as a result of the 
Dayton Accords, as proposed by the Senate. The House bill 
included $1,000,000.

                             RELATED AGENCY

                     Small Business Administration

                     disaster loans program account

      The conference agreement provides $71,000,000 for subsidy 
costs associated with the SBA Disaster Loans Program, instead 
of $72,300,000 as proposed by the House and $69,700,000 as 
proposed by the Senate, as an emergency appropriation to remain 
available until expended, to allow for additional loan volume 
in response to declared disasters.
      In addition, the conferees have included $29,000,000, for 
administrative expenses under this account, instead of 
$27,700,000 as proposed by the House and $30,300,000 as 
proposed by the Senate, as an emergency appropriation to remain 
available until expended, to support SBA's disaster activities 
in response to declared disasters.
      The conferees are concerned about the manner in which SBA 
budgets for, and administers, disaster assistance funds. The 
conferees are disturbed that during development of the 
supplemental funding requirements, SBA identified $79,000,000 
in unspent prior year funding not previously known to SBA. In 
addition, SBA indicated a shortfall in disaster administrative 
expenses, even though the conferees had already fully funded 
SBA's request for these expenses. The conferees expect disaster 
funding to be used only for the purpose for which it was 
provided, and to accurately budget for and administer these 
funds.
      Therefore, the conferees direct the SBA to provide, not 
later than May 30, 1996, a report to the House and Senate 
Appropriations Committees on the obligation of administrative 
expenses funding to date in fiscal year 1996, and to provide an 
updated report on August 15, 1996. These reports should 
identify the following: (1) each headquarters' office receiving 
administrative funding, the total funding provided, and the 
number of FTE supported; (2) the total funding and FTE 
(permanent and temporary) provided to each field location, the 
date the field location was established, the expected duration 
of employment for temporary employees for each location, and 
the expected termination date for each location; and (3) the 
total loan volume by location.

                               CHAPTER 3

                      Department of Defense--Civil

                         Department of the Army

                       corps of engineers--civil

                         general investigations

      The conference agreement includes language contained in 
section 3007 of the Senate bill to permit the Secretary of the 
Army to utilize funds previously appropriated for the St. Louis 
Harbor, Missouri, project for the Upper Mississippi River and 
Illinois Waterway navigation study. The conferees agree that 
they will work to restore funds to the St. Louis Harbor project 
in the future as needed.

                   operation and maintenance, general

      The conference agreement includes $30,000,000, the same 
as the budget request, for the repair of damages to Corps of 
Engineers projects caused by severe flooding in the Northeast 
and Northwest as proposed by the House and the Senate. The 
conferees have also agreed to adopt the language contained in 
the House bill.

                 flood control and coastal emergencies

      The conference agreement includes $135,000,000, the same 
as the budget request and the amount proposed by the House and 
the Senate, for the Corps of Engineers to repair damage to non-
Federal levees and other flood control works located in states 
affected by the Northeast and Northwest floods of 1996 and 
other natural disasters, and to replenish funds transferred 
from other accounts for emergency work pursuant to the 
authority of the Secretary of the Army contained in Public Law 
84-99. The conferees have also agreed to adopt the language 
contained in the House bill.

                       Department of the Interior

                         bureau of reclamation

                          construction program

      The conference agreement includes $9,000,000, the same as 
the budget request and the amount proposed by the House and the 
Senate, for the Bureau of Reclamation to continue emergency 
repairs at Folsom Dam in California. The conferees have also 
agreed to delete funding requested by the President and 
proposed by the Senate for the payment of claims associated 
with flooding in March of 1995 in California's San Joaquin 
Valley.

                          Department of Energy

                    atomic energy defense activities

                        other defense activities

      The conference agreement includes an additional 
$15,000,000 to accelerate activities in the Materials 
Protection, Control and Accounting program to improve 
facilities and institute national standards to secure 
stockpiles of weapons usable fissile materials in Russia and 
the Newly Independent States. No similar provision was included 
in the House bill, the Senate bill, or the budget request.

                    Power Marketing Administrations

 construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance, western area 
                          power administration

                          (transfer of funds)

      The conference agreement provides for the transfer of 
$5,500,000 from this account to the account ``Operation and 
Maintenance, Alaska Power Administration'', as proposed by the 
House bill and budget request, only for necessary termination 
expenses of the Alaska Power Administration. The Senate bill 
did not contain this provision.

                  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

      The conference agreement deletes language contained in 
section 3017 of the Senate bill providing for a limited waiver 
of annual charges for the Flint Creek Project in Montana.

                               CHAPTER 4

       Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs

                  funds appropriated to the president

                          unanticipated needs

      unanticipated needs for defense of israel against terrorism

      The conference agreement provides $50,000,000 for 
emergency expenses necessary to meet unanticipated needs for 
the acquisition and provision of goods, services, and/or grants 
for Israel necessary to support the eradication of terrorism in 
and around Israel as proposed by the Senate. The conferees 
further agree that none of the funds appropriated in this 
paragraph shall be made available except through the regular 
notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations. 
The conferees expect the aid to be provided consistent with 
information transmitted to the Committees on Appropriations in 
a classified document on March 25, 1996. The House bill 
contained no similar provision.

                          military assistance

                   foreign military financing program

      The conference agreement provides $70,000,000 for grant 
Foreign Military Financing for Jordan as proposed by both the 
House and Senate. The conference agreement also provides that 
such funds may be used for Jordan to finance transfers by lease 
of defense articles under chapter 6 of the Arms Export Control 
Act. These funds will be used to support the transfer of 16 F-
16 fighter aircraft to the Government of Jordan. The conferees 
also note that the overall downsizing of the U.S. defense 
industry is costing thousands of American defense-related jobs. 
The conferees therefore direct the Department of Defense to 
give priority consideration to American defense firms in 
awarding contracts for upgrades and other major improvements to 
these aircraft prior to their delivery to the Government of 
Jordan.

                               CHAPTER 5

            Department of the Interior and Related Agencies

      Agency Priorities. The managers have not agreed to 
statutory language, proposed by the Senate in section 1203 of 
Title II, chapter 12, which would have mandated the allocation 
of emergency supplemental funds based on agency prioritization 
processes. The managers understand that the initial estimates 
of emergency requirements that have been provided are based on 
very preliminary information and that those initial estimates, 
because of time constraints, may not have included every 
project which needs to be addressed. The managers expect each 
agency to develop on-the-ground estimates of all its natural 
disaster related needs and to address these needs consistent 
with agency priorities.
      Contingent Appropriations. The availability of those 
portions of the appropriations detailed in this chapter that 
are in excess of the Administration's budget request for 
emergency supplemental appropriations are contingent upon 
receipt of a budget request that includes a Presidential 
designation of such amounts as emergency requirements as 
defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985, as amended.

                       Department of the Interior

                       bureau of land management

                        construction and access

      An additional $5,000,000 in emergency supplemental 
appropriations for Construction and Access is made available as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $4,242,000 as proposed by the 
House. Of this amount, $758,000 is contingent upon receipt of a 
budget request that includes a Presidential designation of such 
amount as an emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.

                   oregon and california grant lands

      An additional $35,000,000 in emergency supplemental 
appropriations for Oregon and California Grant Lands is made 
available as proposed by the Senate instead of $19,548,000 as 
proposed by the House. Of this amount, $15,452,000 is 
contingent upon receipt of a budget request that includes a 
Presidential designation of such amount as an emergency 
requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.

                united states fish and wildlife service

                          resource management

      An additional $1,600,000 in emergency supplemental 
appropriations for Resource Management is made available as 
proposed by the Senate instead of no funding as proposed by the 
House. The entire amount is contingent upon receipt of a budget 
request that includes a Presidential designation of such amount 
as an emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget 
and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.

                              construction

      An additional $37,300,000 in emergency supplemental 
appropriations for Construction is made available as proposed 
by the Senate instead of $20,505,000 as proposed by the House. 
Of this amount, $16,795,000 is contingent upon receipt of a 
budget request that includes a Presidential designation of such 
amount as an emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
      The managers have neither agreed to bill language, 
proposed by the Senate, earmarking specific funds for Devils 
Lake, ND nor to report language earmarking funds for other 
locations. The Service should carefully consider the needs at 
Devils Lake, ND and at Kenai, AK as it allocates funds.

                         national park service

                              construction

      An additional $47,000,000 in emergency supplemental 
appropriations for Construction is made available as proposed 
by the Senate instead of $33,601,000 as proposed by the House. 
Of this amount, $13,399,000 is contingent upon receipt of a 
budget request that includes a Presidential designation of such 
amount as an emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.

                    united states geological survey

                 surveys, investigations, and research

      An additional $2,000,000 in emergency supplemental 
appropriations for Surveys, Investigations, and Research is 
made available as proposed by the Senate instead of $1,176,000 
as proposed by the House. Of this amount, $824,000 is 
contingent upon receipt of a budget request that includes a 
Presidential designation of such amount as an emergency

                         MILITARY CONSTRUCTION

     North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program

      The conference agreement includes an additional 
$37,500,000 for the NATO Security Investment Program, as 
provided in both the House and Senate bills. In addition, the 
conference agreement includes rescissions totaling $37,500,000 
to offset this additional appropriation, as explained in Title 
III of this report.

                           GENERAL PROVISION

      The conferees agree to language proposed by the Senate 
which gives the Secretary of the Army discretionary authority 
to convey approximately five acres of land in Hale County, 
Alabama. The House bill contained no similar provision.

                               CHAPTER 7

                    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--MILITARY

                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS

      The House recommended a total of $782,500,000, designated 
as emergency appropriations pursuant to the Budget Act, for 
additional incremental U.S. military costs associated with the 
Bosnia operation, including the NATO-led Peace Implementation 
Force (IFOR) and Operation Deny Flight. The Senate recommended 
$777,700,000 in new appropriations, none of which were 
designated emergency. The House and Senate each fully offset 
their respective supplemental funding through rescissions of 
funds previously provided in Department of Defense 
Appropriations Acts.
      The conference agreement provides a total of 
$820,000,000, all designated as emergency appropriations. This 
amount is fully offset by rescissions contained in Title III, 
Chapter 6 of the conference agreement. A summary of the 
conference agreement by appropriations account is as follows:

                           MILITARY PERSONNEL

      The conference agreement recommends a total of 
$298,800,000 for costs of active and reserve military personnel 
pay and allowances. The conferees believe they have met the 
most urgent military personnel requirements for the Bosnia 
operation, and expect the Department to keep the Committees on 
Appropriations advised of any revisions to these estimates.

                       OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

      The Department of Defense requested a total of 
$270,500,000 for operation and maintenance to fund the 
incremental costs of U.S. participation in the NATO-led Bosnia 
Peace Implementation Force (IFOR). The conferees recommend 
$495,200,000, an increase of $224,700,000 above the 
supplemental request, to provide for additional requirements of 
the Army and the Air Force.

                              PROCUREMENT

                       Composite Shaft Fairwaters

      The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal 
Year 1996 contained $3,000,000 in ``Other Procurement, Navy'' 
for procurement of composite shaft fairwaters for CG-47 
cruisers. The Navy recently conducted testing of composite 
shaft fairwaters and demonstrated extended life, reduced 
maintenance, and improved capability for removing fairwaters 
while a ship is waterborne. The Navy concluded, however, that 
the most cost-effective approach is to incorporate this new 
technology into Aegis destroyers while under construction 
rather than to retrofit Aegis cruisers. The conferees therefore 
direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to submit a 
fiscal year 1996 transfer of $3,000,000 from ``Other 
Procurement, Navy'' to ``Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy'' 
using standard reprogramming procedures.

               RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION

            Ballistic Missile Defense Management and Support

      The conferees note that a total increase to the budget of 
$528,939,000 was provided for Ballistic Missile Defense 
programs in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1996. 
This total included a recommendation contained in the National 
Defense Authorization Act, 1996, which cut $30,000,000 from the 
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's (BMDO) Program 
Management and Support program element.
      In executing the additional tasks and responsibilities 
required by the fiscal year 1996 program funding increases, it 
has become clear that the burden on the BMDO Program Management 
and Support program element has actually increased. To minimize 
this impact, Congressional action to date in proposed 
reprogrammings and rescissions has rejected the application of 
any inflation reductions to BMDO accounts. This bill includes a 
provision which further prohibits the application of any 
portion of the proposed inflation reductions against BMDO 
program elements.
      However, these restorations still leave BMDO with the 
challenge of managing activities in the appropriate program 
elements Therefore, the conferees hereby restore the 
$30,000,000 reduction made to the Program Management and 
Support program element. BMDO shall internally manage this 
restoration by reallocating funds preciously identified as 
excess because of decreased inflation estimates. The inflation 
decreases shall be applied proportionally to each BMDO RDT&E 
program element and project. The Director, BMDO, shall provide 
the congressional defense committees a statement detailing the 
specific decreases as applied to all program elements.

               Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency

      The conferees direct that $500,000 of the funds provided 
for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency may be 
available to purchase photographic technology to support 
research in detonation physics. The Director of Defense 
Research and Engineering shall provide the congressional 
defense committees with a plan for the acquisition and use of 
this instrument no later than may 29, 1996.

             Joint DOD-DOE Munitions Technology Development

      The conferees direct that $2,000,000 of the fiscal year 
1996 funds allocated to the Joint DOD-DOE Munitions Technology 
Development program element shall be used to develop and test 
an open-architecture machine tool controller.

                  Electronic Commerce Resource Centers

      The FY 1996 Defense Appropriations conference agreement 
directed the transfer of the managerial responsibility for the 
Electronic Commerce Resource Centers program to the Defense 
Logistics Agency. Information from the Department has 
subsequently come to the conferees' attention indicating that 
the next implementation stage for this program can best be 
accomplished under the direction of Deputy Under Secretary of 
Defense for Logistics. The conferees endorse such action and 
direct that a transfer of ECRC managerial responsibility to the 
Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics be accomplished 
expeditiously under the overall program guidance expressed in 
the FY 1996 Defense Appropriations conference report.

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS

                       General Transfer Authority

      Section 2701 of the conference agreement amends both 
House and Senate provisions regarding the amount of additional 
transfer authority provided under Section 8005 of the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, 
by providing $700,000,000 in additional transfer authority. The 
conferees direct that the additional transfer authority 
provided herein shall be available only to the extent funds are 
transferred, or have been transferred during the current fiscal 
year to cover costs associated with United States military 
operations in support of the NATO-led Peace Implementation 
Force (IFOR) in and around the former Yugoslavia.

                             F-15E Aircraft

      The conference agreement includes a technical amendment 
(Section 2702) requested by the Department of Defense and 
contained in the Senate bill, which is needed to permit the 
obligation of funding which was both authorized and 
appropriated in fiscal year 1996 for the procurement and 
advance procurement of F-15E aircraft.

                       C-17 Multiyear Procurement

      The conferees strongly support the multiyear procurement 
of eighty C-17 advanced transport aircraft and have agreed to 
bill language (Section 2703) authorizing the Air Force to begin 
a seven-year multiyear program.
      However, the conferees also agree that additional savings 
potentially can be generated from an accelerated multiyear 
procurement of the C-17 over six program years. Therefore, 
Section 2703 also directs the Secretary of Defense to enter 
into negotiations with the C-17 aircraft and engine prime 
contractors for contract alternatives for multiyear procurement 
over a six-year period.
      The conference agreement prevents the exercise of the 
multiyear authority until the Secretary of Defense certifies 
that the Air Force will save more than 5 percent in the price 
for eighty C-17 aircraft under a multiyear contract as compared 
to annual lot procurement. The savings must exceed the total 
amount of $895.3 million shown in the ``Multiyear Procurement 
Criteria Program: C-17'' document submitted to the 
Appropriations Committees on February 29, 1996.
      In calculating the savings from the multiyear proposals, 
the conferees direct that the weapon system budget estimates 
submitted with the C-17 multiyear procurement exhibits be used 
as the baseline. The conferees also direct that in conjunction 
with the certification required by section 2703(c) of the C-17 
multiyear bill language, the Secretary of Defense shall submit 
a new multiyear justification exhibit package which reflects 
the additional savings achieved over the original multiyear 
proposal submitted by the Administration.
      The conferees believe that the seven-year authority 
should enable the Air Force to generate savings significantly 
in excess of the $895.3 million reflected in the original 
multiyear proposal. It is the conferees' intent that the 
additional savings should be realized from multiyear contracts 
currently being negotiated. In addition, the conferees believe 
that a six-year multiyear plan has the potential to generate 
even greater savings.
      The conferees also agree to provisions delaying the 
exercise of the multiyear authority to the earlier of May 24, 
1996, or the day after enactment of a subsequent Act 
authorizing entry into a C-17 multiyear contract. The Secretary 
of Defense also is required to provide a detailed program plan 
for a six-year multiyear procurement by May 24, 1996.

                                SEMATECH

      Section 2704 of the conference agreement amends a Senate 
amendment and provides $50,000,000 for SEMATECH. This amount is 
fully offset by rescissions in Title III, Chapter 6 of the 
conference report.

             Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid

      The conference agreement includes Section 2705, as 
proposed by the Senate, which provides authority to transfer up 
to $15,000,000 in support of specific activities associated 
with humanitarian assistance activities related to landmines.

                  Environmental Restoration Activities

      Section 2706 of the conference agreement amends a Senate 
provision making $15,000,000 of ``Operation and Maintenance, 
Army'' funding available in order to complete the Army's 
remaining environmental remediation activities in recognition 
of its 1988 agreement with National Presto Industries, Inc.

                Discharge of HIV-Positive Servicemembers

      Section 2707 of the conference agreement includes a 
Senate provision regarding the discharge of HIV-positive 
servicemembers.

                          B-52 Force Structure

      Section 2708 of the conference agreement amends a Senate 
provision and adds $44,900,000 to ``Operation and Maintenance, 
Air Force'' for the operation and maintenance of 94 B-52H 
bomber aircraft in active status or in attrition reserve. This 
amount is fully offset by rescissions in Title III, Chapter 6 
of the conference report. The conferees express their intent to 
not recommend additional funding for B-52 aircraft in excess of 
the Air Force's stated requirements unless the Air Force 
revises its bomber force inventory estimates.

                          Mine Countermeasures

      Section 2709 of the conference agreement includes an 
additional $10,000,000 for Shallow Mine Countermeasure 
Demonstrations. This restores a general reduction made to this 
account earlier in fiscal year 1996. These additional funds are 
fully offset by rescissions in Title III, Chapter 6 of the 
conference report. The conferees believe the Navy has recently 
presented a more compelling strategy for developing countermine 
warfare technology centered around a joint exercise with Army, 
Navy, and Marine Corps forces of the U.S. Atlantic Command in 
1998. The additional funds provided in the conference agreement 
will enable the Navy to test a number of promising technologies 
that would otherwise miss the 1998 exercise completely or else 
be demonstrated at less than full scale. The Navy has indicated 
that it plans to use $5,000,000 to allow the Advanced 
Lightweight Influence Sweep System to be tested in the 1998 
exercise with a full scale magnet, and $5,000,000 would be used 
for the Explosive Neutralization Advanced Technology 
Demonstration and Advanced Degaussing.

                         Army Medical Research

      Section 2710 of the conference agreement transfers 
$8,000,000 of previously appropriated ``Defense Health 
Program'' funds to the ``Research, Development, Test and 
Evaluation, Army'' account in order to continue research of 
neurofibromatosis. The Army has an ongoing successful research 
program in this area. This makes a technical clarification to 
the designation for this activity in the Fiscal Year 1996 
Defense Appropriations conference agreement and involves no 
additional funds.

                          Counter-Drug Support

      Section 2711 of the conference agreement authorizes the 
Department to make grants to local counternarcotic task forces 
in a high crime, low income area under its Counter Drug program 
to provide Kevlar vests for enhanced personal protection.

                               HAVE GAZE

      In Section 2712 the conferees have recommended language 
to clarify Section 8105 of Public Law 104-61 with respect to 
the use of fiscal year 1995 funds appropriated for this Air 
Force RDT&E program.

                               CHAPTER 8

                      DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

                        Office of the Secretary

                        payments to air carriers

                    (airport and airway trust fund)

      The conference agreement includes language that limits 
obligations from the airport and airway trust fund to 
$22,600,000 for payments to air carriers, as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill contained no similar provision.
      This limitation permits the obligation of general fund 
carryover balances to pay outstanding commitments in fiscal 
year 1996.

                     Federal Highway Administration

                          federal-aid highway

                          (highway trust fund)

      The conference agreement appropriates $300,000,000 for 
the emergency fund to cover expenses resulting from the 
flooding in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Northwest states, 
and other disasters, as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$267,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement waives the provisions of 23 
U.S.C. 125(b)(1), which limit obligations to a single state 
resulting from a single natural disaster to $100,000,000, as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.

                    Federal Railroad Administration

                     local rail freight assistance

      The conference agreement deletes the Senate appropriation 
of $10,000,000 to repair and rebuild rail lines of other than 
class I railroads damaged as a result of the floods of 1996. 
The House bill contained no similar appropriation.

                     Federal Transit Administration

                       mass transit capital fund

                (liquidation of contract authorization)

                          (highway trust fund)

      The conference agreement includes an appropriation of 
$375,000,000 to liquidate contract authority obligations for 
mass transit capital programs as proposed by both the House and 
Senate.

                            Related Agencies

                        Panama Canal Commission

                      panama canal revolving fund

      The conference agreement increases the limitation on 
administrative expenses of the Panama Canal Commission by 
$2,000,000, to be derived from the Panama Canal revolving fund, 
as proposed by the House. The Senate bill contained no similar 
provision.

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS

      The conference agreement deletes the Senate provision 
that allows $3,250,000 of the Federal Transit Administration's 
discretionary grants program for Kauai, Hawaii, to be used for 
operating expenses. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.
      The conference agreement includes a provision that 
requires the Federal Highway Administration to make available 
up to $28,000,000 in federal-aid obligation limitation to the 
State of Missouri to make obligations for construction of a new 
bridge in Hannibal, Missouri, from limitation set asides for 
discretionary programs or limitation on general operating 
expenses for fiscal year 1996. The provision further requires 
restoration of that limitation before any funds made available 
for the August redistribution prescribed in section 310 of 
Public Law 104-50 may be distributed. This provision shall not 
affect the federal-aid bonus limitation provided by section 
310. The Senate bill contained a provision that advances 
emergency relief funds to the State of Missouri for the 
replacement in kind of the Hannibal bridge on the Mississippi 
River. The House bill contained no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes a provision that 
permits the state of Vermont to use up to $3,500,000 of the 
discretionary grants identified in the conference agreement 
accompanying Public Law 104-50 provided to the state and the 
Marble Valley Regional Transit District for improvements to 
support commuter rail operations on the Clarendon-Pittsford 
rail line between White Hall, New York, and Rutland, Vermont. 
The Senate bill allowed the State of Vermont to obligate funds 
apportioned to the state under the surface transportation and 
congestion mitigation and air quality improvement programs for 
railroad capital and/or operating expenses. The House bill 
contained no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language that provides 
the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration 
discretion to take into consideration unique circumstances in 
the State of Alaska when making certain changes to specified 
regulations, effective until June 1, 1997. The House and Senate 
bills contained no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes a provision that 
specifies that the unobligated funds provided for the Chicago 
central area circulator project in Public Law 103-122 and 
Public Law 103-331 be available only for constructing a 5.2-
mile light rail loop within the downtown Chicago business 
district as described in the full funding grant agreement 
signed on December 15, 1994, and shall not be available for any 
other purpose. The House and Senate bills contained no similar 
provision.

                               CHAPTER 9

                       DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

                          Departmental Offices

                         salaries and expenses

      Deletes provision proposed by the Senate as part of the 
Administration's initiative to combat middle eastern terrorism, 
which included $3,000,000 for the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control.

                     UNITED STATES CUSTOMS SERVICE

                   customs services at small airports

      Deletes provision in P.L. 104-52 capping collections for 
Customs services at small airports at $1,406,000 as proposed by 
the House. The Senate had no comparable provision.

                        INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

          administrative provisions--internal revenue service

      Amends P.L. 104-52 by adding a new provision which sets a

Senate had no comparable provision.

    EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE 
                               PRESIDENT

                 Office of National Drug Control Policy

                         salaries and expenses

      Provides that $1,000,000 of the amounts available to the 
Counter-Drug Technology Assessment Center shall be used for 
conferences on model state drug laws as proposed by the House. 
The Senate had no comparable provision.
      Appropriates an additional $3,400,000 for the salaries 
and expenses of the Office of National Drug Control Policy as 
requested by the Administration, instead of no additional 
funding as proposed by the House and $3,900,000 as proposed by 
the Senate. This will provide resources for an additional 80 
full-time equivalent positions and overhead expenses for 30 
military detailees, raising the complement of ONDCP to 154 
positions by the end of the fiscal year.
      ONDCP has a strategic mission: to aid and oversee 
operational agencies in coordinating the national drug control 
policy. The Congress never intended ONDCP to become an 
operational entity, but instead to formulate, direct, and 
oversee the implementation of the annual drug control strategy 
using the expertise of line agencies. The conferees are 
concerned that a rapid expansion in staffing that is not 
carefully thought out will result in ONDCP duplicating the 
functions of already existing programs and agencies.
      To ensure that this does not occur, the conferees direct 
the Director of ONDCP to submit a detailed staffing plan to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of 
enactment of this legislation. Such plan shall include an 
organizational chart, a detailed description of the function of 
each component of the office, and a detailed description of the 
duties associated with each position.

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS

        Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service

      Includes a provision which increases, by four, the 
membership of the Commission on Restructuring the Internal 
Revenue Service as proposed by the Senate. The House had no 
comparable provision.

                               CHAPTER 10

 DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND 
                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES

              DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT

                   COMMUNITY PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT

                      COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT GRANTS

      The Conferees agree to provide $50,000,000 for the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development Community 
Development Block Grant Program for emergency activities 
related to recent Presidentially declared flood disasters.

                  FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY

                            disaster relief

                     (including transfer of funds)

      The conference agreement includes language allowing up to 
$104,000,000 by transfer from the disaster relief account to 
the disaster assistance direct loan program account for the 
cost of direct loans as authorized by section 417 of the 
Stafford Act. Language is included which limits community 
disaster loan authority to $119,000,000, requires that the 
Director of FEMA certify that the provisions of section 417 of 
the Stafford Act will be complied with and requires that the 
entire amount of this transfer is available only to the extent 
that an official budget request for a specific dollar amount is 
forwarded to the Congress. The conferees fully expect that 
these terms be complied with in an expeditious manner so as to 
release necessary loan funds to meet known emergency disaster 
needs of the Virgin Islands.

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS

            waiver of statutes or regulations for assistance

      The conference agreement retains a provision proposed by 
the Senate allowing the Secretary of any department to waive 
any statute or regulation that the Secretary administers in 
connection with the obligation of funds for domestic 
assistance. The Secretary may also specify alternative 
requirements to the statutes or regulation being waived. Civil 
rights, fair housing and nondiscrimination, the environment, 
and labor standards statutes and regulations could not be 
waived. The Secretary must find that the waiver is required to 
facilitate the obligation of the assistance and would not be 
inconsistent with the statute or regulation being waived. The 
House bill contained no similar provision.
      This provision has been included in past disaster 
appropriations bills. The managers expect this provision to be 
implemented in a manner similar to past practices and only in 
those cases where not waiving the statutes or regulations would 
cause unnecessary and significant delays in assistance.

              priorities of allocation of emergency funds

      The conference agreement deletes a provision proposed by 
the Senate that funds for emergency or disaster assistance 
programs for USDA, HUD, EDA, SBA, the National Park Service and 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could be allocated in 
accordance with the prioritization process of the respective 
department. The House bill contained no similar provision.
      In developing this conference agreement, the managers 
have carefully developed the priority considerations for 
funding the various activities included in it. For the most 
part, there are no restricting allocations imposed in this 
conference agreement on the funding provided for disaster 
assistance. Priorities on allocations have only been imposed 
where specific concerns needed to be addressed. Because these 
matters were addressed on a case by case basis, this general 
provision has been deleted.

                      disaster assistance offsets

      The conference agreement deletes a provision proposed by 
the Senate that the conference agreement should include 
sufficient reductions and savings to offset the funding 
provided for disaster assistance. The House bill, which did 
include offsets for disaster funding, contained no similar 
provision. Since this conference agreement does include the 
necessary offsets, this provision has been complied with and is 
no longer necessary.

                budget treatment of disaster assistance

      The conference agreement deletes a provision proposed by 
the Senate to have Congress address the manner in which 
disaster assistance is provided and develop a long-term funding 
plan for the budget treatment of disaster assistance funding. 
The House bill contained no similar provision.
      This matter has been reviewed several times, and the 
managers agree that another review and analysis would only 
delay any decision on possible changes in how the budget 
treatment of these type appropriations is handled. The 
conferees agree that the results of previous analyses should be 
considered as future budget resolutions are developed to see if 
any changes might be warranted.

                      restriction on expenditures

      The conference agreement deletes a provision proposed by 
the Senate that would have restricted non-defense expenditures 
to certain fixed amounts if the funds in this conference 
agreement and other previous Acts would cause these amounts to 
be exceeded. The House bill contained no similar provision.
      Because the funding included in this conference agreement 
is either within the spending limits or is offset herein, this 
provision is no longer necessary.

                 ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS

      On April 12, 1996, the President forwarded to the 
Congress a supplemental appropriations request for various 
counter-drug programs. The conferees express their intent to 
fund these additional requirements in the fiscal year 1997 
appropriations process.

                   TITLE III--RESCISSIONS AND OFFSETS

                               CHAPTER 1

                      ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT

    subchapter a--united states enrichment corporation privatization

      The conference agreement includes language contained in 
the Senate bill authorizing the Board of Directors of the 
United States Enrichment Corporation to transfer the interest 
of the United States in the United States Enrichment 
Corporation to the private sector.

       subchapter b--bonneville power administration refinancing

      The conference agreement includes language contained in 
section 3003 of the Senate bill regarding refinancing of 
Bonneville Power Administration debt.

                               CHAPTER 2

       FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS

                    EXPORT AND INVESTMENT ASSISTANCE

                EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES

                         subsidy appropriation

                              (rescission)

      The conference agreement rescinds $42,000,000 of the 
unobligated balances available under this heading instead of 
$41,000,000 as proposed by the House. The Senate had proposed a 
rescission of $25,000,000 from funds made available under this 
heading in Public Law 104-107.

                               CHAPTER 3

            DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES

                          DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

                      strategic petroleum reserve

      The managers have agreed to sell $227,000,000 worth of 
oil from the Weeks Island site of the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve (SPR). The Weeks Island site in Louisiana is currently 
being decommissioned and the oil is being relocated to other 
SPR locations because of a water intrusion problem. This sale 
is proposed to offset partially additional funding provided for 
high priority education programs identified by the 
Administration. To pay for decommissioning of the site, 5.1 
million barrels of the 70 million barrels of Weeks Island oil 
have already been sold in fiscal year 1996. An additional 12 
million to 15 million barrels will need to be sold to realize 
$227 million in revenues.

                               CHAPTER 4

     DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION

                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

      The conference agreement includes a provision as proposed 
by the Senate rescinding funding available but unclaimed by 
States under the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program.

                        DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

      The conference agreement includes a provision that was 
not included in either the House or Senate bill reducing the 
amount of new funding for the Pell Grant program by 
$53,446,000. Because of the substantial amount of funding 
carrying forward in FY 1996 from previous appropriations, this 
reduction will not reduce the amount of funding actually 
expended for Pell Grants in FY 1996.
      The conference agreement does not include a general 
provision proposed by the Senate (section 3014) that expressed 
the sense of the Senate with respect to funding for the Low 
Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

                               CHAPTER 5

                         MILITARY CONSTRUCTION

                             (rescissions)

      The conference agreement rescinds a total of $37,500,000 
from funds appropriated for fiscal year 1996 (Public Law 104-
32), instead of no rescissions as proposed by both the House 
and the Senate. The conferees agree to rescind the following 
sums from the following accounts:

Military Construction, Army.............................      $6,385,000
Military Construction, Navy.............................       6,385,000
Military Construction, Air Force........................       6,385,000
Military Construction, Defense-wide.....................      18,345,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Total.............................................      37,500,000

      The conferees agree to rescissions in the Army, Navy, and 
Air Force accounts in order to bring the fiscal year 1996 
appropriation amounts into conformance with authorization. The 
conferees emphasize that the construction programs funded by 
these accounts will not be changed by these rescissions, and 
that no project will be reduced in scope or canceled.
      With regard to the ``Military Construction, Defense-
wide'' account, the conferees agree to the following 
rescissions:

Energy Conservation Investment Program..................     $10,000,000
Planning and Design.....................................       8,345,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Total.............................................      18,345,000

      In the case of the Energy Conservation Investment 
Program, the conferees agree to the rescission of $10,000,000 
in order to bring the program into conformance with 
authorization, and $40,000,000 remains available for this 
program in fiscal year 1996. In the case of Planning and Design 
funds, the conferees agree to the rescission of $8,345,000 
which is not required at this time, and $60,492,000 remains 
available in fiscal year 1996.

                               CHAPTER 6

                    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--MILITARY

                             (rescissions)

      The House and Senate bills contained rescissions proposed 
by the President or transfers of previously appropriated 
Department of Defense funding in order to fully offset the new 
defense appropriations in their respective bills. In this 
chapter, the conferees recommend total rescissions of 
$994,900,000, which totally offset the new appropriations 
contained in Title II, Chapter 7 of the conference report, as 
well as funds provided for the transfer of F-16 aircraft to 
Jordan in Title II, Chapter 4.
      A summary of rescissions showing House, Senate, and 
conference recommendations by appropriation account is in the 
following table:

                               CHAPTER 7

                      DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

                    Federal Aviation Administration

                       grants-in-aid for airports

                    (airport and airway trust fund)

                 (rescission of contract authorization)

      The conference agreement includes a rescission of 
$664,000,000 in contract authority from the grants-in-aid for 
airports program as proposed by the Senate. The rescission of 
contract authority applies to those funds that are not 
available for obligation due to annual limits on obligations. 
The House bill contained no similar rescission.

                     Federal Highway Administration

                     highway-related safety grants

                          (highway trust fund)

                 (rescission of contract authorization)

      The conference agreement includes a rescission of 
$9,000,000 in contract authority from highway-related safety 
grants. The rescission of contract authority applies to those 
funds that are not available for obligation due to annual 
limits on obligations. The House and Senate bills contained no 
similar rescission.

                      motor carrier safety grants

                          (highway trust fund)

                 (rescission of contract authorization)

      The conference agreement includes a rescission of 
$33,000,000 in contract authority from motor carrier safety 
grants. The rescission of contract authority applies to those 
funds that are not available for obligation due to annual 
limits on obligations. The House and Senate bills contained no 
similar rescission.

             National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

                     highway traffic safety grants

                          (highway trust fund)

                 (rescission of contract authorization)

      The conference agreement includes a rescission of 
$56,000,000 in contract authority from highway traffic safety 
grants. The rescission of contract authority applies to those 
funds that are not available for obligation due to annual 
limits on obligations. The House and Senate bills contained no 
similar rescission.

                               CHAPTER 8

                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES

                    GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION

                              (rescission)

      The conferees have agreed to rescind $3,400,000 from 
funds made available to the General Services Administration 
(GSA) for installment acquisition payments instead of the 
$3,500,000 rescission as proposed by the Senate and no 
rescission as proposed by the House. This rescission offsets 
the $3,400,000 in new budget authority for the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) as discussed in Chapter 9 
of Title II of this Act.
      The conferees have agreed to no rescission of funds made 
available to GSA for advance design ($200,000) and the U.S. Tax 
Court ($200,000) as proposed by the Senate. The House did not 
address this rescission.

                               CHAPTER 9

 DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND 
                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES

                  FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY

                            disaster relief

                              (rescission)

      The conferees have proposed a rescission of 
$1,000,000,000 of disaster relief funds to help off-set 
appropriations levels provided in H.R. 3019. Such disaster 
funds were provided in the disaster relief and disaster relief 
contingency fund accounts in Public Law 104-19.
      The conferees expect that this rescission will leave the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency approximately 
$1,300,000,000 short of known or expected requirements by the 
end of fiscal year 1997. As such, it is expected that FEMA will 
request an appropriate supplemental budget request to meet 
necessary requirements at an early point during fiscal year 
1997.

                               CHAPTER 10

                      debt collection improvements

      The conferees have agreed to include and amend a 
provision proposed by the Senate which addresses debt 
collection improvements, instead of no provision as proposed by 
the House. The conferees have modified the provision so that it 
more closely resembles the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 
1995, as developed by the Government Reform and Oversight 
Committee of the House of Representatives. The conferees have 
not included language as proposed by the Senate which would 
have permitted non-judicial foreclosure of mortgages.
      The conferees direct that the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) provide coordination and oversight for development 
and implementation of the debt collection program created by 
this section. Additionally, with regard to the Debt Collection 
Improvement Account, the conferees direct the OMB to determine 
the baseline from which the increased collections are measured 
over the prior fiscal year, taking into account the 
recommendations made by the Secretary of the Treasury in 
consultation with creditor agencies.
      The conferees strongly support repayment of delinquent 
government debt by all those who can afford to do so. However, 
the conferees recognize that those who receive federal 
benefits, particularly Social Security benefits, may be 
dependent upon them for a substantial part of their income. In 
order to avoid unreasonable hardship, the conferees insist that 
any federal debt collection effort give full consideration to 
the financial situation of the individual who may repay the 
debt.
      By definition, recipients of Social Security benefits are 
elderly or totally disabled workers and their dependents, or 
the surviving dependents of deceased workers. The conferees 
intend that in cases where such benefits are involved, it is 
particularly important for the Treasury Department, as well as 
all other Executive Branch organizations involved in developing 
regulations to implement this provision, to create regulatory 
safeguards which separate those debtors who cannot repay from 
those who refuse to pay. In particular, those who have become 
delinquent because of personal hardship, such as debilitating 
disability, or death of the breadwinner, and who may therefore 
be unable, rather than unwilling, to repay, must be protected 
if administrative offset of those benefits would cause undue 
financial hardship. Such safeguards are critical when benefits 
such as Social Security are the sole or major source of income 
for the debtor.
      The conferees want to ensure that the Department of the 
Treasury regulations governing new debt collection procedures 
will be cautiously and thoughtfully implemented, providing full 
safeguards for beneficiaries. Recognizing the dependence of 
those receiving federal benefits on those benefits, the 
conferees direct that the Treasury Department limit automatic 
withholding of benefits above the $9,000 annual exemption to a 
reasonable percentage of those benefits, not to exceed 15 
percent. Of course, debtors wishing to repay more would be free 
to do so by remittance or other voluntary means.
      The conferees agree that it is particularly important to 
recognize that individual circumstances change and even an 
individual with a good repayment record could face a personal 
or financial misfortune that makes further repayment difficult, 
if not impossible. For example, the death of the family 
breadwinner, despite the payment of survivor benefits, could 
indicate a substantial loss of income to a family. To suddenly 
or excessively reduce a surviving dependent's benefits could 
further threaten an already precarious economic situation for 
the affected dependent.

                       Contingent Appropriations

      The conference agreement does not include any 
appropriations which would have been available only on the 
enactment of subsequent legislation that would have credited 
the Committees on Appropriations with sufficient savings to 
offset these appropriations. The House bill and the Senate 
amendment both contained this type of contingent appropriations 
but in different amounts. In lieu of providing any such 
contingent appropriations the conference agreement includes 
regular appropriations and offsetting savings above the regular 
appropriations or offset amounts in either the House or Senate 
passed versions of the bill. The additional amount of offsets 
result in this conference agreement being within the designated 
spending limits.

                       Environmental Initiatives

      The conference agreement does not include a separate 
title on environmental initiatives as proposed by the Senate. 
Instead these issues have been addressed in other parts of the 
conference agreement.

         Disclosure of Lobbying Activities by Federal Grantees

      The conference agreement deletes a provision requiring 
disclosure of lobbying activities by Federal grantees as 
proposed by the House. The Senate amendment contained no 
similar provision.

                       Deficit Reduction Lock-Box

      The conference agreement deletes a provision proposed by 
the House that would have reduced the Committees on 
Appropriations spending allocations when spending reduction 
amendments are adopted during consideration of appropriations 
bills in either body. The Senate amendment contained no similar 
provision.
