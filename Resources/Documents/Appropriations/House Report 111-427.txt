    Mr. Conyers, from the Committee on the Judiciary, submitted the 
                               following

                              R E P O R T

                      [To accompany H. Res. 1031]

  The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was referred the 
resolution (H. Res. 1031) impeaching G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., 
judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of Louisiana, for high crimes and misdemeanors, having 
considered the same, reports favorably thereon without 
amendment and recommends that the resolution be agreed to.

                           I. THE RESOLUTION

                              H. Res. 1031

    Impeaching G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., judge of the United 
States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, 
for high crimes and misdemeanors.

                    In The House of Representatives

                            JANUARY 21, 2010

    Mr. Conyers (for himself, Mr. Smith of Texas, Mr. Schiff, 
Mr. Goodlatte, Ms. Jackson Lee of Texas, Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. 
Delahunt, Mr. Daniel E. Lungren of California, Mr. Cohen, Mr. 
Forbes, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, Mr. Gohmert, Mr. Pierluisi, and 
Mr. Gonzalez) submitted the following resolution; which was 
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary
    Resolved, That G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., a judge of the 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Louisiana, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and 
that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the 
Senate:
    Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
Representatives of the United States of America in the name of 
itself and all of the people of the United States of America, 
against G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., a judge in the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, in 
maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high 
crimes and misdemeanors.

                               ARTICLE I

    G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., while a Federal judge of the 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Louisiana, engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible 
with the trust and confidence placed in him as a Federal judge, 
as follows:
    Judge Porteous, while presiding as a United States district 
judge in Lifemark Hospitals of Louisiana, Inc. v. Liljeberg 
Enterprises, denied a motion to recuse himself from the case, 
despite the fact that he had a corrupt financial relationship 
with the law firm of Amato & Creely, P.C. which had entered the 
case to represent Liljeberg. In denying the motion to recuse, 
and in contravention of clear canons of judicial ethics, Judge 
Porteous failed to disclose that beginning in or about the late 
1980's while he was a State court judge in the 24th Judicial 
District Court in the State of Louisiana, he engaged in a 
corrupt scheme with attorneys, Jacob Amato, Jr., and Robert 
Creely, whereby Judge Porteous appointed Amato's law partner as 
a `curator' in hundreds of cases and thereafter requested and 
accepted from Amato & Creely a portion of the curatorship fees 
which had been paid to the firm. During the period of this 
scheme, the fees received by Amato & Creely amounted to 
approximately $40,000, and the amounts paid by Amato & Creely 
to Judge Porteous amounted to approximately $20,000.
    Judge Porteous also made intentionally misleading 
statements at the recusal hearing intended to minimize the 
extent of his personal relationship with the two attorneys. In 
so doing, and in failing to disclose to Lifemark and its 
counsel the true circumstances of his relationship with the 
Amato & Creely law firm, Judge Porteous deprived the Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals of critical information for its review 
of a petition for a writ of mandamus, which sought to overrule 
Judge Porteous's denial of the recusal motion. His conduct 
deprived the parties and the public of the right to the honest 
services of his office.
    Judge Porteous also engaged in corrupt conduct after the 
Lifemark v. Liljeberg bench trial, and while he had the case 
under advisement, in that he solicited and accepted things of 
value from both Amato and his law partner Creely, including a 
payment of thousands of dollars in cash. Thereafter, and 
without disclosing his corrupt relationship with the attorneys 
of Amato & Creely PLC or his receipt from them of cash and 
other things of value, Judge Porteous ruled in favor of their 
client, Liljeberg.
    By virtue of this corrupt relationship and his conduct as a 
Federal judge, Judge Porteous brought his court into scandal 
and disrepute, prejudiced public respect for, and confidence 
in, the Federal judiciary, and demonstrated that he is unfit 
for the office of Federal judge.
    Wherefore, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., is guilty of high 
crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.

                               ARTICLE II

    G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., engaged in a longstanding pattern 
of corrupt conduct that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as 
a United States District Court Judge. That conduct included the 
following: Beginning in or about the late 1980's while he was a 
State court judge in the 24th Judicial District Court in the 
State of Louisiana, and continuing while he was a Federal judge 
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Louisiana, Judge Porteous engaged in a corrupt relationship 
with bail bondsman Louis M. Marcotte, III, and his sister Lori 
Marcotte. As part of this corrupt relationship, Judge Porteous 
solicited and accepted numerous things of value, including 
meals, trips, home repairs, and car repairs, for his personal 
use and benefit, while at the same time taking official actions 
that benefitted the Marcottes. These official actions by Judge 
Porteous included, while on the State bench, setting, reducing, 
and splitting bonds as requested by the Marcottes, and 
improperly setting aside or expunging felony convictions for 
two Marcotte employees (in one case after Judge Porteous had 
been confirmed by the Senate but before being sworn in as a 
Federal judge). In addition, both while on the State bench and 
on the Federal bench, Judge Porteous used the power and 
prestige of his office to assist the Marcottes in forming 
relationships with State judicial officers and individuals 
important to the Marcottes' business. As Judge Porteous well 
knew and understood, Louis Marcotte also made false statements 
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in an effort to assist 
Judge Porteous in being appointed to the Federal bench.
    Accordingly, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., has engaged in 
conduct so utterly lacking in honesty and integrity that he is 
guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, is unfit to hold the 
office of Federal judge, and should be removed from office.

                              ARTICLE III

    Beginning in or about March 2001 and continuing through 
about July 2004, while a Federal judge in the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, G. Thomas 
Porteous, Jr., engaged in a pattern of conduct inconsistent 
with the trust and confidence placed in him as a Federal judge 
by knowingly and intentionally making material false statements 
and representations under penalty of perjury related to his 
personal bankruptcy filing and by repeatedly violating a court 
order in his bankruptcy case. Judge Porteous did so by----

          (1) using a false name and a post office box address 
        to conceal his identity as the debtor in the case;
          (2) concealing assets;
          (3) concealing preferential payments to certain 
        creditors;
          (4) concealing gambling losses and other gambling 
        debts; and
          (5) incurring new debts while the case was pending, 
        in violation of the bankruptcy court's order.

    In doing so, Judge Porteous brought his court into scandal 
and disrepute, prejudiced public respect for and confidence in 
the Federal judiciary, and demonstrated that he is unfit for 
the office of Federal judge.
    Wherefore, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., is guilty of high 
crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.

                               ARTICLE IV

    In 1994, in connection with his nomination to be a judge of 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Louisiana, G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., knowingly made material 
false statements about his past to both the United States 
Senate and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to 
obtain the office of United States District Court Judge. These 
false statements included the following:

          (1) On his Supplemental SF-86, Judge Porteous was 
        asked if there was anything in his personal life that 
        could be used by someone to coerce or blackmail him, or 
        if there was anything in his life that could cause an 
        embarrassment to Judge Porteous or the President if 
        publicly known. Judge Porteous answered `no' to this 
        question and signed the form under the warning that a 
        false statement was punishable by law.
          (2) During his background check, Judge Porteous 
        falsely told the Federal Bureau of Investigation on two 
        separate occasions that he was not concealing any 
        activity or conduct that could be used to influence, 
        pressure, coerce, or compromise him in any way or that 
        would impact negatively on his character, reputation, 
        judgment, or discretion.
        (3) On the Senate Judiciary Committee's `Questionnaire 
        for Judicial Nominees', Judge Porteous was asked 
        whether any unfavorable information existed that could 
        affect his nomination. Judge Porteous answered that, to 
        the best of his knowledge, he did `not know of any 
        unfavorable information that may affect [his] 
        nomination'. Judge Porteous signed that questionnaire 
        by swearing that `the information provided in this 
        statement is, to the best of my knowledge, true and 
        accurate'.

    However, in truth and in fact, as Judge Porteous then well 
knew, each of these answers was materially false because Judge 
Porteous had engaged in a corrupt relationship with the law 
firm Amato & Creely, whereby Judge Porteous appointed Creely as 
a `curator' in hundreds of cases and thereafter requested and 
accepted from Amato & Creely a portion of the curatorship fees 
which had been paid to the firm and also had engaged in a 
corrupt relationship with Louis and Lori Marcotte, whereby 
Judge Porteous solicited and accepted numerous things of value, 
including meals, trips, home repairs, and car repairs, for his 
personal use and benefit, while at the same time taking 
official actions that benefitted the Marcottes. As Judge 
Porteous well knew and understood, Louis Marcotte also made 
false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in an 
effort to assist Judge Porteous in being appointed to the 
Federal bench. Judge Porteous's failure to disclose these 
corrupt relationships deprived the United States Senate and the 
public of information that would have had a material impact on 
his confirmation.
    Wherefore, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., is guilty of high 
crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.

                            II. INTRODUCTION

    The House Committee on the Judiciary, in conjunction with 
its duly authorized ``Task Force on Judicial Impeachment,'' has 
conducted an investigation into the conduct of United States 
District Court Judge Gabriel Thomas Porteous, Jr., (``Judge 
Porteous'') and has determined, for the reasons set forth in 
this Report, that Judge Porteous's impeachment is warranted as 
a factual matter, fully supported by the Constitution, and is 
consistent with precedent.

                   III. JUDGE G. THOMAS PORTEOUS, JR.

    Judge Porteous was born December 14, 1946. He grew up in 
the New Orleans area and attended Louisiana State University 
both as an undergraduate and for law school. He graduated from 
law school in 1971.
    From 1971 to 1973, Judge Porteous was Special Counsel to 
the Office of the Louisiana Attorney General. He then served as 
an Assistant District Attorney from approximately 1973 through 
1984. During that time period, Assistant District Attorneys 
could also hold outside employment. Thus, during some portion 
of this time, Judge Porteous was a law partner of Jacob Amato, 
Jr., at the law firm Edwards, Porteous & Amato. Attorney Robert 
Creely also worked at this firm.
    Judge Porteous was elected judge of the 24th Judicial 
District Court in the State of Louisiana in 1984 and remained 
in that position until October 1994. In August 1994, Judge 
Porteous was nominated by President Clinton to be a United 
States District Court Judge for the Eastern District of 
Louisiana. His confirmation hearing was held on October 6, 
1994. He was confirmed by the Senate on October 7, 1994, 
received his commission on October 11, 1994, and was sworn in 
on October 28, 1994.
    Judge Porteous was married in 1969 to Carmella Porteous, 
who passed away on December 22, 2005.

                       IV. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

    In or about late 1999, the Department of Justice 
(occasionally referenced as the ``Department'' or ``DOJ'') and 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the ``FBI'') commenced a 
criminal investigation of Judge Porteous. The criminal 
investigation continued for several years, and ultimately ended 
in early 2007, without an indictment.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\Among the reasons the Department gave in declining prosecution 
were that some of the conduct at issue was barred by the statue of 
limitations, and that some of the demonstrably false statements may not 
have been ``material'' as a matter of law. Letter from John C. Keeney, 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, to Hon. 
Edith H. Jones, Chief Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit, Re: Complaint of Judicial Misconduct Concerning the Honorable 
G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., May 18, 2007 (hereinafter ``DOJ Complaint 
Letter'') at 1 (Ex. 4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The evidentiary materials have been identified as HP [House Porteous] 
Exhibit numbers by the Task Force Staff, and the documents are cited as 
``(Ex. [#]).'' Certain publicly available documents, such as House and 
Committee Resolutions, or pleadings in connection with litigation, have 
also been marked as exhibits for ease of reference. The testimony cited 
in this Report consists of the following: 1) testimony of witnesses 
before the House Impeachment Task Force during one of four hearings 
(either on November 17-18, 2009 (Hearing I), December 8, 2009 (II), 
December 10, 2009 (III) or December 15, 2009 (IV)), cited as 
``[Witness] TF Hrg. [I, II, III or IV] at [page];'' 2) testimony of 
witnesses before the Fifth Circuit Special Investigative Committee 
Hearing in October 1997, cited as ``[Witness] 5th Cir. Hrg. at 
[page],'' or otherwise referencing the speaker if the person quoted is 
not the sworn witness; 3) testimony of witnesses before the Federal 
grand jury, cited as ``[Witness] GJ at [page];'' and 4) deposition 
testimony taken by Task Force Staff, in the late summer and fall of 
2009 and early 2010, cited as ``[Witness] Dep. at [ ].'' Facts that are 
undisputed--such as the date Judge Porteous was nominated or 
confirmed--are not always cited. Several witnesses were interviewed by 
Task Force Staff but were not deposed. Every effort has been made in 
this Report to rely on documentary materials or testimony under oath; 
however, on a few occasions, references are made to Task Force Staff 
interviews where a deposition was not conducted.
    In a letter dated May 18, 2007, the Department submitted a 
formal complaint of judicial misconduct to the Honorable Edith 
H. Jones, Chief Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the 
Fifth Circuit. The DOJ Complaint Letter described numerous 
instances of alleged misconduct by Judge Porteous that 
potentially related to his fitness as a judge.\2\ The alleged 
misconduct included soliciting and accepting things of value 
from litigants, attorneys, and other interested persons (such 
as the owners of a bail bonds company) with matters before him. 
The misconduct was alleged to have commenced while Judge 
Porteous was a State judge serving on the 24th Judicial 
District Court in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana (from 1984 to 
1994), and to have continued while he was a Federal district 
judge. In addition, the Department also set forth information 
that Judge Porteous, while a Federal judge, made false 
statements and engaged in other dishonest conduct in connection 
with his personal bankruptcy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\DOJ Complaint Letter (Ex. 4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Upon receipt of the DOJ Complaint Letter, the Fifth Circuit 
appointed a Special Investigatory Committee (the ``Special 
Committee'') to investigate the Department's allegations. A 
hearing was held before the Special Committee on October 29 and 
30, 2007 (the ``Fifth Circuit Hearing''), at which Judge 
Porteous, representing himself, testified,\3\ cross-examined 
witnesses, and called witnesses on his own behalf.\4\ 
Thereafter, the Special Committee issued a Report to the 
Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit, dated November 20, 2007. 
That Report concluded that Judge Porteous committed misconduct 
which ``might constitute one or more grounds for 
impeachment.''\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\An order of immunity had been obtained and provided to Judge 
Porteous in connection with his testimony before the Fifth Circuit 
Special Committee.
    \4\That hearing did not address Judge Porteous's improper 
relationships with bail bondsmen, nor did it examine his conduct during 
the confirmation process to become a Federal judge.
    \5\Report by the Special Investigatory Committee to the Judicial 
Council of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, In 
the Matter of Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. United States District 
Judge, Eastern District of Louisiana, Dkt. No. 07-05-351-0085 (Nov. 20, 
2007) (Ex. 5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On December 20, 2007, by a majority vote, the Judicial 
Council of the Fifth Circuit accepted and approved the Special 
Committee's Report and likewise concluded that Judge Porteous 
``had engaged in conduct which might constitute one or more 
grounds for impeachment under Article I of the 
Constitution.''\6\ The Fifth Circuit Judicial Council 
thereafter certified these findings and the supporting records 
to the Judicial Conference of the United States.\7\

Misconduct Against United States District Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr.

of the Fifth Circuit, Dkt. No. 07-05-351-0085 (Dec. 20, 2007) at 4 (Ex. 
6(a)). A dissenting opinion authored by Circuit Judge James L. Dennis 
examined each of Judge Porteous's acts individually and concluded that, 
under that analysis, the evidence did not demonstrate a possible ground 
for impeachment and removal. Id. (J. Dennis dissenting) (Ex. 6(b)). 
Judge Dennis would have recommended suspending and reprimanding Judge 
Porteous.

6(a)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On June 17, 2008, the Judicial Conference of the United 
States determined unanimously, upon recommendation of its 
Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability, to transmit to 
the Speaker of the House a Certificate ``that consideration of 
impeachment of United States District Judge G. Thomas Porteous 
(E.D. La.) may be warranted.''\8\

the Speaker, United States House of Representatives [Re: Determination 
that Consideration of Impeachment of Judge G. Thomas Porteous may be

delivered to the Honorable Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, on June 
18, 2008.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On September 10, 2008, the Judicial Council of the Fifth 
Circuit issued an ``Order and Public Reprimand'' taking the 
maximum disciplinary action allowed by law against Judge 
Porteous, including ordering that no new cases be assigned to 
him and suspending his authority to employ staff for 2 years or 
``until Congress takes final action on the impeachment 
proceedings, whichever occurs earlier.''\9\

of the Fifth Circuit, Dkt. No. 07-05-351-0085 (Sept. 10, 2008) at 4 
(Ex. 8).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On September 17, 2008, the House of Representatives of the 
110th Congress passed H. Res. 1448, which provided, in 
pertinent part: ``Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary 
shall inquire whether the House should impeach G. Thomas 
Porteous, a judge of the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Louisiana.''\10\ On January 6, 2009, 
Chairman John Conyers, Jr. of the Committee on the Judiciary 
introduced H. Res. 15, which continued the authority of H. Res. 
1448 of the 110th Congress for the 111th Congress.\11\ On 
January 13, 2009, H. Res. 15 passed the full House by voice 
vote.

                  V. COMMITTEE AND TASK FORCE ACTIONS

    On January 22, 2009, the impeachment inquiry was referred 
by the Committee on the Judiciary to a Task Force on Judicial 
Impeachment (the ``Task Force''), comprised of 12 Committee 
Members, to conduct the investigation.\12\ On July 29, 2009, 
the Committee on the Judiciary voted to permit the House 
General Counsel to seek immunity orders to compel the testimony 
of 8 witnesses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\See Reestablishment of the Task Force on Judicial Impeachment: 
Before the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 111th Con. (2009) (statement of 
John Conyers, Jr., Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary), http://
judiciary.house.gov/hearings/transcripts/transcript090122.pdf at 30-34. 
The Task Force consisted of Chairman Adam B. Schiff (CA), Ranking 
Member Bob Goodlatte (VA), Sheila Jackson Lee (TX), Steve Cohen (TN), 
Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson (GA), Pedro Pierluisi (PR), Charles A. 
Gonzalez (TX), F. James Sensenbrenner (WI), Daniel E. Lungren (CA), J. 
Randy Forbes (VA), and Louis Gohmert (TX).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             A. In General

    Task Force Staff reviewed materials provided from the Fifth 
Circuit (which included DOJ materials that had been provided to 
the attorneys handling the Special Investigatory inquiry). Task 
Force Staff also obtained additional documents from DOJ and 
from other entities, and interviewed over 70 individuals and 
took over 25 depositions. The evidentiary materials that are 
pertinent to this Report were made part of the record at the 
Task Force meeting of January 21, 2010.

                    B. Litigation by Judge Porteous 
                 in Response to the Task Force Inquiry

    Judge Porteous has litigated in three different courts in 
an attempt to preclude, or delay, the Committee from obtaining 
critically-needed information in this impeachment inquiry.
    After review of the DOJ Complaint Letter, and the referral 
from the U.S. Judicial Conference, the Committee moved to 
obtain a court order authorizing DOJ to disclose grand jury 
materials. The Committee originally moved on July 8, 2009 for 
an order authorizing the disclosure of grand jury materials 
related to the DOJ investigations of Judge Porteous, Rowan 
Company, and Diamond Offshore, and a Department of Interior 
employee, Donald C. Howard.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\Memorandum in Support of the U.S. House of Representatives 
Committee on the Judiciary for an Order Directing the Department of 
Justice to Disclose Certain Grand Jury Materials, In re: Grand Jury 
Investigation of United States District Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., 
Misc. No. 09-4346 (E.D. La. July 8, 2009) (Ex. 401). Howard had been 
prosecuted for not disclosing that he accepted hunting trips from Rowan 
Companies on his financial disclosure reports, and, in fact, had been 
on some of the same Rowan hunting trips as Judge Porteous.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  After the Committee filed its Motion, Judge Porteous's counsel wrote 
to the judge assigned to the case and asserted that it would not be 
proper for any judge currently sitting in the judicial districts 
comprising the Fifth Circuit to hear and decide the Committee's motion. 
Letter from Richard W. Westling, Counsel to Judge Porteous, to the 
Honorable Neal B. Biggers, Jr., Senior United States District Judge 
(July 13, 2009) (Ex. 400). As a result, the Fifth Circuit designated 
the Honorable Callie V. S. Granade, the Chief Judge of the Southern 
District of Alabama, to hear and decide the Committee's motion.
    On July 28, 2009, Judge Porteous filed an opposition to the 
Committee's Motion.\14\ While never challenging the fact that 
the information sought was relevant and necessary for the 
impeachment inquiry, the Judge's opposition was based solely on 
a concern for secrecy of grand jury matters. The court 
dismissed this objection and issued an order dated August 5, 
2009, granting the Committee's Motion.\15\ Thereafter, Judge 
Porteous moved to stay the Order pending his appeal to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit;\16\ the Committee 
opposed Judge Porteous's stay motion\17\ and the District Court 
denied the stay as without merit.\18\ Judge Porteous took an 
appeal of the August 5 grand jury disclosure order\19\ and also 
moved in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to 
stay disclosure pending the duration of the entire appeal.\20\ 
The Committee opposed this motion,\21\ and the Court of Appeals 
denied the stay.\22\ Throughout these pleadings, Judge Porteous 
never argued that the grand jury materials sought were not 
relevant to the Committee's impeachment inquiry.

    On November 12, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Fifth Circuit issued an order which granted the Committee's 
motion for summary affirmance, and denied all of Judge 
Porteous's motions.\29\ The Task Force finally obtained access

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Judge's legal maneuverings had delayed access by the 
staff to important and relevant information for approximately 5 
months.
    By way of a motion filed October 8, 2009, the Committee 
sought a second Order authorizing disclosure of grand jury and 
Title III wiretap materials that related to Judge Porteous. 
These materials were obtained during the Department's 
``Wrinkled Robe'' investigation into corruption in connection 
with the relationship of certain bail bondsmen to State judges 
of the 24th Judicial District Court of Louisiana, where Judge 
Porteous had presided prior to becoming a Federal judge.\30\ 
Again, Judge Porteous filed an opposition to this motion,\31\ 
and the Committee replied.\32\ The Department of Justice filed 
a memorandum in support of the Committee.\33\ On October 23, 
2009, the court granted the Committee's motion and authorized 
disclosure of the grand jury and Title III materials.\34\

    Once again, Judge Porteous moved in the district court to 
stay disclosure.\35\ The Committee opposed his stay motion.\36\ 
The district court denied the stay motion as without merit.\37\ 
Judge Porteous did not move to stay disclosure in the Court of

    In addition to the grand jury litigation, on November 12, 
2009, a few days prior to the first evidentiary hearing of the 
Task Force, Judge Porteous filed a lawsuit in the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a permanent 
injunction preventing the Committee from using or reading his 
sworn immunized testimony that had been provided to the 
Committee by the Judicial Conference. On an emergency basis, 
Judge Porteous sought a temporary restraining order to enjoin 
three aides to the Impeachment Task Force from using testimony 
he had provided under a grant of immunity to the Fifth Circuit 
Special Committee more than 2 years earlier.\41\ On an 
expedited schedule, the Committee moved to dismiss this 
motion,\42\ and Judge Porteous replied.\43\ United States 
District Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District 
Court for the District of Columbia denied Judge Porteous's 
motion for a temporary restraining order after oral argument on 
November 16, 2009.\44\ Per the Court's request, the Committee

    Judge Porteous's attorney, Richard Westling, Esq., was 
permitted to give an opening statement at the initial hearing 
and was offered the opportunity to examine the witnesses at 
each of the four hearings. He did in fact examine witnesses at 
all the hearings except the December 10, 2009 hearing, where, 
despite having been offered the opportunity to participate, 
neither Mr. Westling nor any other attorney representing Judge 
Porteous was present. Mr. Westling was given the opportunity to 
identify witnesses whose testimony he sought for the Committee 
to hear. Mr. Westling did not identify any such individuals. 
Judge Porteous was also provided the opportunity to testify. He 
declined to do so.
    On January 21, 2010, the Task Force held a meeting to 
consider proposed articles of impeachment. In connection with 
that meeting, Task Force exhibits cited in this Report were 
made part of the record. At that meeting, Task Force Members 
agreed by an 8-0 vote to recommend four specified Articles of 
Impeachment to the Full Committee.
    On that same day, Chairman Conyers introduced H. Res. 1031, 
setting forth the four recommended Articles of Impeachment 
against Judge Porteous.
    On January 27, 2010, the Committee on the Judiciary met and 
unanimously approved by record votes each of the four articles, 
and, upon doing so, voted unanimously to report H. Res 1031 to 
the full House.

                 VI. A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF IMPEACHMENT

                 A. Pertinent Constitutional Provisions

    The following are the pertinent provisions in the United 
States Constitution that relate to impeachment:

        Article I, Section 2, Clause 5:
          The House of Representatives . . . shall have the 
        sole Power of Impeachment.

        Article I, Section 3, Clauses 6 and 7:
          The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all 
        Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall 
        be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the 
        United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall 
        preside: And no person shall be convicted without the 
        Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present.
          Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend 
        further than to removal from Office, and 
        disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, 
        Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party 
        convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to 
        Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according 
        to Law.

        Article II, Section 2, Clause 1:
          The President . . . shall have Power to grant 
        Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United 
        States, except in Cases of Impeachment.

        Article II, Section 4:
          The President, Vice President and all civil Officers 
        of the United States, shall be removed from Office on 
        Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, 
        or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

    In this regard, it has long been recognized that Federal 
judges are ``civil Officers'' within the meaning of Article II, 
Section 4.\52\ Finally, as to the life tenure of Federal 
judges, the Constitution provides:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \52\A commentator wrote in 1825:

      All executive and judicial officers, from the president 
      downwards, from the judges of the supreme court to those of 
      the most inferior tribunals, are included in this 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      description.

W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America, 
Philip H. Nicklin ed. (1829), 213 (The Law Exchange reprint (2003)). 
Another prominent commentator, Joseph Story, wrote:

      All officers of the United States . . . who hold their 
      appointments under the national government, whether their 
      duties are executive or judicial, in the highest or in the 
      lowest departments of the government, with the exception of 
      officers in the army and navy, are properly civil officers 
      within the meaning of the constitution, and liable to 
      impeachment.

2 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 
Sec. 790 at 258 (1833) (citing Rawle) (quoted in To Consider Possible 
Impeachment of United States District Judge Samuel B. Kent of the 
Southern District of Texas: Hearing Before the Task Force on Judicial 
Impeachment of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. Serial No. 
111-11 (June 3, 2009) (statement of Prof. Arthur Hellman)).

        Article III, Section 1:
          The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, 
        shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour. . . .

           B. The Meaning of ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors''

    The committee report accompanying the 1989 Resolution to 
Impeach United States District Court Judge Walter L. Nixon 
summarized the British precedents for impeachment, the events 
at the Constitutional convention leading to the adoption of the 
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' formulation for impeachable 
conduct, and the interpretation of that term in the 12 judicial 
impeachments that had occurred prior to 1989. In its summary of 
the historical meaning of the term, the report noted:

        The House and Senate have both interpreted the phrase 
        broadly, finding that impeachable offenses need not be 
        limited to criminal conduct. Congress has repeatedly 
        defined ``other high Crimes and misdemeanors'' to be 
        serious violations of the public trust, not necessarily 
        indictable offenses under criminal laws.\53\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \53\H.R. Rep. No. 101-36, Impeachment of Walter L. Nixon, Jr., 
Report of the Committee on the Judiciary to Accompany H. Res. 87, 101st 
Cong., 1st Sess. (1989) [hereinafter ``Walter Nixon Impeachment 
Report"] at 5 (1989).

    In applying these concepts to the conduct of a judge, the 
Walter Nixon Impeachment Report further stressed that the term 
``misdemeanor'' as used in the Constitution was not intended to 
denote a minor criminal offense, but rather focused on the 
behavior of the judge, that is, whether the judge 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
``misdemean[ed]'' and thus should be removed:

        Indeed, when the phrase ``high crimes and 
        misdemeanors'' first appeared during the impeachment of 
        the Earl of Suffolk in 1386, the term ``misdemeanor'' 
        did not denote a violation of criminal law. In the 
        context of impeachment, the word focuses on the 
        behavior of a public official, i.e., his demeanor. 
        Gouverneur Morris, a member of the Committee on Style 
        and Revision of the Constitutional Convention and one 
        of the founding fathers responsible for the final 
        revisions to the Constitution, explained the use of the 
        term ``Misdemeanor'': ``[T]he judges shall hold their 
        offices so long as they demean themselves well, but if 
        they shall misdemean, if they shall, on impeachment, be 
        convicted of misdemeanor, they shall be removed.''\54\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \54\Walter Nixon Impeachment Report at 5 (footnote omitted).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Walter Nixon Impeachment Report concluded:

        Thus, from an historical perspective the question of 
        what conduct by a Federal judge constitutes an 
        impeachable offense has evolved to the position where 
        the focus is now on public confidence in the integrity 
        and impartiality of the judiciary. When a judge's 
        conduct calls into questions his or her integrity or 
        impartiality, Congress must consider whether 
        impeachment and removal of the judge from office is 
        necessary to protect the integrity of the judicial 
        branch and uphold the public trust.\55\

    The report that accompanied the Alcee Hastings impeachment 
resolution stated that the phrase ``high crimes and 
misdemeanors'' ``refers to misconduct that damages the state 
and the operations of governmental institutions, and is not 
limited to criminal misconduct.''\56\ That Report stressed that 
impeachment is ``non-criminal,'' designed not to impose 
criminal penalties, but instead simply to remove the offender 
from office,\57\ and that it is ``the ultimate means of 
preserving our constitutional form of government from the 
depredations of those in high office who abuse or violate the 
public trust.''\58\ The fact that the individual who is 
impeached and removed from office ``shall nevertheless be 
liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and 
Punishment, according to Law,'' makes it further clear that 
impeachment is a remedial provision, not a punitive one.\59\

                    VII. ARTICLE BY ARTICLE ANALYSIS

                             A. In General

    In connection with the impeachment of Federal Judge George 
W. English in 1926, the House Committee on the Judiciary noted: 
``Each case of impeachment must necessarily stand upon its own 
facts. It can not, therefore, become a precedent or be on all 
fours with every other case.''\60\ That observation is 
particularly true in regard to the case of Judge Porteous, who 
has committed misconduct in several spheres of activity over 
many years. As one scholar noted in his testimony before the 
Task Force, any lack of factual precedents directly on point 
``has to do with more the nature of Judge Porteous's misconduct 
than with anything else. The fact is that we are discovering or 
finding in this case a pattern of misbehavior that extends over 
such a long period of time that is virtually unique in the 
annals of impeachment.''\61\ Nonetheless, a review of prior 
judicial impeachments reveals that the four Articles against 
Judge Porteous are consistent with the Constitution and 
impeachment precedent.

                     B. Discussion of the Articles

1. Article I
    Article I sets forth Judge Porteous's conduct in the course 
of presiding over the case Lifemark Hospitals of La., Inc. 
[``Lifemark''] v. Liljeberg Enterprises, Inc. [``Liljeberg'' or 
``the Liljebergs''],\62\ including his failure to recuse 
himself despite his close personal and financial relationships 
with attorneys for the Liljebergs (including, in particular, 
his prior financial relationship with Amato and Amato's partner 
Creely, while Judge Porteous was a State judge); making false 
and deceptive statements at the recusal hearing to conceal his 
relationship and otherwise failing to disclose his prior 
financial relationship; and continuing to solicit and accept 
things of value from the attorneys in that case, including 
cash, while he had the case under advisement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \62\Civ. Action No. 93-1794 (E.D. La.). See PACER Docket Report 
(Ex. 50).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The conduct alleged in Article I--financial entanglements 
with persons having business before the court--is well 
recognized as constituting the ``gravest sort'' of judicial 
misconduct.\63\ The Committee notes that the conduct involving 
the solicitation and receipt of things of value violates 
Federal law as well as several of the Canons of Judicial Ethics 
that are designed to ensure that parties receive a fair trial 
by an impartial judge--a judge that is neither soliciting nor 
accepting things of value from attorneys who are appearing in 
front of him.\64\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \63\Prof. Geyh TF Hrg. IV at 12 (written statement at 6).
    \64\As Professor Geyh testified:

      [J]udge Porteous's misconduct here was of the gravest sort. 
      The current Code of Conduct for United States judges 
      provides that ``A judge should comply with the restrictions 
      on acceptance of gifts set forth in the Judicial Conference 
      Gift Regulations. [citation omitted]'' The judge who 
      solicits or receives money from a lawyer who has an 
      important case pending before the court, creates the taint 
      of corruption that the Judicial Conference's gift 
      regulations are designed to prevent; it is thus 
      unsurprising that ethics rules universally condemn the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      practice.

Prof. Geyh TF Hrg. IV at 12 (written statement at 6). The principles of 
impeachment do not require that the conduct at issue constitute a 
specific crime or violation of a civil or regulatory rule of law. 
Nonetheless, the fact that the conduct alleged to warrant impeachment 
violates widely accepted ethical standards or particular civil or 
criminal laws is a relevant consideration that informs, and in this 
case supports, the decision that impeachment and removal is 
appropriate. In connection with the impeachment of Judge Harry 
Claiborne, the accompanying Report referenced the Code of Judicial 
Conduct for United States Judges as ``[o]ne guide to what is considered 
`good behavior' befitting a member of the judiciary.'' The Report noted 
that Canon 1 (providing that judges should ``uphold the integrity'' of 
the judiciary) and Canon 2 (providing that judges should ``avoid 
impropriety and the appearance of impropriety'') ``reinforce the 
Committee's determination that Judge Claiborne has brought disrepute 
upon the profession and severely undermined public confidence in the 
institution.'' H.R. Rep. No. 99-688, ``Impeachment of Judge Harry E. 
Claiborne, Report of the Committee on the Judiciary to Accompany H. 
Res. 461,'' 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 23 (1986) [hereinafter ``Claiborne 
Impeachment Report''].
    Further, Article I against Judge Porteous alleges 
misconduct similar to that alleged in articles of impeachment 
against other judges. For example, in 1912, the House voted 
articles of impeachment against Circuit Judge Robert W. 
Archbald alleging numerous incidents of improper financial 
involvement with attorneys and parties. Articles 1 though 6 
against Judge Archbald described complicated financial schemes 
whereby, while he was a judge of the Commerce Court, Judge 
Archbald enriched himself through financial dealings with 
companies and attorneys with cases before the Court. Articles 7 
through 9 described complicated relationships through which 
Judge Archbald obtained money from counsels for parties with 
cases in front of him when he was a district court judge. 
Article10 charged that as a district court judge, Judge 
Archbald received money from an individual who was an officer 
and director of major railroad corporations ``which in the due 
course of business was liable to be interested in litigation 
pending in the said court over which [Archbald] presided as a 
judge.'' That Article further charged that Judge Archbald's 
acceptance of the money was thus ``improper and had a tendency 
to and did bring his said office of district judge into 
disrepute.'' Article 11 charged that Judge Archbald did 
``wrongfully accept and receive'' money that was ``contributed 
to [him] by various attorneys who were practitioners in the 
said court presided over by [Judge Archbald].''\65\

``Archbald Impeachment Report'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Similarly, in 1936, the House voted articles of impeachment 
against Judge Halsted L. Ritter.\66\ In particular, Article I 
of the Ritter Articles described financial dealings between 
Judge Ritter and his former law partner, in which Judge Ritter 
appointed the former law partner as a receiver in a civil case. 
Thereafter, Judge Ritter approved the payment of a $75,000 
receiver fee to the former partner (increasing the amount from 
$15,000 that had been set by another judge), and then received 
$4,500 back from the former partner.\67\

422), 198-202 (H. Res. 471) (hereinafter ``Ritter Articles'').
    \67\Ritter Articles at 188-189. Judge Ritter was acquitted of that 
Article in the Senate; however, it is not possible to determine the 
basis for the verdict--whether it was for failure of proof or because 
of some other reason. In any event, Judge Ritter was convicted of a 
different Article--Article 7--which re-alleged the $4,500 cash payment 
from his former partner.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Article I against Judge Porteous, in alleging misconduct 
arising from his undisclosed financial relationships with 
attorneys with a case in front of him, is consistent with the 
sorts of charges that have supported Articles of Impeachment 
against Judges Archbald and Ritter.
    Article I also charges that by his conduct, Judge Porteous 
has harmed the judicial system by bringing it into disrepute. 
This harm constitutes a discrete injury that justifies 
impeachment and removal, and numerous of the prior judicial 
impeachments, including those of Judges Claiborne, Nixon, 
Ritter, and Archbald, have included Articles that, after 
reciting the essential facts, have alleged that by virtue of 
that conduct the judge has brought such disrepute to the 
Federal courts, and so undermined public confidence in the 
courts, that the judge should be impeached.\68\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \68\See, e.g., Archbald Article 10 (charging that Judge Archbald's 
acceptance of money from an officer of a railroad company was 
``improper and had a tendency to and did bring his said office of 
district judge into disrepute'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thus, when Judge Porteous denied a recusal motion and it 
was later revealed that he had financial entanglements with 
certain of the attorneys, not only did he harm the party 
seeking a fair and impartial judge (Lifemark), but he harmed 
the judicial system as a whole by inviting cynicism as to its 
fairness and by suggesting to the public at large that, for a 
litigant to prevail at trial, it may be necessary to pay for 
meals or trips or to provide other things of value to the 
presiding judge.\69\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \69\One of the Articles against Judge Harold Louderback accused him 
of partiality so as ``to excite fear and distrust and to inspire a 
widespread belief in and beyond said northern district of California 
that causes were not decided in said court according to their merits, 
but were decided with partiality and prejudice and favoritism to 
certain individuals . . . all of which is prejudicial to the dignity of 
the judiciary.'' H. Res. 403 (1933), Articles of Impeachment Against 
Harold Louderback, reprinted in Impeachment, Selected Materials, House 
Comm. on the Judiciary, Comm. Print (1973) at 185. This same language 
was used in the articles of impeachment against Judge George W. 
English, which accused him of conduct so as to ``excite fear and 
distrust and to inspire a widespread belief . . . that causes were not 
decided in said court according to their merits but were decided with 
partiality and with prejudice and favoritism to certain individuals. . 
. .'' English Impeachment Report at 163.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Article II
            a. Overview
    Article II describes Judge Porteous's corrupt relationship 
with bail bondsman Louis Marcotte and his sister Lori Marcotte, 
spanning from the late 1980's/ early 1990's through Judge 
Porteous's tenure as a Federal judge and into approximately 
2004. This article alleges what is in substance a bribery 
scheme, whereby Judge Porteous solicited and accepted things of 
value from the Marcottes and, in return Judge Porteous took 
numerous actions to assist the Marcottes, both as a State judge 
(in setting bonds and taking other judicial acts) and as a 
Federal judge. This type of conduct is specifically set forth 
in Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution as a grounds for 
impeachment--that is ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors.''
            b. Pre-Federal Bench Conduct--The Judge Archbald Precedent
    Some of the conduct alleged to constitute a basis for 
impeachment in Article II occurred prior to Judge Porteous 
taking the Federal bench.\70\ Including such conduct as a basis 
for impeachment is consistent with the impeachment of Judge 
Archbald and with a common-sense interpretation of the 
Constitution and Congress's impeachment power.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \70\Article IV is based exclusively on pre-Federal bench conduct. 
However, since that issue is arguably implicated in Article II as well, 
the legal discussion is set forth here.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Archbald was a District Court Judge in the Middle 
District of Pennsylvania from March 29, 1901 through January 
31, 1911, when he was then appointed to the Circuit Court for 
the Third Circuit. While on the Circuit Court, he also sat on 
the United States Commerce Court.\71\ In 1912--while Judge 
Archbald was a circuit court judge--the House voted articles of 
impeachment against him, alleging improper conduct both as a 
circuit judge sitting on the Commerce Court (Articles 1 through 
6) and in his prior position as a district judge (Articles 7 
through 12). Article 13 set forth a ``catch-all'' article 
encompassing both district court and Circuit Court/Commerce 
Court conduct. That Article alleged that Archbald ``as such 
United States district judge and judge of the United States 
Commerce Court,'' sought loans from persons who had an interest 
in the matters ``pending in the court over which he presided as 
judge of the district court, and in suits pending in the United 
States Commerce Court, of which the said Robert W. Archbald is 
a Member.''\72\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \71\The United States Commerce Court was in existence from 1910 to 
1913. It heard appeals from orders of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission.
    \72\Archbald Impeachment Report at 182. Archbald was ultimately 
convicted in the Senate of 5 of the 13 articles--Articles 1, 3, 4, and 
5 involving Commerce Court conduct, and Article 13, a ``catch-all'' 
article involving both district court and Commerce Court conduct. VI 
Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, Sec. 512, p. 707.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Archbald Impeachment Report specifically addressed the 
fact that Articles 7 through 12 were based on judicial conduct 
that occurred prior to Judge Archbald being appointed to the 
Circuit Court (from which removal was sought). In the section 
of the Report entitled ``Impeachment for Offenses Committed in 
Another Judicial Office,'' the Report stated:

          It is indeed anomalous if the Congress is powerless 
        to remove a corrupt or unfit Federal judge from office 
        because his corruption or misdemeanor, however vicious 
        or reprehensible, may have occurred during his tenure 
        in some other judicial office under the Government of 
        the United States prior to his appointment to the 
        particular office from which he is sought to be ousted 
        by impeachment, although he may have held a Federal 
        judgeship continuously from the time of the commission 
        of his offenses. Surely the House of Representatives 
        will not recognize nor the Senate apply such a narrow 
        and technical construction of the constitutional 
        provisions relating to impeachments.\73\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \73\Archbald Impeachment Report at 175.

    In reaching this conclusion, the Archbald Impeachment 
Report focused on the similarity of the prior office in which 
Archbald committed impeachable conduct (district court judge) 
to the office from which Archbald was holding at the time of 
his impeachment (circuit court judge). The report further noted 
that precedents from State courts supported impeachment of a 
public official for misconduct that occurred in a prior term of 
office, especially if ``the prescribed functions of such 
offices were of the same general nature and susceptible to the 
same malversations and abuse.''\74\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \74\Archbald Impeachment Report at 175.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In that the ``prescribed functions'' of Judge Porteous's 
prior office as State court judge were ``of the same general 
nature'' as the office of district court judge that he 
presently occupies, and were thus ``susceptible to the same 
malversations and abuse,'' the reasoning in Archbald fully 
supports considering Judge Porteous's State judge conduct as a 
basis for impeachment. It would simply be ``anomalous'' if 
Congress were ``powerless to remove a corrupt or unfit Federal 
judge from office because his corruption or misdemeanor, 
however vicious or reprehensible, may have occurred during his 
tenure in some other judicial office''--in this case, a State 
judgeship that he occupied immediately prior to the Federal 
judgeship from which impeachment is now sought.\75\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            c. Pre-Federal Bench Conduct--Views of Constitutional 
                    Scholars
    There is broad support among scholars that certain pre-
Federal bench conduct--especially of the sort that was 
committed while Judge Porteous was a State judge--may properly 
constitute a basis for impeachment. At the Task Force Hearing 
of December 15, 2009, Professor Michael Gerhardt testified that 
though Article II of the Constitution describes certain types 
of conduct for which impeachment is warranted (``Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors''), ``it does 
not say when the misconduct must have been committed,''\76\ and 
certainly does not require that such conduct occur during the 
tenure of the Federal office from which impeachment is sought. 
As Professor Gerhardt noted, ``[t]he critical questions are 
whether Judge Porteous committed such misconduct and whether 
such misconduct demonstrates the lack of integrity and judgment 
that are required in order for him to continue to function'' as 
a Federal judge.\77\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \76\Prof. Gerhardt TF Hrg. IV at 30 (written statement of Prof. 
Michael J. Gerhardt, University of North Carolina at 4) (emphasis in 
original).
    \77\Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The reason for considering pre-Federal bench conduct in 
appropriate circumstances is evident from very basic examples. 
Take the situation where the individual committed a truly 
heinous crime prior to becoming a Federal judge:

          Say, for instance, that the offence was murder--it is 
        as serious a crime as any we have, and its commission 
        by a judge completely undermines both his integrity and 
        the moral authority he must have in order to function 
        as a Federal judge. The timing of the murder is of less 
        concern that the fact of it; this is the kind of 
        behavior that is completely incompatible with the 
        public trust invested in officials who are sufficiently 
        high-ranking to be subject to the impeachment 
        process.\78\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \78\Id. This particular example is used to illustrate the principle 
that pre-Federal bench conduct may justify impeachment; it is not 
intended to suggest that such conduct must be comparable to homicide. 
Rather, ``[f]rom there you simply have to ask yourself whether the 
conduct as a State judge is sufficiently egregious to rise to an 
impeachable standard.'' Prof. Geyh TF Hrg. IV at 36.

However, the crime or misconduct need not be comparable to 
homicide to justify impeachment. As another professor 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
testified:

          Let's take bribery. Imagine now a person who bribes 
        his very way into office. By definition, the bribery 
        here occurs prior to the commencement of office 
        holding. But surely that fact can't immunize the briber 
        from impeachment and removal. Had the bribery not 
        occurred, the person never would have been an officer 
        in the first place. \79\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \79\Prof. Amar TF Hrg. IV at 17.

Or, as the third expert testified: ``[A] quid pro quo 
arrangement with bail bondsmen . . . is the kind of corruption 
that fairly may be characterized as a violation of the public 
trust. Who cares if it occurred before [Judge Porteous took the 
Federal bench]?''\80\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \80\Prof. Geyh TF Hrg. IV at 36.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thus, consistent with reasons set forth in the Archbald 
Impeachment Report and those provided by three legal scholars 
at the Task Force Hearing, there is simply no basis in the 
Constitution, nor is there a basis in policy, for the House or 
Senate to adopt a narrow or technical reading of the 
Constitution so as to divest themselves of the power to 
consider pre-Federal bench conduct as a grounds for 
impeachment.
            d. Federal Bench Conduct
    Even though Judge Porteous's conduct while a Federal judge 
did not involve taking judicial actions to benefit the 
Marcottes, the Federal bench conduct constituted a continuation 
of the same unlawful relationship that was in place when Judge 
Porteous was a State judge, and consisted of Judge Porteous's 
efforts to help the Marcottes form relationships with no fewer 
than four State judicial officers as well as other business 
executives. By these acts, Judge Porteous assisted the 
Marcottes--whom he knew to be corrupt--to expand their reach in 
the 24th Judicial District Court (24th JDC). By attending meals 
with the Marcottes and other judicial officers, Judge Porteous 
not only received the benefit of those free meals, but provided 
the opportunity for the Marcottes to show off their 
relationship with him and to put their generosity on display by 
paying for him and the others who were in attendance. Though 
there is no evidence that Judge Porteous specifically 
communicated to these judges that he sought or intended for the 
Marcottes to form corrupt relationships with them, from his 
personal experience Judge Porteous knew that the Marcottes gave 
him and others things of value to induce favored treatment and 
thus had every reason to know that the Marcottes would seek to 
establish the same relationship with new judges. Thus, Judge 
Porteous was instrumental in helping the Marcottes form a bond 
with one State judge, Ronald Bodenheimer, with whom the 
Marcottes formed a corrupt relationship that continued for 
several years until he was arrested and convicted.\81\ Judge 
Porteous's vouching for the Marcottes was a critical causal 
factor in the perpetuation of the corruption in the setting of 
bail bonds in the 24th JDC even when Judge Porteous was no 
longer on the State bench.\82\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \81\Lori Marcotte Dep. at 47 (Ex. 76).
    \82\Canon 2B of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges (1999) 
provides: ``A judge should not lend the prestige of the judicial office 
to advance the private interests of others[.]'' Again, it is noteworthy 
that the sort of conduct that is described in Article II, which the 
Committee has concluded warrants Judge Porteous's impeachment, also 
runs afoul of standards of conduct promulgated by the Judicial 
Conference.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Article III
    Article III alleges that Judge Porteous committed numerous 
acts of misconduct in the course of his personal bankruptcy, 
including making false material statements under oath and 
otherwise violating court orders. This Article is analogous to 
the tax evasion, perjury, and obstruction of justice bases of 
impeachment set forth in the impeachments of Judge Harry E. 
Claiborne, Judge Walter Nixon and Judge Samuel B. Kent--each of 
which involved dishonesty under oath in arguably personal and/
or financial matters.
    In the case of Judge Harry E. Claiborne, a United States 
District Judge for the District of Nevada, the House voted four 
Articles of Impeachment. Articles I and II alleged that Judge 
Claiborne had filed false income tax returns for calendars 
years 1979 and 1980 under penalties of perjury. The returns 
were false because they reported total income in the amount of 
$80,227.04 and $54,251.00 respectively, when ``as he then and 
there well knew and believed, he received and failed to report 
substantial income [from legal fees] in addition to that stated 
on the return.'' Each Article further alleged that because of 
such conduct, Judge Claiborne ``was and is guilty of 
misbehavior and was and is guilty of a high crime and 
misdemeanor and, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and 
trial and removal from office.''\83\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \83\Claiborne Impeachment Report at 1-2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the impeachment of District Court Judge Walter Nixon, 
the first two Articles each alleged, in substance, discrete 
incidents of perjury before the grand jury, namely, that ``[i]n 
the course of his grand jury testimony and having duly taken an 
oath that he would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth, Judge Nixon did knowingly and contrary to his 
oath make material false or misleading statements to the grand 
jury.'' Each Article summarized the substance of the alleged 
perjurious statement. Article I, for example, alleged that 
``[t]he false or misleading statement was, in substance, that 
Forrest County District Attorney Paul Holmes never discussed 
the Drew Fairchild case with Judge Nixon.'' Each Article 
concluded: ``Wherefore, Judge Walter L. Nixon, Jr., is guilty 
of an impeachable offense and should be removed from 
office.''\84\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finally, the House voted four Articles of Impeachment 
against Judge Samuel B. Kent. Articles III and IV alleged, in 
substance, that Judge Kent obstructed justice by making false 
statements to the Fifth Circuit Special Investigatory Committee 
(Article III) and to the FBI when it investigated his conduct 
(Article IV).\85\

    Judge Porteous's conduct in his personal bankruptcy invites 
disrepute upon the judiciary. The need for honesty by the 
debtor in bankruptcy proceedings is obvious, and dishonesty by 
a Federal judge as a debtor in bankruptcy has particular 
ramifications. As Chief Judge Duncan Keir of the United States 
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland testified:

        [Because the conduct at issue] occurs by a Federal 
        judge, I think it has a potential effect of 
        denigrating, if you will, the integrity of the court. 
        What happens if 6 months later somebody has been found 
        by a bankruptcy court to have violated these oaths and 
        denied a discharge, and they appeal it, and the appeal 
        goes in front of Judge Porteous? What is that argument 
        going to be? You did it? I did it? It is untenable.\86\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \86\Keir TF Hrg. II at 81. Thus, though Judge Porteous's bankrutpcy 
conduct may have been ``personal'' in some respects, its consequences 
directly impact his ability to carry out his judicial responsibilities. 
Further, Judge Porteous's failure acts in the nature of filing false 
financial disclosure forms that concealed his liabilities for years, 
though not charged as part of Article III, constitute part of the 
evidence that implicates Judge Porteous's fitness to hold judicial 
office.

    Article III against Judge Porteous is consistent with these 
Articles against Judges Claiborne, Nixon and Kent. As with the 
Judge Claiborne impeachment, Article III against Judge Porteous 
charges that he filled out forms related to his own personal 
financial situation under penalty of perjury, on which he 
concealed material facts. And, as with the perjury and acts of 
obstruction alleged in the impeachment Articles against Judge 
Nixon and Judge Kent, Judge Porteous's dishonest statements on 
court forms and his violation of a court order occurred in the 
context of a Federal judicial proceeding and demonstrated a 
disregard of, and contempt for, the authority of the 
supervising Federal court.\87\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \87\Professor Gerhardt noted that the violation of the bankruptcy 
laws ``reflects a level of disdain for the law that I think is just 
simply incompatible with being a Federal judge.'' Prof. Gerhardt TF 
Hrg. IV at 36.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Article IV
    Article IV alleges that Judge Porteous committed a fraud on 
the judicial confirmation process by making material false 
statements to the FBI and on his Senate Judiciary Committee 
Questionnaire in response to questions as to whether there was 
anything in his past that could be used to blackmail or coerce 
him. Judge Porteous answered ``no'' to such inquiries, 
notwithstanding his unlawful financial relationships with 
certain attorneys (Creely and Amato) and with the Marcottes.
    For reasons set forth in the discussion of Article II, it 
is appropriate to consider pre-Federal bench conduct as a basis 
to impeach. Even though Judge Porteous did not make the 
statements in a judicial capacity, and even though this conduct 
did not carry over into his tenure as a Federal judge, the 
false statements corrupted the judicial appointment and 
rendered it illegitimate from its inception. As Professor Amar 
testified before the Task Force, after stating why pre-Federal 
bench ``bribery'' would constitute impeachable conduct:

        Now what is true of bribery is equally true of fraud. A 
        person who procures a judgeship by lying to the 
        President and lying to the Senate has wrongly obtained 
        his office by fraud and is surely removable via 
        impeachment for that fraud.\88\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \88\Prof. Amar TF Hrg. IV at 18.

    Professor Gerhardt agreed that ``lying to or defrauding the 
Senate in order to be approved as a Federal judge'' is likely 
to justify impeachment. First of all, that conduct is serious 
as a stand-alone matter in that it ``plainly erodes the 
essential, indispensable integrity without which a Federal 
judge is unable to do his job.''\89\ Professor Gerhardt noted, 
however, that in the case of Judge Porteous, it is not 
necessary to determine whether the false statements themselves 
demonstrated his unfitness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \89\Prof. Gerhardt TF Hrg. IV at 24.

        For, by defrauding the Senate in his confirmation 
        proceedings, Judge Porteous has engaged in misconduct 
        that is egregious and has a more than obvious 
        connection to his present position. The nexus is that 
        Judge Porteous deprived the Senate of information that 
        would undoubtedly have changed the outcome in his 
        confirmation hearing. His failure to disclose is 
        nothing less than an attack on the integrity of the 
        confirmation process and an affront to the 
        constitutional responsibilities of the President and 
        the Senate.\90\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \90\Prof. Gerhardt TF Hrg. IV at 31.

    The questions are sufficiently precise for purposes of 
concluding that the false answers were knowing and intentional, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and warrant impeachment. As Professor Amar testified:

        [E]veryone knows what is actually at the core of the 
        question[s]. Are you an honest person? Are you a person 
        of integrity? Do you have the requisites to hold a 
        position of honor, trust, and profit? Do you have 
        judicial integrity? That is at the core of all these 
        questions. That is not at the periphery.
          And what he lied about was his gross misconduct as a 
        judge: taking money from parties, taking money in cash 
        envelopes, not reporting any of this to anyone. . . .

                              *    *    *

          [W]e know what those questions at their core [were] 
        about, and he lied at the core. There is vagueness at 
        the periphery, but this was really central.\91\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \91\Prof. Amar TF Hrg. IV at 34-35. Professor Amar further noted 
that these questions did not constitute some sort of ``trap'' for the 
unwary: ``All he has to do is say, [`]I do not wish to be considered 
for this position.[']'' Id. at 42.

 VIII. THE FACTS UNDERLYING ARTICLE I--JUDGE PORTEOUS'S RELATIONSHIPS 
    WITH ATTORNEYS ROBERT CREELY, JACOB AMATO, JR., DON GARDNER AND 
        LEONARD LEVENSON, AND HIS HANDLING OF THE LILJEBERG CASE

                            A. Introduction

    Judge Porteous, while a State court judge, was particularly 
close to four attorneys: Jacob Amato, Jr., with whom Judge 
Porteuos had practiced law; Robert Creely, Amato's partner who 
also practiced with Judge Porteous; and local attorneys Leonard 
Levenson and Donald Gardner. These individuals regularly paid 
for expensive lunches for Judge Porteous, accompanied him on 
travel, including travel to gambling establishments, hosted him 
on hunting trips, and otherwise subsidized his lifestyle. 
Creely and Amato, in particular, provided Judge Porteous 
substantial cash from ``curatorships'' assigned to Creely by 
Judge Porteous.
    Judge Porteous's personal and financial relationships with 
these attorneys, as well as his financial dependence upon them, 
became particularly significant in connection with his handling 
of a civil case, Lifemark Hospitals of La., Inc., v. Liljeberg 
Enterprises, Inc.,\92\ when he was a Federal judge. A few weeks 
prior to the scheduled November 1996 non-jury trial before 
Judge Porteous, the defendants (the Liljebergs) brought in 
Amato and Levenson as trial counsel. In response, the 
plaintiffs (Lifemark) filed a motion to recuse Judge Porteous, 
arguing that Amato's and Levenson's late entry in the case and 
their known close relationships with Judge Porteous supported 
the conclusion that Amato and Levenson were hired precisely 
because of those relationships. Counsel for Lifemark, however, 
was unaware of any prior financial relationship between Judge 
Porteous and Amato, and unaware that Amato and his partner 
Creely had provided Judge Porteous thousands of dollars in cash 
while Judge Porteous was a State judge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \92\Civ. Action No. 93-1794 (E.D. La.). See PACER Docket Report 
(Ex. 50).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Porteous denied Lifemark's recusal motion in a 
fashion that concealed his respective relationships with Amato 
and Levenson. Lifemark then added Gardner to their trial team. 
Trial was ultimately held in June and July 1997. Subsequent to 
trial, while the case was pending his decision, and while his 
financial circumstances were significantly deteriorating, Judge 
Porteous continued to seek money and accept other things of 
value from these four attorneys.
    Finally, in April 2000, as his financial situation became 
increasingly dire (and just weeks prior to his consulting with 
a bankruptcy attorney), Judge Porteous ruled for the 
Liljebergs. This verdict, if it had stood, would have been 
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees to Amato 
(and his partner Creely) and Levenson--men who had supported 
Judge Porteous's life-style for years. Judge Porteous's 
decision was reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in 
a scathing opinion that castigated Judge Porteous's legal 
reasoning.

          B. Relationships with the Attorneys Pre-Liljeberg--
              Meals, Trips, Hunting and Entertainment\93\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \93\There is no attempt here to break out the meals, entertainment, 
and trips that occurred prior to and subsequent to Judge Porteous's 
appointment as a Federal judge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Meals and Related Entertainment. Beginning with Judge 
Porteous's years on the State court bench and continuing 
through his tenure on the Federal bench, the four attorneys--
Creely, Amato, Levenson and Gardner--routinely provided Judge 
Porteous with meals, trips, and entertainment, as well as 
covered other expenses.
    Amato and Creely took Judge Porteous to lunch frequently. 
When asked how frequently Judge Porteous paid, Amato testified 
``[n]ot very often.''\94\ As Amato noted: ``He [Porteous] 
probably paid for one or two of them.''\95\ As to the frequency 
of the lunches: ``It would depend upon what his schedule was 
and my schedule. I would say we probably met two to three times 
a month over a, you know, a period of time. And depending--you 
know, some months it might have been more. Some months less. It 
just depended.''\96\ Amato identified the restaurants he took 
Judge Porteous to as including: Red Maple, Beef Connection, 
Ruth's Chris Steak House, Fitzgerald's, and Smith & 
Wollensky's.\97\ Amato also recalled paying for Porteous's 
swearing in party as a Federal judge at the ``Jefferson 
Orleans,''\98\ at which about 100 to 200 people attended.\99\ 
This would have been in late 1994. This party would have cost 
several thousand dollars.\100\

    \95\Amato 5th Cir. Hrg. at 255 (Ex. 20). See also Amato TF Hrg. I

occasion'').

    \99\Amato GJ at 66 (Ex. 18).
    \100\Amato GJ at 39 (Ex. 18).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Gardner described purchasing Judge Porteous numerous meals 
over time--``50, 60 lunches a year when he was a [New Orleans] 
district court judge.''\101\ In response to questioning at the 
Task Force deposition, Gardner agreed that he had paid for 
``countless, countless, countless more meals'' than Judge 
Porteous had paid for Gardner.\102\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \101\Gardner GJ at 69 (Ex. 33). See also, Gardner Dep. at 8 (lunch 
``once a week'' when Judge Porteous was a State judge) (Ex. 36).
    \102\Gardner Dep. at 37 (Ex. 36).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Levenson also testified to treating Judge Porteous to 
lunches over the years. Levenson testified that, starting while 
Judge Porteous was a State court judge, these lunches ``would 
average . . . maybe over the course of a year three or four 
times a month, or more. Some months would be or some weeks 
would be more. Some would be less.''\103\ Levenson paid 
``[m]ost of the time;''\104\ Judge Porteous paid ``[v]ery 
rarely.''\105\ ``To say that I could specifically remember him 
picking up another lunch bill, no. Did he do it? I'm sure he 
did. Was it rare? Yes.''\106\ Levenson listed the restaurants 
they went to as Mandina's, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Smith & 
Wollensky's, Bon Ton, Red Maple, and the Beef Connection.\107\ 
Judge Porteous at the Fifth Circuit Hearing testified that 
Levenson took him out to places such as Ruth's Chris Steak 
House and Smith & Wollensky's.\108\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \103\Levenson GJ at 10 (Ex. 25).
    \104\Levenson GJ at 10 (Ex. 25).

    \106\Levenson GJ at 12 (Ex. 25).
    \107\Levenson GJ at 15 (Ex. 25); Levenson Dep. at 28 (Ex. 30). 
Judge Porteous stipulated to Levenson's and Forstall's grand jury 
testimony at the Fifth Circuit Hearing. 5th Cir. Hrg. at 341.
    \108\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 128 (Ex. 10). Another attorney, 
Warren A. Forstall, stated he would take Judge Porteous to lunch at 
Ruth's Chris Steak House and Smith & Wollensky's, and that he 
[Forstall] always paid the bill. Forstall GJ at 30 (Ex. 38). The Ruth's 
Chris Steak House bills, on average, were $100. Id. at 31.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Former State Judge Ronald Bodenheimer testified that when 
he was first elected, Judge Porteous gave him pointers on being 
a judge. Judge Porteous told Bodenheimer that he would ``never 
have to buy lunch again. . . . There will always be somebody to 
take you to lunch.''\109\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \109\Bodenheimer testified that Judge Porteous told him:

      Congratulations kid, you know. Now, let me tell you, give 
      you some pointers about being a judge. Number one, you'll 
      never be known as Ronnie again. You'll be judge for the 
      rest of your life. Number two, you'll never have to buy 
      lunch again OK. There will always be somebody to take you 
      to lunch. And number three, always wash your rear end so 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      the attorneys have a clean place to kiss.

Bodenheimer GJ at 10 (Ex. 87). See also Bodenheimer Dep. at 12 (Ex. 
86).
    These attorneys continued taking Judge Porteous out for 
lunches after he became a Federal judge, including during the 
period when they had the Liljeberg case pending before him.
    Creely took Judge Porteous on several hunting and fishing 
trips while Judge Porteous was on the State bench. For example, 
Creely identified a dove hunt in Mexico in September 1990, 
where he paid for Judge Porteous. Creely also took Judge 
Porteous on another dove hunting trip to Mexico--probably in 
September 1993.\110\ The cost of these trips paid for by Creely 
would have been approximately $1,500 per person plus air 
fare.\111\ Creely also took Judge Porteous fishing on a 
houseboat Creely leased at Delacroix Island on more than 20 
occasions--each time hosting Judge Porteous.\112\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \110\Creely GJ at 19-20 (Ex. 11). Creely also testified there may 
have been another trip to Mexico in 1995 (when Judge Porteous was a 
Federal judge). He said he knows he took Judge Porteous twice, and 
maybe a third time. Id at. 20-21. Creely also traveled to Las Vegas 
with Judge Porteous a few times when Judge Porteous was a State judge. 
Creely recalled going to Las Vegas with Judge Porteous as part of a 
fund-raiser to retire campaign debt of a local candidate in September 
1990 , Creely GJ at 29-31 (Ex. 11) and in January 1991 on a Jefferson 
Bar ``Continuing Legal Education'' trip. Creely GJ at 32 (Ex. 11). 
Caesars Palace records reflect that Creely gambled at that casino in 
January 1991.
    \111\Creely GJ at 19-20. Creely also testified there may have been 
another trip to Mexico in 1995 when Judge Porteous was a Federal judge. 
He testified he knows he took Judge Porteous twice, and maybe a third 
time. Id. at 20-21.
    \112\Creely GJ at 24-25 (Ex. 11).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Levenson went on trips to Las Vegas with Judge Porteous, as 
part of a group, on more than one occasion when Judge Porteous 
was a State judge. Levenson also recalled going on ``one . . . 
maybe two'' trips to Las Vegas. One of the trips was to the 
Riviera Hotel where Levenson shared a room with Judge Porteous. 
Attorney Warren Forstall also went on that trip and roomed with 
State Judge George Giacobbe. Although Levenson did not have a 
specific recollection of what he may have paid for Judge 
Porteous, he answered affirmatively that he ``could state with 
confidence . . . that [he] paid for some aspects of drinks or 
meals or other entertainment . . . for which Judge Porteous 
would have been a beneficiary.''\113\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \113\Levenson Dep. at 18-19 (Ex. 30).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Gardner also recalled going to Las Vegas with Judge 
Porteous on several Jefferson Bar Association ``Continuing 
Legal Education'' trips, which he thought occurred in the 
1970's.\114\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \114\Gardner GJ at 23 (Ex. 33).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

             C. Cash from Creely and Amato (Pre-Liljeberg)

    Amato and Creely formed a law partnership in about 1975 
that lasted until 2005. It was a true partnership--all the 
income and expenses were shared, they held joint accounts, they 
held themselves out as partners, and took equal draws.\115\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \115\Creely Dep. at 3 (Ex. 16).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While he was on the State bench, Judge Porteous requested 
cash from Creely on several occasions. Creely provided cash to 
Judge Porteous in response to those requests. As Creely 
testified:

        Q. L[C]an you just describe a typical instance that 
        would characterize how this request would be made and 
        the sorts of dollar amounts which were encompassed by 
        these requests?

        A. LIn reference to the dollar amounts, it would be 
        hard for me to say. He would ask me for money when we 
        were together socially or fishing or one of those 
        things. He would ask for money.

        Q. LDid he give you reasons?

        A. LYes. He would have--it would be a number of 
        reasons, just a number of reasons, like needing to pay 
        tuition, needing to meet his obligations, financial 
        obligations.\116\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \116\Creely Dep. at 6 (Ex. 16). Before the Grand jury, Creely 
testified: ``Every time he came to us it was a car note he couldn't 
pay. His house was being foreclosed upon. He couldn't pay his kids' 
tuition.'' Creely GJ at 61 (Ex. 11). At the Fifth Circuit hearing, 
Creely stated that Judge Porteous requested the money ``for various 
personal issues.'' . . . ``[I]t would be things like tuition, different 
things that he needed in his--in his personal life.'' Creely 5th Cir. 
Hrg. at 199 (Ex. 12).

The amounts were as much as $500 to $1,000 and Creely never 
perceived these payments to be loans.\117\ Creely explained 
that he and his partner, Amato, would take draws from the firm 
account in the form of checks payable to the two men, would 
cash the checks, and would give Judge Porteous the cash. When 
asked to describe the mechanics of how he would get the money 
to give to Judge Porteous, Creely testified:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \117\Creely Dep. at 7 (Ex. 16).

        [I] think sometimes I had to go cash a check, take a 
        draw, yes. Yes, sir. I did not always have money to 
        hand him. I would have to get--I'd have to say, you 
        know--``You know, his tuition's due. He can't pay his 
        tuition, Jake [Amato].'' And he`d say, ``all right,'' 
        you know. ``How much money does he need?'' And I would 
        say five hundred or a thousand dollars, whatever. I'm 
        just--and I wanna try to be fair to him, OK, to 
        whatever number. And then we'd go get a check cashed 
        and give him the money.\118\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \118\Creely GJ at 50 (Ex. 11). See also Creely TF Hrg. I at 20 
(Judge Porteous would ask for money for ``tuition'' and ``living 
expenses'').

    Even though the requests were made to Creely, and the 
actual provision of money to Judge Porteous came from Creely, 
the payments to Judge Porteous were split 50-50 between Creely 
and Amato.\119\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \119\Creely Dep. at 8 (Ex. 16).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Amato testified consistently as to Judge Porteous's reasons 
for needing money (as reported to Amato by Creely), the 
frequency of the requests, the procedures for getting the money 
to Judge Porteous, and the fact that the payments were split 
between Amato and Creely. Amato testified that ``Bob [Creely] 
would come in and say, you know, `Porteous is looking for 
money.''' After the request was made: ``We both took draws to 
do it. We would split it. . . .'' Amato characterized the 
reasons Judge Porteous gave as follows: ``[H]e couldn't pay the 
tuition for his children. He was gonna lose his house. They 
were gonna take his car. His daughter was a maid in the 
Washington Ball and he needed money. Those are the kind of 
stories that I would get through Bob Creely that Porteous 
needed money. . . . [H]e [Judge Porteous] was always poor 
mouthing, you know, he was always busted. He always--you know, 
it was always a catastrophe. It was always something that, you 
know--that, you know, hard to ask a--it's hard to turn down a 
friend, you know.''\120\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        D. The Curatorship Kickback Scheme with Creely and Amato

1. Creely's and Amato's Testimony
    Creely ultimately balked at providing monies to Judge 
Porteous. Creely testified: ``I told him, quite frankly, I 
thought it was an imposition on our friendship for him to 
continue to ask me for money.''\121\ As Creely stated in his 
Task Force deposition: ``I got tired of the requests for every 
request he made. I was tired of it.''\122\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \121\Creely TF Hrg. I at 21.
    \122\Creely Dep. at 7 (Ex. 16). Creely testified consistently 
before the Fifth Circuit: ``[I] told him that I--we could not continue 
giving him money, I couldn't continue giving him money.'' Creely 5th 
Cir. Hrg. at 204 (Ex. 12).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As a result of Creely's discontent, and in order to 
generate cash that Creely and Amato could then use to provide 
Judge Porteous money as he requested, Judge Porteous began 
increasingly to assign Creely ``curatorships.''\123\ Judge 
Porteous took this initiative at a time when Creely was 
resisting giving him more money. Creely described how this 
scheme began as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \123\Creely described the duties of a curator as follows: ``[W]hat 
you do is, you represent an absentee that they can't find. So when 
somebody would get their house foreclosed on and they would leave and 
they couldn't find them to serve them with the foreclosure proceedings 
the court would appoint a lawyer. And I would be the curator in the 
Porteous instances, in which case then I would have to--the bank would 
give me the last known address--write a letter, registered letter. Then 
I'd have to run an ad in the newspaper. And then I'd have to get a 
certified copy. . . . But a curator is to represent a person that they 
can't find.'' Creely GJ at 101-02 (Ex. 11).

        [T]his borrowing turned into this, as you said, burden, 
        and that's a good word 'cause I, you know, can use many 
        words for it. But he--there was a time I said, you 
        know, ``I just can't keep doing this man, I can't keep 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        supporting your family.'' . . .

        And so I told him I had to stop. I gotta stop doing 
        this. All right . . . But he started sending 
        curatorships over to my office. . . . And he would send 
        like two or three at a time. . . .

        And he then started calling and saying, ``Look. I've 
        been sending you curators, you know. Can you give me 
        the money for the curators?'' I said, ``Man.'' So I 
        talked to my law partner. I said, ``Jake, you know, man 
        what do we do?'' He says, ``Well, just go ahead and 
        give it to him.'' We decided to give him the money. We 
        would deduct the expenses. We would pay income taxes on 
        it. . . .

        But the practice became that he--and it got to the 
        point that he would call my secretary and say, 
        ``Dianne, how may curators do I have over there?'' And 
        then she'd come in and it was like a--it was a bad 
        deal. I mean, it's a bad feeling. OK. And she would 
        say, she'd say, ``Hey, you got four or five curators'' 
        and say, ``He's calling wanting the money on [sic].'' 
        And I said, ``Well, just go get two draws, one for 
        Jake, one for me'' and then I would give him the money. 
        Either me or Jake would give him the money.\124\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \124\Creely GJ at 51-54 (Ex. 11).

Creely would receive a fee of approximately $200 for a 
curatorship, which went into the law firm accounts. Creely did 
not want these curatorships,\125\ even though they involved 
minimal work.\126\ Rather, Creely viewed these curatorships as 
``basically a way for me to supply him funds as before instead 
of coming out of my pocket. It was being provided through the 
curatorships.''\127\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \125\At the Task Force Hearing, when asked if he wanted Judge 
Porteous to assign him curatorships, Creely answered, ``No, I did 
not,'' and testified they were not important to his business. Creely TF 
Hrg. I at 21-22.
    \126\All the work, consisting primarily of placing notices in the 
newspapers and preparing routine notices to be filed with the court, 
was done by Creely's secretary.
    \127\Creely 5th Cir. Hrg. at 209-10 (Ex.12).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This was not a dollar-for-dollar arrangement. At the Fifth 
Circuit Hearing, Creely testified that Judge Porteous received 
more than 50% of the curatorship fees. Creely also confirmed 
that the payments of the curatorship fees to Judge Porteous 
were at Judge Porteous's request.\128\ Notwithstanding the 
mechanics of the scheme, Creely resisted characterizing it as a 
``kickback'' scheme because Creely did not believe he was 
getting anything out of the arrangement:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \128\Creely 5th Cir. Hrg. at 208-09 (Ex. 12).

        It had nothing to do with, ``Look, why don't you give 
        me these and I'll give you that back,'' or ``Do 
        something for me and--you know, and I'll give you this 
        back.'' It was just--it just occurred that he--you 
        know, he got the curator money.\129\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \129\Creely 5th Cir. Hrg. at 209-10 (Ex.12). The term ``kickback'' 
is occasionally used in this Report notwithstanding Creely's resistence 
to it, and notwithstanding the evidence that suggests that he and Amato 
were not thrilled about this financial relationship, about engaging in 
these acts to give Judge Porteous money at Judge Porteous's 
instigation.

    In the Task Force Hearing, Creely similarly resisted the 
use of the term ``kickback'' to describe the relationship, 
describing the fact that he had received the curatorships from 
Judge Porteous as a ``justification to help him out so that I 
didn't have to go and spend my own money on him.''\130\ 
Nonetheless, Creely understood that Judge Porteous linked his 
assignment of curatorships to Creely's giving cash back to 
Judge Porteous.\131\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \130\Creely TF Hrg. I at 23.
    \131\From Creely TF Hrg. I at 23:

      Q. [S]o he was taking official acts [assigning 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      curatorships] to enrich himself, correct?

      A. [Creely] I can't speak for him, but that was my 
      understanding.

        Q. L[Mr. Johnson] The curatorship process, you say that 
        you would not--there was no agreement before this 
        scheme started, but didn't it become apparent to you 
        during the course of the curatorship scheme that this 
        was a way of you being able to pay Judge Porteous?

        A. LIt evolved into that, yes. He began to rely upon 
        the curators, began to call for them, and we 
        rationalized he is asking for money, giving him the 
        money. And it wasn't all of the money, but, yes, it--
        that is what it sounds like.\132\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \132\Creely TF Hrg. I at 38.

    Creely's partner, Amato, confirmed the essentials of this 
arrangement. Amato testified that ``Mr. Creely came to me 1 day 
and said that Tom--or Judge Porteous asked him for some money 
based upon sending curatorships. . . . Bob [Creely] would tell 
me Judge Porteous needs, you know, $500, $1,000, whatever it is 
for the curatorships, and we would each draw a check for 
whatever half the amount that he requested.''\133\ In response 
to questioning by Task Force Chairman Schiff, Amato testified:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \133\Amato TF Hrg. I at 100. He also testified before the Task 
Force: ``[J]udge Porteous sent curator cases to Bob Creely and at some 
point asked that he be--receive some of that money.'' Id. Amato has 
been consistent throughout his various appearances. Before the grand 
jury, Amato testified that Judge Porteous ``would send curatorships to 
Bob Creely and then he would ask Bob to, you know, `I need some money 
for one of these catastrophes. And, you know, I've sent you 10 or 15 or 
20' or however many `curatorships so, you know, send me a check or' not 
`Send me a check.' But you know, `I need some money.''' Amato GJ at 61 
(Ex. 18). At the Fifth Circuit Hearing, he testified: ``At some point 
in time when Judge Porteous was on the State bench, Bob Creely started 
getting a number of curator cases. And after a period of time that that 
went on, Bob came to me and said that, `The judge is--Judge Porteous 
wants some of the curator fees. What should we do?' . . . Well, I told 
him I didn't like the idea but I guess it's something we had to do.'' 
Amato 5th Cir. Hrg. at 238 (Ex. 20).

        Q. L[Mr. Schiff] [W]as there ever any doubt in your 
        mind that what he [Judge Porteous] was asking for 
        during the period he was sending you curatorships was 
        part of the money he was sending you for the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        curatorships?

        A. LNo, no doubt.\134\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \134\Amato TF Hrg. I at 107.

    Amato knew that giving money to Judge Porteous was 
wrong.\135\ When asked whether he felt he had a choice as to 
giving Judge Porteous money, he replied: ``Yes, I think we had 
a choice, but I just wasn't strong enough to put an end to it. 
To put an end to it, I would have to break up my law 
partnership and break up a friendship that I have had over a 
number of years with Judge Porteous, and I wasn't strong 
enough.''\136\

2. Judge Porteous's Statements About His Financial Relationship with 
        Amato and Creely at the Fifth Circuit Hearing
    In his testimony at the Fifth Circuit Hearing, Judge 
Porteous confirmed the essential aspects of his receiving cash 
from Amato and Creely at the Fifth Circuit Hearing. He admitted 
that: 1) he received cash from Creely and Amato; 2) at some 
time, Creely expressed his displeasure with giving him cash; 
and 3) thereafter his receipts of cash were linked to his 
assigning Creely curatorships. At that Hearing, he testified:

        Q. LWhen did you first start getting cash from Messrs. 
        Amato, Creely, or their law firm?

        A. LProbably when I was on State bench.

        Q. LAnd that practice continued into 1994, when you 
        became a Federal judge, did it not?

        A. LI believe that's correct.\137\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \137\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 119 (Ex. 10).

Judge Porteous also admitted that these transactions 
``occasionally'' followed his assignment of curatorships to 
Creely, though he claimed he did not know if the amounts paid 
back to him ``matched each time'' the curatorship fees.\138\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \138\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 130-33 (Ex. 10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Furthermore, Judge Porteous confirmed that he started 
assigning Creely the curatorships after Creely expressed 
resistance to giving Judge Porteous money:

        Q. LDo you recall Mr. Creely refusing to pay you money 
        before the curatorships started?

        A. LHe may have said I needed to get my finances under 
        control, yeah.\139\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \139\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 134 (Ex. 10).

    Judge Porteous implied in his cross-examination of Creely 
and Amato at the Fifth Circuit Hearing that he gave Creely and 
Amato the curatorships so they would have funds to pay an 
individual they had hired at Judge Porteous's request. Amato 
denied this to be the case and Creely did not recall it.\140\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \140\Creely 5th Cir. Hrg. at 232-33 (Ex. 12); Amato 5th Cir. Hrg. 
at 260-62 (Ex. 20). In any event, this would not provide any legitimate 
basis for curatorship fees to have been given back to Judge Porteous.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Judge Porteous's Knowledge of Amato's Financial Participation
    Even though Judge Porteous's requests for and receipts of 
cash went through Creely, the evidence establishes that Judge 
Porteous knew that the monies coming back to him were from 
Amato as well. Judge Porteous was close to Amato, had practiced 
with him, and the Amato-Creely partnership was well-known. When 
asked at the Task Force Hearing if Judge Porteous would have 
known the money was coming from Amato as well as Creely, Amato 
responded: ``Of course. We owned our own office building. We 
had checks. We had business cards. We filed pleadings and, you 
know, Amato and Creely, a professional law corporation.''\141\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \141\Amato TF Hrg. I at 100. Amato elaborated in his deposition: 
``[W]e had a professional law corporation, Amato and Creely, PLC. We 
filed tax returns. We had office signs. We had cards, checks. We owned 
the office building together. . . .'' ``[W]e had a pension profit 
sharing plan. . . .'' He went on to testify:

      Q. Now, in the course of those encounters from your vantage 
      point, would Judge Porteous have known that you and Bob 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      were true, full-blown partners?

      A. I don't, I don't know anything else we could have done 
      to indicate otherwise.
      *    *    *
      Q. And following up, therefore, on the previous set of 
      questions, is there any question in your mind that Judge 
      Porteous would have known that the money that was coming 
      back from Mr. Creely for those curatorships was an equal 
      part money coming from you?

      A. I would, I would think so. I mean, I, I don't know what 
      was in his mind, but I would think he would imagine that, 
      you know.

Amato Dep. at 5-7 (Ex. 24).
    Further, Judge Porteous, in questioning Amato at the Fifth 
Circuit Hearing, evidenced his understanding that the money 
provided to Judge Porteous came from Amato in addition to 
Creely:

        Q. L[J]ust so I'm clear, this money that was given to 
        me, was it done because I'm a judge, to influence me, 
        or just because we're friends?

        A. LTom, it's because we were friends and we've been 
        friends for 35 years. And it breaks my heart to be 
        here.\142\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \142\Amato 5th Cir. Hrg. at 258-59 (Ex. 20).

4. Frequency and Amounts of Cash from Amato and Creely
    Throughout the various proceedings--the DOJ investigation, 
the Fifth Circuit Hearing, and the Task Force Inquiry--efforts 
have been made to quantify the amounts of cash given to Judge 
Porteous by Creely and Amato. Creely's and Amato's estimates 
have varied.
            a. Grand Jury Testimony
    In his March 2006 questioning before the grand jury, Creely 
estimated that the total amount given to Porteous could have 
been more or less than $10,000.

        Q. LAnd how much cash we're talking about?

        A. L[I] don't know how much it is. I mean, it could be 
        $10,000. It could be less than that.\143\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \143\Creely GJ at 44 (Ex. 11).

    In his May 2006 questioning before the grand jury, Amato 
testified that the amount was greater than $10,000 and less 
than $50,000, agreeing that it was ``probably'' over $10,000, 
but ``I don't think it ever approached anywhere near 
[$50,000].\144\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \144\Amato GJ at 36-37 (Ex. 18). Amato testified that he thought 
all the funds given to Judge Porteous came from the ``curatorship'' 
scheme. Amato 5th Cir. Hrg. at 242 (Ex. 20).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            b. Fifth Circuit Hearing
    In October 2007, before the Fifth Circuit, Creely was asked 
how much he and Amato gave to Judge Porteous. He responded: ``I 
would say approximately $10,000 thereabout. Maybe more than 
that but at least 10,000.''\145\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \145\Creely 5th Cir. Hrg. at 201 (Ex. 12).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In response to questioning by Judge Benavides, Amato 
testified consistently with his grand jury testimony as to the 
frequency and total amount of the cash requests--this time 
agreeing that it could be from $10,000 to $20,000:

        A. LIt has just--it's been so long ago and so much 
        water under the bridge since then, I can't tell you 
        specifically how many draws we took, how much money we 
        gave, and when did we give it to him.

        Q. LAll we need is an amount.

        A. LIt was never an amount that was astonishing. It was 
        always a couple thousand dollars.

        Q. LA couple thousand dollars sometimes every 6 months 
        and sometimes every three or 4 weeks?

        A. LYeah, but, I mean, it wasn't a constant thing. It 
        wasn't, you know, ``Look, I expect a check every 
        Thursday'' or Friday for 2 weeks or anything like that, 
        no.

                              *    *    *

        Q. LAll right. But there's no doubt that there had 
        been, you say, not more than $50,000; but would be fair 
        to say ten to twenty thousand dollars in cash?

        A. LI would say, yes, close to that.\146\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \146\Amato 5th Cir. Hrg. at 242, 247 (Ex. 20).

    In his testimony before the Fifth Circuit, Judge Porteous 
admitted receiving cash from Amato and Creely, but would not be 
pinned down on an amount. He did not deny that the total amount 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
could have been in excess of $10,000. He testified as follows:

        Q. LJudge Porteous, over the years, how much cash have 
        you received from Jake Amato and Bob Creely or their 
        law firm?

        A. LI have no earthly idea.

                              *    *    *

        Q. LIt could have been $10,000 or more. Isn't that 
        right?

        A. LAgain, you're asking me to speculate. I have no 
        idea is all I can tell you.

        Q. LWhen did you first start getting cash from Messrs. 
        Amato, Creely, or their law firm?

        A. LProbably when I was on State bench.

        Q. LAnd that practice continued into 1994, when you 
        became a Federal judge, did it not?

        A. LI believe that's correct.\147\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \147\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 118-19 (Ex. 10).

            c. Task Force Inquiry--Creely and Amato Depositions
    In Creely's Task Force Deposition, he stated that the 
amount paid to Judge Porteous by Amato and himself was close to 
$20,000 (including approximately $2,500 paid in 1999, discussed 
below). He testified:

        Q. LWhat is your best feel for how much that [what you 
        and Amato gave Judge Porteous] would have amounted to?

        A. LDuring the twenty year period of time he was on the 
        bench, it would be about $10,000 a piece.

        Q. LSo that would be about $20,000; is that right?

        A. LYes.

        Q. LAnd this was all cash, correct?

        A. LYes.\148\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \148\Creely Dep. at 8-9 (Ex. 16).

    At his deposition, Amato acknowledged that the amount could 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
have even been greater than $20,000:

        Q. LNow, referring again to these monies from the 
        curatorships, at some point in prior testimony the 
        amount of $10,000 was used to describe in some sense 
        the amount of monies which had come from you and Creely 
        to Judge Porteous when he was a State judge. If upon 
        the analysis of the curatorship records the amount 
        proves to be greater by some substantial amount, is 
        that a fact that you would take dispute with?

        A. LNo. I don't--I have no idea how much the curators 
        amounted to.

        Q. LOkay. So if it was over 20,000 or over 30,000 or 
        whatever the dollar amount is, that is not an amount 
        that you would disagree with?

        A. LRight.\149\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \149\Amato Dep. at 7-8 (Ex. 24).

            d. Task Force Hearing Testimony
    At the Task Force Hearing, Creely, consistent with his 
deposition testimony, estimated the amount that he and Amato 
paid to Judge Porteous was approximately $20,000.\150\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \150\Creely TF Hrg. I at 24.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Amato, like Creely, estimated at the Task Force Hearing 
that the amount was ``over $10,000, but how much over, I don't 
know.''\151\ He did not disagree with Creely's estimate that 
the amount could have been as much as $20,000.\152\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \151\Amato TF Hrg. I at 101. See also Amato TF Hrg. I at 108

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            e. Analysis of the Curatorship Records from the 24th 
                    Judicial District Court
    Subsequent to Creely's deposition but before Amato was 
deposed, the Task Force obtained from Amato a computer printout 
of records that were retained in his office's computer system 
that listed the curatorships assigned to Creely.\153\ The 
printout revealed that Creely had over 350 curatorships 
assigned to him (from all judges--not just Judge Porteous) in 
the late 1980's (when the firm's financial records were first 
computerized) and early 1990's. Of the cases listed in that 
printout, the Clerk's Office of the 24th Judicial District 
Court (``24th JDC'') located and made certified copies of the 
curatorship cases that, based on case assignment information, 
appeared to be the ones that were most likely to have been 
handled by Judge Porteous. Those records have been provided to 
the Task Force. The analysis of those records reflects the 
following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \153\Ex. 193. These were identified by Amato's long-time accountant 
Jody Rotolo. See also Rotolo Dep. (Ex. 191). Mr. Amato provided the 
records to the Task Force without a subpoena.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Total number of curatorships assigned to Creely: 350

        Total number of these cases located by the 24th JDC
            Clerk's Office: 209

        Total number of theses cases assigned to Creely by
             Judge Porteous: 192

    The reimbursement amount to Creely would have started at 
$150 in 1988, increased to $200 sometime in 1988, and stayed at 
$200 until 1994. The payment to Creely for the 192 curatorships 
that have been identified is approximately as shown in the 
following chart:\154\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \154\This chart has been marked as Ex. 190. A similar chart, used 
at the November 17, 2009 Task Force Hearing, listed 191 curatorship 
cases. Further review has identified an additional curatorship assigned 
by Judge Porteous to Creely, and has revealed a few changes in the 
amounts in some of the years. The curatorships are listed on the 
Exhibit List as Exhibits 189(1) through 189(227), and includes a few 
curatorships that were assigned to Creely by other judges.


    Thus, the best evidence to date is that a minimum, Judge 
Porteous assigned curatorships to Creely resulting in Creely 
receiving fees amounting to over $37,500 from 1988 through 
1994.

                E. Cash and Things of Value from Gardner

    Donald Gardner was another attorney from whom Judge 
Porteous asked for money and other things of value, and who 
also ended up as an attorney in the Liljeberg case discussed 
below. His testimony, including his description of Judge 
Porteous's behavior, is consistent with (and thus serves to 
corroborate) the testimony of Creely and Amato.
    As to requests for cash, Gardner testified he gave Judge 
Porteous money on more than one occasion, at least sometimes in 
connection with Judge Porteous's gambling. Gardner's grand jury 
testimony does not pin him down on the frequency of these 
events or the dates they occurred:

        I wouldn't say often, but when I was with Tom 
        [Porteous], he'd come up to me . . . Donnie, you got 
        $200? Can I borrow $200 from you? I'm a little short. 
        I'd give him the $200. Can I borrow $100 from you? You 
        know. And I'd give it to him.\155\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \155\Gardner GJ at 31 (Ex. 33).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similarly:

        I think he [Porteous] was always short. I think that's 
        why, you know, he would ask me from time to time for 
        money for stuff, you know, to buy gifts, to do this or 
        whatever.

        At the gambling casinos at the CLE [Continuing Legal 
        Education trips], you know, I remember. . . . I gave 
        him a couple hundred dollars. He, you know, Donnie, I'm 
        busted. You got a couple hundred dollars on you? Like I 
        said, I didn't gamble. I always had money if you don't 
        gamble. \156\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \156\Gardner GJ at 62-63 (Ex. 33). Gardner provided more detail in 
his deposition testimony, testifying: ``[On occasions] when we were at 
CLE [Continuing Legal Education], he would come up and say, `Don, you 
got a hundred dollars?' And sometimes I'd give him a couple 20's. I'd 
give him--I'd count out five 20's or a hundred dollars. But I have to 
tell you, there was never any occasions where Tom Porteous ever asked 
me for any large sums of money or did I give him that. It would just 
be, `Hey, I'm short. You've got a few dollars?''' Gardner Dep. at 32 
(Ex. 36).

    At the Fifth Circuit Hearing, Gardner estimated the amount 
he gave Judge Porteous to be ``[p]robably less than 
[$]3,000.''\157\ Gardner agreed with the questioner that his 
payments to Judge Porteous were ``in small amounts, like $300 
or a hundred dollars, when he [Judge Porteous] would 
ask.''\158\ Gardner specifically recalled an instance when he 
gave Judge Porteous $200 so that Judge Porteous could buy a 
Christmas present (drinking glasses) for his wife.\159\ In the 
grand jury, Gardner testified that the total amount was more 
like $2,000:

        Q. LHow many times did he ask you for cash in the 
        amount of--in the range of a hundred dollars or in the 
        range of between fifty and a hundred dollars?

           I'm asking in total.

        A. LIn total from the time I've known Tom to present, 
        most of it was before he was a Federal judge. But I 
        would imagine that the total would be close--and I keep 
        going through adding it up in my mind--$2,000, give or 
        take.\160\

    \160\Gardner Dep. at 32-33 (Ex. 36).

Gardner also recalled paying for some home improvements 
(hanging fans, paying a sheet rock installer), paying to have 
Judge Porteous's car towed when it broke down, as well as 
buying Judge Porteous an expensive fountain pen.\161\

(Ex. 32).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As he did with Creely, Judge Porteous assigned Gardner 
curatorships. Gardner denied that Judge Porteous asked for cash 
back from these appointments.\162\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \162\Gardner 5th Cir. Hrg. at 464 (Ex. 32). There might have been 
as many as one per month on the average. Gardner Dep. at 24-25 (Ex. 
36). Gardner testified he received 50 curatorships from Judge Porteous, 
if not more. This would have meant approximately $10,000 in fees. (The 
curatorship reimbursement rates at the applicable time period were $150 
and $200.) Even if Judge Porteous did not have the same understanding 
with Gardner as he did with Creely regarding the curatorships, it is 
significant that Judge Porteous assigned the curatorships to an 
individual who in turn was spending money on him on a regular basis. It 
is reasonable to conclude that Judge Porteous knew and intended that by 
assigning Gardner curatorships, he was generating cash for Gardner that 
Gardner could, in turn, use for Judge Porteous's benefit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Porteous called Gardner as a witness on his behalf at 
the Fifth Circuit Hearing. In response to questioning from 
Judge Porteous at that Hearing, Gardner testified as follows:

        When we were practicing lawyers, we were Christmas 
        shopping for the wives; and I believe that you had 
        bought a gift and you were short. And you asked me if I 
        had some money on me. You wanted to buy some glasses--
        glasses, and I think I gave you some money then.
          At various times, you'd asked me for this or that 
        when we were out either eating or drinking and I'd 
        advance it to you or give it to you. I did so as a 
        friend.\163\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \163\Gardner 5th Cir. Hrg. at 461 (Ex. 32). Judge Porteous asked 
for and accepted money from Gardner to buy a Christmas present for his 
wife:

      We [Judge Porteous and Gardner] were shopping one Christmas 
      and he wanted to buy Mel [Judge Porteous's wife Carmella]--
      we would go out for Christmas and try to find a gift for 
      our wives, and he wanted toasting glasses. He was short and 
      he asked me, he says, ``Don, can I borrow $200 for toasting 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      glasses?''

      They were in the 160, 180 range. And I had it on me because 
      I had Christmas money and loaned it to him.

Notwithstanding Gardner's use of the word ``loan,'' Judge Porteous 
never repaid him. Gardner Dep. at 34-35 (Ex. 36).

    At the Fifth Circuit Hearing, Judge Porteous admitted 
receiving cash from Gardner prior to his becoming a Federal 
judge.

        Q. LNow, other than Messrs. Amato and Creely, who else 
        had--what other lawyers--lawyer friends of yours have 
        given you money over the years?

        A. LGiven me money?

        Q. LMoney, cash.

        A. LGardner may have. Probably did.

                              *    *    *

        Q. LAnd when is the last time Mr. Gardner gave you 
        money?

        A. LBefore I took the Federal bench, I'm sure.

        Q. LOkay. And do you recall how much?

        A. LAbsolutely not.\164\

  F. Creely's Statements as Part of Judge Porteous's Background Check

    In August 1994, Creely was interviewed by the FBI as part 
of Judge Porteous's background check. The FBI write-up of the 
interview reports:

          CREELY has never known the candidate to use illegal 
        drugs or to abuse alcohol or prescription drugs. . . . 
        CREELY advised that he knows of no financial problems 
        on the part of the candidate and the candidate appears 
        to live within his economic means.\165\

    In his August 28, 2009 Task Force deposition, Creely was 
questioned about his statements concerning Judge Porteous's 
drinking habits and financial circumstances. Although Creely 
stated that Judge Porteous ``drank excessively,'' and that ``he 
did, in my opinion, drink a lot,'' he also stated that Judge 
Porteous ``was a very intelligent man'' and that ``[h]is 
drinking in no way impaired his ability as a judge.''\166\ In 
his Task Force Hearing testimony, Creely acknowledged having 
seen Judge Porteous in circumstances in which Judge Porteous 
had obviously abused alcohol.\167\

    As to Judge Porteous's financial circumstances, Creely 
testified both at the Task Force Hearing and during his 
deposition that his statements to the FBI were not truthful. In 
his deposition, Creely testified:

        Q. L[I]f the FBI's write-up of its interview with you 
        indicated that you, and I'm quoting, ``advised that 
        [you] knew of no financial problems on the part of the 
        candidate and the candidate appears to live within his 
        economic means,'' do you have any reason to doubt that 
        you said that?

        A. LNo sir.

        Q. LAnd that wouldn't have been true, would it? That 
        would not have been true, because, in fact, you did 
        know that he had financial problems, correct?

        A. LYes.\168\

    \168\Creely Dep. at 13 (Ex. 16).

Judge Porteous in ``very high esteem,'' had a lot of affection 
for him, and would not have wanted to do anything to harm his 
candidacy for the Federal judgeship.''\169\ Before the Task 
Force, Creely testified: ``I didn't want to do anything to 
impede his [Judge Porteous's] advancement. He was a friend. He 
was a very manipulative friend. And I didn't want to--I didn't 
want to hurt the guy.\170\

                      G. The Liljeberg Proceedings

    On January 16, 1996, as a Federal judge, Judge Porteous was 
assigned a complicated civil action, Lifemark Hospitals of La., 
Inc. [``Lifemark''] v. Liljeberg Enterprises, Inc. 
[``Liljeberg'' or ``the Liljebergs''].\171\ This case involved 
a dispute between a hospital and a pharmacy, and implicated 
bankruptcy law, real estate law, and contract law. The case was 
filed in 1993, and had been assigned to other judges before 
being transferred to Judge Porteous in January 1996. The matter 
was particularly contentious, with millions of dollars at 
stake.

(Ex. 50).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. September-October 1996--Amato and Levenson Are Hired by the 
        Liljebergs; Lifemark files a Motion to Recuse Judge Porteous
    The Liljeberg case was set for a non-jury trial before 
Judge Porteous beginning on November 4, 1996. On September 19, 
1996, approximately 6 weeks prior to the scheduled trial date, 
the Liljebergs filed a motion to enter the appearances of Amato 
and Levenson as their attorneys.\172\ As Amato described it: 
``I was approached by a lawyer by the name of Ken Fonte who 
represented the Liljebergs and asked if I would be interested 
in the case. And I told him `I'm always interested in 
litigation and I would take a look at the case.'''\173\ 
According to Amato, the Liljebergs ``were looking for people 
[attorneys] who were, you know, not only competent, but had 
some rapport with the court.''\174\ Amato and Levenson were 
hired on a contingent fee basis, that is, they would not 
receive anything unless the Liljebergs prevailed.\175\ Amato 
estimated that if the Liljebergs prevailed at trial, his fee 
would have been between $500,000 and $1,000,000.\176\ The 
motion to enter Amato's appearance clearly identified him with 
the firm ``Amato and Creely.''\177\ Amato described the case as 
``exceptionally important'' to him.\178\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \172\The Motion by the Liljebergs to enter the appearance of 
attorneys Amato and Levenson was dated September 16, 1996 (Ex. 51(a)).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The decision of the Liljebergs to add Amato and Levenson so 
close to the trial date aroused the concerns of Lifemark's 
lawyer, Joseph Mole, who spoke to other attorneys who knew 
Judge Porteous, Amato and Levenson:

        I learned that--from people who would talk to me . . . 
        --that Mr. Levenson and Mr. Amato were very close to 
        Judge Porteous, that Mr. Amato had been his law 
        partner, as had Mr. Creely--Amato and Creely was the 
        firm--and Mr. Levenson was very close to Judge Porteous 
        and had--I think had been to a fifth circuit conference 
        or two as Judge Porteous's guest, that they frequently 
        socialized in--in the way of lunches, hunting trips, 
        and things like that, and that they--I also knew--well, 
        I formed the opinion that there was--there was a high 
        likelihood that the case--it was a bench trial. There 
        was no jury. So it would be entirely a decision by the 
        judge in a case that had been valued as high as $200 
        million for my client that the case would be handled in 
        the way by the judge that would be favorable to his 
        friends, and that was of deep concern.\179\

    \179\Mole TF Hrg. I at 141. See also Mole 5th Cir. Hrg. at 168 (Ex. 
65); Mole GJ at 9-10 (Ex. 64).

    On October 1, 1996, Mole, on behalf of his client Lifemark, 
filed a motion to recuse Judge Porteous. The motion focused on 
the appearance of impropriety suggested by the fact that just 
weeks prior to trial, the Liljebergs retained two lawyers who 
were close friends with Judge Porteous, neither having 
particular expertise in complicated business litigation.\180\

Liljeberg Enterprises, Inc., Civ. Action No. 93-1794 (E.D. La.) (Oct. 
1, 1996) (Ex. 52).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Lifemark's recusal motion did not allege an actual conflict 
of interest or that Amato (or his partner Creely) had given 
money to Judge Porteous because Lifemark's counsel (Mole) had 
no idea what, if anything, Amato (or Creely) had ever given to 
Judge Porteous.\181\ If he had known of prior cash dealings 
between Judge Porteous and Amato, he would have used that fact 
in his motion,\182\ and he believed that if a prior financial 
relationship existed recusal would have been mandatory.\183\ 
Further, Mole believed recusal would have been required even if 
the relationship were between Judge Porteous and Creely, and 
not Judge Porteous and Amato, because Creely and Amato were 
partners and it was the firm Amato & Creely that had entered 
its appearance for Lifemark--not just Amato.\184\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Because he was unaware of a prior financial relationship, 
as Mole himself described: ``[I] danced around that issue [of a 
financial relationship] pretty carefully because I didn't want 
to accuse the judge that was going to try my case of doing 
something of which I had no evidence.''\185\ Thus, Mole argued 
``that the judge shouldn't be handling a case where two of his 
closest friends, if not his very closest friends, had just 
signed up 6 weeks before trial, whose facts had been in 
litigation since 1987 in one court or another, and that I 
didn't believe they had anything to add, other than their 
relationship with the judge, and that if the result came out in 
a certain way, it would create an appearance that things had 
not been right.''\186\

    As to the appearance of impropriety, the recusal motion 
stated:

          Your Honor's relationship with Messrs. Amato and 
        Levenson is well known to the legal community. It needs 
        no elaboration in this memorandum. This would be of no 
        concern were it not for the timing of their addition, 
        and the fact that the [Liljebergs] clearly believe that 
        influence with governmental bodies, including judges, 
        can be bought.

                              *    *    *

        Under the circumstances, it is respectfully submitted 
        that Your Honor is duty bound to remove any appearance 
        of impropriety. In spite of Your Honor's attempts to be 
        fair, the obviousness of the Liljebergs' intentions, 
        coupled with the timing of the hiring of these lawyers, 
        will always leave questions in the eyes of any 
        objective observer, the ``man in the street,'' who is 
        aware of the Court's relationship with Messrs. Amato 
        and Levenson and the Liljebergs' attitudes toward the 
        political and judicial systems. [citation omitted.] 
        Under such circumstances, Lifemark suggests that Your 
        Honor, the Federal courts, and the litigants in this 
        case (including the Liljebergs) are all best served by 
        Your Honor's recusal.\187\

15, 1996) (hereinafter ``Liljeberg's Opposition to Lifemark's Reply'') 
(Ex. 55).

          In its original supporting memorandum, Lifemark uses 
        terms such as ``close,'' ``extremely close'' and 
        ``closest'' to characterize the relationship between 
        the Court and Messrs. Amato and Levenson. . . . 
        However, such vague superlatives provide absolutely no 
        information upon which an objective, thoughtful and 
        well-informed person could reasonably rely in 
        determining whether grounds exist to question the 
        Court's impartiality.

                              *    *    *

          Lifemark presents no evidence that a reasonable 
        person would attribute to the mere existence of a 
        friendly relationship a significant likelihood that a 
        judge would violate Federal law and subordinate his 
        oath of office just to help a lawyer earn a fee.\192\

Judge Porteous, of course, knew that his respective 
relationships with Amato and Creely went well beyond the ``mere 
existence of a friendly relationship.''
2. Judge Porteous's Statements at the Recusal Hearing
    On October 16, 1996, Judge Porteous held a hearing on the 
recusal motion. Both Levenson and Amato were present. In that 
hearing, the following colloquy occurred:

        The Court:
                    LLet me make also one other statement for 
        the record if anyone wants to decide whether I am a 
        friend with Mr. Amato and Mr. Levenson--I will put that 
        to rest for the answer is affirmative, yes. Mr. Amato 
        and I practiced the law together probably 20-plus years 
        ago. Is that sufficient? . . . So if that is an issue 
        at all, it is a non-issue.\193\

        The Court:
                    L[T]his is the first time a motion for my 
        recusal has ever been filed. . . . I guess it got my 
        attention. But does that mean that any time a person I 
        perceive to be friends who I have dinner with or 
        whatever that I must disqualify myself? I don't think 
        that's what the rule suggests. . . . Courts have held 
        that a judge need not disqualify himself just because a 
        friend, even a close friend, appears as a lawyer.\196\

                              *    *    *

        The Court:
                    LWell you know the issue becomes one of, I 
        guess the confidence of the parties, not the attorneys. 
        . . . My concern is not with whether or not lawyers are 
        friends. . . . My concern is that the parties are given 
        a day in court which they can through you present their 
        case, and they can be adjudicated thoroughly without 
        bias, favor, prejudice, public opinion, sympathy, 
        anything else, just on law and facts. . . .
                    L  I have always taken the position that if 
        there was ever any question in my mind that this Court 
        should recuse itself that I would notify counsel and 
        give them the opportunity if they wanted to ask me to 
        get off. . . .
                    L[In the Bernard case] the court said 
        Section 450 requires not only that a Judge be 
        subjectively confident of his ability to be even handed 
        but [that an] informed, rational objective observer 
        would not doubt his impartiality. . . . I don't have 
        any difficulty trying this case. . . .
                    L[I]n my mind I am satisfied because if I 
        had any question as to my ability, I would have called 
        and said, ``Look, you're right.''\197\

    Judge Porteous denied the recusal motion after the argument 
in open court on October 16, 1996. The complete written opinion 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
signed the following day states:

        On Wednesday, October 16, 1996, the court heard oral 
        argument on Lifemark Hospitals, Inc.,'s Motion to 
        Recuse. The Court, having reviewed the motion to 
        recuse, the opposition, the reply, and the response to 
        the reply and having heard oral argument, for reasons 
        stated in open court denies the Motion to Recuse.\198\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Discussion of the Recusal Hearing
    The attorneys--Levenson and Amato--made no factual 
disclosures. Amato, who was present in the courtroom during the 
recusal hearing, viewed the issue of disclosure and recusal to 
be Judge Porteous's issue--not Amato's. He thus took his lead 
as to disclosure from Judge Porteous, and was not going to 
embarrass the judge by stating that in the past he and his 
partner had given Judge Porteous tens of thousands of dollars 
funded by curatorships assigned by Judge Porteous. As Amato 
testified at his Task Force deposition:

        Q. LOkay. Now, in connection with that motion to recuse 
        Judge Porteous, would it be fair to say that you 
        considered it really Judge Porteous'[s] decision as to 
        whether or not he should be recused?

        A. LOh, absolutely.

        Q. LAnd would it be fair to say that you followed his 
        lead in terms of disclosures which could be made or 
        should be made relative to your relationship with Judge 
        Porteous?

        A. LYes. That Porteous--that was Porteous'[s] 
        obligation.

                              *    *    *

        Q. L. . . Was the fact that you all had given back to 
        Judge Porteous money from the curators disclosed in the 
        course of the Liljeberg litigation?

        A. LNo, it was not disclosed.

        Q. LAnd if that, if that was a fact that could have or 
        should have been disclosed, that was really in your 
        mind something that Judge Porteous would have to do?

        A. LYes.\200\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \200\Amato Dep. at 8-10 (Ex. 24).

Amato, in the Task Force Hearing, before the Fifth Circuit, and 
in the grand jury, has acknowledged the materiality of this 
prior relationship to Judge Porteous's handling of the recusal 
motion.\201\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \201\See also Amato TF Hrg. I at 103; Amato 5th Cir. Hrg. at 248 
(Ex. 20); Amato GJ at 57 (Ex. 18).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    With Amato and Levenson remaining silent in the courtroom, 
the only factual disclosures about the relationships were made 
by Judge Porteous, and these were limited to the facts that he 
was ``a friend with Mr. Amato and Mr. Levenson,'' had been a 
former law partner with Amato, had ``gone along to lunch with 
them'' but had not ``been to either one of them's house,'' and 
that the first time he ran for judge was ``the only time when 
they gave me money.''
    Judge Porteous did not mention that Amato, through his firm 
Amato & Creely, had given him thousands of dollars in cash, 
including monies funded through the assignment of curatorships 
to Creely. And, as discussed, Judge Porteous would have known, 
and in fact subsequently acknowledged, that the funds paid by 
Creely under that arrangement came from Amato as well. Judge 
Porteous did not address Mole's specific statement that he 
[Mole] had heard Judge Porteous had traveled with the 
attorneys, and thus, did not disclose, for example, that he had 
gone to Las Vegas with Levenson (and shared a room with him) 
and had gone hunting and fishing with Amato and Creely on 
several occasions. Judge Porteous also failed to disclose that 
Amato and Creely paid for his party to celebrate his 
appointment to the Federal bench.\202\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \202\There is also some evidence that Judge Porteous's secretary, 
Rhonda Danos, had solicited Amato, Creely and Levenson to help pay for 
his son's expenses when Judge Porteous was a State judge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Porteous's statement denying that he had ever been to 
either one of their houses suggests a relationship that is 
totally at odds with the truth of their respective 
associations. He trivialized Mole's motion by comparing it to 
the following: ``But does that mean that any time a person I 
perceive to be friends who I have dinner with or whatever that 
I must disqualify myself? I don't think that's what the rule 
suggests. . . .'' And, by suggesting merely that he had 
``dinner with'' or ``gone along to lunch with'' the two men, 
with no elaboration, he affirmatively concealed what was really 
the truth: that Amato and Levenson had paid for hundreds of his 
lunches and dinners at expensive restaurants for a decade or 
longer. Judge Porteous affirmatively attempted to divert the 
hearing from the true issues raised in the recusal motion by 
spending considerable attention on the issue of whether the 
attorneys had given him campaign contributions--denying that 
fact--and criticizing Lifemark's attorney for raising the 
issue.\203\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \203\Recusal Hearing Transcript at 8-10 (Ex. 56).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finally, Judge Porteous made several ``lulling'' 
statements--stressing his awareness of and sensitivity to his 
ethical concerns associated with recusal issues, and suggesting 
his comfort with the issue having been raised. The most 
significant instance of this conduct was Judge Porteous's 
statement:

        I have always taken the position that if there was ever 
        any question in my mind that this Court should recuse 
        itself that I would notify counsel and give them the 
        opportunity if they wanted to ask me to get off.\204\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \204\Recusal Hearing Transcript at 18 (Ex. 56).

This self-serving statement purported to demonstrate the 
Judge's sensitivity to his ethical responsibilities and thus 
bolstered the factual and legal record for appellate review.
4. March 1997--Lifemark Hires Gardner
    Lifemark, having lost the recusal motion, felt that it was 
necessary to ``level the playing field,'' and thus hired Don 
Gardner to be part of its trial team.\205\ Lifemark's pleading 
to the court entering the appearance of Gardner was date-
stamped March 11, 1997.\206\ As Mole described:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \206\Ex Parte Motion of Lifemark to Enroll Additional Counsel of 
Record (Don Gardner), Lifemark Hospitals of La., Inc., v. Liljeberg 
Enterprises, Inc., Civ. Action No. 93-1794 (E.D. La., Mar. 11, 1997) 
(Ex. 60(a)).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Q. LWhy was Gardner then brought in by Lifemark?

        A. LAfter we lost the motion to recuse, my client and I 
        discussed that--and my client insisted that we try to 
        find a lawyer who, like Mr. Amato and Mr. Levenson, was 
        a friend with the judge and knew him very well. They 
        were concerned that they would do everything they can 
        to achieve a level playing field. I resisted doing 
        that. I am not happy with the fact that we did it. But 
        my client insisted, and so we did it.\207\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \207\Mole TF Hrg. I at 143; Mole 5th Cir. Hrg. at 174-75 (Ex. 65).

Even Gardner recognized: ``[T]hey [Lifemark] wanted to have a 
friendly face.''\208\ Lifemark's contract with Gardner provided 
that Gardner would be paid based on the results of the case, 
that he would be guaranteed $100,000 simply for entering his 
appearance, and that he would receive another $100,000 if Judge 
Porteous withdrew or if the case settled.\209\ As Mole bluntly 
testified at the Fifth Circuit Hearing:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \208\Gardner 5th Cir. Hrg. at 462 (Ex. 32).
    \209\Mole 5th Cir. Hrg. at 177-80 (Ex. 65); Mole GJ at 21-22 (Ex. 
64).

        Q. LSo is it fair to say this term [the $100,000 
        guaranteed payment] also shows that the purpose that 
        Don Gardner came in the litigation was because of his 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        relationship with Judge Porteous?

        A. LYeah. Embarrassing but true.\210\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \210\Mole GJ at 28 (Ex. 64).

5. June and July 1997--Trial
    Judge Porteous conducted a bench trial in the Liljeberg 
case in June and July 1997.\211\ Amato handled a substantial 
portion of the trial for the Liljebergs.\212\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \211\The Court's ``PACER'' Docket Report reveals that the trial 
took place from June 16, 1997 through June 27, 1997, then started again 
on July 14, 1997 and concluded July 23, 1997. (Ex. 50).
    \212\Amato GJ at 48 (Ex.18).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One incident during the trial is noteworthy. Judge Porteous 
played an active role in examining some of Lifemark's 
witnesses, and at one point in the proceedings near the end of 
the day, Lifemark's attorney, Mole, sought permission to ask 
additional questions of the witness after Judge Porteous's 
examination. Judge Porteous lost his temper at Mole, and though 
the descriptions of the event vary, Judge Porteous ended up 
knocking or throwing some of the evidence binders that were in 
front of him in the direction of Mole. When the parties 
returned to court the following trial day, which was after an 
intervening weekend, Judge Porteous stated for the record his 
position, and then permitted Mole to ask additional 
questions.\213\

(Excerpts of Non-Jury Trial, July 17, 1997 and July 21, 1997) (Ex. 61).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At the conclusion of the trial in July 1997, Judge Porteous 
took the case under advisement. He did not issue his opinion 
until April 26, 2000, nearly 3 years after trial.

  H. Judge Porteous's Declining Financial Circumstances--1996 Through 
                                  2000

    Judge Porteous's financial circumstances in the years 
preceding his filing for bankruptcy in 2001 are discussed in 
the next section. However, in order to understand Judge 
Porteous's behavior in accepting and soliciting things of value 
from attorneys during the pendency of the Liljeberg case (and 
to appreciate his dependency on attorneys and others to support 
his lifestyle), it is useful to note the decline of Judge 
Porteous's financial situation during the period 1996-2000.
    At the end of 1996, a few months after the October 1996 
recusal hearing, Judge Porteous had credit card debt of 
approximately $45,000, and a balance in his individual 
retirement account (IRA) of $59,000. Over the next 4 years, he 
gradually drew down his IRA account, frequently to pay off his 
credit cards. By April 2000, he had credit card debt of 
$153,000, and an IRA balance of $12,000.
    By the time he rendered his decision in the Liljeberg case 
in April 2000, Judge Porteous was just weeks away from 
consulting with a bankruptcy attorney.\214\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \214\As described in the Bankruptcy Section of this Report, Judge 
Porteous's debts were largely a result of gambling.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I. Judge Porteous's Relationships with Amato, Levenson, and Gardner 
While He Had the Liljeberg Case under Advisement (July 1997-April 2000)

    During the period from July 1997 through the issuance of 
his verdict for the Liljebergs in April 2000, with millions of 
dollars for the parties and substantial fees for the attorneys 
at stake, Judge Porteous continued to seek and accept things of 
value from Amato, Creely, Levenson and, to a lesser extent, 
Gardner.
1. Meals
    Amato continued to take Judge Porteous to lunches after the 
Liljeberg trial and prior to Porteous's ruling in that case. As 
Amato testified in his Task Force appearance:

        Q. LAfter the trial, did you continue to take Judge 
        Porteous to lunch on a regular basis?

        A. LJudge Porteous and I have been eating lunch 
        together for--since we have known each other, yes.

        Q. LOkay. And some of them . . . involved you eating 
        well at Ruth's Chris Steak House, the Beef Connection, 
        Andrea's, Emeril's, and so forth, correct?

        A. LYes, we had a nice--we had a good time.

                              *    *    *

        Q. LSo I am talking about roughly summer of 1997 to 
        April 2000, and that is the period that you have just 
        testified that, as part of your whole life, you took 
        him to restaurants that we have just mentioned, 
        correct?

        A. LRight.\215\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \215\Amato TF Hrg. I at 103-04. See also Amato Dep. at 17-18 (Ex. 
24) (paying for Judge Porteous's meals at restaurants such as Beef 
Connection, Ruth's Chris Steak House, and Dickie Brennan's while 
Liljeberg case was pending).

    The Department subpoenaed Amato's calendar and 
corresponding credit card records reflecting meals he bought 
for Judge Porteous starting in 1999. From 1999 to April 2000 
(during which the Liljeberg case was pending), the following 
chart reflects some of the meals attended by Judge Porteous and 
paid for by Amato.\216\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \216\Exs. 21(b)-(c). By virtue of the limited records, the chart 
does not include all instances where there is a calendar entry 
mentioning Judge Porteous but no corresponding credit card charge, and 
also does not include meals for which there is no entry on Amato's 
calendar.


    Gardner also testified that he took Judge Porteous to meals 
while the Liljeberg case was pending. Specifically, Gardner 
testified he took Judge Porteous to the following restaurants 
when Judge Porteous was a Federal judge: Ruth's Chris Steak 
House (``more than six [times].''\217\); Mr. B's (``four or 
five times a year''\218\); Emeril's (``on occasions''\219\); 
Brennan's/Dickie Brennan's (``I've been to Dickie Brennan's I 
guess with Tom Porteous three or four times during that period 
of time''\220\); NOLA's (``[t]hree or four times''\221\), and 
Metro Bistro (``a little more frequent [than NOLA's]''\222\). 
For each of these restaurants, there are charges on Gardner's 
American Express account from approximately 1994 through 2000, 
including charges during the roughly 3 year period spanning 
Gardner's appearance as an attorney in the Liljeberg case 
(early 1997) to the issuance of Judge Porteous's decision 
(April 2000).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Though Gardner could not identify specific meals during 
this time frame as being ones where he paid for Judge Porteous, 
the charges on Gardner's American Express card identify the 
likely meals, and provide a sense of what the meals would have 
cost. For example, Gardner testified he took Judge Porteous to 
NOLA's, Dickie Brennan's or Brennan's ``three or four times.'' 
Charges on Gardner's credit card between 1997 and 1999 (when 
Liljeberg was pending and when Gardner represented Lifemark) at 
those restaurants were as shown in the following chart:


    From August 1994 through February 2000, Gardner had over 30 
charges at Ruth's Chris Steak House, 16 charges at Emeril's, 
over 30 charges at Mr. B's, and 23 at the Metro Bistro--
consistent with his testimony as to other places he frequently 
took Judge Porteous.
2. May 1999--Creely Helps Pay for Bachelor Party Trip to Las Vegas
    In connection with his son Timothy's bachelor party, Judge 
Porteous went on a trip from May 20-23, 1999 (while Liljeberg 
was pending) with several of his friends, including Creely and 
Gardner, to Las Vegas, Nevada. Creely paid for Judge Porteous's 
room and for a portion of Timothy's bachelor party dinner 
during that trip.\223\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \223\Creely GJ at 39-40 (Ex. 11).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As to Judge Porteous's room, Caesars Palace records reflect 
that Judge Porteous's room was charged to Creely's credit card 
number.\224\ Judge Porteous also seemed to recall that Creely 
paid for his room.\225\

Record for May 1999 (Ex. 378).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As to the bachelor party meal at a steakhouse, Creely 
testified:

        [A]nd in these charges [on my credit card], all right, 
        is a meal for the bachelor party meal, OK, that we went 
        out on, and the way all that--$560.48. And the way I 
        recall what happened, there's no way that all these 
        people could eat for $500 at a steak house, drinking 
        and eating. The way I recall, is that there were a 
        number of people that, after the meal and the bill came 
        out, that put up the credit card to pay for the meal. . 
        . . There were a number of credit cards put up to have 
        the tip and the bill divided among everybody.\226\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \226\Creely GJ at 40 (Ex. 11).

Creely recalled that Judge Porteous did not share the cost of 
this meal.\227\ Creely's American Express records also revealed 
a charge of $560.48 at the steakhouse.\228\

3. June 1999--Judge Porteous Solicits and Accepts Money from Amato
    On June 28, 1999--after his son's wedding and prior to 
issuing his decision in Liljeberg--Judge Porteous solicited 
money from Amato. This request was made while the two men were 
on a fishing trip. Amato identified the date of the fishing 
trip--June 28, 1999--by reference to an entry on his 
calendar.\231\ At the Task Force Hearing, Amato recalled the 
amount requested by Judge Porteous as being $2,500.\232\ Amato 
described the incident as follows:

    \232\Amato Dep. at 13 (Ex. 24).

        It was a weekday, and a friend of mine has a fairly 
        large boat, and we were going to Caminada Pass, which 
        is the pass at Grand Isle, and at certain times of the 
        year, the fish run between the Gulf of Mexico and the 
        marsh. And the fish just at night, they bubble up. They 
        come to the surface, and it is a free-for-all. So we 
        went fishing that night. Judge Porteous was drinking. 
        We were standing on the front of the boat, the two of 
        us, and he was--I don't know how to put it. He was 
        really upset. He was--had a few drinks. He said, ``My 
        son's wedding was more than I anticipated. The girl's 
        family can't afford it. I invited too many guests.'' 
        Would I lend him, give him, provide him, however you 
        want to call it, something, like $2,500, to pay for 
        part of the wedding or the after-rehearsal party or 
        something?\233\

him and I were standing on the bow of the boat and he told me that his 
son's wedding cost more than the bride's family anticipated because he 
invited too many guests and could I lend him some money.'').

Notwithstanding Amato's use of the term ``lend'' in describing 
Judge Porteous's request of him, Amato was clear: ``I didn't 
believe I was gonna be paid back.''\234\ Amato testified he 
gave Judge Porteous cash.\235\ Amato described this incident 
consistently at the Fifth Circuit Hearing,\236\ and further 
testified that he recalled providing the cash to Judge Porteous

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Creely recalled and corroborated critical aspects of that 
incident as well. Specifically, Creely was asked whether Judge 
Porteous requested money when he was a Federal judge:

        [I] know one occasion that I remember. And it was an 
        occasion and it was May 1999. I have it written on my 
        calendar. And it has at the bottom of the page 
        ``Fishing Mitch Martin.'' And Mitch Martin is a friend 
        of ours that had a boat. . . . I didn't go on this 
        trip.

        [B]ut after this trip that--this one trip--I do recall 
        my law partner [Amato] went fishing with him--I didn't 
        go on this fishing trip--he [Amato] came back and said, 
        ``The judge was crying about not being able to pay for 
        a wedding of some sort for his daughter. I don't know 
        what it was. But I think it had something to do with a 
        wedding or something. And he said, [``]He's crying.'' 
        And he said, ``What do I do[?''] I said, ``I don't know 
        what to tell you to do. It ain't even me.'' And I 
        believe he gave him the money and I gave my law partner 
        back half of the money or--I don't know how that 
        happened. But I do know he asked for that money and it 
        was given to him.\238\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \238\Creely GJ at 59-60 (Ex. 11). Notwithstanding minor 
discrepancies (the fishing trip was June 1999, not May; the wedding was 
for Judge Porteous's son, not daughter), Creely's testimony was 
consistent with Amato's.

Creely recalled ``that I gave my law partner a thousand 
dollars, which means he gave him [Judge Porteous] 
$2,000,''\239\ and that Judge Porteous's secretary, Rhonda 
Danos, picked up an envelope with the cash.\240\ Creely also 
testified he told Judge Porteous it was not appropriate for him 
to be sending his secretary to pick up the money.\241\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \239\Creely GJ at 61 (Ex. 11). At the Fifth Circuit Hearing, Creely 
testified that he recalled the request being a tuition expense, but 
confirmed that he recalled the amount as $2,000. Creely 5th Cir. Hrg. 
at 212-14 (Ex. 12).
    \240\Creely 5th Cir. Hrg. at 214 (Ex. 12).
    \241\Creely 5th Cir. Hrg. at 215 (Ex. 12). Amato was asked whether 
he recalled an incident where Judge Porteous's secretary picked up the 
money. He replied ``I don't recall that, but I don't say that it didn't 
happen. You know, it well may have happened.'' Amato 5th Cir. Hrg. at 
241 (Ex. 20).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Danos recalled picking up envelopes of money or having envelopes 
delivered from Creely and Amato. In response to questions from the 
attorneys, she identified that as having occurred in the May-June 1999 
time frame. Danos 5th Cir. Hrg. at 421-22 (Ex. 43).
    Judge Porteous, testifying in the Fifth Circuit hearing, 
denied recollection of the specific circumstances in which he 
made a request to Amato, but did not deny that the conversation 
occurred. He admitted that he actually received money from 
Amato for the purposes Amato described, and that the money was 
received in an envelope.

        Q. LDo you recall in 1999, in the summer, May, June, 
        receiving $2,000 for [sic: should be ``from''] them?

        A. LI've read Mr. Amato's grand jury testimony. It says 
        we were fishing and I made some representation that I 
        was having difficulties and that he loaned me some 
        money or gave me some money.

        Q. LYou don't--you're not denying it; you just don't 
        remember it?

        A. LI just don't have any recollection of it, but that 
        would have fallen in the category of a loan from a 
        friend. That's all.\242\

        A. LYeah. Something seems to suggest that there may

4. Payments for ``Externship'' for Judge Porteous's Son
    At some point in time--and the best evidence suggests that 
it occurred during the pendency of the Liljeberg case--Judge 
Porteous and his secretary, Rhonda Danos, solicited the four 
attorneys to contribute to an ``externship'' for Judge 
Porteous's son. As Danos testified: ``I pretty much knew who to 
call,'' identifying Levenson, Creely, and Amato among 
others.\244\ She testified that all the attorneys contributed, 
and indicated that as a general matter they gave $500.\245\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \244\Danos Dep. I at 21-22 (Ex. 46). Rhonda Danos was deposed 
twice, first on Aug. 25, 2009, referenced as ``Danos Dep. I (Ex. 46),'' 
and on December 3, 2009, referenced as ``Danos Dep. II (Ex. 47).''
    \245\Danos Dep. I at 22 (Ex. 46).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Amato recalled that ``I just remember that some sort of way 
that . . . Timmy or Tommy needed money to go to Washington, and 
they were passing the hat.''\246\ He testified he contributed a 
few hundred dollars.\247\

    \247\Amato TF Hrg. I at 104 (``I recall that . . . one of his 
children were coming to Washington to extern, I think, for Senator 
Breaux, and they were looking for contributions to defray the cost.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Levenson testified that Danos solicited him for funds for 
Judge Porteous's son: ``[I] recall Rhonda [Danos] saying that 
they were trying to have some friends help him with--I don't 
know if it was travel expenses or living expenses of something 
so that he could go to Washington'' and that Levenson gave 
Rhonda ``a couple hundred dollars.''\248\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \248\Levenson GJ at 64-65, 66 (Ex. 25).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Gardner recalled being asked by Judge Porteous himself. He 
testified: ``[T]o the best of my recollection . . . he [Judge 
Porteous] says that Tommy or one of his sons, and I think it's 
Tommy, had the opportunity to extern and whatever. It was a 
golden opportunity, but that there were some expenses resulting 
as a result of it. And I think at that point in time I may have 
volunteered to give him $200 to do that. . . . I don't know if 
I gave it to Tommy or gave it to his secretary or 
whatever.''\249\ Gardner placed the externship as occurring 
sometime in 1998, 1999 or 2000, that is, while the Liljeberg 
case was pending.\250\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \249\Gardner GJ at 74 (Ex. 33); Gardner 5th Cir. Hrg. at 468 (Ex. 
32); Gardner Dep. at 26-27 (Ex. 36).
    \250\Gardner 5th Cir. Hrg. at 471 (Ex. 32); Gardner Dep. at 26 (Ex. 
33). The dates of the payments, and the son (or sons) for whom the 
payments were made, is not entirely clear from the record, though 
Amato, Gardner and Danos all recall these requests being made.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Danos generally recalled there were two externships. She was ``pretty 
sure one of them was when [Judge Porteous] was, was [a] State [judge]. 
The other may have been when we were in Federal court.'' Danos Dep. I 
at 21 (Ex. 46). However, whether these requests and payments were made 
prior to the Liljeberg proceeding or while the decision was pending 
(or, as appears likely, whether there were two externships, one in each 
time-frame), it was never disclosed to Lifemark that Judge Porteous 
(through Danos) had ever requested, and that Amato and Levenson had 
paid, monies to help support Judge Porteous's son or sons.
5. Five Year Anniversary Party--Fall 1999
    Amato and Creely also paid for a party for Judge Porteous 
to celebrate his fifth year on the Federal bench, at the French 
Quarter Restaurant and Bar, to which his former clerks and 
other attorneys were invited.\251\ This would have been in late 
1999, during the pendency of the Liljeberg case.\252\ Danos and 
Judge Porteous's courtroom deputy clerk, Ricky Windhorst, 
recalled this party as well.\253\ Amato estimated the amount of 
the party as approximately $1,500.\254\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \251\Amato TF Hrg. I at 105.
    \252\The date is not noted on Amato's calendar.
    \253\Danos Dep. I at 35-37 (Ex. 46).
    \254\Amato Dep. at 14-15 (Ex. 24). In his deposition he estimated 
$1,500. At the Task Force Hearing Amato estimated $1,700. TF Hrg. I at 
119.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Continued Association and Travel with Levenson while Liljeberg was 
        Pending
    During the 1996-2000 time frame, Judge Porteous maintained 
a close relationship with Levenson, characterized by the two 
men traveling together on several occasions. On some of those 
occasions, Levenson purchased meals and drinks for Judge 
Porteous.
    Meals and Drinks at the Jefferson Bar Association Events in 
Biloxi, Mississippi. Levenson has stated he paid for meals and 
drinks for Judge Porteous and others at the annual Jefferson 
Bar Association events held in April of the various years, 
though he does not recall specific meals. His credit card 
records reflect a charge of $197.24 for food at the ``Isle of 
Capri'' restaurant in Biloxi on April 15, 1999, and a charge 
for $405.38 at that same restaurant on April 14, 2000. It is 
likely he paid for Judge Porteous at one or both of these 
meals.\255\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \255\Levenson Expense Records (Ex. 26). The ``Isle of Capri'' was 
the hotel where the restaurant was located. Levenson has stated that if 
Judge Porteous was present, it is likely that he (Levenson) would have 
taken Judge Porteous (among others) to that restaurant, and though he 
did not have a specific memory of each dinner, he had taken Judge 
Porteous to dinner at the Isle of Capri restaurant on at least one 
occasion. Levenson Dep. II at 9 (Ex. 31). Judge Porteous's credit card 
records reflect that he was in fact in Biloxi, Mississippi, at these 
Bar events in both 1999 and 2000. Though Judge Porteous's attendance at 
the 2000 dinner is not certain, that dinner would have been just a few 
weeks prior to Judge Porteous issuing his opinion in the Liljeberg 
case.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hunting Trips at Attorney Allen Usry's Mississippi Property 
1996-1998. From 1996 through 1998, there were one or two 
hunting trips that included Levenson, Judge Porteous, and other 
associates of Judge Porteous (including a neighbor and a now-
deceased bankruptcy judge). Allen Usry, an attorney who on 
occasion worked with Levenson, recalled that Levenson and Judge 
Porteous came to his property to hunt on two occasions during 
the period after fall of 1996 (that is, after Levenson entered 
his appearance in the Liljeberg case) through 1998. Usry 
recalled that ``probably both [hunting trips] . . . [b]ut at 
least one for sure'' occurred in this period.\256\ Levenson 
recalled one such trip.\257\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \256\Usry Dep. at 20 (Ex. 163).
    \257\Levenson Dep. at 8-10 (Ex. 30).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Trip to Washington D.C. for Mardi Gras--February 1999. In 
1999, Judge Porteous's daughter was made a ``Princess'' in 
connection with an event generally referred to as Mardi Gras in 
Washington D.C. This event consisted of meals, drinking, and 
other entertainment. Levenson traveled to Washington D.C. with 
Judge Porteous for this event. It appears that Judge Porteous 
paid his own airfare and hotel charges. Levenson stated he 
would not have paid for meals, because the meals were provided 
at that event, ``[b]ut I'm sure we probably had a round of 
drinks, several of us at the bar, that I would have paid 
for.''\258\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \258\Levenson Dep. at 23 (Ex. 30).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Trip to Houston for the Fifth Circuit Judicial Conference--
April 1999. In April 1999, Levenson went to Houston as Judge 
Porteous's invitee for the Fifth Circuit Judicial 
Conference.\259\ Levenson paid for meals and drinks for Judge 
Porteous, including a meal at a restaurant called ``Americas'' 
(for which there is a charge of $574.71 on his credit card) and 
other food or drinks at ``Delmonico's'' restaurant (for which 
there are charges amounting to over $200 on Levenson's credit 
card).\260\

    \259\Levenson Expense Records (Ex. 26).
    \260\Levenson Dep. II at 11-12 (Ex. 31). Levenson's Hotel Bill 
reflecting charges at ``Delmonico's,'' and his credit card statement 
reflecting a dinner at ``Americas'' are marked as part of Levenson Dep. 
II Ex. 91 (Ex. 291) (LEV 048, 043).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Las Vegas--October 1999. In October 1999, Levenson was in 
Las Vegas at the same time as Judge Porteous. ``I don't recall 
traveling with him. I do remember going to a national bull 
riding championship with him out there.''\261\ Levenson 
recalled paying for a dinner with Judge Porteous, and confirmed 
that the ``Aqua'' restaurant charge of $256 reflected in his 
hotel records corresponds to that meal.\262\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \261\Levenson Dep. at 19 (Ex. 30). Caesar's Palace records reveal 
that Judge Porteous was there from October 27-29, 1999. (Ex. 299).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hunting trip at the Blackhawk Hunting Facility--December 
1999. Usry was offended by the behavior of Judge Porteous and 
his friends during prior hunting trips at his property--
stemming from their drinking--and falsely told Judge Porteous 
he had sold his Mississippi property so he would not have to 
invite Judge Porteous back. In December 1999, Levenson and Usry 
planned to go with Judge Porteous and another friend of Usry's 
to the ``Blackhawk'' hunting facility in Louisiana. Usry 
recalled that he was going to pay for his friend and that 
Levenson would pay for Judge Porteous. Usry's calendar 
reflected that this trip was planned for December 7-10, 
1999.\263\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \263\Usry Dep at 14 (Ex. 163); Usry Dep. Ex. 86 (Ex. 286).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A few days prior to the trip, Usry's friend had a health 
emergency that made it impossible for him to go on the trip, so 
Usry cancelled as well, leaving Levenson and Judge Porteous to 
go alone.\264\ Levenson testified that either he, Usry, or some 
combination of the two of them ended up paying for Judge 
Porteous.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \264\Levenson Dep. at 10-13 (Ex. 30). Levenson confirmed that he 
went on this trip with Judge Porteous. Efforts have been made to 
establish whether Levenson paid for Judge Porteous and, if so, what 
amount. Judge Porteous's records do not reflect that he paid for the 
Blackhawk trip; but he had only a few months before asked Amato for 
money, and the evidence demonstrated that he hardly ever paid for his 
own hunting. The Levenson financial records that were obtained during 
the Department's investigation do not include his 1999 American Express 
records. Blackhawk no longer possessed the pertinent 1999 records.

        Q. LWhat do you recall about the payment for yourself 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        and Judge Porteous at this lodge?

        A. LI know I was supposed to make a payment. I don't 
        recall whether or not I made any payment, and I was 
        unable to find any records where I had made any 
        payments, but I was certainly supposed to pay for 
        myself and a portion of some of the other [persons] 
        which would have included Judge Porteous.\265\

case was decided, Levenson went to San Antonio, Texas, to 
accompany Judge Porteous to the annual Fifth Circuit Judicial 
Conference.\266\ Levenson confirmed he paid for two dinners for 
Judge Porteous, and his credit card reflects charges of $322.16 
at the ``Little Rhein Steakhouse'' (on May 7, 2000), and 
$201.33 at ``L'Etoile'' for food (on May 9, 2000).\267\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Conversations with Amato while the Liljeberg Case was Pending
    Amato testified that Porteous made occasional comments to 
him acknowledging that he [Judge Porteous] knew that Amato was 
waiting for the opinion to be issued. Amato interpreted Judge 
Porteous's comments as being favorable, and testified that he 
believed that Judge Porteous was going to rule for him.\268\

8. These Items of Value were not Disclosed to Lifemark
    Notwithstanding Judge Porteous's statement at the recusal 
hearing that: ``I have always taken the position that if there 
was ever any question in my mind that this Court should recuse 
itself that I would notify counsel and give them the 
opportunity if they wanted to ask me to get off. . . .'' he did 
not notify Mole of any of his post-recusal hearing (and post-
trial) contacts with Amato, Creely, or Levenson in order to 
give Mole the opportunity to move to recuse.
    Mole testified he was unaware that Judge Porteous requested 
money from Amato, and that Amato gave him money:

        Q. LWere you aware of any cash changing hands in `99 
        during the pendency of this suit?

        A. LNo. I would have been very alarmed to find out that 
        Jake was giving money to the judge during the case as 
        being under submission for decision by Judge 
        Porteous.\269\

number of occasions;'' that ``Mr. Amato and Mr. Levenson 
contributed money to Judge Porteous to help pay for some type 
of intern or externship for one of Judge Porteous's sons;'' 
``that Amato had paid about $1,500 for a party to celebrate 
Judge Porteous's fifth year on the bench;'' and that ``with 
regard to Mr. Levenson, . . . that he had, in fact, traveled to 
Washington with Judge Porteous at the end of January 1999, that 
he traveled to Houston with Judge Porteous in April 1999, that 
he was in Las Vegas with Judge Porteous in October 1999, and 
that Levenson and Judge Porteous went on hunting trips 
together, including a hunting trip to a hunting lodge in 
December 1999.'' As Mole testified: ``All of those things were 
the things I--sort of things I feared were happening or would 
happen, but had--I had no knowledge of.''\270\

Mole to elicit the fact that Gardner went on the Las Vegas 
bachelor party trip as well.

        Q. LAre you aware that, again, while this case was 
        under advisement, that your counsel Mr. Gardner 
        accompanied me and my family to Las Vegas for a 
        bachelor party?

        A. LNo, I did not know that.

        Q. LSo, he went--if I represent to you that he went, do 
        you find anything wrong with that?

        A. LYou know, I find something wrong with the whole 
        system that allows that to happen, Judge Porteous. So, 
        yeah, I do.

        went with Gardner?

 J. April 2000--Judge Porteous Rules for the Liljebergs; August 2002--
          Case Reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals

    On April 26, 2000, Judge Porteous issued a written opinion 
ruling for Amato's and Levenson's clients, the Liljebergs.
    In ruling for the Liljebergs, Judge Porteous concluded that 
Lifemark--a lender to the Liljebergs--had breached certain 
duties it purportedly owed to the Liljebergs in connection with 
a $44 million loan to construct a hospital. Lifemark's loan to 
the Liljebergs was secured by hospital property owned by the 
Liljebergs. In 1993, Lifemark had failed to take certain steps 
to secure its debt--it was required to ``reinscribe'' its lien 
in the appropriate land and title records for the lien to 
remain in effect and had failed to do so. As a result, another 
entity--Travelers--which had obtained an unrelated $7.8 million 
judgment against the Liljebergs, was able to file a lien on the 
property and place itself in the prime position ahead of 
Lifemark, which had by its inaction lost its security interest. 
Travelers, now in the prime position, executed its $7.8 million 
judgment on the property, forcing its sale in 1994. The 
property was sold for $26 million--approximately $7.8 million 
of which went to Travelers, and $18 million to Lifemark (now 
sitting in the second position).
    The Liljebergs alleged (and Judge Porteous found) that 
Lifemark's failure to ``reinscribe'' its lien breached a duty 
Lifemark purportedly owed to the Liljebergs, and that because 
of that breach, Travelers was able to move to the front of the 
line (ahead of Lifemark) and foreclose on the Liljebergs' 
property, in this way damaging the Liljebergs. Judge Porteous 
made this finding despite the fact that Travelers could have 
executed on the property even in second position behind 
Lifemark, and even though the Liljebergs could have 
``reinscribed'' the Lifemark lien themselves. In his April 2000 
opinion, Judge Porteous ordered that the 1994 judicial sale be 
``undone.''\272\ This was extraordinary relief that the 
Liljebergs had not even requested.\273\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \272\On this point, Gardner testified he and Judge Porteous had the 
following off the record conversation:

      At the end of that day's testimony when that was resolved, 
      Mr. Levenson and myself went back to talk about the next 
      day, and Judge Porteous commented about the thing. He says, 
      ``I'm really having some problems with Lifemark not 
      reinscribing their mortgage and allowing another creditor 
      to jump ahead of that.'' Because they allowed the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      foreclosure in effect by not reinscribing their mortgage.

      And I said to him, I said, ``Judge''--I may have said ``big 
      boy'' because I was friendly with him, but we were not in 
      court. And I said, ``I don't care who you are. No Federal 
      judge''--because I'm very familiar with State law in 
      foreclosures. I did a lot of them at [a prior law firm]. 
      ``You cannot overturn a State court foreclosure absent 
      fraud.'' And those people [the Liljebergs] put no evidence 
      whatsoever on about any fraud, because they [Lifemark] had 
      a right not to reinscribe their mortgage. They were 
      perfectly in their legal rights the way they went about it.

    Lifemark appealed Judge Porteous's decision to the Fifth 
Circuit. In August 2002, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in 
striking language, rejected Judge Porteous's conclusions that 
Lifemark's failure to preserve its own security interests gave 
the Liljebergs grounds for complaint. The Fifth Circuit 
characterized various aspects of Judge Porteous's ruling as 
``inexplicable,'' ``a chimera,'' ``constructed entirely out of 
whole cloth,'' ``nonsensical,'' and ``absurd'':

          The extraordinary duty the district court imposed 
        upon Lifemark, who loaned the money to build the 
        hospital and held the mortgage on it to secure its 
        payment, is inexplicable. Whatever duty Lifemark may 
        have owed as the pledgee of the collateral mortgage 
        note, they do not include a requirement that Lifemark 
        reinscribe the mortgage executed in Lifemark's favor to 
        secure a debt owed by [the Liljebergs]\274\ to 
        Lifemark, in order that the mortgage may retain 
        priority for Lifemark's benefit as pledgee and 
        mortgagee. As Lifemark aptly points out, ordinarily a 
        debtor such as [the Liljebergs] is happy to have its 
        creditor fail to record its lien. We reject the 
        assertion that Lifemark as the mortgagee here owed a 
        duty to its mortgagor to reinscribe the mortgage, as 
        illustrated in part, indeed, by the very difficulty of 
        describing exactly how not protecting a mortgage[e]'s 
        first position, in and of itself, could possibly harm 
        the mortgagor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \274\The Liljebergs owned and operated an entity called ``St. 
Jude.'' Throughout this discussion, for simplicity's sake, ``St. Jude'' 
will be replaced by ``[the Liljebergs].''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              *    *    *

          Nor can this theory explain how it can lie beside the 
        undisputed right of Lifemark Hospitals, Inc. to, ``at 
        any time, without notice to anyone, release any part of 
        the Property from the effect of the Mortgage.'' . . . 
        The grant of a security interest to secure [the 
        Liljebergs'] debt was to protect the lender, Lifemark 
        Hospitals, Inc., not the borrower.
          Nor did Lifemark as mortgagee have a duty to protect 
        the hospital owner from other creditors asserting their 
        rights against the hospital, as the district court held 
        Lifemark did. . . . This is a mere chimera, existing 
        nowhere in Louisiana law. It was apparently constructed 
        out of whole cloth.\275\

    \275\In the Matter of: Liljeberg Enterprises, Inc., 304 F.3d 410, 
428-29 (5th Cir. 2002) (Ex. 63).

    Judge Porteous offered a second ground for undoing the 
judicial sale, namely, that there was a conspiracy by Lifemark 
to wrest control of the hospital from the Liljebergs. Evidence 
of the conspiracy included the fact that Lifemark failed to 
reinscribe its lien and thus permitted Travelers to initiate 
foreclosure proceedings. This was also rejected by the Fifth 
Circuit as ``border[ing] on the absurd'' and ``close to being 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
nonsensical'':

        [T]he district court's findings of a ``conspiracy'' to 
        wrest control of the hospital and medical office 
        building from [the Liljebergs] and Liljeberg 
        Enterprises border on the absurd. . . .
          The district court's ``conspiracy theory'' conclusion 
        is based, in part, on the view that Liljeberg 
        Enterprises's or [the Liljebergs'] losses were caused 
        by Lifemark. Specifically, not reinscribing the 
        collateral mortgage and not buying out the Travelers 
        lien and adding the Travelers debt to the debt owed by 
        [the Liljebergs] to Lifemark. . . . The district court 
        and Liljeberg Enterprises offer no statutory or case 
        law support for this proposition, for the simple reason 
        that this is not the law. [footnote omitted]
          The theory that Lifemark proximately caused any loss 
        to Liljeberg Enterprises or [the Liljebergs] from the 
        Travelers foreclosure on its judicial mortgage cannot 
        accommodate the undisputed fact that, under Louisiana 
        law, [the Liljebergs] could have reinscribed the 
        collateral mortgage itself. [footnote omitted] . . . 
        That it could have and did not do so is telling. It 
        rends a large hole in the conspiracy claim and leaves 
        [the Liljebergs'] inaction unexplained. . . .

                              *    *    *

        [T]he idea that Lifemark deliberately subordinated its 
        mortgage interest to Travelers, knowing it would result 
        in a required payment, to wit, approximately $7.8

     IX. THE FACTS UNDERLYING ARTICLE II--JUDGE PORTEOUS'S CORRUPT 
   RELATIONSHIPS WITH BAIL BONDSMAN LOUIS M. MARCOTTE, III, AND LORI 
                                MARCOTTE

                            A. Introduction

    In the early 1990's, while a State judge in the 24th 
Judicial District Court (the ``24th JDC'') located in Gretna, 
Louisiana, Judge Porteous formed a relationship with local bail 
bondsman Louis M. Marcotte, III, and his sister, Lori Marcotte, 
who operated a bail bonds company called Bail Bonds Unlimited 
(BBU). That relationship was characterized by a course of 
conduct whereby the Marcottes provided numerous things of value 
to (then) State judge Porteous, and Judge Porteous in turn took 
numerous steps in his official capacity to assist the Marcottes 
in their bail bonds business. Judge Porteous was instrumental 
to the Marcottes in their ability to expand their business in 
the 24th JDC.
    Ultimately, the Marcottes' conduct and their relationship 
with State judges and other State law enforcement officials 
came under investigation. In the late 1990's, after Judge 
Porteous had become a Federal judge, the FBI, working with the 
United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of 
Louisiana, conducted the ``Wrinkled Robe'' investigation, 
targeting public corruption in the setting of bonds in the 24th 
JDC. This investigation included wiretaps and other covert 
methods, and resulted in convictions of Louis Marcotte, Lori 
Marcotte, another BBU employee (Norman Bowley), two State 
judges (Ronald Bodenheimer and Alan Green) and several other 
State law enforcement officials.
    The role Judge Porteous played in the inception of the 
corrupt scheme is discussed generally in the FBI's August 2001 
affidavit in support of its request to obtain wiretaps. That 
affidavit described how the Marcottes had provided Judge 
Porteous (referred to as ``JUDGE #2'' in the Affidavit) with 
meals and a trip to Las Vegas and that Judge Porteous had 
expunged a conviction of a Marcotte employee. The Affidavit 
cited specific instances where Judge Porteous set bonds at the 
Marcottes' request in order to benefit the Marcottes 
financially. The affidavit concluded that the ``pattern of 
illegal activity has been occurring for at least the last 8 
years [i.e., from 1993 to 2001] beginning with [Judge 
Porteous].''\278\ However, as DOJ noted in its 2007 Complaint 
Letter to the Fifth Circuit, the corrupt relationship between 
Judge Porteous and the Marcottes that occurred while Judge 
Porteous was a State judge, even if it were clearly of a 
criminal nature, could not have been the subject of a criminal 
prosecution as part of Wrinkled Robe, because it was barred by 
the applicable statute of limitations.\279\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \278\Affidavit in Support of Application, In the Matter of the 
Application of the United States of America for an Order Authorizing 
the Interception of Wire Communications, Misc. No. 01-2607 (E.D. La., 
Aug. 27, 2001) (redacted) at 136 (Ex. 69(f)).
    \279\The DOJ Complaint Letter stated: ``Although the investigation 
developed evidence that might warrant charging Judge Porteous with 
violations of criminal law relating to judicial corruption, many of 
those incidents took place in the 1990's and would be precluded by the 
relevant statutes of limitations.'' DOJ Complaint Letter at 1 (Ex. 4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FBI's perception of Judge Porteous's central role in 
the corruption in the 24th JDC has been confirmed by the 
Marcottes in their Task Force Hearing testimony and in their 
respective depositions. Not only did Judge Porteous set bonds 
at the Marcottes' request, but because Judge Porteous was an 
influential judge on the 24th JDC, the Marcottes were able to 
trade and build on their close relationship with him to form 
corrupt relationships with other judges. Significantly, though 
the Marcottes would give things of value to other judges and 
law enforcement officials who helped them throughout the 1990's 
and into the 2000's, several of whom were subsequently 
convicted of Federal corruption offenses, they each perceived 
Judge Porteous to be the single most significant judge in 
assisting them in their business.
    Louis Marcotte testified:

        Q. LNow, of all the judges who have helped you, where 
        would you rank Judge Porteous?

        A. LNumber one.

        Q. LOkay. You didn't even hesitate in that response, 
        did you?

        A. LNo.

        Q. LAnd you're certain of that; is that right?

        A. LYes.\280\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \280\Louis Marcotte Dep. at 24-25 (Ex. 68).

    Lori Marcotte, Louis's sister, who ran the company with 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louis, testified similarly:

        Q. LWho was the single most important judge [to] the 
        success of your company, in the 24th Judicial District 
        Court?

        A. LTom Porteous.

        Q. LIs there any question in your mind about that?

        A. LNo.\281\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \281\Lori Marcotte Dep. at 66-67 (Ex. 76).

    Even as a Federal judge, Judge Porteous took steps to help 
the Marcottes maintain and expand their business. He lent his 
status as Federal judge and reputation on their behalf, 
notwithstanding his knowledge of their corrupt acts. In 
particular, Judge Porteous vouched for the Marcottes with newly 
elected State judges and other judicial officers, and helped 
the Marcottes secure and cement relationships--including a 
corrupt relationship with one judge in particular, former State 
Judge Ronald Bodenheimer. Judge Porteous undertook these 
efforts while accepting numerous expensive meals from the 
Marcottes.
    Two other incidents that reflect actions taken by Louis 
Marcotte for the benefit of Judge Porteous are noteworthy. 
First, in 1994, Louis Marcotte was interviewed by the FBI as 
part of its background check of Judge Porteous in connection 
with his nomination to be a Federal judge. Louis Marcotte was 
not candid with the FBI as to his knowledge of Judge Porteous's 
activities. Second, in 2003, when he was under criminal 
investigation, Louis Marcotte prepared an affidavit that 
generally attempted to exculpate Judge Porteous. As discussed 
below, that affidavit was misleading, if not false.

  B. Overview--the Impact of Louisiana State Judges on the Bail Bonds 
                               Businesses

    In the 24th JDC where Judge Porteous presided as a State 
judge until October 1994, the practices of the State judges in 
setting bonds had enormous financial impact on those in the 
bail bonds business. If the bonds were set too high, persons 
who were arrested would not be able to afford to pay the 
premium (typically 10% of the bond)\282\ to the bondsman to 
have the bond posted. If the bond was set too low--say, 
personal recognizance--the bondsman would not make any money in 
the form of premiums. As a general matter, a bondsman wanted 
bonds to be set at profit-maximizing levels--that is, the 
highest amount for which the individual who was arrested could 
afford to pay the premium, but no higher than the person could 
pay. As Lori Marcotte testified:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \282\The actual amount was 12.5%. Of that amount, 10% went to the 
bondsman, and 2.5% went to the court. The 10% amount will be used for 
this discussion.

        Q. L[E]xplain what the consequences are if bond was set 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        too low or if the bond was too high.

        A. LIt depends on how much money the person had to bail 
        out. If they had little money, then having a low bond 
        set would be advantageous to us. If they had plenty 
        money, then a higher bond would be set.

        Q. L[W]hy isn't it in your best interest for the judge 
        to set a $100,000 bond or $1 million bond? Does that 
        mean you get $100,000 premium?

        A. LNot if the people don't have the money. No, it 
        doesn't maximize profit to write a bond and not collect 
        all the money.\283\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \283\Lori Marcotte Dep. at 8 (Ex. 76).

    In the 24th JDC, the practice was that the Marcottes (or 
their employees or agents) would interview a prisoner upon 
arrest, find out identifying information, the nature of the 
crime, and the prisoner's record, locate relatives or persons 
capable of posting bail, and ultimately determine how much the 
prisoner could afford to pay in the form of a premium: ``We 
would screen the family or the defendant to find out how much 
money they had. At some point, we would run credit reports to 
see if they had available credit on their credit cards.''\284\ 
The Marcottes would use that information in making a 
recommendation to one of the judges in the courthouse as to the 
amount of bond that the judge should set.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \284\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 42.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The procedures in the courthouse during the relevant time 
period called for bond to be set by a sitting magistrate 
assigned to that duty. However, any judge in the courthouse 
could set bond, so if the bondsman thought that the magistrate 
who would hear the case would set the bond too high or too low, 
the bondsman would seek out a favored judge to set the bond at 
the bondsman's recommended, profit-maximizing level. As Louis 
Marcotte explained: ``[I]f the magistrate wasn''t favorable, we 
would start calling the judges at home, you know, real early 
before the magistrate got there. And then, if we couldn't get 
in touch with them, we would go shopping in the courthouse 
before the magistrate set the bond.''\285\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \285\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 43.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is against this background and set of financial 
incentives that Louis Marcotte and Lori Marcotte formed a 
relationship with Judge Porteous.\286\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \286\Though financial records of Judge Porteous in the 1990-1994 
time-period have not been obtained, the testimony of those who knew 
him--including Creely, for example--make it clear that Judge Porteous 
had financial difficulties meeting family obligations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 C. The Relationship Between the Marcottes and Judge Porteous Through 
                           the Summer of 1994

    The relationship between Judge Porteous and the Marcottes 
involved a course of conduct, consisting of Judge Porteous 
soliciting and accepting a steady stream of things of value 
from the Marcottes, while, at the same time, Judge Porteous 
took a series of official actions for their financial benefit. 
These actions on both sides grew more extensive, and more 
intertwined, from the inception of their relationship in or 
about 1990 and 1991 to the time that Judge Porteous took the 
Federal bench in late October 1994.
1. Judge Porteous's Solicitation and Acceptance of Things of Value from 
        the Marcottes
    Meals. The Marcottes frequently took Judge Porteous to 
lunch, along with his secretary Ms. Danos, as well as other 
courthouse personnel or staff. The meals were expensive and 
involved significant consumption of alcohol. Louis Marcotte 
estimated they occurred ``around once a week and sometimes 
twice a week'' and identified the restaurants as ``the Beef 
Connection, Ruth's Chris [Steak House], a place named Romairs, 
you know, restaurants near the courthouse.''\287\ Lori Marcotte 
similarly described the frequency of the lunches as ``[a] few 
times a month. Sometimes once or twice a week and then 
sometimes once a month. So overall, I don't know, twice a month 
in the whole history, but sometimes more.''\288\ On occasion 
the lunches would go on for hours, to the point that Lori 
Marcotte left her credit card number with the restaurant--
essentially providing Judge Porteous and others access to an 
open bar and unlimited food.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \287\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 44. The various restaurants were 
described as ``pretty close to the same cost'' as Ruth's Chris Steak 
House. Id.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Several witnesses corroborated the Marcottes. When asked 
which restaurants the Marcottes took her and Judge Porteous to, 
Danos responded: ``Red Maple, Beef Connection, Emeril's. I'm 
sure there's others. . . .''\289\ Attorney Bruce Netterville 
was friends with Louis Marcotte,\290\ and was also an 
occasional guest of the Marcottes when they were taking Judge 
Porteous to lunch. Netterville identified ``Ruth's Chris 
Steakhouse on Broad Street and the Red Maple which is on 
Lafayette and, I think 10th, but Lafayette Street in Gretna'' 
as among the restaurants they went to, but had no doubt there 
were others as well.\291\ Bodenheimer (who would subsequently 
be elected judge) testified that when he was a prosecutor: ``I 
was assigned to [Judge Porteous's] court. And when we broke for 
lunch, he would--Louis and his, one or sometimes both of his 
sisters, would be there to take him [Judge Porteous] to 
lunch.''\292\

    Sometimes Louis would call Judge Porteous, sometimes Judge 
Porteous would call Louis: ``It started out with me calling him 
for lunch. And then, as we got closer and developed a 
relationship, he would call and then I would call.''\293\ 
According to Louis, Judge Porteous never paid for a meal.\294\

    \294\From Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 45:

      Q. [L]et's just say [you took him to lunch] three times a 
      month for 3 years, so 100 lunches. Of the 100 lunches that 
      you went to with Judge Porteous at the restaurants and at 
      the rates that you described, how many of those did Judge 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Porteous pay for?

      A. He didn't pay for any.
    Corporate credit card records of Louis Marcotte and Lori 
Marcotte were obtained going back as far as January 1994, as 
well as Lori Marcotte's personal credit card going back to 
March 1993. These records are consistent with the recollections 
of the Marcottes and other witnesses concerning lunches at the 
Beef Connection, Red Maple, Emerils, and Romairs, and reveal 
charges at those restaurants on the days shown in the following 
chart:\295\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \295\Designations in Table 4 reflect that Lori Marcotte used both a 
personal (P) and corporate (C) American Express account. Records for 
the Red Maple charges do not indicate the date of the month on which 
the charges were incurred.


    Bodenheimer testified that Louis's and Lori's other sister, 
Lisa Marcotte, was occasionally in attendance at these lunches, 
and there are charges on Lisa Marcotte's American Express 
account for meals at the Red Maple and Beef Connection, 
consistent with the amounts set forth above, in this same time 
period. Lori Marcotte and Lisa Marcotte confirmed that on 
occasion Lisa was in attendance at lunches with Judge Porteous 
and paid for the meals.
    Automobile repairs and maintenance--early 1990's. The 
Marcottes, through their employees Jeffery Duhon and Aubrey 
Wallace, began to take care of Judge Porteous's various 
automobiles (including those of his family).\296\ This service 
included picking up Judge Porteous's car to have it washed, 
detailed, and filled up with gas, as well as more significant 
repairs. As Louis Marcotte described: ``[F]irst, I started 
washing it. And then, you know, after I would wash it, I would 
add a little gas to it. And then it escalated from there, you 
know. Then the mechanical work started, the tires, the radios 
in the cars, and then his son's cars, and transmissions and 
stuff like that.''\297\ Danos recalled an incident where she 
went to pick up Judge Porteous's car from the repair shop, and 
the proprietor told her that the Marcottes were paying for the 
repairs.\298\

specifically recalled Judge Porteous requesting that Marcotte replace 
four tires on the car, and in a follow-up phone call to the FBI, Louis 
Marcotte reported that a car stereo for Judge Porteous's car was 
purchased at ``Delta Electronics'' and that tires were purchased at 
``Uniroyal.'' The tire business's name had changed and was called

repairs ``Because I, I remember Gus [the mechanic] saying it was taken 
care of or whoever was working there at the time.'' Danos Dep. I at 55-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Duhon testified that he ``took care of three of [Judge 
Porteous's] cars. I had his, his son's, and his wife['s].'' As 
to what he meant by ``took care of them,'' Duhon explained: 
``Anything. Mostly keeping them maintained, maintenance up on 
them, transmission, brakes, tune-ups, air condition[ing], 
anything that was wrong with his automobiles, his three 
automobiles.'' Duhon specifically recalled: ``I had a 
transmission rebuilt in a Cougar, brake job. I used to tune 
them up, get them tuned up a lot.''\299\

    Aubrey Wallace, another Marcotte employee, similarly 
testified that ``I was assigned on some occasions, several 
occasions to do detail of the car, just basic maintenance. If 
it needed some maintenance work, I would bring it to the proper 
place that it needed to go.'' By ``detailing'' Wallace meant: 
``Generally, just cleaning the car inside and out, gassing it 
up. If there were any additional work that I needed to do, it 
would be specified to me what I needed to do.''\300\

Judge Porteous solicited car service. As Louis described: 
``Well, sometimes we would be at lunch and he would say, `Well, 
you know, my car is not running well,' and I would say, `Okay, 
Judge, I will take care of that.' And there was also requests 
from him, you know, asking me to do it. So it worked both 
ways.''\301\

    Trip to Las Vegas with Judge Giacobbe and Attorney Bruce 
Netterville. In or about 1992, the Marcottes invited Judge 
Porteous and Danos,\302\ among others (including attorneys who 
helped the Marcottes in their business), on a trip to Las Vegas 
with them. Judge Porteous did not attend this trip, though 
Danos did. The trip included attending a ``Siegfried and Roy'' 
show, as well as a flight over the Grand Canyon. One of the 
dinner bills paid for by Lori Marcotte was particularly 
expensive--``the largest bill we had ever paid for 
dinner.''\303\ Photographs have been obtained of guests sitting 
around the table, and of Lori Marcotte holding the bill.\304\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \302\The Marcottes had similar incentives to pay for Danos as they 
did for Judge Porteous--she was a gatekeeper to Judge Porteous and 
would help the Marcottes have access to him, and dealt with the jail on 
bond matters on behalf of Judge Porteous. See e.g., Danos Dep. I at 6 
(Ex. 46). In fact, one measure of the importance of Judge Porteous to 
the Marcottes is the fact that they gave things to his secretary as 
well to ensure access to him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thereafter, from approximately 1992 through 1994, the 
Marcottes paid for at least one, and maybe two, trips for Judge 
Porteous to Las Vegas.
    One of the Las Vegas trips included another State judge--
Judge George Giacobbe--as well as Netterville, one of the 
criminal attorneys with whom the Marcottes had dealings in a 
professional capacity. That trip to Las Vegas is confirmed by 
Netterville and Lori Marcotte and was also mentioned in the 
Wiretap Affidavit.\305\ Louis Marcotte testified he wanted 
attorneys to be on the trip with him and Judge Porteous because 
``it just doesn't look good with a bail bondsman hanging out 
with judges. So what I did is I brought some attorneys in to 
make it look good.''\306\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Both Louis Marcotte and Lori Marcotte claimed they split 
the costs of the trip with the attorneys and did so by paying 
cash to Judge Porteous's secretary Danos. Louis Marcotte 
testified:

        Q. LOkay. Now, do you recall how Judge Porteous'[s] 
        travel was arranged for and/or paid for?

        A. LYes. My sister brought cash money to Rhonda, and 
        Rhonda had wrote the check to pay everything, and we 
        reimbursed her. And we got money from the lawyers for 
        half of it.

        Q. LAnd how is it that you happen to remember that?

        A. LBecause that's just one thing that you'd remember.

        Q. LOkay. And was there, was there conscious thought 
        about paying Rhonda so the money wouldn't come--look 
        like it's coming right from you to Judge Porteous?

        A. LRight.\307\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \307\Louis Marcotte Dep. at 14-15 (Ex. 68). As written up by the 
FBI, Louis Marcotte stated in an April 2004 interview:

      On this [Las Vegas] trip the lawyers and LOUIS split the 
      cost of Judge PORTEOUS' expenses and gave the money to 
      DANOS to put it through her checkbook in order to hide the 
      payments. DANOS then wrote a check to pay for the expenses 
      so there was no direct link between LOUIS, JUDGE PORTEOUS 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      and [others].

Lori Marcotte likewise recalled ``standing in [Danos's] office,

    Attorney Netterville testified that he did not recall how 
much he actually paid for the trip but acknowledged that if he 
had been asked to pay for more than his individual personal 
share (i.e., if he had been asked to chip in for the judges) he 
would have done so. Netterville testified:

        Q. LBut you don't doubt that if Louis said your share 
        of this trip is ``X'' dollars that that's something you 
        would have paid?

        A. LYes, I would have.\310\

    Possible second trip to Las Vegas. Louis Marcotte and Lori 
Marcotte both testified they believed there was a second trip 
where they took Judge Porteous to Las Vegas, a fact that 
appears supported by Danos as well. Louis recalled a second 
trip because he ``remember[ed] we were standing by a slot 
machine, and his wife was asking him for some change to put--
some dollars to put back in, coins, you know, to put back into 
the slot machine.''\311\

    Danos did not recall Judge Porteous taking the previously 
described trip with Judge Giacobbe and the attorneys (a trip 
that she did not attend).\313\ However, she, like Lori 
Marcotte, recalled what appeared to be a different Marcotte-
Judge Porteous trip to Las Vegas in connection with one of the 
PBUS conventions that Danos herself attended:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \313\Danos Dep. I at 15 (Ex. 46).

        Q. L[D]id the Marcottes ever take Judge Porteous to Las 
        Vegas, either with you on any trip that you were in 
        attendance on or on a trip that you know they took him 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        on even if you were not in attendance on?

        A. LOne Las Vegas trip.

        Q. LOkay. And what do you recall about that trip?

        A. LNot very much. It was their convention. And I think 
        they would have liked for him to have spoken, but they 
        already had speakers lined up.

        Q. LOkay. And you were in attendance on that trip?

        A. LYes, sir.\314\

        Q. LThe trip which there was a bail bond convention 
        going on, and I think it's your testimony that to the 
        best of your recollection this was still when he was a 
        State judge, I take it, is it your testimony that that 
        was a trip that was paid for by the Marcottes?

        A. LI think it was.\315\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \315\Danos Dep. I at 17 (Ex. 46).

    Consistent with both Louis's and Lori's testimony, Danos 
did recall that on one occasion the Marcottes reimbursed her 
for Judge Porteous's trip to Las Vegas. Danos did not dispute 
that it was Lori who paid her in cash.\316\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Fence repairs. In or about 1994--while Judge Porteous was 
still a State judge--Marcotte's employees Duhon and Wallace 
rebuilt a fence at Judge Porteous's house. They were there more 
than 1 day and also performed other repairs at the house. They 
both recalled picking up lumber at Home Depot and described the 
incident in consistent terms.\317\ Louis Marcotte described the 
incident as follows: ``[W]e were at lunch and he mentioned, 
`Well, look, my fence blew over in the storm.' And I said, 
`Well, you know, I got two guys that will take care of it for 
you. No problem.'''\318\ Lori Marcotte confirmed they paid for 
a fence for Judge Porteous.\319\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \317\See Duhon Dep. at 13-14 (Ex. 78); Wallace Dep. at 10-11 (Ex.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Favors for Judge Porteous's Son. The Marcottes permitted 
one of Judge Porteous's sons to use one of their parking spaces 
near the courthouse for his courier business. They also hired 
his son on occasion.
2. Judge Porteous's Actions on Behalf of the Marcottes
    Setting Bonds. When Louis Marcotte first entered the bail 
bonds business as the owner of Bail Bonds Unlimited (BBU), he 
did not have connections with judges or other law enforcement 
personnel in the 24th JDC where he did the bulk of his work. 
Louis and Lori came to know Judge Porteous through another 
bondsman--Adam Barnett (who in turn knew Judge Porteous from 
other connections in the courthouse).\320\ On occasion, when 
Louis Marcotte needed a ``difficult'' bond to be set, Barnett 
would go to Judge Porteous to have him set the bond. Barnett 
was not an employee of Marcotte's, but Louis Marcotte would 
provide Barnett some portion of the premium that was paid by 
the individual for whom bond was posted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \320\At some point in 1993, Judge Porteous officiated at Adam 
Barnett's wedding, which was also attended by Lori Marcotte.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Louis Marcotte gradually excluded Barnett as the middleman 
and he and Lori began to deal with Judge Porteous directly. As 
Louis and Lori began to do things for Judge Porteous--described 
in the previous section--Judge Porteous became the ``go-to'' 
judge for the Marcottes. Over the time period roughly between 
1990 through 1994, as the Marcottes increasingly gave Judge 
Porteous things of value, they would increasingly go to Judge 
Porteous to have him set bonds at amounts they requested, and 
would seek other favors from him. It started ``just a little 
bit'' but, as Lori Marcotte described: ``[I]n the end it was a 
lot. It was an everyday, everyday thing in the courthouse. We'd 
go to the courthouse to see him in his office, call him on his 
cell phone, call him at home, contact him through his 
secretary. If he wasn't in the office, she would find him for 
us, get, get him off the bench. When we needed him to set a 
bond, he was available for us to set a bond, or split a bond 
too.''\321\ As to the frequency of their contacts: ``A few 
times a week. And sometimes when we would go to see him, we'd 
have more than one bond, sometimes ten at a time. We would make 
a stack of worksheets and bring bonds. So it's not so much how, 
how many times in a week. It's when we did go, we always had 
more than one.''\322\

    \322\Lori Marcotte Dep. at 14 (Ex. 76).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Louis Marcotte described the reasons he gave Judge Porteous 
things of value as follows:

        Q. LThe real question, Mr. Marcotte, is, why did you do 
        all of these things for Judge Porteous? What value were 
        you getting by virtue of the fact that you were 
        providing him this stream of value?

        A. LI wanted service, I wanted access, and I wanted to 
        make money.\323\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \323\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 47.

    The Marcottes' access to Judge Porteous is corroborated by 
numerous witnesses who saw the Marcottes around his courtroom 
or in his chambers.\324\ For example, Marcotte employee Duhon 
testified that Louis Marcotte would go to Judge Porteous more 
than to any other judge in the courthouse to get bonds set. He 
further described Louis's access to Judge Porteous as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \324\Other witnesses describe the Marcottes' frequent access to 
Judge Porteous. These witnesses include Lori Marcotte, Danos, 
Netterville (a criminal defense attorney who associated with the 
Marcottes), Aubrey Wallace (Marcotte employee), and Bodenheimer (a 
prosecutor at the time, and eventually a State judge).

        Q. L[W]ould you describe what it would be like to have 
        Judge Porteous go in and set bond at the request of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Louis?

        A. LYes. He'd get to his chambers at 9:00 in the 
        morning, and they might have 10 or 12 lawyers waiting 
        there. Me and Louis would just walk right by both of 
        them, all of them and walk into his office and have a 
        seat carrying sheets of paper which is like bond form 
        we bring to them, and he let them see them.\325\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \325\Duhon Dep. at 7-9 (Ex. 78).

    Splitting bonds. One way in particular that Judge Porteous 
helped the Marcottes was through a practice referred to as 
``splitting'' a bond. If a bond for a serious crime would 
otherwise naturally be set at an amount that would be too high 
for an accused to pay the required premium, a judge could 
``split'' the bond into two pieces--one portion was a standard 
commercial bond, the other was a property bond or other 
personal promise not backed up by a bondsman. As an example, a 
$100,000 bond could be ``split'' into a regular $50,000 
commercial bond and a $50,000 component that was secured by 
property or by the promise of a third party (the accused's 
mother, for example) to pay $50,000 if the accused did not 
appear as required.\326\ By splitting the bond, the accused 
needed only to come up with the premium for the $50,000 piece, 
that is, $5,000. A judge's action in splitting a high bond 
would mean that the Marcottes would receive some premium rather 
than no premium.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \326\Louis Marcotte noted that, frequently, the bail component that 
was not backed by a surety bond may have had no real value. Louis 
Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 48 (``[M]ost of the time the personal surety 
wasn't worth anything, and the only portion of the bond that was worth 
something was the commercial part of the bond that was executed by the 
bail agent and backed by the insurance company.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A ``split bond'' had political value for the elected State 
judges who ``liked setting high bonds, because if it came out 
in the newspaper that, you know, something happened and the guy 
[who was let out on a split bond] did something wrong, then it 
would look like he got out on a high bond.''\327\ A judge who 
``split'' a bond could claim that he did not actually reduce 
the bond (even though in substance this was the effect). 
Certain individuals in the law enforcement community opposed 
this practice, and there were some judges who would not 
``split'' bonds.\328\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \327\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 47.
    \328\See Lori Marcotte Dep. at 15 (Ex. 76). As described by the FBI 
in its wiretap affidavit:

[I]t is common practice for bondsmen to attempt to get a bond reduced 
in order to make a bond more affordable; however, there is a built-in 
reluctance to grant such requests, especially in cases where serious 
crimes are involved. This reluctance is based primarily on the fact 
that a Judge, who depends on the public vote to keep his/her job, fears 
potential serious criticism from the public in general and from the 
media in particular if a defendant commits another serious crime while 
out on bond. Splits are a much more attractive means of making bonds 
``affordable'' because a Judge can always argue he/she did not ``reduce 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a bond.''

Application of the United States of America for an Order Authorizing 
the Interception of Wire Communications, Misc. No. 01-2607 (E.D. La., 
Aug. 27, 2001) (redacted) at 20-21 (Ex. 69(f)).
    Judge Porteous became associated with this practice of 
``splitting bonds'' and bragged about having invented it (even 
though it may have been done by other judges in the past). 
Former State Judge Bodenheimer testified it was his 
understanding that Judge Porteous ``was the one who somehow 
came up with this idea of doing these bond splittings'' and 
that Louis Marcotte ``told me that Porteous was, was the one 
who came up with the idea about splitting bonds in the first 
place.''\329\ Lori Marcotte stated that ``because Judge 
Porteous was respected in the courthouse by other judges, his 
peers, the District Attorney's office, Judge Porteous--by Judge 
Porteous splitting and setting bonds for us was making it like 
the norm, creating the practice of splitting bonds. He actually 
originated this practice of splitting bonds.''\330\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \329\Bodenheimer Dep. at 6-7 (Ex. 86).
    \330\Lori Marcotte Dep. at 17 (Ex. 76). The act of setting a bond 
is entrusted to a Judge's discretion, so it cannot be argued that the 
actions of Judge Porteous in splitting or reducing in bond in any 
particular cases was ``right'' or ``wrong,'' or that splitting bonds in 
general was either appropriate or inappropriate across the board.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Setting aside convictions. Judge Porteous took other 
significant official actions as favors to the Marcottes. In 
1993 at Louis Marcotte's request, he set aside the burglary 
conviction of Jeffery Duhon. Duhon was not only an employee of 
the Marcottes but was also married to Lisa Marcotte (Louis's 
other sister).\331\ Louis Marcotte testified he ``approached 
Porteous to see if he would expunge Jeff Duhon's record'' and 
that Judge Porteous did so.\332\ Judge Porteous's action in 
setting aside Duhon's conviction was particularly unusual 
because Duhon had been sentenced by Judge E. V. Richards, not 
Judge Porteous, ``[s]o what [Judge Porteous] did was he took 
the conviction out of another section and brought it in his 
section and then expunged the record.''\333\ Louis Marcotte 
elaborated that in his experience, it was unusual for a judge 
in one division to expunge a conviction in a criminal case 
assigned to a judge in a different division.\334\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \331\In 2003, after Louis Marcotte was publicly identified as the 
subject of a criminal investigation, Judge Porteous's expungement of 
Duhon's record was reported in the local newspapers:

        Duhon said it was Porteous who gave him his break in 
      1992, when the judge expunged his felony record as a favor 
      to Marcotte, allowing him to apply for a bail bonds 
      license. Duhon had been arrested for burglary when he was 
      17, a charge for which he served 93 days in jail for 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      probation violation, he said.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Additionally, as discussed below, on the eve of his 
ascension to the Federal bench in October 1994, Judge Porteous 
set aside the conviction of Aubrey Wallace, another Marcotte 
employee.
    Helping the Marcottes with Judge Alan Green and other 
Judges. As noted, Judge Porteous was a former prosecutor, had a 
good relationship with the District Attorney, and was perceived 
by many in the courthouse to be influential on the bench.\335\ 
By forming a public relationship with Judge Porteous, the 
Marcottes gained credibility with other State judges on the 
24th JDC. Thus, the Marcottes sought to have other State judges 
included in their lunches with Judge Porteous. Louis Marcotte 
told the FBI he ``wanted to target judges who were not doing 
bonds and asked RHONDA DANOS [Judge Porteous's secretary] to 
invite them to lunch with Judge PORTEOUS.''\336\ An FBI write-
up of another Louis Marcotte interview recounts: ``MARCOTTE 
frequently called on PORTEOUS to help bring in other judges 
MARCOTTE could use to split bonds, reduce bonds and give 
MARCOTTE good service.''\337\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \335\Bodenheimer testified: ``Out of all the judges there--Porteous 
came from the District Attorney's Office--and he was probably the most 
influential judge with the District Attorney's office, in my opinion.'

Judge Porteous was perceived to be an influential Judge on the 24th 
JDC. Netterville Dep. at 9 (Ex. 92).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As one example, Judge Porteous helped connect the Marcottes 
with Judge Alan Green (who was ultimately convicted of a 
corruption offense arising from his relationship with the 
Marcottes). Lori Marcotte described this in her Task Force 
Hearing testimony as follows:

        I remember setting up a lunch with some other judges 
        and some attorneys and Judge Porteous and Rhonda, and 
        we had--they had invited or we had invited Judge Green 
        who was newly elected. And, I mean, it is pretty clear 
        because that was really the first lunch where Judge 
        Porteous had explained the concept of splitting bonds. 
        That was kind of like the stage for everything else 
        that would happen.\338\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \338\Lori Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 57. See also Lori Marcotte FBI 
Interview, Apr. 2, 2004 at 1 (Ex. 74(c)) (``After Green won the 
election, Lori and Louis discussed initiating a relationship with Green 
via Judge Porteous. Porteous got Green to come to lunch with Porteous 
and the Marcottes which was set up by Danos [Porteous's secretary]. 
They had lunch at Romer's (ph) [should be `Romair's'].''). Danos also 
identified Judge Green as one of the judges who accompanied them with 
Judge Porteous on lunches when he was a State judge. Danos Dep. I at 27

    This practice of having Judge Porteous vouch for the 
Marcottes with the State judges in the 24th JDC continued after 
Judge Porteous became a Federal judge.
    Helping in civil ``non-compete'' litigation. The Marcottes 
also requested that Judge Porteous help lobby other judges on 
their behalf in connection with ``non-compete'' litigation 
initiated by the Marcottes against a former employee. As 
written up by the FBI, Lori Marcotte described the request for 
assistance in a BBU civil case against a former employee, Bobby 
Gene Hollingsworth, as follows:

        BBU [Bail Bonds Unlimited] sued BOBBY HOLLINGSWORTH 
        over a non-compete clause in his contract. LOUIS 
        MARCOTTE went to JUDGE PORTEOUS and wanted JUDGE 
        PORTEOUS to call JUDGE CLARENCE McMANNUS and tell him 
        how to rule. JUDGE PORTEOUS said he would contact JUDGE 
        McMANNUS and called him while LOUIS MARCOTTE was in 
        JUDGE PORTEOUS' chambers. McMANNUS ruled in favor of 
        BBU.\339\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \339\Lori Marcotte FBI Interview, Nov. 5, 2004 at 2 (Ex. 74(e)).

The official court case jacket is consistent with this 
recollection, and reveals that the Marcottes (Bail Bonds 
Unlimited) filed the case against Hollingsworth in August 1994, 
shortly prior to Judge Porteous taking the Federal bench. The 
Marcottes initially obtained a Temporary Restraining Order 
restraining Hollingsworth from competing against them, then 
obtained a permanent injunction which was to be in effect until 
September 1995.\340\

               C. The July-August 1994 Background Check 
                           of Judge Porteous

    The bulk of the background investigation of Judge Porteous 
in connection with his nomination to the Federal bench occurred 
in July and early August 1994. On August 1, 1994, Louis 
Marcotte was interviewed as part of that standard background 
check. It is not known how the FBI got Louis Marcotte's name as 
a person to interview; however, Marcotte testified that Judge 
Porteous told him ``that the FBI is going to be coming to 
interview you.''\341\ Louis Marcotte told the FBI as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \341\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 51.

        MARCOTTE said the candidate [Porteous] is of good 
        character and has a good reputation in general. He said 
        the candidate is well-respected and associates with 
        attorneys who are upstanding individuals. He does not 
        know the candidate to associate with anyone of 
        questionable character.\342\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \342\Porteous Background Check Documents, at PORT 503-04 (Ex. 
69(b)).

As to Judge Porteous's drinking and financial situation, the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
write-up reports:

        He [MARCOTTE] advised that the candidate will have a 
        beer or two at lunch, but has never seen him drunk. He 
        has no knowledge of the candidate's financial 
        situation.\343\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \343\Porteous Background Check Documents, at PORT 503-04 (Ex. 
69(b)).

    Louis Marcotte acknowledged that these statements about 
Judge Porteous's financial situation and drinking habits were 
false. As to Judge Porteous's financial condition, Marcotte has 
since testified that he knew at the time that Judge Porteous 
was ``struggling'': ``[B]y looking at the surroundings and the 
problems with the drinking and the cars and asking people for 
repairs and stuff like that, you know, one would think that, 
hey this guy is struggling. And by looking at the cars, you 
could see that he was struggling.''\344\ He further described 
Judge Porteous's cars as being in ``deplorable 
condition.''\345\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As to Judge Porteous's drinking, Louis Marcotte bluntly 
described his statement to the FBI that Judge Porteous would 
have a ``beer or two'' at lunch in the following terms: 
``That's a false statement.''\346\ Marcotte testified that he 
was familiar with Judge Porteous's drinking, and ``knew that he 
[Judge Porteous] was an alcoholic. He drank a lot. . . . He 
would drink four or five glasses of Absolut for lunch.''\347\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \346\Louis Marcotte Dep. at 12 (Ex. 68).
    \347\Louis Marcotte Dep. at 11 (Ex. 68). In his Task Force Hearing 
testimony, Louis Marcotte repeated his testimony that Judge Porteous 
would have numerous vodka drinks at lunch and that he deliberately 
misled the FBI about his knowledge of Judge Porteous's drinking. Louis 
Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 49. Thus, Louis Marcotte, like Robert Creely, 
was not candid with the FBI as to both Judge Porteous's financial 
circumstances and as to his drinking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finally, the FBI interview quoted Louis Marcotte as stating 
that he ``was not aware of anything in the candidate's 
background that might be the basis of attempted influence, 
pressure, coercion or compromise or would impact negatively on 
the candidate's [Judge Porteous's] character, reputation, 
judgement or discretion.'' Louis Marcotte acknowledged that he 
``was lying again,'' not only because of his knowledge of Judge 
Porteous's ``actions with the gambling, the drinking'' but 
because of Louis Marcotte's knowledge of his own relationship 
with Judge Porteous, which gave him leverage over Judge 
Porteous.\348\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    After the initial portion of the background check had been 
completed, FBI Headquarters directed that further investigation 
be conducted as a result of some derogatory information that 
was uncovered (including allegations as to Judge Porteous's 
drinking and that he was living above his means).\349\

completed a few days later.\351\

Judge Porteous and ``told him [Judge Porteous] everything that 
they asked about''\352\ and that he had given Judge Porteous 
``a clean bill of health.''\353\

 D. Judge Porteous's Actions to Benefit the Marcottes During His Final 
                       Months on the State Bench

1. September-October 1994 Set-Aside of Wallace's Felony Conviction
    After he was nominated, and around the time of his Senate 
confirmation process, Judge Porteous was pressed by Louis 
Marcotte to set aside the felony burglary conviction of his 
employee Aubrey Wallace.\354\ As described by Louis Marcotte:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \354\Wallace had been arrested on burglary charges on May 8, 1989; 
he pleaded guilty to the felony charge of simple burglary on June 26, 
1990 and was sentenced the same day to a suspended sentence of 3 years 
incarceration and placed on probation for 2 years. State v. Wallace, 
No. 89-2360 (24th Jud. Dist. Ct., Jeff. Par., La.) (court case file) 
(Ex. 82). At the time of his May 1989 burglary arrest, Wallace was 
under indictment for felony drug charges (PCP and cocaine) for an 
offense alleged to have occurred on December 15, 1988.

  While he was on probation for the burglary conviction, Wallace 
pleaded guilty on February 26, 1991, to the felony drug charges of 
possession of over 28 grams of cocaine and possession of PCP and was 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
sentenced to 5 years incarceration.

        Q. L[W]hat was Judge Porteous's response when you made 
        that request of him?

        A. LHe waffled a little bit because he wasn't confirmed 
        at the time, but he told me--I saw him a few times, I 
        pushed him and said, you know, ``Judge, you know, I 
        really need to get this done.'' He said, ``After my 
        confirmation, I will do it.''

        Q. LAnd, in fact, did he do it?

        A. LYes, he did.

        Q. LAnd, in your mind, do you have an opinion as to why 
        Judge Porteous set aside Wallace's conviction?

        A. LBecause all of the stuff that I have done for him 
        in the past.

        Q. LWas there any question in your mind that he set 
        aside the conviction as a favor to you?

        A. LYes, he did it for me.\355\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \355\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 51. Louis Marcotte's Task Force 
Hearing testimony tracked his statement to the FBI in 2004 in which he 
stated that Judge Porteous wanted to wait until after his Senate 
confirmation to set aside Wallace's conviction:

      PORTEOUS waited until the last days of his term as a 24th 
      Judicial District Court Judge to expunge AUBREY WALLACE'S 
      criminal record. PORTEOUS did not want the fact that he 
      expunged WALLACE'S record to be exposed in the media or 
      discovered in his background investigation for his Federal 
      judicial appointment. PORTEOUS told MARCOTTE that he 
      (PORTEOUS) would act on WALLACE'S expungement after he was 
      appointed to the Federal judicial bench. PORTEOUS told 
      MARCOTTE he was not going to risk a lifetime judicial 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      appointment for WALLACE.

Louis Marcotte FBI Interview, Oct. 15, 2004 at 1 (Ex. 72(g)). Lori 
Marcotte specifically recalled that ``we went to Judge Porteous to ask 
him if he would expunge Aubrey Wallace's criminal record. My brother 
and myself, we went to Judge Porteous'[s] office.'' Lori Marcotte Dep. 
at 25-26 (Ex. 76).

    Setting aside Wallace's burglary conviction required Judge 
Porteous to take two steps: first, the sentence for Wallace's 
burglary conviction--a sentence which Wallace had completed--
had to be amended from one which, as a matter of law, was not 
eligible to be set aside, to one that could be set aside; 
second, the sentence, having been so amended, would then need 
to be set aside.
    On September 20, 1994, Robert Rees, an attorney who did 
occasional criminal work and thus had interactions with the 
Marcottes, filed a motion on behalf of Wallace to set aside 
Wallace's conviction. This was a bare-bones motion, reciting 
only that Wallace had been sentenced in 1990 and now ``desires 
to amend his sentence to give him benefit under Article 
893.''\356\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \356\Motion to Amend Sentence, State of Louisiana v. Aubrey N. 
Wallace, No. 89-2360 (24th Jud. Dist Ct., Jeff. Par., La.), Sept. 20, 
1994, (part of Ex. 82). Wallace's first name is spelled ``Aubry'' in 
the court records from this case. The correct spelling of his first 
name is in fact ``Aubrey.'' Accordingly, throughout this Report, his 
first name will be spelled ``Aubrey'' regardless of how it may have 
been spelled in court records.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On September 21, 1994, Judge Porteous held a hearing in 
which he took the first step in the set aside process, by 
amending Wallace's sentence to make it eligible to be set 
aside. At that hearing, Netterville (an attorney who did 
business with the Marcottes and who had traveled to Las Vegas 
with Judge Porteous and Louis Marcotte in or about 1992 or 
1993) stood in for Rees. Netterville did not recall this 
hearing or how he came to stand in for Rees, and he did not 
consider Wallace a client. His appearance was limited to his 
saying ``Thank you, Judge'' and ``Thank you.'' The entire 
hearing was less than one transcript page, the critical portion 
consisting of Judge Porteous's conclusion: ``Accordingly, the 
sentence will be amended to include removal of the 
unsatisfactory removal of probation and the entering of the 
plea under Code of Criminal Procedure 893. All right. I've 
signed the order.''\357\

Wallace, No. 89-2360 (24th Judicial Dist. Ct., Jeff. Par.), Sept. 21,

deemed to have been unsatisfactorily completed because Wallace was 
incarcerated while on probation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On Thursday, September 22, 1994, Judge Porteous signed the 
written order that was proposed as part of the underlying 
September 20, 1994 Motion. The Order amended the sentence so 
that it would represent that the defendant pleaded guilty under 
a provision of State law (Article 893) which permitted the 
conviction to be set aside.\358\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \358\The Order stated in full:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            ORDER

        Considering the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that the 
      sentence on Aubrey WALLACE is hereby amended to include the 
      following wording, ``the defendant plead under Article 
      893.''
        GRETNA, LOUISIANA this 22 day of September, 1994.

Order (amending sentence), Louisiana v. Aubrey N. Wallace, No. 89-2360 
(24th Jud. Dist Ct., Jeff. Par., La.), Sep. 22, 1994 (part of Ex. 82).
    Judge Porteous's Senate confirmation hearing occurred 2 
weeks later, on Thursday, October 6, 1994. He was confirmed by 
the Senate on Friday, October 7, 1994, and received his 
commission the following Tuesday, October 11, 1994.
    On Friday, October 14, 1994, 1 week after being confirmed 
but prior to being sworn in as a Federal judge (which occurred 
on October 28, 1994), Judge Porteous held another hearing on 
the Wallace matter to finish the process, this time with Rees 
appearing for Wallace. Again, the transcript of the entire 
hearing takes up but one transcript page, starting as follows:

        Mr. Reese:
                        LYou Honor, Robert Reese on behalf of--
        --

        Judge Porteous:
                        LI'm going to grant that. I've already 
        amended the sentence to provide for a 893.

                              *    *    *

                        LUnder 893 the dismissal will be 
        entered.\359\

Wallace, No. 89-2360 (24th Jud. Dist. Ct., Jeff. Par., La.), Oct. 14, 
1994, at PORT 000625-29 (Ex. 69(d)). The attorney's name was Robert 
Rees (without the ``e''). It is reported in the documents as Robert 
``Reese,'' and that spelling is used in the quoted materials. The 
prosecutor in the courtroom for the two hearings, Assistant District 
Attorney Michael Reynolds, stated in a Task Force Staff interview on 
January 5, 2010, that the set-aside didn't ``smell right'' to him at 
the time, that it was wrong as a matter of discretion and perhaps 
illegal, but that because of Judge Porteous's close relationship with 
the then-District Attorney, there was nothing he could do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  On October 19, 1994, Judge Porteous signed again the same order he 
had previously signed on September 22, 1994 (the order amending the 
sentence to permit it to be set aside). It is not known why he signed 
this second identical order. It was actually signed after Judge 
Porteous had set aside the conviction.

Judge Porteous also signed a written order that date to the 
same effect, thus setting aside Marcotte employee Wallace's 
1990 burglary conviction.\360\

Louisiana v. Aubrey N. Wallace, No. 89-2360 (24th Jud. Dist Ct., Jeff.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    November 1994--Judge Porteous's Interview by the 
Metropolitan Crime Commission. Shortly after setting aside 
Wallace's conviction, an allegation was made to the New Orleans 
Metropolitan Crime Commission (MCC)--a citizen's watchdog 
group--concerning the lawfulness of Judge Porteous's actions in 
setting aside Wallace's conviction. Judge Porteous was 
interviewed by MCC representatives on November 8, 1994, 11 days 
after he became a Federal judge.
    In that interview, Judge Porteous denied having 
``frequent'' lunches with the Marcottes, denied that the 
Marcottes paid his way to Las Vegas, and denied that he amended 
Wallace's sentence out of friendship or at the request of Louis 
Marcotte. That interview was written up as follows:

          Upon arrival we advised Judge Porteous that the 
        purpose of our meeting was to question him regarding 
        his amendment of the Aubrey N. Wallace sentence. . . . 
        In particular we advised Judge Porteous that we wanted 
        to ask him about his relationship with Louis Marcotte. 
        . . . The Judge stated ``lets not sugar coat anything, 
        in other words you guys think I'm dirty.'' We replied 
        that we had some questions about his handling of the 
        Aubrey Wallace case and welcomed an explanation of his 
        reasoning in this matter. . . .
          The Judge freely admitted that he has known Mr. 
        Marcotte for a number of years and considers him to be 
        a friend. We asked the Judge if he frequently ate lunch 
        with Mr. Marcotte and provided him with the name of the 
        two restaurants they frequent. He admitted that he has 
        had several lunches with Mr. Marcotte, but he didn't 
        know if he would term his lunches with Marcotte as 
        ``frequent.'' Additionally, we asked if he had traveled 
        to Las Vegas with Mr. Marcotte and he confirmed that he 
        had. The Judge stated that six or seven people went as 
        a group to Vegas and Marcotte was a member of the 
        group. The Judge when asked did Marcotte pay his way, 
        quickly changed the subject. Porteous when asked a 
        second time advised that Marcotte did not pay his way 
        to Vegas.

                              *    *    *

          The Judge vehemently denied that he amended the 
        sentence out of friendship for or at the request of 
        Louis Marcotte.
          The Judge stated he felt he had done nothing 
        criminal, but stated that the Assistant District 
        Attorney had the authority to appeal his ruling it was 
        improper. The Judge ended the meeting by telling us to 
        ``do what you think you have to do.'' . . .\361\

Porteous by Anthony Radosti and Rafael C. Goyaneche, III, Metropolitan

    These events were reported in the New Orleans Times-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Picayune in a March 19, 1995 article:

          U.S. District Judge Thomas Porteous, while serving 
        his final weeks on the state bench in Jefferson Parish, 
        illegally amended a convicted drug offender's burglary 
        sentence and then removed it from the man's record, 
        according to the Metropolitan Crime Commission.\362\

Actions, New Orleans Times-Picayune, B-1, Mar. 19,1995 (Ex. 119(a)).

    The Lawfulness of the Set-Aside. The action of Judge 
Porteous setting aside Wallace's burglary conviction was not 
appealed by the State and thus not subject to review as to its 
lawfulness. Nonetheless, the observations of a practicing 
attorney in this field are noteworthy. Netterville, the 
attorney who stood in to represent Wallace at the initial set-
aside hearing, has handled hundreds of set-aside motions in his 
career and understands the law and practice involved in the 
process. Notwithstanding that Netterville actually appeared for 
Wallace in open court in seeking the set-aside, he testified in 
a Task Force deposition that he would not have accepted that 
case from a paying client and viewed the set-aside as legally 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
improper:

        Q. LIf a client, if a person came to you and said I 
        want to hire you to have my conviction set aside and . 
        . . I wasn't sentenced under Article 893 [which permits 
        set asides] and my probation was unsatisfactorily 
        terminated, what would you tell them?

        A. LI'd say you can't hire me because it can't be done.

        Q. LSo that's more--I mean, isn't that more than just 
        being irregular to highly irregular.

        A. LNo, it's highly irregular. You can't, you can't do 
        it. If the district attorney had objected and taken a 
        writ, he would have won in my opinion.\363\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \363\Netterville Dep. at 18-19 (Ex. 92(a)).

    Whether or not the set-aside was unlawful, the facts at a 
minimum demonstrate that on the eve of his taking the Federal 
bench, Judge Porteous took the ``highly irregular'' official 
act of setting aside the felony conviction of one of Marcotte's 
employees, at the personal request of Marcotte and as a favor 
to him. The fact that Judge Porteous timed this judicial act to 
occur after his confirmation is strong evidence that he knew of 
its impropriety and that he knew that it evidenced his improper 
relationship with the Marcottes. It is not possible to 
challenge the ``merits'' of a decision to set aside a 
conviction (any more than it is possible to challenge the 
exercise of discretion in setting a bond), for such an act 
inherently embodies the judgment of a judge as to whether an 
individual merits this significant benefit. However, in this 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
instance, the following factors are noteworthy:

         LWallace had two felony convictions in a short 
        period of time (stemming from the 1989 drug charge and 
        the 1990 burglary charge, which occurred while on 
        release from the drug charge). Wallace had been 
        released from prison for about a year on the drug 
        charge, and was still on parole for that offense at the 
        time Judge Porteous set aside Wallace's burglary 
        conviction.

         LIt is consistent with Judge Porteous's other 
        conduct as a judge that benefitted Louis Marcotte. 
        Indeed, Judge Porteous had previously set aside the 
        conviction for Marcotte's brother-in-law (Duhon).

         LThere was no compelling justification for 
        Judge Porteous to set aside the conviction in the last 
        days of his tenure on the State bench. The motions and 
        orders were bare-bones, handled by persons close to 
        Louis Marcotte and Judge Porteous. There were no facts 
        adduced at the hearings or in the pleadings in support 
        of the motion, such as a contention of extraordinary 
        rehabilitation.

         LJudge Porteous knew that Wallace, like Duhon, 
        had worked on his cars and his house.

         LMoreover, even if both the legality and the 
        merits could be argued, at the time he set aside the 
        conviction, Judge Porteous was indebted to Marcotte, 
        who had assisted him by lying on his behalf in the 
        confirmation process. So long as Judge Porteous was a 
        State judge--and particularly when Judge Porteous was 
        seeking to become a Federal judge--Louis Marcotte had 
        leverage over Judge Porteous by virtue of Marcotte's 
        knowledge of their corrupt relationship.

2. Judge Porteous's Bond-Setting in His Final Days on the State Bench
    Louis Marcotte also recalled that when Judge Porteous was 
about to leave the State bench, Marcotte used him to ``open the 
floodgates'' in terms of setting bonds: ``I figured he was on 
his way out and let's open the floodgates and let me try to 
make as much money as I can before he left.''\364\ In response 
to questioning from Mr. Schiff at the Task Force hearing, Louis 
Marcotte explained: ``Now, prior to that [the last days on the 
bench], you know, there was a ton of bail applications as well, 
but my words were `Well, let's wear him [Judge Porteous] 
out.'''\365\ Marcotte's testimony has been corroborated by a 
series of bond forms that were obtained from the Sheriff's 
Office and the 24th JDC reflecting numerous bonds set by Judge 
Porteous, for prisoners for whom the Marcottes posted bonds, in 
the last days of his tenure on the State court bench. \366\

    \364\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 51. See also Louis Marcotte Dep. 
at 24 (Ex. 68). Louis Marcotte's Task Force Hearing testimony was 
consistent with what he told the FBI in 2004: ``After PORTEOUS was 
appointed to the Federal bench, he expunged WALLACE'S record and did 
almost every bond MARCOTTE asked.'' Louis Marcotte FBI Interview, Oct. 
15, 2004 at 1 (Ex. 72(g)). From Judge Porteous's perspective, at the 
time he set aside Wallace's conviction and signed the bonds on the 
``way out,'' he knew that Louis Marcotte had been interviewed twice by 
the FBI, and had the power to derail his nomination, and, further, that 
this was one of his last opportunities to set bonds for the Marcottes.

E. Judge Porteous's Relationship with Louis Marcotte and Lori Marcotte 
                      While He Was a Federal Judge

1. Overview
    Judge Porteous and the Marcottes continued to maintain a 
relationship after he became a Federal judge. Even though Judge 
Porteous could no longer set bonds for them, the Marcottes 
continued to take Judge Porteous to expensive lunches, assisted 
in having him speak at Bail Bond conventions in Biloxi 
Mississippi (at the Beau Rivage Resort) and in New Orleans at 
the Royal Sonesta Hotel, and took his secretary Rhonda Danos to 
Las Vegas at least twice, to maintain access to Judge Porteous. 
Louis Marcotte explained that because Judge Porteous was a 
Federal judge, he ``brought strength to the table'' on any 
issues for which the Marcottes sought his assistance, 
particularly maintaining and forging new relationships with 
other State judicial officers and business executives.
    In his Task Force Hearing testimony, Louis Marcotte was 
blunt about the prestige that Judge Porteous provided by being 
at the ``table'' with him:

        A. LBecause, number one, he was a Federal judge. Right 
        there, that brings strength to the table whenever he 
        sits down with me.

                              *    *    *

        A. LIt would make people respect me because, you know, 
        I am sitting with a Federal judge.

                              *    *    *

        Q. LSo it is good for you to be sitting with a Federal 
        judge if you are meeting with somebody else, right?

        A. LYes, sir.\367\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \367\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 52. See also Louis Marcotte Dep. 
at 16 (Louis Marcotte maintained a relationship with Judge Porteous 
``[b]ecause whenever I brought Porteous to the table, I brought 
strength. . . . Because other judges respected him and they listened to 
him when he talked.'') (Ex. 68).

    Judge Porteous, while a Federal judge, helped the Marcottes 
meet at least four judicial officers--newly elected Justices of 
the Peace Charles Kerner and Kevin Centanni, and newly elected 
State judges Ronald D. Bodenheimer and Joan Benge. In addition, 
Judge Porteous also went with the Marcottes to meals that were 
also attended by Norman Stotts, the executive for the insurance 
company that underwrote the Marcottes' bonds. In each instance, 
Louis Marcotte's explanation of how Judge Porteous ``brought 
strength'' and helped him with these individuals is 
corroborated by other witnesses and evidence.
2. Maintaining the Marcotte-Porteous Relationship
    Both Louis Marcotte and Lori Marcotte testified that they 
continued to take Judge Porteous to lunches when he was a 
Federal judge--typically with others, and frequently with other 
State judges. Their testimony on this fact is corroborated by 
records that were obtained, including calendars of Bail Bonds 
Unlimited (BBU), noting some of the activities of Louis and 
Lori Marcotte in the 1999-2002 time frame; various credit card 
records of Louis Marcotte, Lori Marcotte, and other BBU 
employees; and several meal checks from the Beef Connection 
going back to August 1997. Thus, as reflected in the following 
table, several meals can be identified as including Judge 
Porteous while he was a Federal judge:\368\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \368\The exhibits supporting the first four dates in the table 
include, for each date, a copy of the meal check from the Beef 
Connection and the pertinent page from Lori Marcotte's American Express 
Card. The meal checks reflect the purchase of ``Abs'' or ``Abso''--
short for ``Absolut''--Judge Porteous's drink of choice. The respective 
exhibits are Ex. 372(a) for August 6, 1997; Ex. 372(b) for August 25, 
1997; Ex. 372(c) for November 19, 1997; and Ex. 372(d) for August 5, 
1998. The exhibits for the last two dates also include the pertinent 
pages from a BBU calendar that contain a reference to Judge Porteous on 
the given date. See Ex. 373(c) (February 1, 2000) and Ex. 373(d) 
(November 7, 2001).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In addition, there are other calendar entries mentioning potential 
lunch appointments with Judge Porteous on other dates for which no 
corresponding or corroborating credit card statements reflecting 
restaurant charges were located. Nonetheless, the very presence of 
Judge Porteous's name in the Marcotte calendars starting in 1999 
reflects an ongoing relationship during the years while he was on the 
Federal bench.


    PBUS Convention at the Beau Rivage--July 1999. In July 
1999, the PBUS held its annual convention at the Beau Rivage 
resort in Biloxi, Mississippi. The Marcottes paid for some of 
the events and entertainment at that convention. Judge 
Porteous's room was paid for by PBUS,\369\ however Danos's room 
was paid for by the Marcottes. Photos taken at that convention 
show Judge Porteous in the company of Louis Marcotte and 
Marcotte employee Norman Bowley, among others, at the cocktail 
reception hosted by BBU.\370\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \369\Judge Porteous's hotel room of $206.00 was paid by PBUS, and 
other food and entertainment for Judge Porteous was provided by PBUS 
and the Marcottes. Judge Porteous did not disclose this reimbursement 
in his Financial Disclosure Report for calendar year 1999. In contrast, 
Judge Porteous did disclose the following comparable events for which 
he was reimbursed: (1) ``Jefferson Bar Association, 4/15/99, Speaker 
CLE Seminar, Biloxi, Mississippi (Hotel);'' (2) ``Louisiana State Bar 
Association, 6/9-6/12/99, Speaker CLE Seminar, Destin Fla. (Hotel, Food 
and Mileage)''; and, (3) ``LSU Trial Advocacy Program, 8/9-8/11/99, 
Faculty Member, Baton Rouge, La (Hotel, Food and Mileage).'' Judge 
Porteous's receipt of hotel accommodations at a gambling location from 
the PBUS arose from his association with the Marcottes, and his failure 
to report the receipt of this reimbursement is consistent with an 
attempt to conceal that relationship.
    \370\The photographs were identified by Lori Marcotte in her 
deposition. See Lori Marcotte Dep. Exs. 23 and 24 (Exs. 223 and 214).

3. Judge Porteous's Assistance to the Marcottes
            a. 1997--Helping with Newly Elected Justice of the Peace 
                    Charlie Kerner
    Charlie Kerner was the Justice of the Peace in Lafitte, a 
city about 30 minutes outside of New Orleans. Both Louis 
Marcotte and Lori Marcotte testified that Judge Porteous helped 
them try to forge a relationship with Justice of the Peace 
Kerner. Louis Marcotte testified that they had Judge Porteous 
attend a lunch with Kerner: ``We sat down at the Beef 
Connection. We ate with Kerner. And then we thought we had a 
good lunch, and, and Kerner had listened to Porteous. And then 
after we called Kerner, he kind of froze up on us.''\371\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \371\Louis Marcotte Dep. at 16-17 (Ex. 68).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Kerner confirmed that on one occasion, when Judge Porteous 
was a Federal judge, he (Kerner) arranged to have lunch with 
Judge Porteous and Danos.\372\ Kerner sought to have lunch with 
Judge Porteous to thank him for having sworn him in as Justice 
of the Peace.\373\ Kerner had ``a lot of respect'' for Judge 
Porteous and was ``honored'' that Judge Porteous had sworn him 
in.\374\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \372\This discussion of events is set forth in Justice of the Peace 
Kerner's deposition.
    \373\The lunch would have been in 1997, Kerner having been elected 
in late 1996.
    \374\Kerner Dep. at 6 (Ex. 79).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On the day of the lunch, Kerner received a call from Danos 
stating that Louis Marcotte, whom Kerner had never met, would 
be joining them and that the Marcottes would pay for lunch. At 
that lunch, in the presence of Judge Porteous and Danos, 
Marcotte spread law books and other materials over the lunch 
table and tried to explain to Kerner the authority that Kerner 
possessed to set bonds to help Marcotte. As Kerner described 
it:

        [H]e [Louis Marcotte] produced some law books to me and 
        had a outline of what he felt as a magistrate and 
        saying setting bonds or whatever would be in my 
        jurisdiction to help him to lower the bonds, you know, 
        so they can help people like that. That's the way he 
        presented it to me.

                              *    *    *

        Well, he wanted me to help him, help them, I guess, if 
        someone say if the bond could be lowered in a margin 
        that would be affordable to them. That's the way I took 
        it.\375\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \375\Kerner Dep. at 9 (Ex. 79).

    Kerner testified that when Louis was giving this 
presentation: ``[I] felt a little uncomfortable. I'll say that. 
I felt a little uncomfortable.''\376\ The respect Kerner felt 
towards Judge Porteous and the honor he felt by Judge 
Porteous's presence affected Kerner's willingness to hear what 
the Marcottes had to say.\377\ After that lunch, Kerner spoke 
to another Justice of the Peace who knew the Marcottes, and 
after that conversation he decided he wanted nothing to do with 
them.\378\

Force testimony described this event in similar terms: ``We had Rhonda 
set up a lunch and had Judge Porteous attend. And we went to the Beef 
Connection and we showed up. My brother had the law book in his hand, 
and we had instructed Judge Porteous to explain about the power of the 
Justice of the Peace being able to set bonds. And he did.'' Lori 
Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 56-57.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            b. 1997--Helping with Newly Elected Justice of the Peace 
                    Kevin Centanni
    Lori Marcotte, in her FBI interviews in 2004\379\ and Task 
Force interviews, stated that Judge Porteous also arranged for 
them to meet newly elected Justice of the Peace Kevin Centanni. 
As with Justice of the Peace Kerner, the Marcottes' efforts to 
cultivate a relationship with Centanni were not successful.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \379\Lori Marcotte FBI Interview, April 21, 2004 at 5 (Ex. 74(d)). 
According to the FBI write-up, Lori Marcotte stated: ``PORTEOUS talked 
to KEVIN CENTANNI, a Justice of the Peace in Jefferson Parish, about 
doing bonds. CENTANNI did a couple of bonds but stopped because he felt 
uncomfortable doing the bonds.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Centanni, when interviewed by the FBI in 2004, recalled a 
meal at the Beef Connection with the Marcottes and other 
judges, at which he ``believed'' Judge Porteous was in 
attendance.\380\ At that lunch, according to the FBI write-up, 
Louis Marcotte gave Centanni information on bond setting and 
bond splitting. ``CENTANNI believed MARCOTTE was trying to 
educate CENTANNI to get CENTANNI to do bonds for MARCOTTE, 
however, CENTANNI rarely set bonds.''\381\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \380\Centanni FBI Interview, July 6, 2004 at 1 (Ex. 69(h)). When 
interviewed by Task Force staff on January 6, 2010, Justice of the 
Peace Centanni stated he did not recall whether Judge Porteous was 
present.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            c. 1999--Helping with Newly Elected State Judge Ronald 
                    Bodenheimer
    In 1999, Judge Porteous took steps to assist the Marcottes 
in forming a relationship with newly elected State Judge Ronald 
Bodenheimer. Shortly after Bodenheimer was elected, Louis 
Marcotte asked Judge Porteous to help the Marcottes form a 
relationship with Bodenheimer. During his Task Force Hearing 
testimony, Louis Marcotte was asked to describe what he asked 
Judge Porteous to do with regard to Bodenheimer. Louis Marcotte 
described his request to Judge Porteous as follows:

        A. LJudge, tell this guy [Bodenheimer] I am a good guy. 
        Tell him that commercial bonds is the best thing for 
        the criminal justice system and that--ask him would he 
        take--ask him would he take your spot when--because you 
        left now and I needed somebody to step in to Porteous's 
        shoes so I can get the same things done that I got done 
        when Porteous was there.

        Q. LDo you know whether or not Judge Porteous spoke to 
        Judge Bodenheimer?

        A. LYes, he did.

        Q. LAnd after he spoke to Judge Bodenheimer, did your 
        relationship with Judge Bodenheimer change as a result?

        A. LYes, it did. Bodenheimer became the Porteous of the 
        24th District Court.\382\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \382\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. at 53. Similarly, when asked what the 
Marcottes requested of Judge Porteous, Lori Marcotte responded: ``The 
same thing that we--that Judge Porteous did with us with the other 
judges, to, to introduce us to him, to get close to him, to--he was 
familiar with bond splitting because he was a D.A., Judge Bodenheimer. 
But just to establish trust and to help us split bonds, to get us to 
help us split bonds.'' Lori Marcotte Dep. at 46 (Ex. 76). She testified 
that Bodenheimer ``took Judge Porteous'[s] place.'' Id. at 47.

    Bodenheimer confirmed Louis Marcotte's testimony. He 
testified in the grand jury: ``I distanced myself from him 
[Marcotte]. Porteous knew it.''\383\ Bodenheimer recalled that 
Judge Porteous told him that he [Judge Porteous] ``knew that I 
didn't really like Louis Marcotte and that group very much but 
they were really--they really weren't as bad as people thought 
they were, that he [Louis Marcotte] was a pretty good 
guy.''\384\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \383\Bodenheimer GJ at 11 (Ex. 89).
    \384\Bodenheimer Dep. at 12 (Ex. 86). See also id. at 13 (Judge 
Porteous told Bodenheimer ``regardless of what preconceived notions I 
might have about them, that [Louis Marcotte] really wasn't a bad guy, 
that he wouldn't steer me wrong, if he tells me something about a 
particular defendant and a bond, I can take it to the bank, he won't 
lie to me.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Bodenheimer had appeared as a prosecutor in front of Judge 
Porteous in State court in the early 1990's and ``looked up'' 
to Judge Porteous. Thus, Judge Porteous's comments about the 
Marcottes were significant to Bodenheimer and affected his 
willingness to form a relationship with the Marcottes. As 
Bodenheimer explained:

        Q. LSo how did the fact that Judge Porteous--how did 
        the fact that you looked up to Judge Porteous 
        influence, influence you in interpreting the comments 
        that Judge Porteous made in your dealings with the 
        Marcottes?

        A. LI had a lot of respect for Judge Porteous. I had a 
        lot of respect for him as a person. I had a lot of 
        respect for him and his rulings. I had been with him 
        for a long time, and I knew he was very, very, just in 
        my opinion, was very, very smart. And if he told me 
        something, I wouldn't question it.

        Q. LSo when he vouched for the Marcottes, that was very 
        significant for you in your willingness to form a 
        relationship with the Marcottes?

        A. LYes.\385\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \385\Bodenheimer Dep. 13-15 (Ex. 86). He testified consistently in 
the Grand jury:

      I distanced myself from [Marcotte]. Porteous knew it. And 
      he [Porteous] says, ``I know you got this bad taste in your 
      mouth for him. I know that you've heard these rumors about 
      him and cocaine.'' He said, ``Let me tell you. It's not 
      true. He's a good guy. You can trust him. If you got 
      problems with bonds go see him. He'll never steer you 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      wrong. He'll never get you hurt.''

Bodenheimer GJ at 11 (Ex. 89).

Over time, Bodenheimer would attend lunches with Louis Marcotte 
and Judge Porteous. Louis Marcotte would pay: ``[I]t would be 
the better restaurants, maybe like the Beef Connection. . . . 
Of course, we did go to Emeril's one time. But mostly it would 
be something like the Beef Connection or a place called the Red 
Maple[.]''\386\

charges arising from his relationship with the Marcottes.\387\

            d. March 2002--Helping with Newly Elected State Judge Joan 
                    Benge
    In 2001, Joan Benge was elected to the State bench. Louis 
Marcotte sought to get to know her and wanted Judge Porteous to 
be at a March 2002 lunch at ``Emeril's'' that included himself, 
Judge Benge and others.\388\ As Louis Marcotte testified:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \388\Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 53-54.

        A. LWell, Benge was a new judge. And basically what we 
        tried to do was rally a bunch of judges to have lunch 
        with Porteous, and he could tell them how great the 
        bail bond business is and how, how. . . .

                              *    *    *

        Q. LAnd did you want Judge Porteous to be there 
        because----

        A. LYes, I did. Because I wanted to show strength. He's 
        a Federal judge, and when he--if he spoke, then they 
        would listen.\389\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \389\Louis Marcotte Dep. at 18-19 (Ex. 68).

    As described by Bodenheimer, Louis Marcotte arranged the 
lunch and told him that he wanted to have Judge Benge present 
because ``he didn't really know her that well and he wanted to 
get to meet her.'' He also knew that Judge Benge, who had been 
a prosecutor in the 24th JDC, ``respected him [Judge Porteous] 
as much as I did.''\390\ As it turned out, Judge Porteous 
arrived late for the meal, and only had drinks.\391\ The 
Emeril's credit card receipt and meal check for $414 has been 
obtained. Louis Marcotte paid for this lunch with his American 
Express card. The FBI surveilled and videotaped this March 2002 
lunch, at which Judge Porteous, Louis Marcotte, Bodenheimer and 
Judge Benge (as well as BBU staff and Judge Benge's secretary) 
were in attendance.\392\

            e. Meals with Insurance Company Representative Norman 
                    Stotts
    The Marcottes' bonds were underwritten by an insurance 
company called ``Amwest.'' As Louis Marcotte described, the 
Marcottes were in essence insurance agents for Amwest and bail 
bonds were, in essence, insurance policies that would pay the 
court if a defendant did not show up as required.\393\ Amwest 
would receive from the Marcottes a portion of the premiums. As 
the Marcottes were, in substance, selling Amwest insurance 
policies, Amwest had a vital interest in the Marcottes' 
profitability and business practices and could, for example, 
limit the dollar amount of bonds they could write.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \393\``A bail bondsman is no more than a State Farm agent. We are 
licensed through the Commission of Insurance. We carry a property and 
casualty license. And the insurance company supplies us with policies 
that we can post at the jail so we can get defendants out. It is not 
real money; it is just a policy. If the defendant doesn't show up in 
court, then the courts cash the policy.'' Louis Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 
42.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On a regular basis, Amwest would send a high level company 
official, Norman Stotts, to meet with the Marcottes. Louis and 
Lori would take him out to lunch and include Judge Porteous. As 
Louis described: ``It makes me look good with the insurance 
company. It gives me more writing authority to write big bonds, 
you know. It just showed strength in my organization by having 
a Federal judge sitting with me at the table.''\394\

    F. The Wrinkled Robe Investigation and the Prosecution of Louis 
          Marcotte, Lori Marcotte, and Louisiana State Judges

    In 1999, the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Eastern District of Louisiana commenced a broad investigation 
of Louis Marcotte's corrupt relationship with Louisiana State 
judges and other State law enforcement officials. The FBI 
labeled this investigation ``Wrinkled Robe.'' In August 2001, 
the FBI sought and obtained wiretaps, and in June 2002, the FBI 
executed a search warrant at the Marcottes' offices.
    The results of the investigation included the convictions 
of Louis Marcotte and Lori Marcotte for their actions in giving 
things of value to State judges and other State law enforcement 
officials (such as jail employees) who helped them in their 
bail bonds business. Two State judges (Bodenheimer and Green) 
and other State law enforcement officials were also convicted 
on Federal corruption charges arising from their relationships 
with the Marcottes. By any reasonable interpretation of the 
evidence, Judge Porteous's conduct was indistinguishable (if 
not more extensive) from the conduct of the other two State 
judges who were convicted.
1. Bodenheimer's Guilty Plea
    Bodenheimer pleaded guilty in March 2003 to conspiracy to 
commit mail fraud on a ``deprivation of honest services'' 
theory. (This was prior to the Marcottes' guilty pleas.) Among 
the overt acts charged in the Information were that he:

        regularly set, reduced, and split bonds underwritten by 
        a Jefferson Parish bail bonding company in criminal 
        cases pending before him and other judges, irrespective 
        of whether he was scheduled for ``magistrate duty.''  . 
        . . BODENHEIMER routinely set the bonds at a level 
        requested by the bail bonding company in a manner which 
        would tend to maximize the company's profits; that is, 
        by securing the maximum amount of premium money 
        available from the criminal defendant and his 
        family.\397\

    \397\Superseding Bill of Information for . . . Conspiracy to Commit 
Mail Fraud, United States v. Ronald D. Bodenheimer, Crim. No. 02-219 
(E.D. La.), Mar. 31, 2003, at 3 (Ex. 88(d)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  It is of no consequence that the judge--be it Bodenheimer or Judge 
Porteous--may have taken the same discretionary acts in setting, 
splitting, or reducing bonds or setting aside convictions even without 
accepting the financial inducements from the Marcottes to do so. A 
judge has significant discretion to exercise as he or she deems fit--
just not in exchange for things of value. In this regard, the Committee 
notes by way of reference that the Federal courts have reached the same 
understanding in interpreting the bribery laws. Public officials 
accused of taking bribes have occasionally attempted to defend their 
conduct, or claim a lack of corrupt intent, on the grounds that they 
would have taken the same act or reached the same decision anyway, or 
that the official acts alleged to have been committed for things of 
value were affirmatively ``good'' for the community.
  One Federal circuit court addressed and rejected these arguments as 
follows: ``It is neither material nor a defense to bribery that `had 
there been no bribe, the (public official) might, on the available 
data, lawfully and properly have made the very recommendation that (the 
briber) wanted him to make.''' United States v. Janotti, 673 F.2d 578, 
601 (3d Cir. 1982) (citing United States v. Labovitz, 251 F.2d 393, 394 
(3d Cir. 1958)). In Labovitz, the court explained: ``It is a major 
concern of organized society that the community have the benefit of 
objective evaluation and unbiased judgment on the part of those who 
participate in the making of official decisions. Therefore, society 
deals sternly with bribery which would substitute the will of an 
interested person for the judgment of a public official as the 
controlling factor in official decision.'' United States v. Labovitz, 
251 F.2d at 394.
  The standard Federal criminal jury instruction on this topic tracks 
the above cases, and provides: ``It is not a defense to the crime of 
bribery as charged in Count of the indictment that the [offer] [or] 
[promise] [demand] [or] [receipt] of anything of value was made [to] 
[by] the public official to influence an official act which is actually 
lawful, desirable, or even beneficial to the public.'' O'Malley, Grenig 
& Lee, 2 Fed. Jury Prac. & Instr. Sec. 27:11 (6th ed.). See also United 
States v. Dorri, 15 F.3d 888, 890 (9th Cir. 1994) (same).

    The sorts of things Judge Bodenheimer received from the 
Marcottes were similar to those things that the Marcottes gave 
to Judge Porteous. Louis Marcotte, according to Bodenheimer, 
``worked on my house,'' ``took us on fishing trips,'' and 
``took us to the Beau Rivage [casino] to a show.''\398\ The 
factual proffer signed by Bodenheimer stated that he 
``enriched[ed] himself by setting, reducing, and splitting 
bonds in various criminal matters pending before him as well as 
other judges on terms most advantageous to the bail bonding 
company in exchange for things of value, including meals, trips 
to resorts, campaign contributions, home improvements, and 
other things of value.''\399\

2. Louis Marcotte Affidavit
    On April 17, 2003, 2 months after a New Orleans Times-
Picayune article publicly linked Judge Porteous to accepting 
things of value from Louis Marcotte as a State judge,\401\ and 
1 month after Bodenheimer pleaded guilty, Louis Marcotte signed 
an affidavit designed to protect Judge Porteous.\402\ That 
affidavit stated, in pertinent part:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \401\M. Carr and M. Torres, ``Judges Were Given Gifts; Marcotte's 
Ex-workers Tell of Shrimp, Fence,'' New Orleans Times-Picayune, Feb. 8, 
2003 (part of the Metropolitan Crime Commission Documents, MCC 0199-200 
(Ex. 85), and separately marked as Ex. 119(e)). Judge Porteous is 
identified by name in that article which states:

      The former employees claim Marcotte paid for car repairs 
      and built a fence for former 24th Judicial District Judge 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Thomas Porteous, who now sits on the Federal bench[.]

Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \402\Louis Marcotte Dep. Ex. 80 (Ex. 280).

        At no time have I ever given money or anything of value 
        to Judge Porteous for reducing or altering any 
        bond.\403\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \403\Marcotte Dep. Ex. 80 (Ex. 280).

Louis Marcotte testified in his deposition that the statement 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
was ``not accurate.''

        Q. LOkay. And would you describe whether or not that 
        statement is accurate or not?

        A. LIt's not accurate.

                              *    *    *

        A. LI gave him meals, trips, car repairs, radios.

        Q. LAnd why did you do all that?

        A. LI wanted him to help me with the bonds.\404\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \404\Louis Marcotte Dep. at 23-24 (Ex. 68).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In his deposition, Louis Marcotte testified he felt 
uncomfortable signing the affidavit, and ``thought my lawyer 
was protecting Porteous and not me.''\405\ Nonetheless, just as 
he did in 1994 in connection with the FBI background check, 
Louis Marcotte made statements intended and designed to protect 
Judge Porteous and to insulate him from investigation, scrutiny 
and the disclosure of the relationship between the two 
men.\406\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \405\Louis Marcotte Dep. at 23 (Ex. 68).
    \406\Though the statement may be parsed as ``literally true'' if 
read as a denial that Judge Porteous and Louis Marcotte had a specific 
conversation where Louis Marcotte agreed to give a specific thing of 
value to Judge Porteous in exchange for a specific official act, the 
sweeping nature of the denial is misleading, if not outright false, in 
that it conceals the numerous things of value that Louis Marcotte gave 
Judge Porteous and the numerous official acts of Judge Porteous that 
benefitted Louis Marcotte in return.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Louis Marcotte's and Lori Marcotte's Guilty Pleas
    In March 2004, both Louis Marcotte and Lori Marcotte 
pleaded guilty to an Information charging Federal corruption 
offenses. Louis Marcotte pleaded guilty to Racketeering 
Conspiracy. That conspiracy was alleged to have commenced prior 
to 1991.\407\ The temporal scope of the scheme is consistent 
with the allegations in the FBI wiretap affidavit that 
generally described the inception of the corrupt relationship 
between Marcotte and judges in the 24th JDC as beginning with 
their relationship with Judge Porteous. Similarly, the 
Information's elaboration of the acts of the judicial 
conspirators describes the actions of Judge Porteous.\408\ The 
Information described the racketeering conspiracy, in pertinent 
part, as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \407\Bill of Information for Conspiracy to Operate an Enterprise 
through a Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Conspiracy to Commit 
Mail Fraud, United States v. Louis M. Marcotte, III, and Lori M. 
Marcotte, Crim. No. 04-061 (E.D. La.), Mar. 3, 2004, at 4 (Ex. 71(a)).
    \408\DOJ policy generally prohibits publicly identifying uncharged 
conspirators unless they have otherwise been publicly identified. Thus, 
though Bodenheimer's name could be included in the Marcotte Information 
as a named conspirator because he had previously pleaded guilty to a 
corrupt relationship with the Marcottes, the prosecutors would not have 
identified Judge Porteous in the Marcotte Information as he had not 
been publicly accused.

        3. LIt was a further part of the conspiracy that, in 
        return for things of value, certain judges would make 
        themselves available to BBU; quickly respond to the 
        requests of BBU; and set, reduce, increase, and split 
        bonds to maximize BBU's profits, minimize BBU's 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        liability, and hinder BBU's competition.

        4. LIt was a further part of the conspiracy that, to 
        allow BBU to maximize profits, the conspirator judges 
        would engage in the practice of ``bond splitting.''  . 
        . . At BBU's request, the conspirator judge would set 
        the commercial portion of the bond at an amount the 
        defendant could afford and would set the balance in 
        some other manner. BBU would then post the commercial 
        portion of the bond and collect a percentage of that 
        bond as commission. This practice allowed BBU to 
        maximize its profit and minimize its liability.\409\

Marcotte, Crim. No. 04-061 (E.D. La.), Mar. 3, 2004, at 5 (Ex. 71(a)).

    Bodenheimer, who had already pleaded guilty to having a 
corrupt relationship with the Marcottes, was specifically 
identified in the Louis Marcotte Information as one of the 
judges with whom Marcotte had a corrupt relationship. That 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
relationship was described as follows:

        Beginning at a date unknown and continuing until in or 
        about June 2002, LOUIS M. MARCOTTE, III provided 
        Bodenheimer with gifts, meals, and other things of 
        value. In return, Bodenheimer was available to BBU; 
        quickly responded to the requests of BBU; and set, 
        reduced, increased, and split bonds to maximize BBU's 
        profits, minimize BBU's liability, and hinder BBU's 
        competition.\410\

Marcotte, Crim. No. 04-061 (E.D. La.), Mar. 3, 2004, at 6 (Ex. 71(a)).

The things of value included: Louis Marcotte's hiring 
Bodenheimer's daughter, paying for meals and paying for hotel 
rooms. The Louis Marcotte Information further specified that 
during the course of that corrupt relationship, Bodenheimer set 
and split hundreds of bonds.\411\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \411\If ``Porteous'' were to be substituted for ``Bodenheimer''--in 
the above paragraph, the charging language would aptly describe the 
nature of Louis Marcotte's relationship with Judge Porteous as 
established by the evidence.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Lori Marcotte pleaded guilty at the same time as Louis 
Marcotte to conspiracy to commit mail fraud, that is, ``to 
deprive the citizens of the State of Louisiana of the honest 
and faithful services, performed free from deceit, bias, self-
dealing, and concealment, of certain Jefferson Parish Sheriff's 
Deputies in the performance of their official duties.''\412\

4. Judge Alan Green's Conviction
    Judge Alan Green was indicted September 29, 2004, along 
with Marcotte employee Norman Bowley, on several charges 
arising from Judge Green's corrupt relationship with the 
Marcottes.\415\ The conspiracy to commit mail fraud (honest 
services fraud) count (Count Two) with which Green was charged 
described the scheme in terms that again track the Marcottes' 
relationship with Judge Porteous (as well as Judge 
Bodenheimer):

Crim. No. 04-295 (E.D. La.), Sept. 29, 2004 (Ex. 93(a)).

        2. LIt was part of the scheme and artifice to defraud 
        that the defendant, NORMAN BOWLEY, the defendant, ALAN 
        GREEN, along with Louis Marcotte, Lori Marcotte, and 
        others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, engaged in 
        a scheme to maximize BBU's and the Marcottes' profits 
        from writing bail bonds in Jefferson Parish and 
        elsewhere through the corruption of the defendant, ALAN 
        GREEN.

                              *    *    *

        4. LIt was a further part of the scheme and artifice to 
        defraud that, in return for things of value, ALAN GREEN 
        would make himself available to BBU; quickly respond to 
        the requests of BBU; and set, reduce, increase, and 
        split bonds to maximize BBU's profits, minimize BBU's 
        liability, and hinder BBU's competition.

        5. LIt was a further part of the conspiracy that, to 
        allow BBU to maximize its profits, the defendant, ALAN 
        GREEN, would engage in the practice of ``bond 
        splitting.'' . . . At BBU's request, GREEN would set 
        the commercial portion of the bond at an amount the 
        defendant could afford and would set the balance in 
        some other manner. BBU would then post the commercial 
        portion of the bond and collect a percentage of that 
        bond as commission. This practice allowed BBU to 
        maximize it profits and minimize its liability.\416\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \416\Id. at 18-19. The charging language in the Green case is 
similar in essential aspects to a description of the Marcottes' 
relationship with Judge Porteous.

    On June 29, 2005, the jury found Green guilty of Count 
Three of the Indictment, charging him with a single substantive 
count of mail fraud. The jury did not reach a verdict on the 
conspiracy count. However, Count Three incorporated by 
reference the description of the scheme set forth above.
    Judge Green was sentenced on February 9, 2006, to 51 months 
incarceration, to be followed by 3 years of supervised 
release.\417\

               G. The Marcottes' Relationship with Danos

    As alluded to at various points above, the Marcottes 
maintained a relationship with Judge Porteous's secretary, 
Rhonda Danos, over the same time period that they maintained a 
relationship with Judge Porteous. As Lori Marcotte testified:

          She [Danos] could call [Judge Porteous] if he wasn't 
        in the office. She could get him off of the bench. . . 
        . Also she could call the jail, call in the bonds for 
        us and call to get information on the case itself. So 
        when Judge Porteous was off the bench, he could split 
        or set the bond fast.\418\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \418\Lori Marcotte Dep. at 28 (Ex. 76).

    Thus, the Marcottes included her in the lunches with Judge 
Porteous, paid for numerous expensive entertainment events, and 
took her to Las Vegas four or five times, some of which took 
place after Judge Porteous became a Federal judge.\419\ Danos 
has also testified that ``[i]t may have been four [trips to Las 
Vegas]''\420\ and that the Marcottes took her to two 
``Siegfried and Roy'' shows on those trips.\421\ Notably, Lori 
Marcotte testified she did not know Danos well prior to 
inviting her the first time,\422\ and she explicitly linked 
providing these trips with the fact that Danos had been so good 
to them.\423\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \419\There is ample corroboration for these trips: (1) Lori 
Marcotte testified she took Danos to Las Vegas in 1992 and that on that 
trip they took an airplane trip over the Grand Canyon. Lori Marcotte 
identified a ``certificate'' that she was given by the tour company for 
that Grand Canyon trip dated February 1992. Danos also recalled that 
trip and the Grand Canyon flight. (2) Louis Marcotte's credit card 
records reflect that he purchased for Danos a February 1996 flight to 
Las Vegas, and Golden Nugget Casino hotel records reflect a room for 
Danos charged to the Marcottes' office address. Danos also recalled a 
trip paid by the Marcottes at which she stayed at the Golden Nugget. 
(3) Lori Marcotte's credit card records reflect her purchase for Danos 
of a February 1998 flight to Las Vegas. On that trip, the Marcottes 
stayed at the Luxor Hotel, and Danos shared a room with a Marcotte 
employee. See, e.g., Lori Marcotte Dep. at 28-29 (Ex. 76); Danos Dep. I 
at 13-14 (identifying various trips to Las Vegas); Lori Marcotte Dep. 
Ex. 1 (the Grand Canyon flight certificate) (Ex. 201); Ex. 371 
(containing, among other records, Louis Marcotte's credit card 
statement containing charges for air travel purchased for Danos for a 
trip to Las Vegas in 1996 and the Golden Nugget Casino room statement 
for Danos for February 1996 (charged to the BBU address)).
    \420\Danos Dep. I at 8 (Ex. 46).
    \421\Danos Dep. I at 12 (Ex. 46).
    \422\When asked how it came about that she took Danos to Las Vegas, 
Lori Marcotte testified: ``Well, we would go to Judge Porteous's office 
to get bonds set or split, and I started speaking to her at the desk 
and asked her to come to Las Vegas. We were having a bail bond 
convention, and we asked her to come along.'' Lori Marcotte TF Hrg. III 
at 55-56.
    \423\Lori Marcotte TF Hrg. III at 56.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To the extent that Judge Porteous would have understood 
that the Marcottes gave things of value to Danos because of 
official acts performed (or to be performed) by her, then his 
tolerance of those activities would have, in substance, been 
the condoning of a relationship based on the Marcottes' 
provision and Danos's acceptance of a stream of illegal 
gratuities.\424\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \424\Although Danos testified she believed the things of value were 
solely because of a friendship, she would have known that Lori Marcotte 
brought jail personnel along on at least one Las Vegas trip that Danos 
attended. Notably, one of the jail employees, Edward Still, pleaded 
guilty to Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud. The Information charged that 
Still and others, including Louis Marcotte and Lori Marcotte, conspired 
to defraud the citizens of Louisiana of their right to the honest 
services of Still (and other Sheriff's Deputies who worked in the 
jail). See Bill of Information for Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud, 
United States v. Forges et al [including Edward Still], Crim. No. 04-
217 (E.D. La., July 21, 2004) (Ex. 95(a)). Among the overt acts in that 
Information were: ``In or about February 1993, Louis Marcotte and Lori 
Marcotte paid for the defendant, Edward Still, to take an expense-paid 
trip to Las Vegas, Nevada.'' Id. at 4. Still admitted this event in the 
``Factual Basis,'' filed in court, to support his guilty plea. See 
Factual Basis at 3, United States v. Still, Crim. No. 04-217 (E.D. La., 
Sept. 1, 2004) (Ex. 97(b)). Still pleaded guilty September 1, 2004, and 
received a sentence of probation. See Judgment in a Criminal Case, 
United States v. Still, Crim. No. 04-217 (E.D. La., Feb. 2, 2005) (Ex. 
97(c)).

X. THE FACTS UNDERLYING ARTICLE III--JUDGE PORTEOUS'S FALSE STATEMENTS 
   AND VIOLATION OF THE COURT ORDER IN CONNECTION WITH HIS PERSONAL 
                               BANKRUPTCY

                              A. Overview

    Judge Porteous's conduct surrounding his bankruptcy case 
was characterized by numerous false statements and material 
omissions on the official forms that he signed under penalty of 
perjury that were filed with the court. He also violated a 
court order by incurring gambling debt and other indebtedness. 
These acts included filing for bankruptcy under a false name 
(and with a PO Box rather than his actual residence address) to 
conceal his identity, and failing to disclose an anticipated 
substantial tax refund. In addition, Judge Porteous made 
numerous other false or deceptive statements about his income, 
liabilities, and financial activities in order to conceal his 
prior and ongoing gambling activity. As a result, his unsecured 
creditors (predominantly credit card companies) received a 
fraction of what he owed them, while, at the same time, (1) 
every casino that had ever extended credit to Judge Porteous 
was paid in full, and (2) the casinos continued to extend to 
Judge Porteous lines of credit which he utilized even while in 
bankruptcy.
    The evidence related to Judge Porteous's dealings with 
Creely, Amato, other attorneys, and the Marcottes demonstrates 
that Judge Porteous experienced financial difficulties 
throughout the 1990's. He solicited money from friends; 
accepted hundreds of meals and payments towards travel and 
entertainment with no pretense that he would reciprocate; drove 
vehicles in ``deplorable'' condition; and depended on others 
for home and car repairs. Judge Porteous even asked Gardner to 
give him money on one occasion so he could buy a Christmas 
present for his wife. Many of these requests and acceptances of 
meals and money occurred while on gambling trips at locations 
such as Las Vegas or casinos in Mississippi.
    The extent of Judge Porteous's deteriorating financial 
condition in the late 1990's is reflected in his financial 
records. These reveal extensive gambling expenses and credit 
card debts that increased dramatically in the late 1990's and 
amounted to approximately $180,000 by the end of 2000.
    For years, Judge Porteous concealed the extent of these 
liabilities. He annually filed false financial disclosure 
reports with the Judicial Conference that materially 
understated his credit card liabilities.
    Ultimately, on March 28, 2001, Judge Porteous and his wife 
Carmella filed for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy 
Code.

            B. Judge Porteous's Financial Affairs Prior to 
                         Filing for Bankruptcy

1. Causes of His Debt
    By the time Judge Porteous took the Federal bench in 
October 1994, he had a history of gambling and was an 
``established player''\425\ at the Grand Casino Gulfport in 
Gulfport, Mississippi. As an established player, Judge Porteous 
held a $2,000 line of credit at the Grand Casino Gulfport, 
which allowed him to take out $2,000 worth of markers at the 
casino.\426\ After becoming a Federal judge, and prior to 
filing for bankruptcy in March 2001, Judge Porteous became an 
established player and opened up lines of credit at seven more 
casinos.\427\ His credit limits ranged from $2,000 to $5,000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \425\An ``established player'' or ``rated player'' at a casino is a 
player who has filled out a credit application with the casino in order 
to open up a line of credit. Established players are thereafter able to 
draw on their line of credit at the casino to gamble and are also 
provided with ``comps'' from the casinos, in the form of complimentary 
or reduced rates on hotel rooms and free meals and drinks. As FBI 
Special Agent Horner explained, there are two reasons why a gambler 
would want to be rated: ``One for tax purposes, for wins and losses, 
because they have to report their winnings and losings. Number two, a 
gamer or gambler would want their gaming activity rated--they call it 
rated play--because the casino will then give the customer food and 
room specials. They will give them free shows if they play enough. They 
will even give them free transportation to the casino. There is a term

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An analysis of Judge Porteous's credit card and bank 
account records, performed by the FBI, revealed that from 1995 
through 2000--while he was a Federal judge--over $130,000 in 
gambling charges appeared on his credit card statements:


        1995          $  9,545.08
        1996          $ 22,927.48
        1997          $ 32,927.48
        1998          $ 16,056.84
        1999          $ 40,825.62
        2000          $  8,908.90
                      ------------
        Total
                      $131,191.40\428\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \428\FBI Credit Card Chart (Ex. 348). At the Fifth Circuit Hearing, 
FBI Financial Analyst Gerald Fink testified that the gambling charges 
on Judge Porteous's credit cards were $66,051 in gaming charges. Fink 
5th Cir. Hrg. at 345-48 (Ex. 332). These same dollar amounts were 
presented at the Task Force Hearing. A subsequent review has revealed 
that the chart of credit card gambling expenses used at the Fifth 
Circuit and the Task Force Hearing failed to include several of Judge 
Porteous's credit cards, and that the actual amount of credit card 
gambling charges is substantially greater. Agent Horner, at the Task 
Force Hearing, testified that the chart he identified, Exhibit 327, 
``doesn't include everything. There is probably some additional credit 
card charges that were not included in this time period, and there may 
be some additional withdrawals out of his bank account that were not 
included.'' Horner TF Hrg. II at 9. An updated chart, Exhibit 348, 
supplements the chart (Exhibit 327) that was used at the Task Force 
Hearing.

    Additionally, between January 1997 and June 2000, Judge 
Porteous wrote checks or made cash withdrawals from his bank 
accounts at casinos totaling at least $27,739.\429\ Thus, Judge 
Porteous had incurred at least $150,000 in gambling charges and 
related gaming withdrawals in the 5 years preceding his 
bankruptcy filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \429\The June 2000 date was chosen for the purposes of the Fifth 
Circuit Hearing because that was the first time Judge Porteous met with 
his bankruptcy attorney, Claude Lightfoot.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Judge Porteous's Financial Condition from 1996 to 2000
    From 1996 to 2000, Judge Porteous's financial situation 
grew increasingly dire, as follows:
    Year-end 1996--Credit card debt in excess of $44,826; IRA 
Balance of $59,000. In December 1996--a date as of which nearly 
all the known credit card records of Judge Porteous were 
obtained--Judge Porteous had about $45,000 in outstanding 
credit card debt and an IRA balance of about $59,000. (He had 
no stocks or bonds or other significant savings or assets other 
than modest equity in his house.)
    June of 1997--Credit card debt of $69,000; IRA balance of 
$20,000. During the first 6 months of 1997, Judge Porteous's 
financial situation deteriorated significantly. During that 
period, he made three withdrawals from his IRA account 
amounting to $40,000, resulting in his IRA balance falling to 
approximately $20,000. His credit card debt increased to 
$69,000.
    June of 1999--Credit card debt of $103,000; IRA balance of 
$9,500. Judge Porteous took additional withdrawals from his IRA 
in April 1998 and January 1999. By June 1999 (when Judge 
Porteous sought money from Amato on the boat),\430\ Judge 
Porteous's credit card debt had increased to approximately 
$103,000, while his IRA balance had fallen to approximately 
$9,500.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \430\See discussion in VIII(I)(3), supra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    April 2000--Credit card debt of $153,000; IRA balance of 
$12,000. In September 1999, Judge Porteous withdrew another 
$1,600 from his IRA (his balance was as low as $7,700 on 
September 30, 1999, but the value grew over the next several 
months as the value of his securities in that account 
increased), but his credit card debt had increased to more than 
$150,000.
3. Judge Porteous's False Statements Concealing Liabilities on 
        Financial Disclosure Reports
    On an annual basis, starting with calendar year 1994, Judge 
Porteous was required by law to file Financial Disclosure 
Reports with the Judicial Conference of the United States.
    Part VI of the Financial Disclosure Report required Judge 
Porteous to report liabilities by means of a letter code, the 
pertinent categories being ``J'' for liabilities of $15,000 or 
less, and ``K'' for amounts between $15,001 and $50,000. The 
filer is required to list all liabilities to credit card 
companies where the balance exceeded $10,000 at the close of 
the calendar year for which the Report was filed.\431\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \431\Under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Federal judges are 
required by law to file annual public reports with the Judicial 
Conference disclosing certain personal financial information. See 5 
U.S.C. app. Sec. Sec. 101(a), 101(b), and 101(f)(11)-(12). Public 
financial disclosure was intended ``to deter conflicts of interests 
from arising,'' to ``deter some persons who should not be entering 
public service from doing so,'' and to subject a judge's financial 
circumstances to ``public scrutiny.'' ``By having access to financial 
disclosure statements, an interested citizen can evaluate the 
official's performance of his duties in light of the official's outside 
financial interests.'' See S. Rpt. 95-170, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 21-22 
(1977), Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Report to Accompany 
S. 555, ``Public Officials Integrity Act of 1977.'' (This Act took the 
name ``Ethics in Government Act'' in its final form.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  These disclosure requirements were upheld by the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Duplantier v. United States, 606 
F.2d 654 (5th Cir. 1979). In that case, the Fifth Circuit explained:

      While nomination and confirmation procedures no doubt weed 
      out certain persons who should not serve as Federal judges, 
      they do nothing to scrutinize the behavior of judges once 
      confirmed. Congress could legitimately conclude that the 
      statutory controls mandated by the Act would further the 
      interest of judicial integrity.
        By alerting litigants and the public of a judge's 
      financial interest, the financial disclosure provisions of 
      the Act can serve as a check on potential judicial abuse.

Id. at 701. Individuals who have made false statements on Financial 
Disclosure Reports have been subject to prosecution under the Federal 
criminal laws as a violation of title 18, United States Code, Section 
1001 (False and Fraudulent Statements).
    Table 6 sets forth the credit card liabilities that Judge 
Porteous actually disclosed as compared with the credit card 
debts he actually incurred and failed to disclose on his 
Financial Disclosure Reports for calendar years 1996 through 
2000.\432\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \432\Danos testified that Judge Porteous prepared the forms, 
including specifying the codes to be used, and she simply typed the 
forms for him using the information he provided. Danos Dep. II at 4-5 
(Ex. 47).

      Judge Porteous's Financial Disclosure Reports are marked as 
      exhibits as follows: Ex. 102(a) (Financial Disclosure 
      Report for 1996); Ex. 103(a) (Report for 1997); Ex. 104(a) 
      (Report for 1998); Ex. 105(a) (Report for 1999), and Ex. 
      106(a) (Report for 2000). The various credit card 
      statements for December of the respective calendar years 
      containing balances that should have been reported are 
      marked as follows: Ex. 167 (statement for Citibank account 
      0426 (December 12, 1996)); Ex. 168 (statements for MBNA 
      accounts 0877 (December 19, 1997) and 1290 (December 4, 
      1997), and Travelers account 0642 (December 30, 1997)); Ex. 
      169 (statements for MBNA accounts 0877 (December 19, 1998) 
      and 1290 (December 4, 1998)); Ex. 170 (statements for 
      Citibank accounts 0426 (December 10, 1999) and 9138 
      ((December 21, 1999), MBNA accounts 0877 (December 18, 
      1999) and 1290 (December 4, 1999)); Ex. 171 (statements for 
      MBNA accounts 0877 (December 20, 2000) and 1290 (December 
      5, 2000), Citibank accounts 0426 (December 12, 2000) and 
      9138 (December 21, 2000), Travelers Bank account 0642 
      (December 29, 2000), and Discover account 9489 in the name 
      of Carmella G. Porteous (December 25, 2000)).
      
      
    The reports were signed by Judge Porteous on a signature 
line directly below the following certification:

          I certify that all information given above (including 
        information pertaining to my spouse and minor or 
        dependent children, if any) is accurate, true, and 
        complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and 
        that any information not reported was withheld because 
        it met applicable statutory provisions permitting non-
        disclosure.

Below Judge Porteous's signature is the following additional 
warning in capital letters:

        NOTE: ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO KNOWINGLY AND WILFULLY 
        FALSIFIES OR FAILS TO FILE THIS REPORT MAY BE SUBJECT 
        TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS\433\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \433\Judge Porteous's Financial Disclosure Report (for calendar 
year 1998), filed May 13, 1999 (Ex. 105(a)). That warning cites 5 
U.S.C. App. 4, Sec. 104 which provides, in part, that the Attorney 
General may bring civil penalty enforcement actions (seeking damages 
not to exceed $10,000), against persons who knowingly and willfully 
falsify a financial disclosure report. Even though the report does not 
cite to the criminal laws, Judge Porteous would have known that a false 
statement would also violate Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001 
(False Statements) which makes it a crime for an individual ``in any 
matter within the jurisdiction of the . . . judicial branch'' to make a 
``materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or 
representation,'' or make or use ``any false writing or document 
knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent statement or entry.''

    Thus, for several years prior to filing for bankruptcy, 
Judge Porteous concealed his financial circumstances on 
documents where he was legally required to disclose them.

                 C. The Pre-bankruptcy Workout Period--
                    July 2000 Through February 2001

    In the summer of 2000, Judge Porteous retained attorney 
Claude Lightfoot as his bankruptcy counsel. Lightfoot had never 
met Judge Porteous prior to representing him.\434\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \434\Lightfoot GJ I at 22 (Ex. 120). Lightfoot testified three 
times before the grand jury: August 19, 2004 (Lightfoot GJ I), 
September 9, 2004 (Lightfoot GJ II), and November 4, 2004 (Lightfoot GJ 
III).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Lightfoot spent ``considerable time'' with Judge Porteous 
and his wife in July and August 2000,\435\ working to compile 
documentation on their assets and debts and to develop a 
workout proposal for the creditors in an effort to avoid a 
bankruptcy filing.\436\ Lightfoot also told Judge Porteous not 
to incur any new debts and provided Judge Porteous general 
information describing Chapter 13 bankruptcies.\437\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \435\In August 2000, even as Judge Porteous was consulting with 
Lightfoot for the purpose of attempting a workout of his debts, he 
requested a credit limit increase at the Treasure Chest Casino from 
$2,500 to $3,000. See Porteous Central Credit Inc. Gaming Report (Ex. 
326). Judge Porteous did not disclose this fact to Lightfoot.
    \436\Lightfoot Affidavit in Support of Attorney's Fees at 1, Docket 
No. 18, In the Matter of Porteous, Case No. 01-12363, (Bankr. E.D. La.) 
(hereinafter ``Lightfoot Affidavit and Invoice'') (Ex. 342). During the 
workout process, Lightfoot analyzed Judge Porteous's assets and debts 
and came up with a plan to offer at least a partial payment to Judge 
Porteous's creditors for all of Judge Porteous's credit card debt of 
which Lightfoot was aware. Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 87.
    \437\Lightfoot Dep. at 14-15 (Ex. 123); Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 42.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    During the early months of his engagement with Judge 
Porteous, Lightfoot gave Judge Porteous worksheets to fill 
out.\438\ Lightfoot specifically explained to Judge Porteous 
that he needed to disclose all of his assets and all of his 
debts.\439\ Lightfoot believed that the worksheets may have 
been filled out before he met with Judge Porteous on July 20, 
2000, and that Judge Porteous personally filled out the 
worksheets because, for example, only Judge Porteous's Social 
Security number was initially filled in on the worksheets, and 
not Mrs. Porteous's.\440\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \438\Lightfoot Dep. at 3 (Ex. 123). Lightfoot's worksheets 
contained ``every single question that appears in the petition, the 
schedules and the statements and the Chapter 13 plan. . . . [I]t 
contains everything that would ultimately be contained in a bankruptcy 
filing.'' Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 42.
    \439\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 42.
    \440\Lightfoot GJ III at 36-37 (Ex. 122).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Porteous also provided Lightfoot with a ``big pile of 
invoices,'' bills, and credit card statements.\441\ Included 
among these documents was Judge Porteous's pay stub from the 
period ending May 31, 2000, which showed Judge Porteous's net 
monthly income to be $7,531.52.\442\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \441\Lightfoot GJ I at 39 (Ex. 120).
    \442\Judge Porteous never provided Lightfoot with an updated pay 
stub closer to the date of the bankruptcy filing in March 2001, nor did 
he provide any other information indicating that his salary increased 
in 2001. Lightfoot Dep. at 4 (Ex. 123).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Lightfoot spent considerable time preparing an analysis of 
Judge Porteous's debts and collecting all relevant documents 
that creditors would need to review when considering whether 
the workout proposal was a fair settlement.\443\ Finally, on 
December 21, 2000, Lightfoot sent Judge Porteous a copy of the 
workout letters that had been sent to all of Judge Porteous's 
unsecured creditors, ``with the exception of [a $5,000 loan 
from] Regions Bank which we wanted to exclude.\444\'' The 
workout letters listed thirteen debts owed to ten different 
creditors, totaling $182,330.23.\445\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \443\Lightfoot GJ I at 54 (Ex. 120).
    \444\December 21, 2000 Letter from Lightfoot to the Porteouses (Ex. 
146).
    \445\December 21, 2000 Letter from Lightfoot to the Porteouses (Ex. 
146). Five days after Lightfoot sent Judge Porteous the workout 
letters, Judge Porteous traveled to Caesars Lake Tahoe and took out a 
$3,000 marker. (Ex. 380). Judge Porteous did not disclose to Lightfoot 
this gambling trip or the $3,000 extension of credit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    During the entire period that Lightfoot represented Judge 
Porteous in connection with his bankruptcy, Judge Porteous 
never told Lightfoot that he had any gambling debt. Lightfoot 
has been consistent in his testimony at every forum--the grand 
jury, the Fifth Circuit, the Task Force Deposition, and the 
Task Force Hearing--that at all times he was unaware of Judge 
Porteous's gambling.\446\ At the Task Force Hearing, in 
response to questioning by Mr. Goodlatte, Lightfoot testified: 
``I didn't know [Judge Porteous] gambled . . . 
whatsoever.''\447\ At the Fifth Circuit Hearing, Chief Judge 
Jones pressed Lightfoot on this point:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \446\Lightfoot Dep. at 9 (Ex. 123); Lightfoot 5th Cir. Hrg. at 446 
(Ex. 124); Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 43.
    \447\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 65.

        Q. LAnd you're telling us, as his counsel, in whom he 
        confided for months and months before the time that he 
        was--that he filed this petition, when he continued to 
        gamble almost every week before and after he filed 
        bankruptcy, that you had no earthly idea that this was 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        because of gambling?

        A. LI didn't. I never knew him before, and I--I really 
        didn't know that gambling was an issue with the 
        judge.\448\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \448\Lightfoot 5th Cir. Hrg. at 453 (Ex. 124).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 D. Judge Porteous's Conduct Between the End of the Workout (February 
            2001) and Filing for Bankruptcy (March 28, 2001)

    In about February 2001, Lightfoot concluded that the 
proposed workout would not succeed, and he turned his attention 
toward preparing a bankruptcy filing for Judge Porteous. From 
February 2001 to the filing of the initial bankruptcy petition 
on March 28, 2001, Judge Porteous committed a series of acts 
that have particular significance in connection with the 
bankruptcy forms he subsequently signed under oath. These acts 
reflect his intent to conceal certain of his debts, 
particularly his gambling debts, in violation of applicable 
bankruptcy law requiring the disclosure of such liabilities.
1. Treasure Chest Markers
    On March 2, 2001, Judge Porteous's credit limit at the 
Treasure Chest Casino (``Treasure Chest'') was increased from 
$3,000 to $4,000.\449\ Also on that day Judge Porteous gambled 
at Treasure Chest and took out seven $500 markers. He repaid 
four markers in chips that same day but left the casino owing 
$1,500.\450\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \449\Treasure Chest Records (Ex. 331).
    \450\Treasure Chest Customer Transaction Inquiry (Ex. 302).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On March 27, 2001, the day prior to filing for bankruptcy, 
Judge Porteous made a cash payment of $1,500 to Treasure Chest, 
repaying the three markers that had been outstanding since 
March 2, 2001.\451\ Judge Porteous thus made certain that he 
had no unsecured debts to Treasure Chest as of the date he 
filed for bankruptcy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \451\Treasure Chest Customer Transaction Inquiry (Ex. 302). Judge 
Porteous's payment of these markers on March 27, 2001 in order that 
they would not be included on the bankruptcy schedules also reflect his 
understanding that markers were a form of unsecured debt.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The Fleet Credit Card
    Carmella Porteous had a Fleet credit card issued in her 
name. In the few months prior to March 2001, partial payments 
had been made to keep that account current and in good 
standing. Thus, the balance on the account's January 17, 2001 
closing date was $1,144, on which $315 was paid in February. 
The February closing balance was over $1,250, on which a $370 
payment was made on March 5, 2001.
    On March 19, 2001, a Fleet statement was issued showing a 
new balance of $1,088.41. Payment on the account was due April 
15, 2001. Nonetheless, just a few days after the closing date, 
Judge Porteous directed his secretary Rhonda Danos to pay off 
this credit card in full. On March 23, 2001, Danos wrote a 
check drawn on her personal account in the amount of $1,088.41 
to Fleet, indicating in the memo line that the payment was for 
the Carmella Porteous account.\452\ The Fleet card was not used 
to make any charges from March 5, 2001 (three weeks prior to 
filing for bankruptcy), to April 7, 2001 (about 10 days after 
the bankruptcy petition was filed).\453\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \452\Fleet statement and Danos check number 1660 in the amount of 
$1,088.41 (Ex. 329).
    \453\Judge Porteous's handling of this payment to Fleet 
demonstrates his knowledge of the bankruptcy process and his 
determination that Fleet not be included as an unsecured creditor. 
First, it was not Judge Porteous's practice to pay off credit cards 
early and in full. Second, though he did not have funds in his accounts 
to make the Fleet payment (he had only $559.07 in his main checking 
account on the date Danos wrote the $1,088.41 check to Fleet), he could 
have easily waited until April 1, 2001, when he would receive his 
monthly salary check in excess of $7,500. Instead, he had Danos pay it 
a few days prior to his filing for bankruptcy. (Also, by having Danos 
pay the Fleet card, if creditors were subsequently to insist on 
examining Judge Porteous's accounts in the month prior to bankruptcy, 
the check to Fleet would not be signed by Judge Porteous, and Judge 
Porteous's personal involvement in hiding this card from the creditors 
would not be apparent.) Third, the 5-week gap in any charges on the 
card was inconsistent with the card's prior usage pattern, but can be 
explained by Judge Porteous's desire to be certain there was no debt 
outstanding on the date of the filing for bankruptcy. Finally, the 
concealed payment on the concealed account occurred 3 days after Judge 
Porteous obtained a P.O. Box to hide his actual residential address at 
a time when he was structuring (and concealing) his activities with his 
bankruptcy filing in mind.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Grand Casino Gulfport Markers
    On February 27, 2001, Judge Porteous gambled at the Grand 
Casino Gulfport (``Gulfport'') and took out two $1,000 markers. 
Had they been outstanding on the date Judge Porteous filed for 
bankruptcy, the debt to the casino would have had to be 
disclosed on the schedule of unsecured creditors that would be 
filed as part of the bankruptcy process. (And, as will be 
discussed, if Judge Porteous paid the debt within 90 days of 
filing for bankruptcy, that payment would be required to be 
disclosed on his Statement of Financial Affairs, one of the 
official forms that must be filed in a bankruptcy case.)
    Gulfport records reflect that the casino attempted to 
deposit and collect on these markers starting March 16, 2001--
which would have been prior to the bankruptcy filing--but the 
markers were returned as ``uncollected.''\454\ FBI Agent Horner 
determined that there was a problem with Judge Porteous's bank 
routing number on the markers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \454\Grand Casino Gulfport Patron Transaction Report (Ex. 301(a)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On March 27, 2001--the day prior to filing his initial 
bankruptcy petition, and the same day he paid off his Treasure 
Chest markers--Judge Porteous deposited exactly $2,000 into his 
Bank One account.\455\ This amount consisted of $1,960 cash and 
a check he drew on his Fidelity money market account of $40--
thus ensuring that there be a $2,000 in that account.\456\ 
Without this deposit, there would not have been $2,000 to pay 
the markers. This $2,000 deposit into an account from which 
Judge Porteous knew a $2,000 debt was to be collected 
demonstrates Judge Porteous's awareness that the Gulfport 
markers were outstanding as of March 27.\457\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \455\Porteous Bank One Records (Ex. 144).
    \456\Porteous Fidelity Money Market Statement (Ex. 143).
    \457\No other debt has been uncovered which would require that 
there be at least $2,000 in Judge Porteous's bank account for the 3 
days prior to his anticipated receipt of his salary deposit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Gulfport records reflect that the casino ultimately 
redeposited the markers for collection on March 24, 2001 (a 
fact, which if known to Judge Porteous, would explain his 
$2,000 deposit), and the markers cleared Judge Porteous's bank 
account on April 5 and 6, 2001, a week after he filed for 
bankruptcy.\458\

4. Obtaining a Post Office Box
    On March 20, 2001, Judge Porteous opened a Post Office Box

false name in his bankruptcy filing, instead of using his home 
address.\459\

    Judge Porteous did not disclose to Lightfoot his activities 
associated with the Gulfport and Treasure Chest markers, the 
Fleet payment, or his filing for a tax refund. As described in 
(E) below, Judge Porteous further failed to disclose these 
activities when he signed forms and schedules under oath in 
connection with his bankruptcy.

 E. March 28, 2001--Judge Porteous's Initial Bankruptcy Petition Filed 
                           under a False Name

    On March 28, 2001, Judge Porteous filed a Petition for 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy (the ``Initial Petition'') in the United 
States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of 
Louisiana.\461\ While the Initial Petition contained a list of 
creditors, it did not contain financial schedules or other 
detailed financial information. Those documents were 
subsequently filed on April 9, 2001.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \461\Porteous Initial Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition, Docket No. 1, 
In the Matter of Porteous, Case No. 01-12363 (Bankr. E.D. La. Mar. 28, 
2001) (hereinafter ``Initial Petition'') (Ex. 125). During his 
testimony before the Impeachment Task Force, the Honorable Duncan Keir, 
Chief Judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of 
Maryland, described Chapter 13 bankruptcies as wage earners' plans, in 
that they are only available to individuals who are receiving a monthly 
income. There is no liquidation in a Chapter 13, and a debtor is 
therefore allowed to keep his property. In exchange for that 
opportunity, debtors must provide the bankruptcy trustee ``with at 
least as much in value as they would have received had it been a 
liquidating Chapter 7 bankruptcy.'' Keir TF Hrg. II at 68.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This Initial Petition was filed with the false names ``G.T. 
Ortous'' and ``C.A. Ortous'' as debtors and also listed a newly 
obtained P.O. Box address instead of Judge Porteous's actual 
residential address. Judge Porteous personally reviewed the 
Initial Petition before it was filed,\462\ and both he and his 
wife signed the Initial Petition ``under penalty of perjury 
that the information provided in this petition is true and 
correct.''\463\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \463\Initial Petition (Ex. 125). Lightfoot had no doubt that the 
Porteouses understood that they were signing a document containing 
false information when they signed the Initial Petition. Lightfoot GJ 
III at 31 (Ex. 122).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Porteous admitted at the Fifth Circuit Hearing that 
the names used the Initial Petition were false.

        Q. LYour name is not Ortous, is it?

        A. LNo, sir.

        Q. LYour wife's name is not Ortous?

        A. LNo, sir.

        Q. LSo, those statements that were signed--so, this 
        petition that was signed under penalty of perjury had 
        false information, correct?

        A. LYes, sir, it appears to.\464\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \464\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 55 (Ex. 10). Federal Rule of 
Bankruptcy 1005 requires that the caption of a bankruptcy petition 
include the name of the debtor and ``all other names used by the debtor 
within 6 years before filing the petition.'' Fed. R. Br. P. 1005 
(2001). Accuracy in the caption of the petition is not merely a matter 
of form. ``It is of substantive importance since it informs the 
creditor of exactly who the debtor is in order that the creditor may 
have an opportunity to determine whether it has a claim against the 
estate.'' In re Anderson, 159 B.R. 830, 838-39 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1993); 
accord In re Adair, 212 B.R. 171 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1997).

    While Judge Porteous admitted that he filed his initial 
bankruptcy petition with a false name, Lightfoot has taken 
responsibility for coming up with that idea.\465\ Lightfoot has 
since characterized the use of false names as a ``stupid 
idea,''\466\ and he explained in his Task Force testimony that 
his goal in filing the Initial Petition with the false names 
was to avoid embarrassment to Judge Porteous:

    \466\Lightfoot 5th Cir. Hrg. at 435 (Ex. 124).

        I had hoped that I could avoid him the embarrassment--
        or have him avoid the embarrassment of a big story in 
        the newspaper. At that time, these filings were listed 
        in the newspaper once a week. And I knew that it would 
        be corrected very quickly before any notice would go 
        out to creditors. And that was a mistake, and it was my 
        suggestion, and I am sorry that I made that 
        suggestion.\467\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \467\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 44.

Lightfoot acknowledged that Judge Porteous may have said 
something about not wanting his bankruptcy to be in the 
paper.\468\ While it was Lightfoot's idea to use a false name, 
Judge Porteous never objected and never refused to file a 
document under oath representing he was ``G.T. Ortous.''\469\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \468\Lightfoot GJ III at 23-24, 26 (Ex. 122).
    \469\Lightfoot testified:

      Q. After you made the suggestion to Judge Porteous that he 
      file under a false name in the original petition, did he 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      object to your suggestion?

      A. No.

      Q. Did he ever say to you, no, I refuse to file a document 
      with a false name?A.No.

Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 44.

   F. April 9, 2001--Judge Porteous's Amended Petition, Accompanying 
             Schedules, and Statement of Financial Affairs

1. The Amended Petition
    Judge Porteous amended his Initial Petition on April 9, 
2001, 2 weeks after it was filed, correcting the false names 
and listing his actual residential address in Metairie, 
Louisiana.\470\ The Amended Petition did not list Judge 
Porteous's newly acquired PO Box under either the ``street 
address'' field or the ``mailing address'' field.\471\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \470\Porteous Amended Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition, Docket No. 2, 
In the Matter of Porteous, Case No. 01-12363 (Bankr. E.D. La. Apr. 9, 
2001) (hereinafter ``Amended Petition'') (Ex. 126).
    \471\Judge Porteous identified his Amended Petition during his 
testimony before the Fifth Circuit Special Committee. Porteous 5th Cir. 
Hrg. at 56-57 (Ex. 10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The Bankruptcy Schedules and Statement of Financial Affairs
    Along with the Amended Petition, Judge Porteous filed two 
other documents. The first consisted of schedules setting forth 
such items as assets (for example, real and personal property, 
and property claimed as exempt), debts (secured and unsecured 
creditors), income, and other miscellaneous financial matters. 
The second, entitled ``Statement of Financial Affairs,'' 
consisted of a series of questions requiring disclosure of 
specific financial activities. Judge Porteous signed each 
document under penalty of perjury.\472\ Though they were filed 
April 9, 2001, these forms should have described Judge 
Porteous's financial affairs as they existed on the date of the 
Initial Petition--the date which determines the bankruptcy 
``estate.''

Porteous, Case No. 01-12363 (Bankr. E.D. La. Apr. 9, 2001) (Ex. 127).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Prior to filing these documents, Lightfoot provided Judge 
Porteous with draft copies and specifically reviewed them with 
Judge Porteous at least twice.\473\ The final review took place 
within 1 week of the Initial Petition's filing.\474\ Judge 
Porteous then signed both his Bankruptcy Schedules and his 
Statement of Financial Affairs under penalty of perjury, 
declaring that the documents were true and correct.\475\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \473\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 46. As Lightfoot explained in his Task 
Force testimony: ``[I] would sit down, and I believe with his wife at 
one time as well, and we went through them to see that everything was 
accurate and there were no changes, just going page by page, pointing 
out what was there.'' Id.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. False Representations in the Bankruptcy Schedules
            a. The Tax Refund
    Category 17 on Schedule B (``Personal Property'') of the 
Bankruptcy Schedules required Judge Porteous to disclose 
``other liquidated debts owing debtor including tax 
refunds.''\476\ In response to Category 17, the box ``none'' is 
checked.\477\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \476\The instructions for completing Category 17 on Schedule B 
state that ``Item 17 request [sic] the debtor to list all monies owed 
to the debtor . . . and specifically, any expected tax refunds.'' 
Instructions for Completing Official Form 6, Schedules at 62 (Ex. 345).
    \477\Bankruptcy Schedules at SC00096 (Ex. 127). During his Fifth 
Circuit testimony, Judge Porteous acknowledged that he checked ``none'' 
in response to this question. Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 80 (Ex. 10). 
The decision to check ``none'' was Judge Porteous's decision--not 
Lightfoot's. Lightfoot 5th Cir. Hrg. at 451 (Ex. 124).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, on March 23, 2001--5 days before he filed his 
Initial Petition and seventeen days before he filed his 
Bankruptcy Schedules--Judge Porteous filed his calendar year 
2000 Federal income tax return and requested a $4,143.72 tax 
refund.\478\ And on April 13, 2001--just 4 days after the 
Bankruptcy Schedules were filed--Judge Porteous received his 
entire $4,143.72 Federal tax refund by way of a direct deposit 
into his Bank One checking account.\479\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \478\2000 Porteous Federal Tax Return (Ex. 141).
    \479\Porteous Bank One records (Ex. 144). Bankruptcy Trustee S.J. 
Beaulieu told the FBI during an interview in 2004 that the Porteouses 
should have disclosed any tax refund to Beaulieu, and Beaulieu would 
have then required the Porteouses to turn over the refund so that it 
could be distributed to the unsecured creditors. Beaulieu FBI 
Interview, Jan. 22, 2004, at SC00410 (Ex. 334). Judge Porteous 
acknowledged during his Fifth Circuit testimony that the $4,143.72 tax 
refund was deposited into his Bank One checking account on April 13, 
2001. Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 82-83 (Ex. 10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At the Fifth Circuit Hearing, Judge Porteous was shown the 
return and identified it as having been filed on March 23, 
2001. When confronted with the fact that the Schedule did not 
disclose the pending refund, Judge Porteous responded: ``When 
that was listed, you're right.''\480\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \480\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 81-82 (Ex. 10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At one point in his Fifth Circuit testimony, Judge Porteous 
claimed that he called Lightfoot when he received the refund, 
and that they discussed what he should do with it:

        Q. LWhat did Mr. Lightfoot tell you?

        A. LSaid, ``If the trustee didn't put a lien on it, put 
        it in your account; but they may--they may ask for it 
        back.''

        Q. LBut, Judge Porteous, that schedule was signed under 
        penalty of perjury.

        A. LIt was omitted. I don't know how it got omitted. 
        There was no intentional act to try and defraud 
        somebody. It just got omitted. I don't know why.\481\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \481\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 83-84 (Ex. 10).

    Lightfoot, however, testified before the Task Force that 
Judge Porteous never told him about the year 2000 tax 
refund.\482\ In response to Judge Porteous's statement that he 
talked about the refund with Lightfoot after he received it, 
Lightfoot testified that he had a conversation with Judge 
Porteous in relation to Judge Porteous's receipt of a different 
tax refund in a subsequent year. Lightfoot testified he 
specifically recalled the issue in that conversation being 
whether the ``special confirmation order we received from the 
Houston [bankruptcy judge]'' required that the refund be 
disclosed or turned over, and that to answer Judge Porteous's 
question, it would be necessary to ``look at [the] confirmation 
order'' since it was not a typical order issued in New 
Orleans.\483\ The confirmation order in Judge Porteous's case 
was issued June 28, 2001. As of the date Judge Porteous 
received the refund (April 13, 2001) the order had not yet been 
issued. Therefore, the conversation that Lightfoot had with 
Judge Porteous about whether the order required disclosure of 
the refund could not have taken place in reference to the 2000 
tax refund.

    \483\Lightfoot Dep. at 19 (Ex. 123).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Further, Lightfoot testified he viewed the existence of the 
refund as significant and he stated that if he had known about 
it, he would have disclosed it to the bankruptcy trustee:

        I would have amended this schedule to list it, had it 
        been absent, and probably informed the trustee, 
        particularly if the meeting of creditors hadn't been 
        held yet. I would have mentioned it.\484\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \484\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 47. See also Lightfoot Dep. at 18 (``I 
would have felt the requirement, the obligation on my part to amend the 
schedules, to list an expected tax refund as the questions read, and I 
would have informed the trustee at the upcoming meeting of 
creditors.'') (Ex. 123).

According to Lightfoot, a tax refund is an asset and ``[i]f you 
have a liquidated refund owing to you at the time you file, it 
should be listed.''\485\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \485\Lightfoot 5th Cir. Hrg. at 447 (Ex. 124); see also Lightfoot 
TF Hrg. II at 46. Chief Judge Keir also explained that ``liquidated'' 
in this context means the tax refund is an amount certain--it does not 
mean that the amount has already been collected. According to Judge 
Keir, ``[a] tax refund that has been determined or at least initially 
determined by the tax return is a liquidated amount.'' Keir TF Hrg. II 
at 70. Judge Keir also made the point that the undisclosed tax refund 
had significance going forward in determining Judge Porteous's 
disposable income: ``Not only was it an asset that should have come in 
. . . but in effect it affects the calculation of what is disposable 
income. If you claim no dependents, no deductions, and have them take 
out extra money, you can lower that take-home pay. All you are doing is 
putting it in your own savings account, if you are allowed to do that. 
Therefore, your monthly payment is also going to be less under this 
plan calculation.'' Keir TF Hrg. at 77.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            b. Omitted and Undervalued Financial Accounts
    The Bankruptcy Schedules were also inaccurate as to two of 
Judge Porteous's accounts.
    Question 2 on Schedule B (``Personal Property'') requires 
the debtor to list, among other things, ``checking, savings or 
other financial accounts.'' In response, the current market 
value of Judge Porteous's Bank One Checking Account--into which 
his monthly salary was deposited--was listed as $100.\486\ 
However, the opening balance in Judge Porteous's Bank One 
account for the time period of March 23, 2001 to April 23, 2001 
was $559.07, and the closing balance for the same time period 
was $5,493.91. Indeed, the day prior to filing his Initial 
Petition, Judge Porteous had deposited $2,000 into the 
account--the amount he owed on the Gulfport markers--so he knew 
that the account held at least that amount. At no time during 
that month did Judge Porteous's balance drop to as low as 
$100.\487\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \486\Bankruptcy Schedules at SC00095 (Ex. 127). During his Fifth 
Circuit testimony, Judge Porteous acknowledged that he listed his Bank 
One checking account under Schedule B as having a balance of $100. 
Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 79-80 (Ex. 10).
    \487\Porteous Bank One Records (Ex. 144). Lightfoot testified that 
he asked Judge Porteous on April 9, 2001 how much money Judge Porteous 
had in his Bank One account, and Judge Porteous told Lightfoot that he 
had ``about $100.'' Lightfoot GJ III at 43. (Ex. 122).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Porteous also omitted a Fidelity money market account 
entirely from Category 2 on Schedule B. This account was held 
in both his and his wife's names, and was an active account of 
Judge Porteous. Judge Porteous never told Lightfoot about this 
account, and did not include it on the worksheets that he 
filled out for Lightfoot in the summer of 2000.\488\ As 
Lightfoot testified: ``I asked for all bank accounts, and this 
[the disclosed accounts] is what I got. I was never told there 
were others.''\489\ Judge Porteous acknowledged the existence 
of his Fidelity money market account, and acknowledged that it 
was omitted from his Schedule B, during his Fifth Circuit 
testimony.\490\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \489\Lightfoot GJ III at 45 (Ex. 122).
    \490\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 85-87 (Ex. 10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Fidelity money market account was an active account 
used by Judge Porteous for transactions outside his personal 
checking account. He would deposit into the account withdrawals 
from his IRA account, travel reimbursements, insurance checks, 
cash, and other miscellaneous items. He used the funds for a 
variety of purposes, including the payment of gambling debts. 
For example, on November 27, 2000, Judge Porteous deposited 
$2,400 that he withdrew from his IRA into that account, and on 
November 30, 2000, he wrote a check on that account for $1,600 
to the Treasure Chest Casino.\491\ On occasion, he would move 
money from his main checking account (the Bank One account, 
into which his salary checks were deposited) to the Fidelity 
money market account and then write checks from the latter 
account. The checks drawn on this account also included checks 
to Danos that appeared to constitute Judge Porteous's repayment 
to her for payments she made on his behalf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \491\Judge Porteous deposited each of the following withdrawals 
from his IRA into his Fidelity money market account: January 22, 1997 
($12,000); April 30, 1997 ($12,000); April 6, 1998 ($7,200); January 
19, 1999 ($2,000); September 27, 1999 ($1,600); May 12, 2000 ($2,400); 
and November 21, 2000 ($2,400) (Ex. 383).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Moreover, Judge Porteous had used the Fidelity money market 
account in the time frame immediately surrounding his filing 
for bankruptcy.\492\ By omitting the Fidelity money market 
account, Judge Porteous kept a bank account available for his 
own use while in bankruptcy that was outside the knowledge of, 
and thus the potential scrutiny of, creditors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \492\Porteous Fidelity Statement (Ex. 143). The Fidelity statement 
that was issued to Judge Porteous immediately prior to his filing the 
original bankruptcy petition was dated March 20, 2001, and showed a 
balance of over $600. There was some activity on the account, dropping 
the balance down to $283.42 on March 28, 2001. On April 4, Judge 
Porteous deposited another $200 into the account. Judge Porteous knew 
about this money market account, having written five checks on this 
account between March 22, 2001 and April 12, 2001, including a check in 
the amount of $40 which he deposited into his Bank One account on March 
27, 2001--the day prior to filing for bankruptcy. Moreover, the account 
was similarly active and used for the same purposes in the summer of 
2000, at the time when Judge Porteous should have disclosed it to 
Lightfoot. Judge Porteous deposited $2,400 into that account on May 12, 
2000, leaving and ending balance that month of $2,456.33, and, after 
some transactions the next month, a balance on June 20, 2000 of 
$2,055.43.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            c. Understated Income
    Schedule I of the Bankruptcy Schedules, ``Current Income of 
Individual Debtor(s),'' required Judge Porteous to list his 
``current monthly gross wages, salary, and commissions (pro 
rate if not paid monthly).'' On that schedule, Judge Porteous's 
monthly gross income was listed as $7,531.52, the amount that 
was reflected on the pay stub Judge Porteous gave Lightfoot 
when he first retained him in the summer of 2000.\493\ That 
amount listed was in fact Judge Porteous's net salary for that 
month (not gross as called for by the Schedule), and the pay 
stub was attached to the Schedule. In 2001, Judge Porteous's 
net judicial salary had increased to $7,705.51 per month.\494\ 
Judge Porteous's net income, therefore, was understated by 
$173.99 a month, or $2,087.88 annually, or over $6,000 for the 
3 year life of the proposed Plan.\495\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \493\Bankruptcy Schedules at SC00108-09 (Ex. 127).
    \494\Porteous Bank One Records (Ex. 144). Judge Porteous never 
disclosed to his bankruptcy attorney that his judicial salary had 
increased in 2001. Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 47. Schedule I was 
improperly filled out because Judge Porteous's gross income, even 
according to his attached May 31, 2000 pay stub, was $11,775, and his 
net (not gross) income was $7,531.52. Nonetheless, the form was 
prepared by Lightfoot and the pay stub was attached.
    \495\Moreover, even as a ``net'' amount, the $7,531 was misleading. 
Judge Porteous had Social Security taxes withheld from his salary until 
he reached a statutorily defined annual gross salary--referred to as 
the Social Security ``wage base''--a level he typically reached in July 
of a calendar year. At that point, he was no longer subject to Social 
Security tax withholding, and his net monthly salary would increase 
several hundred dollars. Judge Porteous had experienced this pattern 
for years. In 1999, when the Social Security wage base was $72,600, 
Judge Porteous's net monthly salary increased from approximately $7,350 
on June 1 to $8,052 by August, where it stayed for the rest of the 
year. In 2000, when the Social Security wage base was $76,200, Judge 
Porteous's salary increased from $7,531 on June 1 to $8,253 on August 
1, where it likewise remained for the rest of the year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The same pattern would hold for 2001. As noted, Judge Porteous 
received $7,705 per month through June 1, 2001 (though he reported only 
$7,531 to the bankruptcy court). His monthly net salary increased to 
$7,875 on July 2, 2001, and thereafter increased to a range between 
$8,555 through $8,592 for the rest of the year--roughly $1,000 per 
month more than he reported on his Schedule I, or over $5,000 more for 
that year. See also Horner TF Hrg. II at 26 (testifying that from 
``August through December [2001], the pay that is deposited in his 
account every month is about $8,500'').
  Schedule I specifically contemplated the possibility that a wage-
earner in bankruptcy may anticipate a salary increase, and, to ensure 
that all disposable income is actually paid to creditors, specifically 
inquires at the bottom of Schedule I: ``Describe any increase or 
decrease of more than 10% in any of the above categories anticipated to 
occur within the year following the filing of this document.'' In the 
response for Judge Porteous, the word ``NONE'' is typed. Judge 
Porteous's net monthly salary did in fact go up more than 10%. Thus, 
Judge Porteous in fact enjoyed thousands of dollars a year in 
undisclosed disposable income that would otherwise have been available 
to pay his creditors--income that was significantly in excess of the 
$7,531.52 that was disclosed on Schedule I as his monthly income.

            d. Schedule of Unsecured Creditors
    Notwithstanding Judge Porteous's pre-bankruptcy efforts to 
ensure there would be no outstanding casino markers on the date 
of filing his Initial Petition, Judge Porteous in fact owed 
$2,000 in outstanding markers to the Grand Casino Gulfport on 
March 28, 2001. Though he listed numerous creditors on Schedule 
F, ``Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims,'' this 
casino debt was not included. Once again, this was a gambling-
related matter as to which Lightfoot was unaware. As Lightfoot 
testified:

        Q. LDid Judge Porteous tell you more specifically that 
        on February 27th of 2001 he gambled at the Grand Casino 
        Gulfport, he took out $2,000 in markers and that he 
        left the casino that day still owing $2,000?

        A. LNo. I never knew that he gambled at all or had any 
        gambling debts.

        Q. LDid he ever tell you that he owed $2,000 to the 
        Grand Casino Gulfport on March 28th, which was the day 
        that he filed the bankruptcy petition?

        A. LNo.

        Q. LShould Judge Porteous have told you about those 
        sorts of gambling debts?

        A. LYes, so I could list them.\496\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \496\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 43. It was clear to Lightfoot that a 
marker was a form of debt that had to be reported. He explained, ``I 
have had some cases involving gambling, people who had markers, and, of 
course, they are a civil liability. It is a debt like any other debt in 
that sense. So it has to be listed. I would have listed and do list 
anybody who has a casino-type debt.'' Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 53.

    Gulfport collected on these markers on or about April 5-6, 
2001.\497\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \497\Ex. 144.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            e. Signed Declaration
    At the end of Judge Porteous's Bankruptcy Schedules, he 
signed a ``declaration under penalty of perjury by individual 
debtor,'' which stated:
    I declare under penalty of perjury that I have read the 
foregoing summary and schedules, consisting of 18 sheets plus 
the summary page, and that they are true and correct to the 
best of my knowledge, information, and belief.\498\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \498\Bankruptcy Schedules at SC00111 (Ex. 127).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Statement of Financial Affairs
    Judge Porteous's April 9, 2001 Statement of Financial 
Affairs likewise contained false information by failing to 
report the Fleet payment and the payment of certain gambling 
debts within 90 days of his filing the Initial Petition.
            a. Payments to Creditors (Fleet and the Casinos) Within 90 
                    Days of Filing for Bankruptcy
    Question 3 on the Statement of Financial Affairs required 
Judge Porteous to ``[l]ist all payments on loans, installment 
purchases of goods or services, and other debts, aggregating 
more than $600 to any creditor, made within 90 days immediately 
preceding the commencement of this case.'' The question 
thereafter provided fields for the debtor to list the name and 
address of any creditor, the dates of payments, the amount 
paid, and the amount still owing.\499\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \499\Statement of Financial Affairs at SC00112 (Ex. 127). The 
question thus seeks to inquire as to whether the debtor has favored or 
preferred some creditors over others, by paying some creditors in full 
to the detriment of others. As a Federal judge, Judge Porteous would 
have well understood this purpose. Lightfoot explained:

      But what I'm looking for was there anything unusual, any 
      unusual payments to anybody, anything outside a normal 
      monthly installment, like a normal house note, a normal car 
      payment, a normal payment to the credit card company. In 
      other words, anybody gets paid off, I want to know that. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Some relative gets paid back, I want to know that.

Lightfoot GJ III at 70-71 (Ex. 122).
    Relying on the information that Judge Porteous had 
provided, Lightfoot entered the answer: ``normal 
installments.''\500\ When questioned about what he meant by 
``normal installments'' during his Task Force Hearing 
testimony, Lightfoot explained: ```[N]ormal installments' was 
intended to cover the normal installments on his two leased 
cars and his two home mortgages.''\501\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \500\Statement of Financial Affairs at SC00112 (Ex. 127). During 
his Fifth Circuit testimony, Judge Porteous acknowledged that his 
response to Question 3 was ``normal installments.'' Porteous 5th Cir. 
Hrg. at 89 (Ex. 10).
    \501\Lightfoot TF Hrg. at 48. See also Lightfoot GJ III at 70-72 
(Ex. 122).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    That answer--``normal installments''--was false, in light 
of Judge Porteous's actions in the weeks immediately preceding 
filing for bankruptcy.
    First, it failed to disclose Judge Porteous's payment to 
Treasure Chest. On March 2, 2001, Judge Porteous gambled at 
Treasure Chest and took out seven $500 markers, for a total 
extension of credit of $3,500. He repaid $2,000 with chips on 
March 3, 2001, but he did not repay the balance until March 27, 
2001 (the day before his Initial Petition was filed), when he 
made a $1,500 cash payment to the casino--that is, he made a 
payment on a debt ``aggregating more than $600 to any creditor, 
made within 90 days immediately preceding the commencement of 
this case.''\502\ Lightfoot testified that the repayment of the 
markers to Treasure Chest should have been reported on the 
Statement of Financial Affairs, but that, as with all of Judge 
Porteous's gambling activities, Lightfoot did not include this 
payment because he did not know about it.\503\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \502\Treasure Chest Customer Transaction Inquiry (HP Ex. 302). 
Judge Porteous was able to take out so many markers on March 2, 2001 
because his credit limit at Treasure Chest had been increased during 
the previous summer. See Central Credit, Inc. Gaming Report for Judge 
Porteous (HP Ex. 326).
    \503\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 48.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, Judge Porteous also failed to disclose that on 
March 23, 2001, he had his secretary, Danos, pay off his wife's 
Fleet credit card balance of $1,088.41.\504\ Judge Porteous 
claimed, in his Fifth Circuit testimony, that he had no 
recollection of asking Danos to pay off his wife's Fleet bill. 
However, he also testified that Danos had ``paid some bills'' 
for him in the past.\505\ Danos testified before the Fifth 
Circuit that she ``assume[d]'' Judge Porteous asked her to 
write the check to Fleet and that she didn't talk with Carmella 
about paying her bills.\506\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \504\Fleet Statement and Danos Check (Ex. 329); Fleet Statements at 
SC00590 (Ex. 140). This payment was credited by Fleet on March 29, 
2001. Because this check was not received by Fleet until the day after 
Judge Porteous initially filed for bankruptcy, Judge Porteous could 
argue that the payment to Fleet was not in fact made within the 90 days 
preceding his bankruptcy filing (even though it had been mailed within 
that time), and thus it was not required to be reported on the 
Statement of Financial Affairs. However, if this were the case, then 
Judge Porteous should have made sure that Fleet was listed on Judge 
Porteous's Schedule F as an unsecured creditor. In either event, Fleet 
should have appeared somewhere in Judge Porteous's bankruptcy filing. 
In fact the transaction does not appear anywhere.
    \505\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 97-98 (Ex. 10).
    \506\Danos 5th Cir. Hrg. at 402-03 (Ex. 43).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As to both these items--the Treasure Chest payment and the 
Fleet credit card payment--Lightfoot did not include them in 
response to Question 3 on the Statement of Financial Affairs 
because Judge Porteous did not disclose them to him.\507\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \507\``In other words, I, I--my questioning revealed that the only 
payments that they [the Porteouses] said they made were just normal 
installments on the debts that I knew of.'' Lightfoot GJ III at 72 (Ex. 
122).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finally, on February 26, 2001, Judge Porteous took out 
$2,000 in markers at the Grand Casino Gulfport. As noted, these 
were in fact outstanding as of the date he filed for bankruptcy 
(March 28, 2001) and were not reported on the Schedule of 
Unsecured Creditors. However, if Judge Porteous believed that 
the markers had in fact been repaid prior to filing for 
bankruptcy, that payment should have been disclosed. Again, 
Lightfoot was unaware of the Gulfport markers.\508\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \508\In short, Judge Porteous would have known either that the debt 
was actually pending (in which case it should have been listed on 
Schedule F as a debt owed to an unsecured creditor) or that it had been 
paid (in which case it should have been listed on the Statement of 
Financial Affairs as a payment made in the 90 days preceding the 
bankruptcy filing). This indebtedness was not listed in either place, 
because Judge Porteous did not tell Lightfoot about it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            b. Gambling Losses
    Question 8 on the Statement of Financial Affairs required 
Judge Porteous to ``[l]ist all losses from . . . gambling 
within 1 year immediately preceding the commencement of this 
case or since the commencement of this case.'' In response, the 
box for ``none'' is checked.\509\ However, an analysis of Judge 
Porteous's gambling activities in the year preceding his 
bankruptcy filing revealed that Judge Porteous had accrued 
$6,233.20 in net gambling losses during that year.\510\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \509\Statement of Financial Affairs at SC00113 (Ex. 127).
    \510\FBI Gaming Losses Chart (Ex. 337). FBI Agent Horner explained 
this chart both to the Impeachment Task Force and to the Fifth Circuit 
Special Committee, and he testified that Judge Porteous's losses 
totaled $12,895.35, but Judge Porteous also had winnings of $5,312.15. 
Horner TF Hrg. II at 16; Horner 5th Cir. Hrg. at 317-18 (Ex. 338). The 
analysis of Judge Porteous's gambling activities (including losses) in 
the year preceding his bankruptcy was based on a review of each 
casino's records. Casinos keep these records because ``first of all, 
they have to determine wins and losses for tax purposes for these 
people; and then, second of all, they're basing their comps on these 
numbers. So . . . they want the numbers to be as accurate as 
possible.'' Horner 5th Cir. Hrg. at 322 (Ex. 338).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    During his Fifth Circuit testimony, Judge Porteous admitted 
that his response of ``none'' to that question was 
``incorrect'':

        Q. LJudge Porteous, do you recall that in the--that 
        your gambling losses exceeded $12,700 during the 
        preceding year?

        A. LI was not aware of it at the time, but now I see 
        your documentation and that--and that's what it 
        reflects.

        Q. LSo you--you don't dispute that?

        A. LI don't dispute that.

        Q. LTherefore, the answer ``no'' was incorrect, 
        correct?

        A. LApparently, yes.

        Q. LEven though this was signed under oath, under 
        penalty of perjury, correct?

        A. LRight.\511\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \511\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 99 (Ex. 10).

            c. Declaration
    At the end of his Statement of Financial Affairs, Judge 
Porteous signed a declaration which stated:

        I declare under penalty of perjury that I have read the 
        answers contained in the foregoing statement of 
        financial affairs and any attachments thereto and that 
        they are true and correct.\512\

E. Judge Porteous's Post-filing Activities and the Bankruptcy Creditors 
                                Meeting

1. Post-Filing Activities
    Despite the fact that he had filed for bankruptcy 
protection and claimed to have over $190,000 in credit card 
debts,\513\ Judge Porteous continued to gamble and to incur 
thousands of dollars in additional debt immediately following 
his bankruptcy filing.\514\ Judge Porteous's activities between 
March 28, 2001, when he filed his Initial Petition, and the 
Creditors Meeting on May 9, 2001 included the following:\515\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \513\Bankruptcy Schedules at SC00092 (Ex. 127).
    \514\Judge Porteous never advised Lightfoot that, after filing the 
amended petition on April 9, 2001, he incurred thousands of dollars in 
gambling debt at casinos. Lightfoot 5th Cir. Hrg. at 449 (Ex. 124).
    \515\While there was no official court order during this time 
period prohibiting Judge Porteous from incurring new debt, nor had the 
bankruptcy trustee yet instructed Judge Porteous that he may not incur 
new debt, Lightfoot had already made it clear to Judge Porteous that he 
should not be incurring any new debt. Lightfoot Dep. at 13-14 (Ex. 
123). Moreover, Judge Porteous's return to the same conduct that had 
caused him to go into bankruptcy in the first place necessarily placed 
his creditors at risk. Gambling, and seeking credit to do so, in the 
very days after filing false documents in bankruptcy (that concealed 
his gambling) bear on the question of his ``good faith'' in seeking 
bankruptcy. See testimony of Judge Greendyke, in X(F)(1) and (2), 
infra. Finally, Judge Porteous's repayment of the Beau Rivage debt by 
endorsing a check to Danos and having her write a check to the casino, 
thus bypassing Judge Porteous's account altogether, is evidence of his 
consciousness of the wrongfulness of taking out and repaying debts to 
casinos between the time of filing for bankruptcy and the Creditors 
Meeting.

         LApril 6, 2001--Judge Porteous requested a 
        one-time credit increase at the Beau Rivage Casino from 
        $2,500 to $4,000.\516\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \516\Beau Rivage Credit History (Ex. 303).

         LApril 7-8, 2001--Judge Porteous took out 
        $2,000 in markers at the Beau Rivage Casino. He left 
        the casino owing $1,000, which was not paid back until 
        May 4, 2001.\517\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \517\Beau Rivage Balance Activity (Ex. 304). Judge Porteous was 
able to leave the casino while still owing money because he had an 
established credit line. FBI Agent Horner testified before the Fifth 
Circuit Special Committee and explained that a player has ``to 
establish some kind of credit line with the casino before they would 
let you [leave while still owing money].'' Horner 5th Cir. Hrg. at 309-
10 (Ex. 338).

         LApril 10, 2001--Judge Porteous took out 
        $2,000 in markers at Treasure Chest. He paid them all 
        back the same day in chips.\518\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \518\Treasure Chest Customer Transaction Inquiry (Ex. 305).

         LApril 30, 2001--Judge Porteous submitted a 
        casino credit application to Harrah's Casino and 
        requested a $4,000 credit limit.\519\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \519\Harrah's Casino Credit Application (Ex. 149). This application 
lists ``$0'' for indebtedness, though it is not clear who may have 
written that figure on the form. See also Central Credit, Inc. Gaming 
Report for Judge Porteous (Ex. 326).

         LApril 30, 2001--Judge Porteous took out 
        $1,000 in markers at Harrah's Casino. These markers 
        were not paid back until May 30, 2001.\520\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \520\Harrah's Patron Credit Activity (Ex. 306). Judge Porteous 
wrote a check to repay these markers on April 30, 2001, but Harrah's 
held the check for 30 days before depositing it.

         LApproximately April 30-May 1, 2001--Judge 
        Porteous repaid the Beau Rivage by withdrawing $1,000 
        from his IRA, which was paid to him in the form of a 
        check dated April 24, 2001. He endorsed the check 
        directly to Danos, and she deposited it into her 
        personal account on May 1, 2001. On April 30, 2001, 
        Danos wrote a check payable to the Beau Rivage in the 
        amount of $1,000, the memo line referencing Judge 
        Porteous. As noted, that payment was credited against 
        Judge Porteous's Beau Rivage account on May 4, 
        2001.\521\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \521\Thus, rather than depositing the money into his own account 
and writing a check on that account, Judge Porteous conducted this 
transaction in a way that bypassed his accounts altogether and 
consistent with an intent to conceal his gambling. (Ex. 382).

         LMay 7, 2001--Judge Porteous took out $4,000 
        in markers at Treasure Chest. He left the casino owing 
        this amount and repaid all $4,000 2 days later in 
        cash.\522\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \522\Treasure Chest Customer Transaction Inquiry (Ex. 307).

2. Bankruptcy Creditors Meeting
    On May 9, 2001, the Section 341 Creditors Meeting was held 
in Judge Porteous's bankruptcy case.\523\ Bankruptcy trustee 
S.J. Beaulieu, Jr. presided over the hearing, which was 
attended by Judge Porteous and his attorney Lightfoot. At the 
beginning of the hearing, Judge Porteous was provided with a 
copy of a pamphlet entitled ``Your Rights and Responsibilities 
in Chapter 13.''\524\ Section 6 of this pamphlet discussed 
credit while in Chapter 13 and specifically provided:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \523\Trustee's Memo to Record, Docket No. 7, In the Matter of 
Porteous, Case No. 01-12363 (Bankr. E.D. La. May 9, 2001) (Ex. 129). A 
section 341 creditors meeting is a statutorily mandated meeting of 
creditors and equity security holders that is held by the bankruptcy 
trustee. See 11 U.S.C. Sec. 341 (2003). Lightfoot explained during his 
Task Force testimony that the purpose of a section 341 creditors 
meeting is to examine the debtor under oath regarding his petition and 
bankruptcy schedules. Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 49.
    \524\See Creditors Meeting Hearing Transcript (indicating that 
Judge Porteous was given a copy of the pamphlet) (Ex. 130); see also 
Chapter 13 Pamphlet (Ex. 148). During his testimony before the Fifth 
Circuit Special Committee, Judge Porteous acknowledged receiving the 
pamphlet from the bankruptcy trustee. See Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 60 
(Ex. 10).

        You may not borrow money or buy anything on credit 
        while in Chapter 13 without permission from the 
        bankruptcy Court. This includes the use of credit cards 
        or charge accounts of any kind. If you or a family 
        member you support buys something on credit without 
        Court approval, the Court could order the goods 
        returned.\525\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \525\Chapter 13 Pamphlet at SC00402 (Ex. 148).

    Judge Porteous was thereafter placed under oath and asked 
if everything in his bankruptcy filing was true and correct. 
Judge Porteous stated, ``yes.'' Judge Porteous was also 
specifically asked if he listed all of his assets in his 
bankruptcy filing, and again he answered ``yes.'' He also 
affirmed that his take home pay was ``about $7,500 a 
month.''\526\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \526\Creditors Meeting Hearing Transcript at SC00595-96 (Ex. 130).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The bankruptcy trustee made it clear to Judge Porteous that 
he was no longer allowed to incur any new debt or to buy 
anything on credit. Specifically, the trustee told Judge 
Porteous that he was ``on a cash basis now.''\527\ Judge 
Porteous did not disclose at the hearing that between the time 
of filing for bankruptcy and the date of the Creditors Meeting 
he had incurred additional debt by taking out markers at 
casinos--one of which he paid back by way of a transaction that 
bypassed his personal accounts altogether. Nor did he disclose 
that he had increased a credit line, that he had concealed a 
credit card in his bankruptcy filing, or that he had 
outstanding markers at Harrah's Casino on the date of the 
meeting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \527\Creditors Meeting Hearing Transcript at SC00598 (Ex. 130). 
During his Fifth Circuit testimony, Lightfoot confirmed that both he 
and the bankruptcy trustee advised Judge Porteous about not incurring 
new debt without permission. Lightfoot 5th Cir. Hrg. at 454 (Ex. 124); 
Lightfoot Dep. at 13-14 (Ex. 123).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite this admonition by the bankruptcy trustee, and 
despite the clear language in the ``Rights and 
Responsibilities'' pamphlet stating that he was not allowed to 
borrow money, Judge Porteous continued to gamble, to take out 
casino markers, and to incur new debt after the Creditors 
Meeting on May 9, 2001. Judge Porteous's activities between May 
9, 2001 and June 28, 2001 included the following:

         LMay 16, 2001--Judge Porteous took out a $500 
        marker at Treasure Chest. He repaid the marker the same 
        day in chips.\528\

F. The June 28, 2001 Confirmation of Judge Porteous's Bankruptcy Plan, 
              and Judge Porteous's Violations of the Order

1. The Order's Prohibition Against Judge Porteous Incurring New Debt
    On June 28, 2001, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William 
Greendyke\531\ signed an Order Confirming the Debtor's Plan and 
Related Orders (the ``June 28 Order''). Among its terms, the 
June 28 Order prohibited Judge Porteous from incurring new debt 
without the permission of the trustee:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \531\Judge Greendyke is now in private practice with the law firm 
of Fulbright & Jaworski LLP. Prior to entering private practice in 
2004, Judge Greendyke was the Chief Judge of the United States 
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. He was specially 
assigned Judge Porteous's bankruptcy case to avoid having the case 
heard by a bankruptcy judge from the Eastern District of Louisiana. 
Judge Greendyke was interviewed by Impeachment Task Force staff on 
January 7, 2009.

        The debtor(s) shall not incur additional debt during 
        the term of this Plan except upon written approval of 
        the Trustee. Failure to obtain such approval may cause 
        the claim for such debt to be unallowable and non-
        dischargeable.\532\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \532\Order Confirming the Debtor's Plan and Related Orders, Docket 
No. 22, In the Matter of Porteous, Case No. 01-12363 (Bankr. E.D. La. 
June 28, 2001) (hereinafter ``June 28 Order'') (Ex. 133).

    Judge Porteous testified he understood the June 28 Order at 
the time the order was entered.\533\ Judge Porteous's 
understanding that he needed the bankruptcy trustee's 
permission to incur new debt is evidenced by the fact that on 
at least two separate occasions he sought and received such 
permission.\534\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \533\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 62 (Ex. 10). Lightfoot also 
testified before the Impeachment Task Force that Judge Porteous was 
aware the June 28 Order had been entered and that Judge Porteous had 
received a copy of the Order.
    \534\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 50. First, on December 20, 2002, the 
bankruptcy trustee granted Judge Porteous's request to refinance his 
home. (See Ex. 339.) And second, on January 2, 2003, the bankruptcy 
trustee granted Judge Porteous's request to obtain two new car leases. 
(See Ex. 340).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Judge Greendyke's Decision to Sign the Confirmation Order
    Judge Greendyke was asked about his decision to sign the 
June 28 Order, confirming Judge Porteous's Chapter 13 plan, 
during his Fifth Circuit testimony:

        Q. LGiven the sum of these events--the false filing of 
        the name on the initial petition, the omission of the 
        tax refund on the schedules where it should be noted, 
        the preferred payment to certain creditors. . . .

                              *    *    *

    Given the sum of those events, had you known that, what 
would have been your course of action while you were the judge 
supervising that bankruptcy? Had you known all those events, 
what action would you have taken?

        A. LIf I had been aware of those items prior to the 
        signing of the confirmation order, I would not have 
        signed the confirmation order. I would probably have 
        sua sponte objected on the basis of lack of good faith. 
        I anticipate if my Houston trustee had been aware of 
        that he would have filed a similar objection. And we 
        would have had a hearing to try and iron things out.

        Q. LAnd in bankruptcy filings, is good faith on behalf 
        of the debtor one of the key elements that the judge 
        and the trustee rely on?

        A. LIt's a confirmation requirement.\535\

    In response to questioning by Chief Judge Jones, Judge 
Greendyke further testified that he did not scrutinize Judge 
Porteous's bankruptcy as closely as he normally would have 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
because Judge Porteous was a Federal judge:

        Q. LI assume you attributed a higher--a certain level 
        of integrity to this filing because the subject in 
        quest was a Federal judge?

        A. LI did not scrutinize it----

        Q. LRight.

        A. L--particularly because I thought it was a judge and 
        I----

        Q. LBecause you thought a judge would turn square 
        corners?

        A. LYes, Judge. That's why I was surprised when I found 
        out the things I found out.\536\

3. Violations of the June 28 Order
    Judge Porteous was subject to the terms of his Chapter 13 
repayment plan for 3 years.\537\ Notwithstanding Judge 
Greendyke's Order that ``[t]he debtor(s) shall not incur 
additional debt during the term of this Plan except upon 
written approval of the Trustee,'' Judge Porteous: (1) took out 
42 markers over the course of 14 different gambling trips at 4 
different casinos, (2) applied to increase his credit limit at 
one of those casinos and thereafter utilized his increased 
credit line, and (3) obtained and used a new low-limit credit 
card. He did not have the permission of the trustee or the 
bankruptcy court to engage in these activities.

    \537\See Discharge of Debtor After Completion of Chapter 13 Plan, 
Docket No. 49, In the Matter of Porteous, Case No. 01-12363 (Bankr.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            a. Casino Markers
    After the June 28 Order was issued, Judge Porteous 
continued to gamble and to take out markers, i.e., incur debt, 
at casinos on a regular basis. He obtained these markers on his 
existing lines of credit at the casinos, and on occasion sought 
an increase on a line of credit.\538\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \538\See Central Credit, Inc. Gaming Report for Judge Porteous (Ex. 
326). Agent Horner explained during his Task Force testimony that 
gamblers are required to fill out credit applications before they can 
take out markers at casinos, and these applications are very similar to 
credit card applications. Horner TF Hrg. II at 13.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Porteous took out at least 42 markers between July 
19, 2001 and July 5, 2002. The following table summarizes Judge 
Porteous's gambling activity during the first year following 
the June 28 Order:\539\

(October 13, 2001 markers); Ex. 316 (October 17-18, 2001 markers); Ex. 
318 (November 27, 2001 markers); Ex. 319 (December 11, 2001 markers); 
Ex. 322 (April 1, 2002 markers). The documents related to the Harrah's 
transactions are marked as follows: Ex. 314 (September 28, 2001 
markers); Ex. 320 (December 20, 2001 markers). The documents related to 
the Beau Rivage transaction are marked as Ex. 317 (October 31-November 
1, 2001 markers). The documents related to the Grand Casino Gulfport 
transactions are marked as Ex. 321 (February 12, 2002 markers), Ex. 323 
(May 26, 2002 markers), and Ex. 325 (July 4-5, 2002 markers). At the 
Task Force Hearing, the total dollar amounts of the markers were 
erroneously added up to be in excess of $149,000.


    Judge Porteous repaid his October 17-18, 2001 debt to 
Treasure Chest using his undisclosed Fidelity money market 
account. As Table 7 shows, Judge Porteous left Treasure Chest 
on October 18, 2001, owing $4,400. The following week, on 
October 25, 2001, Judge Porteous withdrew $1,760 from his IRA. 
He received those funds by check and, on October 30, 2001, he 
deposited the check into his Fidelity money market account. On 
November 9, 2001, he repaid Treasure Chest with $2,600 cash and 
a $1,800 personal check from the Fidelity money market account 
into which he had deposited the IRA proceeds.\540\

Fidelity money market account to repay Treasure Chest are marked as Ex. 
381.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    During his Task Force Deposition, Lightfoot explained that 
a marker is a form of indebtedness owed to a creditor, that it 
was clearly prohibited by the June 28 Order, that at no time 
did Judge Porteous inform him that he [Judge Porteous] had 
taken markers, and that if the Judge had so informed him, it 
would have been significant.

        Q. LIs there any question in your mind that a marker is 
        a form of indebtedness owed to a creditor?

        A. LNone whatsoever.

                              *    *    *

        Q. LAnd if he had ever asked you, by the way, is a 
        marker a form of indebtedness which has to be 
        disclosed, what would you have said?

        A. LI'd say--I would have told him that it's a civil 
        liability that has to be disclosed because it's a debt, 
        but that there are other issues about if you can't pay 
        it, it may be the subject of some sort of criminal bad 
        check prosecution that you need to look into.

        Q. LOkay. But there's no question it's a form of debt, 
        correct?

        A. LAt a minimum it's that, and at a maximum it could 
        be worse.\541\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \541\Lightfoot Dep. at 9-10 (Ex. 123). See also Lightfoot TF Hrg. 
II at 64 (``No doubt at all'' that a marker is a form of indebtedness.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Porteous was questioned about his understanding of a 
marker before the Fifth Circuit Special Committee, and he 
accepted as accurate the following definition:

        A marker is a form of credit extended by a gambling 
        establishment, such as a casino, that enables the 
        customer to borrow money from the casino. The marker 
        acts as the customer's check or draft to be drawn upon 
        the customer's account at a financial institution. 
        Should the customer not repay his or her debt to the 
        casino, the marker authorizes the casino to present it 
        to the financial institution or bank for negotiation 
        and draw upon the customer's bank account any unpaid 
        balance after a fixed period of time.\542\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \542\Porteous 5th Cir. Hrg. at 6465 (Ex. 10).

Judge Porteous's knowledge that a marker constituted an 
unsecured debt is further evidenced by his pre-bankruptcy 
efforts to ensure that there were no markers outstanding when 
he filed for bankruptcy.
    While Judge Porteous repaid some of these markers on the 
same day they were taken out, those markers were no less an 
extension of credit than the markers that were not repaid until 
some time later. As Chief Judge Keir explained during his Task 
Force testimony:

        [T]he debt is incurred when the marker is taken. That 
        is when the debt arises. You owe the money. And it is 
        the incurrence of debt that was prohibited by the 
        order. It was not qualified by saying ``unless you pay 
        it off within the same day,'' or any other words, such 
        as if you pay it off in the same session or something. 
        It is the incurrence of debt. And, of course, when the 
        marker was taken out, there is no way that Judge 
        Porteous knew he was going to be able to or not going 
        to be able to pay it from a particular source or at a 
        particular time. It was gambling. There is a chance. So 
        the only real event in terms of his disobedience of the 
        order was the obtaining of the marker.\543\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \543\Keir TF Hrg. II at 78.

            b. Judge Porteous's Application for a New Credit Card
    On August 13, 2001--less than 2 months after Judge 
Greendyke's June 28 Order was entered--Judge Porteous applied 
for a new Capital One credit card. The credit card carried a 
$200 credit line. Judge Porteous began using it immediately for 
dining out, clothing purchases, theater tickets, gasoline, and 
groceries, among other things.\544\ In May 2002, Judge 
Porteous's credit line was increased to $400, and in November 
2002, it was increased again to $600.\545\

    Judge Porteous never sought permission from the bankruptcy 
trustee to apply for this credit card. When asked about a 
debtor's request to obtain a new credit card, bankruptcy 
trustee S.J. Beaulieu told the FBI that he objects to all new 
credit applications by debtors and sends the application to the 
bankruptcy judge.\546\

    On July 4, 2002, Judge Porteous succeeded in increasing his 
credit limit at the Grand Casino Gulfport from $2,000 to 
$2,500.\547\ Immediately thereafter, Judge Porteous gambled at 
the casino and took out the full $2,500 in markers.

4. Lightfoot's Knowledge of Judge Porteous's Post-June 28 Conduct
    Judge Porteous did not tell Lightfoot that he had taken out 
markers, applied for a credit card, or sought credit line 
increases at casinos. When asked at the Task Force Hearing 
whether he would have considered these acts violations of Judge 
Greendyke's Confirmation Order, Lightfoot responded: ``They 
clearly would have been.''\548\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \548\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 51.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       G. Intent and Materiality

1. Intent
    There are numerous reasons to conclude that the instances 
of falsity on the Bankruptcy Schedules and Statement of 
Financial Affairs, and the acts in violation of the June 28 
Order, were committed by Judge Porteous knowingly and with 
intent to deceive and defraud.
    First, prior to bankruptcy, Judge Porteous had on numerous 
other instances signed forms and documents with false 
information in an effort to conceal material facts. For 
example, he signed false documents in connection with his 
background check to become a Federal judge (and made other 
false statements to the FBI). On an annual basis, he also 
signed false Financial Disclosure Reports that, among other 
things, concealed his debts.\549\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \549\As Mr. Schiff noted at the markup:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Our investigation also uncovered that Judge Porteous 
      falsely reported the full extent of his liabilities in his 
      required financial disclosure reports. These debts, which 
      arose from Judge Porteous'[s] gambling problem, provided 
      further evidence of his willful efforts to conceal his 
      financial situation and the extent of his gambling over the 
      years.
        Taken together, it is clear that his false statements in 
      the bankruptcy proceedings were not the result of an 
      oversight or mistake, but reflected instead intentional and 
      willful conduct to conceal his financial affairs and his 
      gambling.

Markup of H. Res. 1031 [and other bills], House Committee on the 
Judiciary (Hearing Transcript, Jan. 27, 2010) at 33, available at 
http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/transcripts/transcript100127.pdf.
    Second, the fact that Judge Porteous was dishonest and 
acted with the intent to conceal and deceive in connection with 
filing his Initial Petition under a false name and misleading 
address supports the conclusion that the other false statements 
at issue were made with a similar intent.
    Third, throughout the workout process and up to the time of 
filing for bankruptcy in March 2001, Judge Porteous updated 
Lightfoot as to the full extent of his credit card debts (with 
the exception of the Fleet card, which Judge Porteous concealed 
entirely), and he did so as late as March 2001 so as to include 
the most current March credit card balances as of the date of 
filing. As Lightfoot explained:

        [H]e had a practice of providing me with updated credit 
        card statements. Every so often I would get another 
        collection and I would adjust the balances, because the 
        accrual of interest was making them get larger.\550\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \550\See also Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 43.

Though Judge Porteous updated Lightfoot on his credit card 
debts, he did not update Lightfoot on income and assets 
(including the tax refund), and did not provide information 
that would disclose his gambling activities. Thus, the evidence 
demonstrates that Judge Porteous was careful in picking and 
choosing the information he would tell his attorney--informing 
Lightfoot only what he wanted him to know and, more to the 
point, concealing what he did not want to reveal.
    Fourth, Judge Porteous is a Federal judge who has presided 
over bankruptcy matters. Whether some of the acts under 
scrutiny can be explained as a good faith mistake if committed 
by someone of lesser sophistication, Judge Porteous was well 
aware of the significance of the documents he was signing and 
he well understood that he was signing them under penalty of 
perjury.
    Fifth, the omissions and false statements concerning 
gambling activities are consistent with, and are explained by, 
Judge Porteous's powerful motives to keep those activities 
secret from his attorney, from his creditors, and from the 
bankruptcy trustee and judge. Judge Porteous may not have known 
precisely what would happen if his attorney and creditors 
learned of his gambling, but there is little question that he 
would have anticipated that the result would have been further 
scrutiny into his finances and potentially court ordered 
restrictions on his gambling.
    Indeed, Lightfoot testified that it would have been very 
important to him to learn of Judge Porteous's gambling, and 
that such information not only would have triggered numerous 
other questions, but would have resulted in his admonishing 
Judge Porteous that he could no longer gamble and take on debt 
to do so. When asked by Mr. Goodlatte what he would have done 
had he learned that Judge Porteous gambled, Lightfoot 
testified:

        A. LI would want to know where are the gambling debts. 
        They must be listed. You can't gamble anymore. You 
        can't incur debt to gamble. Those admonitions. Have we 
        listed all of the debts or do you have--And then I 
        would get into the area of the markers. Because the 
        markers, although they are a civil liability to pay, as 
        you were explaining, they also could--if the marker is 
        put through as a check and it bounces and then you have 
        a bad check, which is a more serious problem.

        Q. LTell me what sorts of questions you would have 
        asked him and what advice you would have given him if 
        he told you he was a frequent gambler?

        A. LWell, I would have told him exactly what--do you 
        have any gambling debts that you haven't told me about? 
        If so, I need the name, address, account number, 
        balance due. Are you doing it now? Because your budget 
        will not work if you gamble. You have no authority to 
        make any debts to gamble.\551\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \551\Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 64. See also Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 
48-49.

    Judge Keir testified that if Judge Porteous had disclosed 
the preferred payments to creditors on his Statement of 
Financial Affairs, he would have run the risk that the trustee 
would have sought to void those transfers and bring those 
payments back into the bankruptcy estate.\552\ The casinos 
would thus be treated the same as other unsecured creditors, 
and would have received less than full payment on the 
markers.\553\ Further, a default to one casino would jeopardize 
Judge Porteous's credit at all casinos. As Agent Horner 
testified, the various casinos participate in a centralized 
credit system, and ``if a gambler gets a negative history on 
his central credit report, what happens is the other casinos 
generally cut him off.''\554\

occasion do actually launch these adversary proceedings to recover back 
from the preferred creditor all of the money, and then the creditor has 
to wait and get their aliquot share from distributions under the 
plan.''). Lightfoot TF Hrg. II at 54.
    \554\Horner TF Hrg. II at 19.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thus, the conduct discussed in this Section is not simply a 
variety of isolated and unrelated insignificant omissions that 
can be characterized as mere mistakes. Rather, the omissions 
and false statements form a sophisticated and coherent pattern 
of deception that demonstrates a determined effort by Judge 
Porteous to pick and choose those aspects of the Federal 
bankruptcy laws with which he would honestly comply and those 
which he would disregard.
    Judge Porteous's conduct consisted of calculated acts at 
every juncture associated with his bankruptcy. These include:

         LHis failure to be truthful to his attorney at 
        the very outset as to his gambling debts and as to the 
        Fidelity money market account;

         LHis conduct in the days immediately preceding 
        his filing the Initial Petition (having Danos pay off 
        the Fleet Card, obtain the P.O. Box, and paying off 
        Treasure Chest markers);

         LHis causing false statements and omissions to 
        be made on the Initial Petition, the Bankruptcy 
        Schedules, and the Statement of Financial Affairs, and 
        swearing to those documents under penalty of perjury;

         LHis secretly incurring gambling debt after 
        filing for bankruptcy but prior to the Creditors 
        Meeting, and paying off some of this debt by directing 
        that a check constituting a withdrawal from his IRA be 
        endorsed to Danos, and having her write the check 
        paying the casino;

         LHis false swearing to the accuracy of the 
        documents he had previously signed, and acknowledging 
        his understanding of the requirement that he was on a 
        ``cash basis now'' at the Creditors Meeting;

         LHis applying for and taking out debt at 
        casinos, applying for and using a personal credit card 
        in violation of the June 28 Confirmation Plan Order, 
        and his using his concealed Fidelity money market 
        account to pay some of those debts.

    Notwithstanding his knowledge that Chapter 13 bankruptcies 
are to be characterized by providing to the creditors all 
disposable income, Judge Porteous knowingly enjoyed substantial 
disposable income, while creditors were left receiving only a 
portion of what he owed them, and less than what they would 
have received had he been honest and acted in good faith.
2. Materiality
    Notwithstanding the willfulness of Judge Porteous's 
conduct, a question at the Task Force Hearing was raised as to 
the ``materiality'' of the false statements and omissions. For 
example, Judge Porteous's attorney sought to make the point in 
his examination of the witnesses that even though Judge 
Porteous filed under a false name, the casinos would have 
ultimately learned of the bankruptcy if they had run a credit 
check that included Judge Porteous's Social Security 
number.\555\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \555\Horner TF Hrg. II at 29-30.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The false statements were material for numerous reasons. 
First and foremost, one requirement for obtaining bankruptcy 
relief is that the debtor act in ``good faith.'' Dishonesty in 
the filing of bankruptcy petitions is the antithesis of good 
faith. Bankruptcy Judge Greendyke was asked about his decision 
to sign the June 28 Order during his Fifth Circuit testimony, 
and indicated that if he knew all the facts concerning Judge 
Porteous's conduct, he ``would probably have sua sponte 
objected on the basis of lack of good faith.''\556\ Lightfoot 
testified that one of the reasons he instructed Judge Porteous 
pre-bankruptcy to stop taking on debt was because of this 
``good faith'' requirement:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \556\Greendyke 5th Cir. at 384-86 (Ex. 335). Judge Keir would have 
done the same: ``It is a requirement under section 1325 that the plan 
be proposed in good faith. The plan, based upon falsehoods like this, 
is not proposed in good faith and the confirmation would have been 
denied right at that point.'' Keir TF Hrg. II at 74.

        Well, by the time someone is in a financial distress 
        sufficient to be consulting about a bankruptcy, it is 
        not good faith for such a person to continue making 
        debt. So I always admonish them not to do it anymore, 
        not to make any more credit card charges, et 
        cetera.\557\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \557\Lightfoot Hrg. II at 43.

    Second, if Judge Porteous had disclosed accurate 
information, the proceedings could have taken an entirely 
different course. For example, the trustee could have ordered 
that the undisclosed tax refund be distributed to the 
creditors, or could have determined that the payment plan 
should be increased to account for that additional amount in 
Judge Porteous's possession, or that Judge Porteous was over-
withholding and thus had more disposable income. ``But, by 
hiding [the refund], he both falsified the amount that the plan 
was going to have to pay and took away from the trustee the 
opportunity to obtain the funds to make sure creditors got 
those funds.''\558\ Or, as Judge Keir explained, by filing 
under a false name and by using a P.O. Box, Judge Porteous had 
``falsified the official record of the United States court.'' 
Accordingly, between the time Judge Porteous filed his Initial 
Petition and his Amended Petition, a lender's credit inquiry 
would likely have failed to reveal that Judge Porteous had in 
fact filed for bankruptcy.\559\ By failing to disclose the 
Fleet card, he deprived Fleet of the accurate information 
whereby it could decide whether it would wish to cancel Judge 
Porteous's account.\560\ Alternatively, if Judge Porteous had 
disclosed payments to casinos within the 90 days of filing, the 
trustee may have decided to sue to recover those payments so 
that those casinos would not end up getting ``a greater return 
dollar for dollar than unsecured creditors generally in the 
case.''\561\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \558\Keir TF Hrg. II at 70-71. As Judge Keir explained:

      So if you hide $4,100 of your assets, you're reducing the 
      amount that the trustee is going to calculate in making a 
      recommendation to the court as to how high the plan payment 
      has to be. The second thing is, of course, a tax refund is 
      effectively cash to put into your account. You can spend 
      it. If you spend it and then your case for some reason was 
      converted to Chapter 7, it is not going to be available to 
      creditors. It is gone. So, often, at least in my district, 
      the trustee will take the position and if not agreed will 
      file a motion asking for a court order that the refund be 
      paid into the trustee upon receipt and, as in effect, part 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      of the payment required into the plan.

    Third, if Judge Porteous had been truthful as to his 
gambling activities, he may have invited further and more 
pointed scrutiny of all his financial affairs, bringing to 
light his actual income and tax refund--the sort of scrutiny 
that was not conducted in part because he was so careful and 
thorough in removing evidence of his gambling from his 
bankruptcy filings, and because it was assumed that as a 
Federal judge, he would turn square corners. Judge Keir 
explained that the bankruptcy system depends on the honesty of 
the debtors in disclosing financial information. Judge Keir 
testified:

        All of this information is sworn to under penalty of 
        perjury. So they [the debtors] are taking a court oath 
        as to all of this, and this provides the essential 
        information that both the creditors and the trustee can 
        then use to decide whether further investigation by way 
        of the examination or take action [by] filing [a] 
        particular action before the bankruptcy court. They 
        investigate the liabilities by asking questions of 
        other witnesses or seeking bank records, for example. 
        All of this activity would follow on based upon what 
        the debtor has revealed. It has to be complete or there 
        is no trail for the creditors and the trustee to 
        follow.\562\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \562\Keir TF Hrg. II at 68.

    Thus, ``the whole system demands and depends upon the 
honesty of the honest but unfortunate person who seeks 
relief.''\563\ Individuals can't just simply decide ``that they 
can do whatever they want, ignoring laws, and so long as you 
can't measure the particular damage of the violation, there is 
no violation at all. That would be chaos.''\564\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \563\Keir TF Hrg. II at 72. Keir explained by analogy: ``[If] one 
goes 110 miles an hour the wrong way down a one-way street but by good 
fortune doesn't hit anybody, they are not exonerated from their 
intentional misconduct for certain.'' Keir TF Hrg. II at 69.
    \564\Keir TF Hrg. II at 69-70. As one appellate court has noted: 
``Materiality does not require a showing that creditors are harmed by 
the false statements. . . . Matters are material if pertinent to the 
extent and nature of bankrupt's assets, including the history of a 
bankrupt's financial transactions. . . . Materiality is also 
established when it is shown that the inquiry bears a relationship to 
the bankrupt's business transactions or his estate . . . or concerns 
the `discovery of assets, including the history of a bankrupt's 
financial transactions.''' United States v. O'Donnell, 539 F.2d 1233, 
1237 (9th Cir. 1976). See also United States v. Gellene, 182 F.3d 578, 
587 (7th Cir. 1998) (``Materiality . . . does not require harm to or 
adverse reliance by a creditor, nor does it require a realization of a 
gain by the defendant. Rather it requires that the false oath or 
account relate to some significant aspect of the bankruptcy case or 
proceeding in which it was given, or that it pertain to the discovery 
of assets or to the debtor's financial transactions.'')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

XI. THE FACTS UNDERLYING ARTICLE IV--JUDGE PORTEOUS'S FALSE STATEMENTS 
                  IN CONNECTION WITH HIS CONFIRMATION

    In 1994, Judge Porteous, in connection with his nomination 
to be a Federal judge, was the subject of an FBI background 
check and was required to submit to interviews and fill out 
various forms and questionnaires.
    First, Judge Porteous filled out and signed a document 
entitled ``Supplement to Standard Form 86 (SF-86).'' That form, 
at question 10's, sets forth the following question and answer 
by Judge Porteous:

        [Question] Is there anything in your personal life that 
        could be used by someone to coerce or blackmail you? Is 
        there anything in your life that could cause an 
        embarrassment to you or to the President if publicly 
        known? If so, please provide full details?

        [Answer] NO\565\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \565\Porteous Background Check Documents, at PORT 00298 (part of 
Ex. 69(b)).

Judge Porteous signed that document under the following 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
statement:

        I understand that the information being provided on 
        this supplement to the SF-86 is to be considered part 
        of the original SF-86 dated April 27, 1994 and a false 
        statement on this form is punishable by law.\566\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \566\Porteous Background Check Documents, at PORT 00298 (part of 
Ex. 69(b)). The form is undated. The date ``April 27, 1994'' was 
written by hand. The Standard Form 86 is entitled ``Questionnaire for 
Sensitive Positions (For National Security).''

    Second, Judge Porteous, when interviewed by the FBI in July 
1994, was asked a series of standard questions designed to 
elicit derogatory information. The FBI Agent, in her write-up 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
of the interview, recorded Judge Porteous as stating:

          PORTEOUS said he is not concealing any activity or 
        conduct that could be used to influence, pressure, 
        coerce, or compromise him in any way or that would 
        impact negatively on the candidate's character, 
        reputation, judgement, or discretion.\567\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \567\Porteous Background Check Documents, at PORT 00294 (part of 
Ex. 69(b)).

    Third, Judge Porteous was interviewed a second time by the 
FBI on August 18, 1994, about concerns related to 1993 
allegations that he had received monies from an attorney and a 
bail bondsman to reduce bond. Again, in the FBI Agent's write-
up of that interview, Judge Porteous is recorded as stating 
``that he was unaware of anything in his background that might 
be the basis of attempted influence, pressure, coercion or 
compromise and/or would impact negatively on his character, 
reputation, judgement or discretion.''\568\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \568\Porteous Background Check Documents, at PORT 00493-94 (part of 
Ex. 69(b)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Fourth, on his United States Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary ``Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees,'' Judge 
Porteous was asked the following question and gave the 
following answer:

        [Question] Please advise the Committee of any 
        unfavorable information that may affect your 
        nomination.

        [Answer] To the best of my knowledge, I do not know of 
        any unfavorable information that may affect my 
        nomination.\569\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \569\Porteous Background Check Documents, at PORT 00049 (part of 
Ex. 69(a)).

The signature block in the form of an ``Affidavit,'' reads as 
follows:

                               AFFIDAVIT

          I, Gabriel Thomas Porteous, Jr., do swear that the 
        information provided in this statement is, to the best 
        of my knowledge, true and accurate.
          Gretna, Louisiana, this 6 day of September, 1994.

It is signed by Judge Porteous and by a notary.\570\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \570\Thus, both Louis Marcotte and Robert Creely have admitted 
making false statements when they were interviewed by the FBI in 
connection with Judge Porteous's background check. Each individual 
admitted not being candid as to their knowledge of Judge Porteous's 
drinking habits and his financial circumstances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These four statements each concealed that Judge Porteous 
had engaged in serious and potentially criminal misconduct on 
the bench on numerous occasions over several years. These acts 
involved his assigning curatorships to Creely as part of a 
kickback scheme. It also involved his setting bonds and setting 
aside convictions for the Marcottes as part of a course of 
conduct, quid pro quo relationship with them.

XII. OTHER THINGS OF VALUE RECEIVED BY JUDGE PORTEOUS AS A STATE COURT 
                                 JUDGE

    Judge Porteous's acceptance of other things of value from 
attorneys and parties, both as a State court judge and as a 
Federal judge, is relevant to his intent and to address a 
contention that the conduct discussed in Articles I and II 
constitute nothing more than a misinterpretation of Judge 
Porteous's friendship and his motives in relation to a few 
attorneys and the Marcottes.
    Attorney Leonard Cline was a plaintiff's attorney who, in 
the late 1980's, had at least three cases in front of Judge 
Porteous for which Judge Porteous awarded his clients large 
verdicts. In the mid-1990's, an attorney sued Cline, alleging, 
in substance, that Cline owed him a portion of the fees from 
one of the cases. In connection with that suit, Cline's 
secretary, Sharon Konnerup, gave a sworn statement in which she 
testified that Cline and Judge Porteous were friends, that 
Cline had given Judge Porteous a unique firearm which she had 
actually seen, and that Cline also paid for a cruise for Judge 
Porteous. Her testimony as to the firearm was as follows:

        Q. LDoes Mr. Cline or did Mr. Cline, at the time you 
        were working with him, have any kind of a relationship 
        with Judge Porteous?

        A. LThey were very good friends. Judge Porteous would 
        stop by the office every now and then.

        Q. LDid they go to lunch together?

        A. LYes, they did.

        Q. LDid Mr. Cline ever give any gifts to Judge 
        Porteous?

        A. LHe gave him a very, very, very unique shotgun that 
        had silver inscriptions on it, all silver scroll, 
        decorative.

        Q. LWas that during your tenure with Mr. Cline?

        A. LYes, it was.

        Q. Did you ever see the shotgun?

        A. LYes, I did.

        Q. LDid Mr. Cline tell you he had purchased it for 
        Judge Porteous?

        A. LYes, he did.\571\

Inc., et al, No. 322-619 (24th Jud. Dist. Ct., Jeff. Par., La., Sept. 
7, 1995)) (Ex. 234).

    Konnerup also testified that, based on discussions that she 
overheard, she believed that Cline had paid for a cruise for 
Judge Porteous.\572\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \572\Id. at 14-16.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Konnerup was deposed by Task Force Staff about this 
incident. At her deposition, Konnerup testified that she worked 
for Cline roughly between 1988 to 1990. She indicated her 
current recollection of events was not as clear as it was at 
the time of the 1995 sworn statement, but she did adopt her 
1995 prior statement, stating that she took the oath to tell 
the truth seriously, and she was confident she told the truth 
as she knew it at that time.\573\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \573\Konnerup Dep. at 5 (Ex. 194).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Attorney Cline, who was deposed by Task Force Staff, 
acknowledged having three cases in front of Judge Porteous. In 
the first, Judge Porteous awarded a verdict after a non-jury 
trial of ``[s]omething like a million dollars . . . or 
$800,000'' in May 1987 in a case where Cline's client suffered 
injuries after tripping over a manhole cover.\574\ In the 
second case, in May 1989, Judge Porteous awarded a default 
judgement of $1,461,105.18 to Cline's client. The case 
thereafter settled for about $450,000.\575\ In the third case, 
in June 1989, Judge Porteous awarded a verdict of $1.5 million 
to Cline's client in an automobile accident case, also after a 
non-jury trial. The award was reduced on appeal to about $1 
million.\576\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \574\Cline Dep. at 11 (Ex. 195). Judge Porteous actually awarded 
Cline's client $1,126,319.79 after a non-jury trial. The case is 
described on appeal at Tracy v. Jefferson Parish, 523 So.2d 266 (La. 
Ct. App. 1988) (Ex. 196(a)).

    \576\Cline Dep. at 18 (Ex. 195). That case was American Motorist 
Ins. Co. v. American Rent-all, No 322-619 (24th Jud. Dist Ct., Jeff.

1991) (Ex. 196(f)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Cline was asked at the Task Force deposition whether he 
ever gave Judge Porteous a firearm or a cruise. He claimed to 
have no recollection of doing so:

        Q. LNow in or about the 1988 to 1990 time frame do you 
        recall giving Judge Porteous any sort of hunting 
        weapon, be it a shotgun, a rifle, or any other hunting 
        weapon?

        A. LI have no recollection of that one way or another.

        Q. LAnd in or about the same time frame, do you recall 
        paying for a cruise for Judge Porteous?

        A. LI have no recollection of paying for a cruise one 
        way or the another.

                              *    *    *

           LMy best guess today is I have no recollection of 
        giving Judge Porteous a gun or a cruise. I have no 
        recollection one way or the other.

                              *    *    *

        Q. LIs it possible that you did?

        A. LI have no recollection.

        Q. L[S]o you're saying it is possible, you just don't 
        recall?

        A. LI have no recollection of doing that, and I just 
        can't answer that question. I don't know, I mean, I 
        don't have any recollection.\577\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \577\Cline Dep. at 21-22, 24-25 (Ex. 195). In contrast to Cline's 
lack of recollection as to whether he gave Judge Porteous a firearm or 
a cruise, Cline had a detailed memory of the facts of the Tracy v. 
Jefferson Parish case that took place in the late 1980's, which Cline 
described as follows:

      Q. [H]ow can you sue Jefferson Parish for somebody slipping 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      on a water meter manhole?

      A. Well, because the grass grew about 16 to 18 inches under 
      the cover, which means that the grass, when the cover's not 
      on it, there's not much light in there. So it takes a while 
      for the grass to grow 16 to 18 inches.

      So the [P]arish inspected the meters and read the meters 
      supposedly every month or whatever, every other month. I'm 
      not sure what the evidence showed back then. But it showed 
      that they had plenty of notice that the grass was under 
      there.

      And after we reported the accident, they came out and cut 
      all the grass and put a nice cover on there and took 
      pictures and said, ``Well, look, this is how it was.'' And, 
      of course, we already had pictures. We had an expert out 
      there, and that wasn't so.

Cline Dep. at 9-10 (Ex. 195).
    Cline testified he owned more that ten firearms, though he 
denied being a ``collector.''\578\

XIII. OTHER INSTANCES OF JUDGE PORTEOUS ACCEPTING THINGS OF VALUE FROM 
PARTIES AND ATTORNEYS WHILE A FEDERAL JUDGE, AND HIS NON-DISCLOSURE OF 
                           THOSE TRANSACTIONS

                            A. Introduction

    Judge Porteous's acceptance of things of value from 
attorneys with matters before him in the Liljeberg case was not 
an isolated incident. He also accepted hunting trips and 
expensive meals at high-end restaurants from parties, their 
attorneys, and even witnesses, without making appropriate 
disclosures to the opposing attorneys who appeared before him. 
Judge Porteous's acceptance of these things of value in cases 
in addition to the Liljeberg case provides additional evidence 
of his intent to inappropriately use his Federal judgeship to 
obtain personal benefits.

        B. Judge Porteous's Recusal Practices as a Federal Judge

    Judge Porteous had no procedures in place to recuse himself 
in the event of a conflict, in contrast to the practice of 
other Federal judges.
    Judge Porteous's courtroom clerk, Richard Windhorst, 
testified that he had previously clerked for District Court 
Judge Morey L. Sear, who provided Windhorst a ``conflict 
list.'' If a company on the list was a party in a case assigned 
to Judge Sear, Windhorst was instructed to call the clerk's 
office and have the case reassigned to another judge. Judge 
Richard Haik maintained a ``recusal list'' for the same 
purpose. As described later in this section, Judge Haik made 
sure to include on that list companies which provided him with 
hunting trips.\579\ In contrast, Judge Porteous had no such 
list and had no such procedures. He recused himself only on 
matters on which his sons, who were attorneys, were 
involved.\580\

C. The Alliance General Case and Other Cases Where Levenson Represented 
                                a Party

1. The Alliance General Case
    From 1996 to 1999, during roughly the same time that the 
Liljeberg case was pending before him, Judge Porteous was also 
presiding over Alliance General Insurance Co. v. Louisiana 
Sheriffs' Automobile Risk Program.\581\ In that case, which was 
filed in March 1996, the plaintiff, an insurance company, sued 
various Sheriffs Associations (``the Sheriffs''), attempting to 
void an auto insurance policy on the grounds that the Sheriffs 
made misrepresentations in procuring the policy as to the 
nature and extent of the claims. The Sheriffs were represented 
by Allen Usry. Usry, in turn, retained Levenson.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \581\Civ. No. 2:96-cv-00961-GTP (E.D. La.), filed March 15, 1995, 
closed May 28, 1999. See PACER Docket Report (Ex. 28).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    During the pendency of that case, Usry and/or Levenson 
invited Porteous on at least one, and perhaps two, hunting 
trips to Usry's Mississippi property. In May 1999, Judge 
Porteous decided a summary judgement motion in favor of the 
Sheriffs--Levenson's and Usry's client--which effectively ended 
the litigation. In December 1999, Levenson and/or Usry paid for 
Judge Porteous to hunt at the Blackhawk hunting facility.\582\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \582\This trip occurred while the Liljeberg case was under 
advisement with Judge Porteous.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Other Levenson Cases Before Judge Porteous
    Levenson had other cases with Judge Porteous as well, and 
in fact had cases pending before Judge Porteous at all times 
from March 20, 1996 (prior to his becoming involved in the 
Liljeberg case) through 2007.\583\ Judge Porteous's 
relationship with Levenson prior to and during the Liljeberg 
case has been described in prior sections. That same 
relationship, whereby Levenson frequently paid for Judge 
Porteous's meals, continued at least until 2003, when they 
traveled to Washington, D.C. for a Mardi Gras event.\584\ At no 
time in any case that Levenson had before Judge Porteous did 
Judge Porteous disclose to the opposing party that he had a 
close relationship with Levenson, that they had traveled 
together frequently (including during the pendency of the 
case), and that Levenson had paid for meals on those 
trips.\585\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \583\These were:

 G``First National Bank v. Evans, Civ. No. 2:96-cv-01006-GTP 
(E.D. La.), filed March 20, 1996, closed September 19, 1997. In this 
case, Judge Porteous appointed Levenson to represent a missing party. 
Levenson was paid approximately $470. See PACER Docket Report (Ex. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
28(c)); Levenson Dep. at 32-33 (Ex. 30).

 GJoseph v. Sears Roebuck & Co., Civ. No. 2:97-cv-001923-GTP 
(E.D. La.), filed January 21, 1997, closed July 24, 1998. Levenson did 
not recall this case. See PACER Docket Report (Ex. 28(d)); Levenson 
Dep. at 33 (Ex. 30).

 GLiberty Mutual Fire Insurance v. Ravannack, Civ. No. 2:00-cv-
01209-CJB-DEK. (E.D. La.), filed April 19, 2000, closed June 13, 2007. 
This complicated products liability case was reassigned from Judge 
Porteous to Judge Carl Barbier in 2006. See PACER Docket Report (Ex. 
28(e)); Levenson Dep. at 34 (Ex. 30).

 GHolmes v. Consolidated Companies, Inc., Civ. No. 2:00-01447-
GTP (E.D. La.), filed May 17, 2000, closed May 22, 2001. Levenson

D. Judge Porteous's Relationship with Richard Chopin and Acceptance of 
                  Hunting Trips from Diamond Offshore

1. Attorney Richard Chopin
    Attorney Richard Chopin was a friend of Judge Porteous for 
years. They first met when they taught trial advocacy at 
Louisiana State University Law School.\586\ They were perceived 
by others to be friends.\587\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \586\Chopin Dep. at 17-18 (Ex. 182).
    \587\Levenson Dep. at 28-29 (identifying Chopin as an attorney who 
took Judge Porteous to lunch) (Ex. 30); Gardner Dep. at 38 (identifying 
Judge Porteous and Chopin as friends) (Ex. 36). See also Baynham Dep. 
at 19 (``My understanding was that they had been friends for a long 
time.'') (Ex. 158); Danos Dep. I at 23 (Porteous and Chopin became 
friends when Porteous was a State judge) (Ex. 46); Danos Dep. I at 68 
(Chopin was one of the attorneys who took Judge Porteous to lunch on 
occasion) (Ex. 46).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Chopin wrote a letter to Second Circuit Judge Ralph Winter, 
dated March 28, 2008, supportive of Judge Porteous, in which 
Chopin described Judge Porteous as an ``outstanding judge'' and 
among ``one of finest judges before whom I have ever 
appeared.'' He stated he had never ``heard, seen or experienced 
any impropriety in Judge Porteous'[s] conduct'' and 
characterized the allegations against Judge Porteous as having 
the appearance of a ``witch hunt.'' Letter from Richard A. 
Chopin, Esq., to Hon. Ralph K. Winter, March 28, 2008 Chopin 
Dep. Ex. 58 (Ex. 258). Chopin also solicited other attorneys to 
write letters in support of Judge Porteous. Chopin Dep. at 70-
71 (Ex. 182); Chopin Dep. Ex. 59 (Ex. 259).
    Chopin testified that he took Judge Porteous out to lunch, 
but he stated that Judge Porteous reciprocated.\588\ Chopin 
also testified that Judge Porteous would have used a credit 
card to charge meals at expensive restaurants in the period 
subsequent to Judge Porteous filing for bankruptcy and when 
Judge Porteous was under court-ordered restrictions from 
incurring new debt.\589\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \588\Chopin claimed he and Judge Porteous split the costs of meals. 
Chopin is the only attorney interviewed who has stated that Judge 
Porteous paid for more than a small fraction of the meals. Chopin Dep. 
at 56-57, 65 (Ex. 182).
    \589\Chopin Dep. at 64-66 (``I'm going to assume [Judge Porteous] 
charge[d], but it could have been, you know, where we were just getting 
a sandwich and paid cash. But certainly he's charged them.'') (Ex. 
182). Chopin's representation that Judge Porteous paid for meals with 
him by credit card is not corroborated by any of Judge Porteous's 
credit card records in the Committee's possession.

    Diamond Offshore (``Diamond'') is an oil rig company with 
headquarters in Houston, Texas, that has been sued on occasion 
as a result of injuries to others or damage to property that 
occurs in the operation of Diamond's rigs. If the injuries or 
damages occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, the civil suits were 
frequently brought in the Eastern District of Louisiana, and 
would occasionally be assigned to Judge Porteous. Chopin was 
frequently retained by Diamond to defend the company in 
litigation.
3. 2000-2007--Judge Porteous Accepts Six Hunting Trips From Diamond
    Diamond owned or leased a hunting property in Texas that it 
used for entertainment purposes. In the late 1990's, Diamond 
arranged a hunting trip for attorneys and others in the claims 
management part of the business. Chopin was invited, and, 
according to a Diamond employee who had some responsibility for 
the trips, Chopin, in turn, recommended that Diamond invite 
Judge Porteous.\590\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \590\Chopin did not deny that he was the impetus to Diamond's 
inviting Judge Porteous, but testified that he did not remember doing 
that. Chopin Dep. 19-20 (Ex. 182).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The documentary evidence confirms that Diamond perceived 
Chopin to be associated with Judge Porteous in connection with 
these trips. In connection with Judge Porteous's attendance on 
the 2001 trip, the communications from Diamond to Judge 
Porteous concerning that trip stated that Judge Porteous could 
provide his information to Chopin and that Chopin would act as 
an intermediary.\591\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \591\Chopin Dep. at 21-22 (Ex. 182); Chopin Dep. Ex. 51 (Ex. 251). 
As late as November 15, 2006, Chopin was still involved in inviting 
Judge Porteous on these hunting trips. In an email to Diamond's General 
Counsel, Chopin wrote: ``. . . I had lunch with Judge Porteous 
yesterday and he asked if I heard anything about the hunt. . . . I know 
he would be thrilled to be invited again. . . .'' Diamond Documents at 
D0075 (Ex. 177).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Judge Porteous went on six Diamond-sponsored hunting trips. 
These occurred in early January in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 
2006, and 2007. In each of these 6 years, Chopin was also 
present. Diamond documents reflect that Judge Porteous and 
Chopin shared a room on at least the 2005 and 2006 trips.\592\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \592\Porteous did not disclose the 2000, 2001 and 2003 Diamond 
hunting trips in his financial disclosure reports. He did disclose the 
hunting trips as gifts in his 2005, 2006 and 2007 his financial 
disclosure reports. See Exs. 106(a), 107(a), 109(a), 111(a), 112(a) and 
113. By 2006, Judge Porteous knew he was under a criminal 
investigation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In connection with the hunting trips, Diamond paid all of 
Judge Porteous's expenses. Diamond flew Judge Porteous, Chopin 
and others from New Orleans to the hunting facility in Texas. 
It provided air transportation (including by private aircraft), 
meals, lodging, and an open bar, and paid for hunting licenses 
if necessary. If the guest shot a deer, the deer would be 
cleaned and butchered, and the processed meat sent to the 
guest.\593\ The only expense a guest was required to cover was 
the cost of mounting a deer head if this service was requested.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \593\Bradley Dep. at 27-28 (Ex. 181).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Specific Cases Assigned to Judge Porteous Involving Diamond and/or 
        Chopin
    Notwithstanding the fact that Judge Porteous had started in 
January 2000 to attend all-expense-paid, high-end hunting trips 
sponsored by Diamond, he continued to preside over litigation 
in which Diamond was a named defendant, without disclosing his 
receipt of Diamond trips.\594\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \594\All the Diamond cases assigned to Judge Porteous either 
settled or were reassigned, so unlike the Liljeberg case, Judge 
Porteous had only limited opportunities to issue dispositive rulings in 
those cases. Thus, no particular ruling by Judge Porteous has been 
subject to judicial scrutiny in his handling of the Diamond cases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Diamond cases in front of Judge Porteous (since he 
first started attending the Diamond hunting trips) include:

         LSylve v. Oceaneering Int'l, Inc., British 
        Borneo Exploration, and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. 
        was filed March 1999.\595\ Even though Diamond was a 
        named defendant, any liability on Diamond's part would 
        have been covered by an insurance policy. The insurance 
        company (Oceaneering International) was thus 
        responsible for managing the defense. However, Diamond 
        was not dismissed from the case. Diamond took Judge 
        Porteous hunting in January 2000, while the case was 
        pending and 2 months prior to trial. Trial commenced 
        March 13, 2000, and the parties settled on March 14, 
        2000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \595\Civ. No. 2:99-cv-00841-GTP (E.D. La.). See PACER Docket Report 
(Ex. 180(d)).

         LBoothe v. Diamond Offshore Mgt. was filed 
        February 20, 2001.\596\ Diamond was represented by 
        Chopin. This case was filed about a month after Judge 
        Porteous had attended his second Diamond hunting trip 
        with Chopin in January 2001. A year later, in February 
        2002, the case was reassigned from Judge Porteous to 
        Judge Jay C. Zainey.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \596\Civ. No. 2:01-cv-00441-JCZ (E.D. La). See PACER Docket Report 
(Ex. 180(f)).

         LJohnson v. Diamond Offshore was filed in 
        September 2003 and was pending until March 2005.\597\ 
        Diamond was represented by Chopin until August 2004, at 
        which time Chopin was replaced by another attorney. In 
        January 2005, during the case's pendency, Judge 
        Porteous went on his fourth Diamond hunting trip. In 
        this case, as with the Sylve case above, Diamond was 
        indemnified by a third party. The case settled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \597\Civ. No. 2:03-cv-02505-GTP-ALC. (E.D. La.). See PACER Docket 
Report (Ex. 180(g)).

         LJones v. Diamond Offshore was filed March 31, 
        2004 and was resolved in June 2006.\598\ In January 
        2005, during the pendency of the case, Judge Porteous 
        went on his fourth Diamond hunting trip. In 2006, the 
        case was reassigned from Judge Porteous to Judge Carl 
        Barbier and settled for a modest amount.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \598\Civ. No. 2:04-cv-00922-CJB-ALC (E.D. La.). See PACER Docket 
Report (Ex. 180(h)).

    Although Judge Porteous did not end up presiding over jury 
or non-jury trials involving Diamond, and was not otherwise 
significantly involved in determinations as to the liability of 
Diamond, in none of these four cases were the plaintiffs or 
their attorneys made aware that Judge Porteous had gone on 
hunting trips paid for by Diamond.
    One additional case, Farrar v. Diamond Offshore,\599\ 
deserves specific mention. Diamond was represented by Chopin in 
a personal injury case brought by plaintiff Farrar alleging 
negligence. The case was filed in March 2003--2 months after 
Judge Porteous had taken his third Diamond hunting trip (also 
attended by Chopin). The parties settled in April 2004 on terms 
acceptable to plaintiff's counsel, Peter Koeppel. However, 
Koeppel's observations illustrate the consequences of Judge 
Porteous's failure to disclose his relationship with both 
Diamond and Chopin. After testifying that he was unaware that 
Judge Porteous had gone on one or more hunting trips paid for 
by Diamond and attended by Diamond's counsel, Koeppel testified 
that if he had known of that fact, he would have felt 
``ethically . . . obligated to inform my client . . . to seek 
their consent in terms of either proceeding forward or advising 
the court to recuse himself.'' He further testified that 
information that the Judge had accepted a trip from Diamond 
would have been important to his clients: ``[P]eople who work 
out offshore on drilling rigs tend to be rather unsophisticated 
and wary of the legal system in general. I can't say that for 
every one of them, but in general. So it would be important to 
tell Them.''\600\

  D. Judge Porteous's Acceptance of Hunting Trips from Rowan Companies

1. Rowan, Baynham, Hedrick and Dr. Cenac
    Rowan Companies (``Rowan'') was an oil rig company with 
headquarters in Houston, Texas. It also owned and operated 
drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, and was on occasion sued 
for damages as a result of injuries or damages to property that 
occurred in the operation of the rigs. When the injuries or 
damages occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, civil suits were often 
brought in the Eastern District of Louisiana. On occasion, 
Judge Porteous was assigned these cases. Rowan, like Diamond, 
leased or owned a property in Texas and sponsored hunting trips 
for invited guests.
    The Rowan hunting trips were similar to the Diamond trips. 
Rowan paid for all expenses, including transportation to and 
from the location (by private plane on occasion), lodging, 
meals, liquor, hunting licenses, and meat processing.\601\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \601\Baynham Dep. at 5 (Ex. 158).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Bill Hedrick was the Rowan Vice President who supervised 
Rowan's claims management process, and was responsible for 
retaining outside counsel to defend Rowan in litigation. 
Hedrick would frequently retain T. Patrick Baynham, a New 
Orleans attorney, to represent Rowan. Baynham, like Chopin, 
specialized in maritime defense.\602\ In mid-November 2001, 
Hedrick met Judge Porteous for the first time at an overnight 
hunt at the camp of Dr. Christopher Cenac, Sr.\603\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \602\Their firm's offices are on the same floor in the same 
building. Chopin Dep. at 47-48 (Ex. 182). Over the years, Chopin and 
Baynham have represented both Rowan and Diamond.
    \603\Dr. Cenac is an orthopedist who is frequently retained by 
Diamond and Rowan, as well as Chopin and Baynham, as a medical expert 
witness. Hedrick recalled this hunt, and stated he perceived Judge 
Porteous and Dr. Cenac to be friends. Hedrick Dep. at 5-6 (Ex. 166). It 
is not known how Judge Porteous initially came to be friends with Dr. 
Cenac.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Hunting Trips and Meals with Rowan, Hedrick and Baynham
    On January 16, 2002, about 2 months after first meeting 
Judge Porteous, Hedrick paid for dinner with Judge Porteous and 
others. The bill was $392 at ``Eleven 79'' restaurant.\604\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \604\Hedrick's receipts and expense report for the meal have been 
obtained. See Rowan Documents at RH 000110-11 (Ex. 154). These contain 
a January 16, 2002 entry for ``Judge Porteous'' with the amount of $392 
and the corresponding receipt. Hedrick identified these documents in 
his deposition. Hedrick Dep. at 12 (Ex. 166); Hedrick Dep. Ex. 92 (Ex. 
292).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On November 4-7, 2002, Judge Porteous went hunting at the 
invitation of Hedrick at the Rowan hunting facility in Texas. 
Hedrick was also in attendance.\605\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \605\Several witnesses have described these trips. See Hedrick Dep. 
at 8-10 (Ex. 166); Baynham Dep. at 28-30 (Ex. 158) and Koeppel Dep. at 
11-13 (Ex. 183).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On January 16, 2003, Hedrick paid for dinner with Judge 
Porteous, his wife, and others. The bill was $591.36, again at 
Eleven 79.\606\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \606\Rowan Documents at RH000112-13 (Ex. 154). The first of those 
pages, RH 000112, references a January 16, 2002 entry for ``Judge 
Porteous'' with the amount of $591.36. The second page sets forth the 
corresponding receipt. Hedrick identified these documents in his 
deposition. Hedrick Dep. at 12-13 (Ex. 166); Hedrick Dep. Ex. 93 (Ex. 
293). Hedrick was reimbursed by Rowan for any meals he spent hosting 
Judge Porteous. These were treated as business expenses--presumably 
because it was in Rowan's corporate interest to have good relations 
with the Judge hearing some its cases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Hanna v. Rowan case before Judge Porteous
    On November 21, 2002--2 weeks after the first hunting 
trip--the complaint in Hanna v. Rowan Company Inc.\607\ was 
filed and assigned to Judge Porteous.\608\ This case involved a 
claim for damages allegedly sustained by plaintiff Hanna when a 
ladder on which he was climbing or standing broke, causing him 
to fall and injure his back. Rowan was represented by Baynham. 
As of the date the case was filed, Judge Porteous had already 
gone on the Rowan hunting trip, and had been the guest of the 
Rowan Vice President at two meals, where Rowan had paid $392 
and $591. This case was pending until August 2005, when 
settlement was reached in the midst of a jury trial.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    During the pendency of the case, on August 25, 2004, 
Hedrick again took Judge Porteous to lunch. Also in attendance 
was Magistrate Judge Daniel E. Knowles, III. This time, the 
meal was at the Steak Knife and the bill was $142.00.\609\ 
Then, on November 16-19, 2004, while the Hanna case was still 
pending, Judge Porteous attended another Rowan hunting trip, 
where Baynham and Hedrick were both in attendance.\610\

Judge Porteous in his 2004 Financial Disclosure Report, which he filed 
in May 2005. This report was filed while the Hanna case was pending and 
prior to the settlement of that case in August 2005. See Ex. 105(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A few days after the hunting trip, at Hedrick's suggestion, 
Baynham called Judge Porteous to arrange for a lunch for the 
three of them. It was scheduled for December 9, 2004, to 
coincide with the date of a scheduled settlement conference 
with the Magistrate Judge in the Hanna case.\611\

Judgment.\612\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hedrick was unable to attend the December 9, 2004 lunch. 
Baynham, knowing that Chopin was a friend of Porteous, asked 
Chopin to go in Hedrick's place. Baynham did not know Porteous 
well, so it made things easier for Baynham to invite Chopin. 
The three of them had what Baynham described as an ``extended 
lunch'' at Restaurant 1827. \613\ Neither Chopin nor Baynham 
could locate a receipt for this lunch. Baynham believed that 
Chopin must have paid for it,\614\ and Chopin believed that 
Baynham would have paid for it.\615\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \613\Baynham Dep. at 20 (Ex. 158). Chopin Dep. at 51 (Ex. 182). 
Both Baynham and Chopin described the lunch as including several 
drinks. Baynham informed Hedrick in an email the following day, 
December 10, 2004, that he had had an ``extended lunch'' with Judge 
Porteous. Baynham Dep. at 21 (Ex. 158); Baynham Dep. Ex. 68 (Ex. 268).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On March 24, 2005, while the Hanna case was still pending, 
Judge Porteous had yet another lunch with Hedrick. Hedrick's 
expense report reflects that this lunch also took place at 
Eleven 79 restaurant and cost $130.00.\616\

    In August 2005, the Hanna trial commenced, and settled mid-
trial. Hanna received a cash settlement. Hanna's attorney, 
Young, was satisfied with the settlement, so this is not a case 
like Liljeberg where a party or counsel was the recipient of an 
unfavorable verdict by Judge Porteous that was reversed by the 
Court of Appeals. Young testified that ``perhaps'' he would 
have wanted to know about the lunches, and ``most likely, yes'' 
he would have wanted to know about the hunting trips.\618\ He 
further testified that if he had known of this information, he 
would have discussed it with his client.\619\ Notably, Baynham 
himself stated that he expected Judge Porteous to recuse 
himself.\620\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In October 2006, the fact that Rowan took Judge Porteous 
hunting during the pendency of the Hanna case in 2004 was 
reported in the New Orleans Times-Picayune. In an article 
entitled ``Company Facing Suit Took Judge Hunting,'' the New 
Orleans Times-Picayune reported:

        In 2003, a seaman named Robert Hanna sued his employer, 
        an offshore drilling company, after stairs on one of 
        its ships collapsed beneath him and dropped him several 
        feet to the floor.

        His case against the Rowan Companies went to trial in 
        U.S. District Court in New Orleans in August 2005. 
        Within 2 days, attorneys announced they had agreed to a 
        settlement, the judge dismissed the jury and everyone 
        appeared to walk away satisfied.

        What Hanna might not have known, however, is that while 
        his personal injury suit was pending, well before trial 
        began, Rowan treated the presiding judge, Thomas 
        Porteous Jr., to a $1,000 hunting trip.\621\

    F. Turner v. Pleasant--Another Case Where Counsel Sought Judge 
                           Porteous's Recusal

1. Introduction
    In 2004, Judge Porteous faced a recusal motion in the case 
Turner v. Pleasant,\622\ arising from his relationship with 
Pleasant's attorney, Dick Chopin. Just as Lifemark's recusal 
motion in the Liljeberg case threatened to expose Judge 
Porteous's prior dealings with the attorneys in that case, the 
recusal motion in Turner v. Pleasant threatened Judge Porteous 
with the disclosure that he had been taking hunting trips from 
Diamond, including having gone on a Diamond hunting trip with 
defense counsel Chopin during the pendency of the case. As 
discussed below, there are striking similarities between how 
Judge Porteous handled the recusal motions in Turner v. 
Pleasant and Liljeberg.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \622\PACER Docket Report, Turner v. Pleasant, Civ. No. 2:01-cv-
03572-GTP (E.D. La.) (Ex. 179(a)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Background--Procedural History
    On November 30, 2001, the complaint in Turner v. Pleasant 
was filed. This was a personal injury case alleging that the 
defendant (Pleasant) operated his boat in a negligent fashion, 
causing an excessive wake that tossed Mrs. Turner in the air 
and caused her to sustain a compression fracture of her back.
    The plaintiffs were represented by Ernest Souhlas and his 
partner Carter Wright; the defendant was represented by Chopin. 
The defense medical expert was Dr. Christopher Cenac, with whom 
Judge Porteous had previously hunted and had a social 
relationship.\623\ On January 3-5, 2003, while the case was 
pending, Judge Porteous went on a Diamond hunting trip which 
Chopin also attended.\624\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \623\Also, when Turner v. Pleasant was pending, Dr. Cenac had been 
the King of Mardi Gras in Washington D.C. in 2003. Judge Porteous was a 
guest at that event.
    \624\Guest List for January 3-5, 2003, Diamond Hunting Trip, D0081 
(Ex. 177).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    About 3 months after Judge Porteous and Chopin went on the 
hunting trip, on April 22-23, 2003, a non-jury trial was held 
in the Turner case. Dr. Cenac was one of the defendant's 
medical experts.\625\

03572-GTP (E.D. La.) (Ex. 179(a)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Nearly 9 months after trial, on January 27, 2004, Judge 
Porteous issued his opinion in favor of the defendant.\626\ In 
reaching his decision, he specifically credited the testimony 
of Dr. Cenac.\627\

3. Souhlas's Motion for a New Trial and Motion to Recuse Judge Porteous
    After the April 2003 trial in Turner v. Pleasant, and while 
the case was awaiting Judge Porteous's decision, Souhlas 
learned that Judge Porteous had gone hunting with Chopin while 
the case was pending.\628\ Accordingly, on February 5, 2004, a 
week after Judge Porteous issued his decision, Souhlas filed a 
motion for a new trial and also moved to recuse Judge 
Porteous.\629\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \628\Souhlas testified that after he had tried the case, he ``was 
told by a person that they [Judge Porteous and Chopin] had a close 
personal relationship and they went on many hunting trips together'' 
and that was the first time he had been made aware of that fact. 
Souhlas Dep. at 14 (Ex. 185). Chopin did not include in any pleading an 
allegation that Souhlas was aware of the hunting trip at the time of 
the trial.
    \629\Plaintiffs' Motion for New Trial and/or Motion to Recuse, 
Turner v. Pleasant, Civ. No. 2:01-cv-03572-GTP (E.D. La., Feb. 7, 2004) 
(Ex. 179(d)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In that motion, after arguing that Judge Porteous's 
decision was contrary to the facts elicited at trial, Souhlas 
requested, in the alternative that ``this Court grant a new 
trial and recuse itself in this matter based upon . . . the 
grounds that the findings of fact and the conclusions of law 
reflect partially [sic: should be `partiality'] and bias in 
favor of the defendant and/or defense counsel in this 
case.''\630\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In his opposition to the motion, Chopin responded primarily 
by attacking Souhlas:

          In an act of desperation never previously witnessed 
        by the undersigned, the plaintiffs have vituperatively 
        attacked the Court and its integrity. Not only are the 
        plaintiffs' claims flagrantly in violation of all 
        rules, they are reprehensible. Moreover, the plaintiffs 
        do not even attempt to offer any support for their new 
        allegations.

                              *    *    *

          The defendants will not dignify the plaintiffs 
        allegations by according them any additional print, 
        except to say that the plaintiffs' motion for recusal 
        also should be denied.\631\

for New Trial and/or Motion to Recuse at 7, Turner v. Pleasant, Civ. 
No. 2:01-cv-02572-GTP (E.D. La., Feb. 17, 2004) (Ex. 179(e)).

    Souhlas, in his reply to Chopin's opposition, specifically 
addressed Chopin's contention that he (Souhlas) had not offered 
any support for his claims of bias. He specifically alleged 
that Judge Porteous ``may have a close personal relationship 
with defense counsel, Richard A. Chopin,'' that ``the 
relationship includes social contacts and hunting trips,'' and 
that ``some of the social contacts took place while this case 
was under advisement''\632\--assertions which were in fact 
true.

New Trial and/or Motion to Recuse at 3, Turner v. Pleasant, Civ. No. 
2:01-cv-02572-GTP (E.D. La., Feb. 17, 2004) (Ex. 179(f)). In fact, the 
hunting trip occurred while the case was pending trial.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On March 22, 2004, Judge Porteous denied Souhlas's motion. 
In doing so, he did not discuss or address any of the factual 
assertions, terming them ``unsubstantiated.'' Judge Porteous 
stated:

          To suggest that the Court has any partiality for the 
        defendant and/or defense counsel is utterly 
        unsubstantiated given that the Court has often 
        demonstrated its complete independence and the absence 
        of any partiality or favoritism in prior cases 
        involving defense counsel. Additionally, in a previous 
        non-jury case involving one of plaintiff's counsel, Mr. 
        Souhlas, where a substantial verdict was rendered in 
        favor of the plaintiff, there was no suggestion of any 
        partiality by the court towards plaintiffs' counsel, 
        even though he has been a friend of this judge for over 
        twenty years. This flagrant attack on the credibility 
        of this Court is not only unfounded and without merit, 
        but not supported by any evidence. This Court finds 
        that no reasonable man would harbor doubts about this 
        judge's impartiality, and therefore, recusal is not 
        warranted.\633\

GTP (E.D. La., Mar. 25, 2004) at 4 (emphasis supplied) (Ex. 179(g)). 
Judge Porteous referenced a personal injury case that Souhlas had filed 
in1996. The plaintiff in that case had stepped in a hole on a city 
street, resulting in permanent damage to his right leg. Judge Porteous 
awarded the plaintiff $650,000. The facts are set forth in Wykle v. 
City of New Orleans, 154 F.3d 416 (5th Cir. 1998).

4. Souhlas's Appeal to the Fifth Circuit
    Souhlas appealed to the Fifth Circuit, and raised the same 
issues as to Judge Porteous's relationship with Chopin that he 
had raised below. He argued that the factual allegations had 
neither been addressed nor disputed, by either Judge Porteous 
or Chopin, in the District Court proceedings.\634\

12, 2004) (Ex. 179(h)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In response, Chopin relied on Judge Porteous's language in 
his ruling denying the recusal, including Judge Porteous's 
statement that he and Souhlas had been friends for 20 
years.\635\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In his reply brief to the Fifth Circuit, Souhlas reasserted 
the specificity of his allegations, i.e., Judge Porteous's 
ongoing social relationship with and hunting trip with Chopin 
during the pendency of the proceedings. Souhlas further 
addressed Judge Porteous's contention that he and Judge 
Porteous were longtime friends, and specifically denied ``that 
a close personal relationship exists between plaintiffs' 
counsel and the District Court.''\636\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Discussion of Judge Porteous's Handling of the Recusal Motion in 
        Turner v. Pleasant
    It is noteworthy that at the time of Souhlas's motion, in 
February 2004, the Farrar v. Diamond case (a case with Chopin 
as Diamond's counsel that was discussed above) was pending in 
front of Judge Porteous. Thus, if either Chopin or Judge 
Porteous were to have disclosed that they had gone hunting 
together as guests of Diamond while the Turner case was 
pending, such a disclosure could have caused problems for Judge 
Porteous and Chopin in connection with the Farrar case (and 
also revealed that Judge Porteous had accepted prior Diamond 
trips as well).\639\ Accordingly, the entire thrust of Judge 
Porteous's (and Chopin's) response to Souhlas's allegations was 
to assert that the allegations were unproven (not that they 
were false), to disclose no relevant information which would 
permit a fair assessment of the merits of the recusal motion, 
and to attack Souhlas for raising the issue.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \639\A few weeks after Judge Porteous denied Souhlas's recusal 
motion, on April 20, 2004, Chopin settled the Farrar case with attorney 
Koeppel. See PACER Docket Report, Farrar v. Diamond Offshore Co., Civ. 
No. 2:03-cv-00782-GTP (E.D. La.) (Ex. 178).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Moreover, Judge Porteous's statement that Souhlas ``has 
been a friend of this judge for over twenty years'' deserves 
particular scrutiny--both for what Judge Porteous may have 
intended to be the legal or factual significance of that 
purported relationship, as well as for the veracity of the 
assertion. One reading of Judge Porteous's ``friend'' statement 
was that he intended to imply there was a symmetry between his 
relationship with Souhlas and his relationship with Chopin--the 
implication presumably being that if he were friends with both 
men then Souhlas's complaint could not be meritorious since 
Judge Porteous would have no more incentive to be partial to 
Chopin than to be partial to Souhlas.\640\ However, not only is 
this argument indefensible even if it were true; but Souhlas 
testified at a deposition that he was not a ``friend'' of Judge 
Porteous. Souhlas never went to lunch or dinner with Judge 
Porteous, never traveled with Judge Porteous on any trips, did 
not go to his swearing-in, had never been to Judge Porteous's 
house, had never had Judge Porteous to his house, had never 
invited Judge Porteous to his annual ``hoe-downs'' (events to 
which he invited a broad swath of the New Orleans legal 
community), and had never met Judge Porteous's wife--in fact, 
did not even know her name.\641\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \640\This is similar to Judge Porteous's line of questioning of 
Mole at the Fifth Circuit Hearing, in which he pointed out that 
Gardner, Lifemark's attorney, also went to Las Vegas as part of his 
son's bachelor party celebration, just as Amato did.
    \641\Souhlas Dep. at 18-21 (Ex. 185).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thus, as he did in the Liljeberg case, Judge Porteous, when 
faced with allegations that would threaten to disclose his 
relationship with parties and attorneys who had given him 
things of value, handled the motion in a manner calculated to 
seal off further inquiry into those relationships. He disclosed 
no pertinent material facts about his relationship with Chopin, 
failed to address the discrete allegations known and raised by 
the moving counsel, and made deceptive statements that 
distorted the factual record as to his relationship with the 
attorney at issue.\642\ By so distorting the record, Judge 
Porteous assured affirmance on appeal of his denial of the 
recusal motion, and a victory below for Chopin. Souhlas's 
clients were never informed by the Judge who denied them 
compensation for their serious injuries that he was a close 
friend and frequent lunch guest of the defendant's lawyer 
Chopin and had gone on a hunting trip with him while the case 
was pending and shortly prior to trial; nor were they informed 
that Judge Porteous had been a house guest of the defendant's 
expert witness, whose credibility was at issue.\643\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \642\In addition, the positions taken by counsels in the respective 
cases are remarkably similar: they attacked the moving party while 
offering no facts, even in response to specific allegations, and each 
counsel left it up to Judge Porteous to decide what would be disclosed. 
Chopin wrote, for example, that Souhlas ``vituperatively attacked the 
Court and its integrity,'' and characterized plaintiffs' claims as 
``reprehensible.'' Similarly, the Liljebergs characterized Lifemark's 
motion as containing ``unsubstantiated innuendo'' in support of a 
``scurrilous conclusion.'' Chopin, like counsel for the Liljebergs, 
offered no factual explanations, but argued that the relationship was 
not proven. Chopin wrote, for example: ``[P]laintiffs do not even 
attempt to offer any support for their new allegations.'' [Defendant's] 
Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for New Trial and/or 
Motion to Recuse at 7, Turner v. Pleasant, Civ. No. 2:01-cv-03572-GTP 
(E.D. La.), Feb. 17, 2004 (Ex. 179(e)). The counsel for the Liljebergs 
wrote: ``Lifemark's motion includes no evidence whatsoever pertaining 
to the Court's alleged affinity for [counsels] . . .'' Memorandum in 
Opposition to Lifemark's Motion to Recuse at 2, Lifemark Hospitals of 
La., Inc. v. Liljeberg Enterprises, Inc., No. 93-1794 (E.D. La.), Oct. 
15, 1996 (Ex. 53).
    \643\While Judge Porteous's hunting trips may superficially call to 
mind the duck-hunting trip that Justice Scalia and Vice President 
Cheney attended together while the case Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for 
Dist. of Columbia, No. 03-475 (Sup. Ct.) was pending, the situations 
are materially different. Vice President Cheney was named in an 
institutional capacity only, not in his individual capacity. As Justice 
Scalia explained:

      Richard Cheney's name appears in this suit only because he 
      was the head of a Government committee that allegedly did 
      not comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act . . . 
      and because he may, by reason of his office, have custody 
      of some or all of the Government documents that the 
      plaintiffs seek. If some other person were to become head 
      of that committee or to obtain custody of those documents, 
      the plaintiffs would name that person and Cheney would be 
      dismissed, and it was the prerogatives of the Office of the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Vice President that were at stake.

  Justice Scalia noted that the Vice President was represented by 
Government lawyers and that throughout the litigation, the Vice 
President's position had been described as the position of ``the 
government.'' Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Columbia, 541 
U.S. 913, 918 (2004) (Scalia, J., denying recusal motion). In contrast, 
Diamond and Rowan had substantial personal financial interests at stake 
in pending and future cases before Judge Porteous at times when Judge 
Porteous accepted their offers to spend money on him--money that came 
from the company treasuries and were expended in pursuit of their 
business interests.
  Moreover, the fact of the Scalia-Cheney hunting trip was publicly 
disclosed and was certainly known to all counsels in the case before 
Justice Scalia. In contrast, there was a concerted and sustained effort 
to keep Judge Porteous's hunting trips a secret from litigants who 
would have reason to believe their interests before the court might be 
affected.
  It should also be kept in mind that there are unique practical, 
structural considerations to recusal at the Supreme Court level. As to 
the notion that he should err on the side of recusal, Justice Scalia 
explained:

      That might be sound advice if I were sitting on a Court of 
      Appeals. . . . There, my place would be taken by another 
      judge, and the case would proceed normally. On the Supreme 
      Court, however, the consequence is different: The Court 
      proceeds with eight Justices, raising the possibility that, 
      by reason of a tie vote, it will find itself unable to 
      resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case. 
      . . . Moreover, granting the motion is (insofar as the 
      outcome of the particular case is concerned) effectively 
      the same as casting a vote against the petitioner.

Id. at 915. In contrast, there was absolutely no structural impediment 
to Judge Porteous's recusing himself. He could have easily been 
replaced by another district judge who had not accepted things of value 
from Diamond or Rowan.

                G. Disclosures of Trips Starting in 2005

1. Financial Disclosure Reports
    Judge Porteous did not disclose the 2000, 2001, or 2003 
Diamond hunting trips on his Financial Disclosure Reports, nor 
did he disclose his 2002 Rowan hunting trip.
    In his report for calendar year 2004 (filed May 12, 2005), 
Judge Porteous reported the 2004 Rowan hunting trip as a 
``gift'' valued at $1000,\644\ and, in his report for 2006 
(filed May 14, 2007), he reported the 2006 Rowan hunting trip 
as a ``gift'' valued at $800.\645\ By 2005, Judge Porteous knew 
he was under a criminal investigation.

2. Judge Porteous's Only Disclosure of Diamond Hunting Trips
    In May 2005, the case of Pioneer Natural Resources, Inc. v. 
Diamond Offshore\649\ was filed. It was originally assigned to 
Judge Ivan L. R. Lamelle. In July 2007, the case was reassigned 
to Judge Porteous. On September 26, 2007, Judge Porteous made a 
disclosure to both counsels indicating that he had been on 
Diamond hunting trips, that he wanted the attorneys to consult 
with their clients and affirmatively represent they did not 
object to his continuing to preside over that case. \650\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \649\Case No. 2:05-cv-00224-DEK. See PACER Docket Report (Ex. 
180(l)).
    \650\This event is noted in the docket entries for September 26, 
2007 reads as follows:

      ORDERED that counsel notify Clerk of Court by 10/9/2007 
      4:00 PM if their clients consent to the undersigned 
      continuing to handle this matter. FURTHER ORDERED that 
      failure to notify the Clerk shall result in the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      undersigned's recusal from this matter.

PACER Docket Report (Ex. 180(l)).
    This 2007 disclosure, occurring after DOJ had sent its 
complaint letter to the Fifth Circuit, is the only known 
instance of Judge Porteous having informed counsel of having 
taken hunting trips paid for by Diamond or Rowan.\651\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \651\In fact, even this disclosure was not entirely complete. On 
the 2007 Diamond hunting trip, the attorney representing Diamond in the 
Pioneer case was also in attendance. This fact was not disclosed to 
Pioneer's counsel.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     XIV. JUDGE PORTEOUS'S CONDUCT IN RELATION TO THE ``GIFT BAN'' 
                       PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL LAW

                             A. The Statute

    At all pertinent times, the applicable Federal law, 5 
U.S.C. Sec. 7353(a)(2) (the Ethics Reform Act of 1989\652\), 
provided:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \652\Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-194, Sec. Sec. 301 
and 303, 103 Stat. 1716 (1989).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Except as permitted by agency ethics regulations] no . . . 
officer or employee of the . . . judicial branch shall solicit 
or accept anything of value from a person--. . . whose 
interests may be substantially affected by the performance or 
nonperformance of the individual's official duties.
    Thus, to determine whether it was acceptable for Judge 
Porteous to accept ``anything of value'' from attorneys and 
parties with matters before him, it is necessary to examine the 
Judicial Conference's regulations implementing this provision.

                           B. The Regulations

    The Gift Regulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference 
of the United States\653\ track the statutory prohibition, but 
address two separate circumstances--a Federal judge's 
solicitation of a gift and a judge's acceptance of a gift.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \653\Unless otherwise noted, references to the ``Gift Regulations'' 
refer to the Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the United 
States under Title III of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 Concerning 
Gifts that were promulgated in 1997. (Ex. 364). The regulations 
discussed in the text were in effect from August 1997 through August 
2003 and thus cover the period when most of the conduct at issue 
occurred. These Gift Regulations were revised in 2003 in ways that are 
not relevant to the substance of the discussion. See 2003 Gift 
Regulations (Ex. 365).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The term ``gift'' is broadly defined, with narrow 
exceptions, one being for ``modest items of food.''

        Sec. 3. Definition of ``Gift.''

        ``Gift'' means any gratuity, entertainment, 
        forbearance, bequest, favor, the gratuitous element of 
        a loan, or other similar item having monetary value but 
        does not include . . . modest items of food and 
        refreshments, such as soft drinks, coffee and donuts, 
        offered for present consumption other than as part of a 
        meal.\654\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \654\There are other narrow exceptions, such as plaques, 
certificates, and trophies, and certain rewards and prizes, including 
random drawings.

    As to the solicitation of a gift, the Gift Regulations are 
unambiguous in prohibiting a judge from soliciting things of 
value from attorneys or parties with matters in front of him. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those regulations provide:

        Sec. 4. Solicitation of Gifts by a Judicial Officer or 
        Employee.

        (a) A judicial officer . . . shall not solicit a gift 
        from any person who is seeking official action from or 
        doing business with the courts (or other employing 
        entity), or from any other person whose interests may 
        be substantially affected by the performance or 
        nonperformance of the judicial officer['s] official 
        duties, including in the case of a judge any person who 
        has come or is likely to come before the judge.\655\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \655\There is no material difference in this definition in the 2003 
Regulations.

    As to the acceptance of a gift, the regulations permit a 
judge to receive only certain gifts. Section 5 of the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
regulations provides:

        Sec. 5. Acceptance of Gifts by a Judicial Officer or 
        Employee; Exceptions.

        A judicial officer or employee shall not accept a gift 
        from anyone except for----

                              *    *    *

        (c) Lordinary social hospitality;

        (d) La gift from a relative or friend, for a special 
        occasion, such as a wedding, anniversary, birthday, and 
        the gift is fairly commensurate with the occasion and 
        the relationship;

        (e) La gift from a relative or close personal friend 
        whose appearance or interest in a case would in any 
        event require that the officer or employee take no 
        official action with respect to the case;

                              *    *    *

        (h) Lany other gift only if:

                              *    *    *

            (2) Lin the case of a judge, the donor is not a 
        party or other person who has come or is likely to come 
        before the judge or whose interests may be 
        substantially affected by the performance or 
        nonperformance of his or her official duties[.]\656\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \656\The other section 5 exceptions to the Gift Regulations have no 
application to the facts of this inquiry such as certain gifts incident 
to a public speaking engagements, or invitations to bar-related 
functions or activities devoted to the improvement of the law, the 
legal system, or the administration of justice.

    C. Application of the Gift Ban Statute and Regulations to Judge 
                           Porteous's Conduct

1. Solicitation and/or Acceptance of Cash, Other Things of Value, and 
        Overnight Trips (other than Meals at Restaurants)
    Judge Porteous's solicitation and acceptance of things of 
value from attorneys and parties with matters before him are 
proscribed by statute and regulations because they are ``things 
of value'' given by attorneys and parties ``whose interests may 
be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance 
of the [Judge's] official duties.'' As to some items--such as 
Judge Porteous's soliciting money from Amato during the 
pendency of a case, accepting the payments for his Las Vegas 
hotel room and payment towards his son's bachelor party dinner 
from Creely, and accepting hunting trips from Diamond and 
Rowan--the application of the statute and regulations is 
straightforward. None of the section 5 exceptions permitted 
Judge Porteous to accept those items while he had cases with 
those attorneys or parties in front of him.\657\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \657\Section 5(d) provides an exception to permit a judge to accept 
a ``gift from a relative or friend, for a special occasion, such as a 
wedding, anniversary or birthday, if the gift is fairly commensurate 
with the occasion and the relationship.'' Creely's payment of close to 
$1,000 for Judge Porteous's hotel accommodations as a contribution 
towards his son's bachelor party dinner is not ``fairly commensurate 
with the occasion.'' Section 5(e) permits judges to accept a ``gift 
from a relative or close personal friend whose appearance or interest 
in a case would in any event require that the officer or employee take 
no official action with respect to the case.'' This provision appears 
to permit a Federal judge to accept a gift if, upon accepting the gift, 
the judge would thereafter recuse himself or herself, that is, ``take 
no official action with respect to the case.'' Indeed Judge Porteous 
could have accepted the ``gifts'' from Creely and Amato. Section 5(h) 
permits judges to accept ``any other gift,'' but only if ``the donor is 
not a party or other person who has come or is likely to come before 
the judge or whose interests may be substantially affected by the 
performance or nonperformance of his or her official duties.'' In this 
case, the donor--an attorney or a party (Rowan or Diamond)--would 
constitute a ``party or other person who has come or is likely to come 
before the judge or whose interests may be substantially affected by 
the performance or nonperformance of his or her official duties.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Meals at Restaurants
    Judge Porteous accepted hundreds of meals from attorneys 
and parties with matters pending before him. Unless there is an 
exception that would allow him to accept these meals, the 
statutory prohibition against accepting ``anything of value'' 
from attorneys and parties ``whose interests may be 
substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of 
the [Judge's] official duties'' prohibits his acceptance of 
these meals. This conduct will be discussed in light of 
possible exceptions.
    The exception in the definition of ``gift'' for ``modest 
items of food.'' The definition of ``gift'' in the regulations 
provides an exception for ``modest items of food and 
refreshments such as soft drinks, coffee and donuts, offered 
for present consumption other than as part of a meal.'' This 
provision--explicitly permitting a judge to accept light 
refreshments (even from attorneys and parties with matters 
before him)--would be unnecessary if a judge were otherwise 
free to accept expensive meals at high-end restaurants paid for 
by parties or attorneys with matters before him. Moreover, a 
lunch consisting of food and drinks at a restaurant such as 
Ruth's Chris Steak House is not, under any interpretation, a 
``modest item of food . . . such as soft drinks, coffee and 
donuts.''
    The exception under section 5(c) of the regulations for 
``ordinary social hospitality.'' Section 5 of the regulations 
provides that ``[a] judicial officer or employee shall not 
accept a gift from anyone except for [certain exceptions].'' 
One of those exceptions is set forth in Section 5(c), which 
permits a judge to accept ``ordinary social hospitality.'' The 
term ``ordinary social hospitality'' is not defined in the 
Judicial Conference regulations, but is similar to and conveys 
the same meaning in context as the phrase ``personal 
hospitality of any individual'' used in the Ethics in 
Government Act. The latter phrase is defined as ``hospitality 
extended for a nonbusiness purpose by an individual, not a 
corporation or organization, at the personal residence of that 
individual or his family or on property of facilities owned by 
that individual or his family.''\658\ If ``ordinary social 
hospitality'' included expensive meals at restaurants, then 
this definition would subsume and render meaningless the narrow 
carve-out in the definition for ``soft drinks, coffee and 
donuts.'' It would make little sense for the regulations to 
explicitly permit a judge to accept donuts from counsel in a 
meeting during trial when a different provision would permit 
counsel to take that same judge to an expensive restaurant 
during the trial.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \658\The Ethics and Government Act defines ``personal hospitality 
of any individual'' as ``hospitality extended for a nonbusiness purpose 
by an individual, not a corporation or organization, at the personal 
residence of that individual or his family or on property of facilities 
owned by that individual or his family.'' Ethics in Government Act, 
Section 109(14), codified at Title 5, United States Code, Appx. 4, Sec. 
109(14). Such ``personal hospitality'' is not required to be disclosed 
in the Financial Disclosure Reports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As Professor Geyh testified, Judge Porteous's acceptance of 
the meals violated both the gift rules (because they were not 
``ordinary social hospitality'') as well as other ethical 
canons that prohibit his exploitation of his position for 
personal gain:

        Codes of conduct permit judges to accept ``social 
        hospitality'' without running afoul of restrictions on 
        the gifts judges may receive, and friends and former 
        colleagues who take each other to lunch can be a 
        conventional form of social hospitality. This, however, 
        was not ordinary ``social hospitality.'' These lawyers 
        reportedly paid Judge Porteous's lunch bills countless 
        times for years with no meaningful reciprocation by the 
        judge. Moreover, this one-way payment practice appears 
        to be what Judge Porteous wanted and expected. Former 
        State Judge Ronald Bodenheimer testified that when 
        Bodenheimer became a judge, Porteous told him that, 
        once a judge, he would ``never have to buy lunch again. 
        . . . There will always be somebody to take you to 
        lunch.'' In other words, Judge Porteous was trading on 
        his position as a judge in contravention of the ethical 
        principle that a judge should not ``lend the prestige 
        of judicial office to advance the private interests of 
        the judge.''\659\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \659\Prof. Geyh TF Hrg. IV at 8-9 (written statement at 2-3). 
Furthermore, Professor Geyh explained there is no such thing as 
``ordinary social hospitality'' extended by a corporation--an entity 
that is not in the business of making friends but is instead in the 
business of making money. Prof. Geyh TF Hrg. IV at 16 (written 
statement at 10). This discussion does not address the circumstance 
where a judge and an attorney alternate paying for meals on a rotating 
basis. As Prof. Geyh stressed, and Judge Porteous himself stated, Judge 
Porteous sought and expected the attorneys to pay for his meals--not 
the other way around--and in fact he virtually never reciprocated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    D. Actions by Judge Porteous That Appear to Violate Federal Law

    The following actions by Judge Porteous would appear to 
violate the gift ban of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7353, and the Judicial 
Conference regulations promulgated thereunder:

        1) LJudge Porteous's solicitation and acceptance of 
        approximately $2500 from Amato in June or July 1999 
        while the Liljeberg case was pending. At that time, 
        Amato had a financial interest in the resolution of the 
        Liljeberg case that would have been ``substantially 
        affected by the performance of [Judge Porteous's] 
        official duties.''

        2) L Judge Porteous's acceptance of Creely's payment 
        for his hotel room and for a portion of his son's 
        bachelor party dinner in Las Vegas in May 1999 while 
        the Liljeberg case was pending. At that time, Creely, 
        as Amato's partner, had a financial interest in the 
        resolution of the Liljeberg case that would have been 
        ``substantially affected by the performance of [Judge 
        Porteous's] official duties.''

        3) LJudge Porteous's acceptance of Creely's and Amato's 
        payment of approximately $1,500 to celebrate Judge 
        Porteous's 5 years on the bench in late 1999 while the 
        Liljeberg case was pending. At that time, Amato and 
        Creely had an interest in the resolution of the 
        Liljeberg case that would have been ``substantially 
        affected by the performance of [Judge Porteous's] 
        official duties.''

        4) LJudge Porteous's acceptance of hunting trips paid 
        for by Diamond without disclosure or recusal. In at 
        least three instances, Judge Porteous accepted Diamond-
        sponsored trips while Diamond had cases pending in 
        front of him and thus had interests which may have been 
        ``substantially affected by the performance of [Judge 
        Porteous's] official duties.'' Even in the situations 
        where a Diamond case was not actually pending at the 
        time of the hunting trip, based on the routine and 
        predictable nature of his being assigned cases 
        involving Diamond, Judge Porteous would have known that 
        he was accepting something of value from an entity 
        ``whose interests may be substantially affected'' in 
        subsequent litigation that would be assigned to 
        him.\660\ At a minimum, after having attended trips and 
        accepted value from Diamond, Judge Porteous should have 
        disclosed his receipt of the trips to counsel (and 
        recused himself if counsel sought recusal).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \660\Judge Haik, who also attended the Diamond hunting trips, 
immediately recused himself after the first trip from hearing cases 
where Diamond was a party. See Affidavit of Judge Richard Haik (Ex. 
186).

        5) LJudge Porteous's acceptance of three hunting trips 
        paid for by Rowan. In connection with the 2004 trip, 
        when the Hanna case was pending, Rowan had an interest 
        in the resolution of that case which would have been 
        ``substantially affected by the performance of Judge 
        Porteous's official duties.'' Moreover, based on the 
        routine and predictable nature of his being assigned 
        Rowan cases, Judge Porteous would have known that he 
        was accepting something of value from an entity ``whose 
        interests may be substantially affected'' in subsequent 
        litigation that would be assigned to him. At a minimum, 
        after having attended trips and accepted value from 
        Diamond, Judge Porteous should have disclosed his 
        receipt of the trips to counsel (and recused himself if 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        counsel sought recusal).

        6) LJudge Porteous's acceptance from various attorneys 
        and parties of hundreds of meals at high-end 
        restaurants while those attorneys had matters pending 
        before him.

         XV. THE DOJ'S DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE JUDGE PORTEOUS

    As noted at the outset, DOJ decided not to prosecute Judge 
Porteous. Several observations are in order.
    First, the nature of Congress's determination whether to 
impeach is fundamentally different from DOJ's decision whether 
to prosecute. Congress does not decide guilt or innocence with 
reference to a criminal statute. Rather, it is for Congress to 
make what is in essence a ``fitness for office'' determination. 
Congress alone has the power to remove an unfit Federal judge, 
and conduct that renders a judge unfit may not necessarily 
violate a criminal statute.
    Second, Congress has an independent responsibility to 
review the evidence and cannot rely on DOJ's assessment of what 
the evidence reveals. Thus, just as the House heard the 
evidence involving Judge Samuel B. Kent, and before that of 
Judges Walter Nixon and Robert Collins, and did not rely solely 
on the fact that each of those judges had been criminally 
convicted, so it is proper for Congress to consider and review 
the evidence that relates to the conduct of Judge Porteous, 
even though some of that evidence (but not all) was considered 
by the Department of Justice.
    Third, even though aspects of Judge Porteous's conduct may 
appear to support a criminal prosecution, the Department faced 
numerous practical obstacles that would necessarily have 
impacted its considerations as to whether prosecution was in 
order for certain categories of conduct. One problem in 
particular involved the statute of limitations--a potentially 
insurmountable hurdle in a criminal prosecution, but not a bar 
to impeachment. Some of the most corrupt conduct, such as Judge 
Porteous's relationship with the Marcottes and his initiation 
of the ``curatorship'' scheme with Creely and Amato, was time-
barred by the statute of limitations. Nonetheless, such 
conduct, even if it cannot be used to support a Federal 
criminal prosecution, is profoundly relevant to the 
determination of whether Judge Porteous should remain a Federal 
judge.
    Fourth, another problem facing the DOJ was the existence of 
various procedural and evidentiary rules that would have 
affected the DOJ's ability to demonstrate before a jury the 
complete picture of Judge Porteous's conduct. The four Articles 
of Impeachment involve different types of conduct, in different 
spheres of activity, and at different times. For example, even 
assuming no statute of limitations issues existed, a bankruptcy 
fraud charge could not necessarily have been brought in the 
same proceeding as a corruption charge; likewise, evidence of 
Judge Porteous's relationship with the Marcottes would not 
necessarily have been admissible in a trial on bankruptcy 
issues.\661\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \661\These considerations were touched on by the panel of legal 
scholars who testified at the December 15, 2009 Task Force Hearing. Ms. 
Jackson Lee asked the panel to opine on the DOJ decision not to seek 
prosecution. Professor Michael Gerhardt, University of North Carolina 
School of Law, responded: ``I think it has no impact. I think it is of 
no real consequence.'' Professor Gerhardt stressed that impeachment is 
not a criminal proceeding, the burden is different, the House can 
consider different evidence, and it would not be bound in any event if 
there were a conviction, as the House must make an independent judgment 
as to the evidence. Gerhardt TF Hrg. IV at 41. Professor Akhil Reed 
Amar, Yale Law School, agreed. He noted the different purposes of 
impeachment and criminal prosecution, testifying that impeachment 
``remov[es] a position that the judge should never should have had in 
the first place. It is not like putting someone in prison, taking away 
their very life. It is not even retributive.'' Amar TF Hrg. IV at 41. 
Professor Charles Geyh, Indiana University Maurer School of Law, 
concurred, specifically noting that the statute of limitations would 
impact DOJ but not Congress. Geyh TF Hrg. IV at 41-42.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Fifth, the Impeachment Task Force has interviewed new 
witnesses and uncovered new evidence that simply was not 
considered by the Department, including evidence related to 
conduct that was time-barred for criminal prosecution. For 
example, it obtained depositions and public testimony from 
Louis Marcotte and Lori Marcotte, corroborating court records, 
as well as the depositions of their employees and associates 
relating to the Marcottes' relationship with Judge Porteous. 
Additionally, the Task Force obtained and considered the 
curatorship records that corroborate and expanded the scale of 
the financial relationship with Creely and Amato that was not 
otherwise developed by the DOJ; it obtained the recusal hearing 
transcript in connection with the Liljeberg case; and, finally, 
the Task Force and the Committee had the benefit of the Fifth 
Circuit hearings which expanded on the evidence available to 
the DOJ.

                            XVI. CONCLUSION

    The following language from the House Report accompanying 
the Judge Walter L. Nixon, Jr., and Samuel B. Kent Articles of 
Impeachment aptly sets out the core principles underlying and 
justifying the Impeachment Resolution against Judge Porteous:

          The [House's] role is not to punish [Judge Porteous], 
        but simply to determine whether articles of impeachment 
        should be brought. Under our Constitution, the American 
        people must look to the Congress to protect them from 
        persons unfit to hold high office because of serious 
        misconduct that has violated the public trust. Where, 
        as here, the evidence overwhelmingly establishes that a 
        Federal judge has committed impeachable offenses, our 
        duty requires us to bring articles of impeachment and 
        to try him before the United States Senate.\662\
