                         PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION

    H.R. 3096 would designate the building occupied by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation located at 801 Follin Lane, 
Vienna, Virginia, as the ``Michael D. Resnick Terrorist 
Screening Center''.

                  BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

    H.R. 3096 would designate the building occupied by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) located at 801 Follin 
Lane, Vienna, Virginia, as the ``Michael D. Resnick Terrorist 
Screening Center'' during the period in which the building is 
occupied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
    Michael D. Resnick dedicated his 20-year FBI career to 
protecting the country from terrorism. Supervisory Special 
Agent Resnick was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-
Madison and De Paul University College of Law and was a career 
FBI supervisor for over 20 years. He was detailed to the White 
House as Senior Director of Information Sharing Policy. 
Supervisory Special Agent Resnick played an integral role in 
developing the terrorist watchlisting system and was an 
architect of the post 9/11 National Security framework. He 
continued his work at the FBI throughout his battle with 
pancreatic cancer until two days before his death on February 
2, 2011.

                                HEARINGS

    No hearings were held on H.R. 3096.

                 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND CONSIDERATION

    On September 12, 2013, Representative Gerald E. Connolly 
(D-VA) introduced H.R. 3096, a bill to designate the building 
occupied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation located at 801 
Follin Lane, Vienna, Virginia, as the ``Michael D. Resnick 
Terrorist Screening Center''.
    On September 19, 2013, the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure met in open session. The Committee ordered the 
bill reported favorably to the House by voice vote with a 
quorum present.

                            COMMITTEE VOTES

    Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires each committee report to include the 
total number of votes cast for and against on each record vote 
on a motion to report and on any amendment offered to the 
measure or matter, and the names of those members voting for 
and against. There were no record votes taken in connection 
with consideration of H.R. 3096 or ordering the measure 
reported. A motion to order H.R. 3096 reported favorably to the 
House was agreed to by voice vote with a quorum present.

                      COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS

    With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(1) of rule 
XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee's oversight findings and recommendations are 
reflected in this report.

               NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX EXPENDITURES

    Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives does not apply where a cost estimate and 
comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget 
Office under section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974 has been timely submitted prior to the filing of the 
report and is included in the report. Such a cost estimate is 
included in this report.

               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

    With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule 
XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 
402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has 
received the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 3096 from the 
Director of the Congressional Budget Office:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 20, 2013.
Hon. Bill Shuster,
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 3096, a bill to designate the building occupied 
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation located at 801 Follin 
Lane, Vienna, Virginia, as the ``Michael D. Resnick Terrorist 
Screening Center,'' as ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 19, 2013.
    CBO estimates that enacting this legislation would have no 
significant impact on the federal budget and would not affect 
direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go 
procedures do not apply. The bill contains no intergovernmental 
or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal 
governments. If you wish further details on this estimate, we 
will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is 
Matthew Pickford.
            Sincerely,
                                              Douglas W. Elmendorf.

                    PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

    With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(4) of rule 
XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
performance goal and objective of this legislation is to 
designate the building occupied by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation located at 801 Follin Lane, Vienna, Virginia, as 
the ``Michael D. Resnick Terrorist Screening Center''.

                          ADVISORY OF EARMARKS

    Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House 
of Representatives, the Committee is required to include a list 
of congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited 
tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(e), 9(f), and 9(g) of 
rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives. No 
provision in the bill includes an earmark, limited tax benefit, 
or limited tariff benefit under clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of 
rule XXI.

                    DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS

    Pursuant to section 3(j) of H. Res. 5, 113th Cong. (2013), 
the Committee finds that no provision of H.R. 3096 establishes 
or reauthorizes a program of the Federal government known to be 
duplicative of another Federal program, a program that was 
included in any report from the Government Accountability 
Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public Law 111-
139, or a program related to a program identified in the most 
recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

                  DISCLOSURE OF DIRECTED RULE MAKINGS

    Pursuant to section 3(k) of H. Res. 5, 113th Cong. (2013), 
the Committee estimates that enacting H.R. 3096 does not 
specifically direct the completion of any specific rule makings 
within the meaning of section 551 of title 5, United States 
Code.

                       FEDERAL MANDATE STATEMENT

    The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of Federal 
mandates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget 
Office pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform 
Act (Public Law 104-4).

                        PREEMPTION CLARIFICATION

    Section 423 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
requires the report of any Committee on a bill or joint 
resolution to include a statement on the extent to which the 
bill or joint resolution is intended to preempt state, local, 
or tribal law. The Committee states that H.R. 3096 does not 
preempt any state, local, or tribal law.

                      ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT

    No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act are created by this 
legislation.

                  APPLICABILITY OF LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

    The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to 
the terms and conditions of employment or access to public 
services or accommodations within the meaning of section 
102(b)(3) of the Congressional Accountability Act (Public Law 
104-1).
