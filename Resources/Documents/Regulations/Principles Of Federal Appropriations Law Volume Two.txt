Foreword 


This is Volume II of Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, third 
edition. As we explained in the Foreword to the third edition of Volume I, 
publication of this volume continues our process of revising and updating 
the second edition of the “Red Book” and reissuing it in what will ultimately 
be a 3-volume looseleaf set with cumulative annual updates. This volume 
and all other volumes of Principles, including the annual updates, are 
available on GAO’s Web site (www.gao.gov) under “Legal Products.” The 
annual updates are only available online. The online updated versions 
contain hyperlinks to the GAO material cited. Check the GAO Web site for 
other interesting information, for example, materials from our annual 
Appropriations Law Forum. 

Our objective in Principles is to present a basic reference work covering 
those areas of law in which the Comptroller General issues decisions, using 
text discussion with specific legal authorities to illustrate the principles 
discussed, their application, and exceptions. As we noted in our first 
volume, Principles should be used as a general guide and starting point, 
not as a substitute for original legal research. We measure our success in 
this endeavor by Principles’ day-to-day utility to its federal and nonfederal 
audience. In this regard, we appreciate the many comments and 
suggestions we have received to date, and hope that our publication will 
continue to serve as a useful reference.

Chapter 6 

Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

The two preceding chapters have discussed the purposes for which 

A. Introduction 
appropriated funds may be used and the time limits within which they may 
be obligated and expended. This chapter will discuss the third major 
concept of the “legal availability” of appropriations—restrictions relating to 
amount. It is not enough to know what you can spend appropriated funds 
for and when you can spend them. You also must know how much you 
have available for a particular object. 

In this respect, the legal restrictions on government expenditures are 
different from those governing your spending as a private individual. For 
example, as an individual, you can buy a house and finance it with a 
mortgage that may run for 25 or 30 years. Since you do not have enough 
money to cover your full legal obligation under the mortgage, you sign the 
mortgage papers on the assumption that you will continue to have an 
income adequate to cover the mortgage. If your income diminishes 
substantially or, heaven forbid, disappears, and you are unable to make the 
payments, you lose the house. A government agency cannot operate this 
way. The main reason why is the Antideficiency Act, discussed in section C 
of this chapter. 

Under the Constitution, Congress makes the laws and provides the money 
to implement them; the executive branch carries out the laws with the 
money Congress provides. Under this system, Congress has the “final 
word” as to how much money can be spent by a given agency or on a given 
program. Congress may give the executive branch considerable discretion 
concerning how to implement the laws and hence how to obligate and 
expend funds appropriated, but it is ultimately up to Congress to determine 
how much the executive branch can spend. In applying these concepts to 
the day-to-day operations of the federal government, it should be readily 
apparent that restrictions on purpose, time, and amount are very closely 
related. Again, the Antideficiency Act is one of the primary “enforcement 
devices.” Its importance is underscored by the fact that it is the only one of 
the fiscal statutes to include both civil and criminal penalties for violation. 

To ensure that the Antideficiency Act’s prohibition against overobligating 
or overspending an appropriation remains meaningful, agencies must be 
restricted to the appropriations Congress provides. The rule prohibiting 
the unauthorized “augmentation” of appropriations, covered in section E of 
this chapter, is thus a crucial complement to the Antideficiency Act.

While Congress retains, as it must, ultimate control over how much an 
agency can spend, it does not attempt to control the disposition of every 
dollar. We began our general discussion of administrative discretion in 
Chapter 3 by quoting Justice Holmes’ statement that “some play must be 
allowed to the joints if the machine is to work.”1 This is fully applicable to 
the expenditure of appropriated funds. An agency’s discretion under a 
lump-sum appropriation is discussed in section F of this chapter. 

B. Types of 
Appropriation 
Language 
Congress has been making appropriations since the beginning of the 
Republic. In earlier times when the federal government was much smaller 
and federal programs were (or at least seemed) much simpler, very specific 
line-item appropriations were more common.2 In recent decades, however, 
as the federal budget has grown in both size and complexity, a lump-sum 
approach has become a virtual necessity.3 For example, an appropriation 
act for an establishment the size of the Defense Department structured 
solely on a line-item basis would rival the telephone directory in bulk. 

Over the course of this time, certain forms of appropriation language have 
become standard. This section will point out the more commonly used 
language with respect to amount. 

1. Lump-Sum A lump-sum appropriation is one that is made to cover a number of 
specific programs, projects, or items. (The number may be as small as 
Appropriations 

two.) In contrast, a line-item appropriation is available only for the 
specific object described. 

1 Tyson & Brother United Theater Ticket Offices v. Banton, 273 U.S. 418 (1927) (Holmes, J., 
dissenting). 

2 For fiscal year 1905, for example, Congress appropriated to the Department of Justice a 
specific line item of $3,000 for stationery. Legislative, Executive and Judicial Appropriations 
Act, 1905, ch. 716, 33 Stat. 85, 134 (Mar. 18, 1904). For fiscal year 2005, Congress 
appropriated to the Department of Justice a lump-sum appropriation of $124,100,000 for 
administrative expenses. Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and 
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-447, div. B, title I, 118 Stat. 2809, 
2853 (Dec. 8, 2004). 

3 As a result of appropriation account consolidation over the years, 200 accounts now cover 
90 percent of all federal expenditures. Allen Schick, The Federal Budget: Politics, Policy, 
and Process, 229 (2000).

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

Lump-sum appropriations come in many forms. Many smaller agencies 
receive only a single appropriation, usually termed “Salaries and Expenses” 
or “Operating Expenses.” All of the agency’s operations must be funded 
from this single appropriation. Cabinet-level departments and larger 
agencies receive several appropriations, often based on broad object 
categories such as “operations and maintenance” or “research and 
development.” For purposes of this discussion, a lump-sum appropriation 
is simply one that is available for more than one specific object. 

The amount of a lump-sum appropriation is not derived through 
guesswork. It is the result of a lengthy budget and appropriation process. 
The agency first submits its appropriation request to Congress through the 
Office of Management and Budget, supported by detailed budget 
justifications. Congress then reviews the request and enacts an 
appropriation which may be more, less, or the same as the amount 
requested. Variations from the amount requested are usually explained in 
the appropriation act’s legislative history, most often in committee reports.4 

All of this leads logically to a question which can be phrased in various 
ways: How much flexibility does an agency have in spending a lump-sum 
appropriation? Is it legally bound by its original budget estimate or by 
expressions of intent in legislative history? How is the agency’s legitimate 
need for administrative flexibility balanced against the constitutional role 
of the Congress as controller of the public purse? 

The answer to these questions is one of the most important principles of 
appropriations law. The rule, simply stated, is this: Restrictions on a lumpsum 
appropriation contained in the agency’s budget request or in legislative 
history are not legally binding on the department or agency unless they are 
carried into (specified in) the appropriation act itself, or unless some other 
statute restricts the agency’s spending flexibility. This is an application of 
the fundamental principle of statutory construction that legislative history 
is not law and carries no legal significance unless “anchored in the text of 

4 See Chapter 1, section D. See also GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget 
Process, GAO-05-734SP (Washington, D.C.: September 2005), Appendixes I and II, for an 
overview of the budget and appropriations process.

the statute.” Shannon v. United States, 512 U.S. 573, 583 (1994).5 Of 
course, the agency cannot exceed the total amount of the lump-sum 
appropriation, and its spending must not violate other applicable 
statutoryrestrictions.6 The rule applies equally whether the legislative 
history is mere acquiescence in the agency’s budget request or an 
affirmative expression of intent. 

The rule recognizes the agency’s need for flexibility to meet changing or 
unforeseen circumstances, yet preserves congressional control in several 
ways. First, the rule merely says that the restrictions are not legally 
binding. The practical wisdom of making the expenditure is an entirely 
separate question. An agency that disregards the wishes of its oversight or 
appropriations committees will most likely be called upon to answer for its 
digressions before those committees next year. An agency that fails to 
“keep faith” with the Congress may find its next appropriation reduced or 
limited by line-item restrictions. As Professor Schick put it: 

“What gives the appropriations reports special force is not 
their legal status but the fact that the next appropriations 
cycle is always less than one year away. An agency that 
willfully violates report language risks retribution the next 
time it asks for money. It may find this year’s report 
language relocated to the next appropriations act, thereby 
giving it even less leeway than it had before. Or it may find 
the next time that the appropriations committees’ guidance 
is more detailed and onerous or that its appropriation has 
been cut.”7 

That Congress is fully aware of these dynamics is evidenced by the 
following statement from a 1973 House Appropriations Committee report: 

5 See Chapter 2, section D.6 for a general discussion of the uses and limits of legislative 
history. 

6 For example, agencies and their employees are, of course, legally bound by 
apportionments and subdivisions of lump-sum appropriations. See 31 U.S.C. §§ 1517–1519. 
See also sections C.4 and C.5 of this chapter for a discussion of these requirements.

John C. Roberts, Are Congressional Committees Constitutional?: Radical Textualism, 
Separation of Powers, and the Enactment Process, 52 Case Western Reserve L. Rev. 489, 
563–64 (2001).

“In a strictly legal sense, the Department of Defense could 
utilize the funds appropriated for whatever programs were 
included under the individual appropriation accounts, but 
the relationship with the Congress demands that the 
detailed justifications which are presented in support of 
budget requests be followed. To do otherwise would cause 
Congress to lose confidence in the requests made and 
probably result in reduced appropriations or line item 
appropriation bills.”8 

Justice Souter made the same point, writing for the Court in Lincoln v. 
Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993): 

“Congress may always circumscribe agency discretion to 
allocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative 
statutes (though not, as we have seen, just in the legislative 
history). And, of course, we hardly need to note that an 
agency’s decision to ignore congressional expectations may 
expose it to grave political consequences.” 

Id. at 193 (citations omitted). 

Second, restrictions on an agency’s spending flexibility exist through the 
operation of other laws. For example, a “Salaries and Expenses” 
appropriation may be a large lump sum, but much of it is in fact 
nondiscretionary because the salaries and benefits (e.g., health insurance 
and retirement contributions) of agency employees constitute mandatory 
expenditures once fixed in accordance with the parameters established by 
law.9 Third, reprogramming arrangements with the various committees 
provide another safeguard against abuse.10 

Finally, Congress always holds the ultimate trump card. It has the power to 
make any restriction legally binding simply by including it in the 

8 Report of the House Committee on Appropriations on the 1974 Defense Department 
appropriation bill, H.R. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16 (1973).

appropriation act.11 Thus, the treatment of lump-sum appropriations may 
be regarded as yet another example of the efforts of our legal and political 
systems to balance the conflicting objectives of executive flexibility and 
congressional control.12 

Two common examples of devices Congress uses when it wants to restrict 
an agency’s spending flexibility are line-item appropriations and earmarks. 
Congress uses other tools as well. The following are just two examples 
taken from the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, Pub. L. 
No. 108-7, 117 Stat. 11 (Feb. 20, 2003), the omnibus appropriation act for 
fiscal year 2003. The first is an example of a notice requirement: 

“[F]unds made available under this heading [Salaries and 
Expenses, Department of Housing and Urban Development] 
shall only be allocated in the manner specified in the report 
accompanying this Act unless the Committees on 
Appropriations . . . are notified of any changes in an 
operating plan or reprogramming. . .” 

117 Stat. 499. The second is a proviso that incorporates by reference 
instructions found in a conference report: 

“Provided, That notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
the Office of Economic Adjustment . . . is authorized to 
make grants using funds made available under the heading 
‘Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide’ in accordance 

11 This assumes, of course, that Congress is acting within its constitutional authority. See 
Chapter 1, section B for a general discussion of Congress’s constitutional authority to 
appropriate and the limits on that authority. Legal Services Corp. v. Velasquez, 531 U.S. 533 
(2001), provides an example of restrictive appropriation language that was declared 
unconstitutional. 

12 The effort has not always been free from controversy. One senator, concerned with what 
he felt was excessive flexibility in a 1935 appropriation, tried to make his point by 
suggesting the following: 

“Section 1. Congress hereby appropriates $4,880,000,000 

to the President of the United States to use as he pleases. 

“Section 2. Anybody who does not like it is fined $1,000.” 

79 Cong. Rec. 2014 (1935) (remarks of Sen. Arthur Vandenberg), quoted in Fisher, supra, 
at 62–63.

with the guidance provided in the Joint Explanatory 
Statement of the Committee of Conference for the 
Conference Report to accompany H.R. 5010 . . . and these 
projects shall hereafter be considered to be authorized by 
law.” 

117 Stat. 533. 

The 1983 appropriation act for the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development contained a restriction incorporating by reference budget 
estimates that the Administration had provided: 

“Where appropriations in titles I and II of this Act are 
expendable for travel expenses and no specific limitation 
has been placed thereon, the expenditures for such travel 
expenses may not exceed the amounts set forth therefor in 
the budget estimates submitted for the 
appropriations . . . .”13 

A provision prohibiting the use of a construction appropriation to start any 
new project for which an estimate was not included in the President’s 
budget submission is discussed in 34 Comp. Gen. 278 (1954). 

Also, the availability of a lump-sum appropriation may be restricted by 
provisions appearing in statutes other than appropriation acts, such as 
authorization acts.14 For example, if an agency receives a line-item 
authorization and a lump-sum appropriation pursuant to the authorization, 
the line-item restrictions and earmarks in the authorization act will apply 
just as if they appeared in the appropriation act itself. The topic is 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 2, section C. 

Perhaps the easiest case is the effect of the agency’s own budget estimate. 
The rule here was stated in 17 Comp. Gen. 147, 150 (1937) as follows:

“The amounts of individual items in the estimates presented 
to the Congress on the basis of which a lump-sum 
appropriation is enacted are not binding on administrative 
officers unless carried into the appropriation act itself.” 

See also Thompson v. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, 334 F.3d 1075, 
1085–86 (Fed. Cir. 2003), aff’d sub nom., 543 U.S. ____, 125 S. Ct. 1172 
(2005); B-63539, June 6, 1947; B-55277, Jan. 23, 1946; B-35335, July, 17, 1943; 
B-48120-O.M., Oct. 21, 1948. This is essentially the same rule as applied to 
allocations of amounts in congressional committee reports and other 
specifications in the legislative history concerning the use of lump-sum 
appropriations, which, as discussed later in this section, likewise have no 
legally binding effect unless tied to the appropriation language itself. 

It follows that the lack of a specific budget request will not preclude an 
expenditure from a lump-sum appropriation which is otherwise legally 
available for the item in question. E.g., B-278968, May 28, 1998; 72 Comp. 
Gen. 317, 319 (1993); 71 Comp. Gen. 411, 413 (1992).15 To illustrate, the 
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts asked for a supplemental 
appropriation of $11,000 in 1962 for necessary salaries and expenses of the 
Judicial Conference in revising and improving the federal rules of practice 
and procedure. The House of Representatives did not allow the increase 
but the Senate included the full amount. The bill went to conference but 
the conference was delayed and the agency needed the money. The 
Administrative Office then asked whether it could take the $11,000 out of 
its regular 1962 appropriation even though it had not specifically included 
this item in its 1962 budget request. Citing 17 Comp. Gen. 147, and noting 
that the study of the federal rules was a continuing statutory function of the 
Judicial Conference, the Comptroller General concluded as follows: 

“[I]n the absence of a specific limitation or prohibition in the 
appropriation under consideration as to the amount which 
may be expended for revising and improving the Federal 
Rules of practice and procedure, you would not be legally 
bound by your budget estimates or absence thereof. 

“If the Congress desires to restrict the availability of a 
particular appropriation to the several items and amounts 

15 On the other hand, inclusion of a budget estimate for a particular purpose can strengthen 
the case that the appropriation is available for that purpose. See B-285066.2, Aug. 9, 2000.

History 
thereof submitted in the budget estimates, such control may 
be effected by limiting such items in the appropriation act 
itself. Or, by a general provision of law, the availability of 
appropriations could be limited to the items and the 
amounts contained in the budget estimates. In the absence 
of such limitations an agency’s lump-sum appropriation is 
legally available to carry out the functions of the agency.” 

B-149163, June 27, 1962. See also 20 Comp. Gen. 631 (1941); B-198234, 
Mar. 25, 1981; B-69238, Sept. 23, 1948. The same principle would apply 
where the budget request was for an amount less than the amount 
appropriated, or for zero. 2 Comp. Gen. 517 (1923); B-126975, Feb. 12, 1958. 

Often issues are raised when there are changes to or restrictions on a lumpsum 
appropriation imposed during the legislative process but not in the 
legislation itself. The “leading case” in this area is 55 Comp. Gen. 307 
(1975), the so-called “LTV case.” The Department of the Navy had selected 
the McDonnell Douglas Corporation to develop a new fighter aircraft. LTV 
Aerospace Corporation protested the selection, arguing that the aircraft 
McDonnell Douglas proposed violated the 1975 Defense Department 
Appropriation Act. The appropriation in question was a lump-sum 
appropriation of slightly over $3 billion under the heading “Research, 
Development, Test, and Evaluation, Navy.” This appropriation covered a 
large number of projects, including the fighter aircraft in question. The 
conference report on the appropriation act had stated that $20 million was 
being provided for a Navy combat fighter, but that “[a]daptation of the 
selected Air Force Air Combat Fighter to be capable of carrier operations is 
the prerequisite for use of the funds provided.” The Navy conceded that 
the McDonnell Douglas aircraft was not a derivative of the Air Force fighter 
and that its selection was not in accord with the instructions in the 
conference report. The issue, therefore, was whether the conference 
report was legally binding on the Navy. In other words, did the Navy act 
illegally by not choosing to follow the conference report? 

The ensuing decision is GAO’s most comprehensive statement on the legal 
availability of lump-sum appropriations. Pertinent excerpts are set forth 
below: 

“[C]ongress has recognized that in most instances it is 
desirable to maintain executive flexibility to shift around 
funds within a particular lump-sum appropriation account 
so that agencies can make necessary adjustments for 

Page 6-12 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

‘unforeseen developments, changing requirements, . . . and 
legislation enacted subsequent to appropriations.’ [Citation 
omitted.] This is not to say that Congress does not expect 
that funds will be spent in accordance with budget 
estimates or in accordance with restrictions detailed in 
Committee reports. However, in order to preserve spending 
flexibility, it may choose not to impose these particular 
restrictions as a matter of law, but rather to leave it to the 
agencies to ‘keep faith’ with the Congress. . . . 

“On the other hand, when Congress does not intend to 
permit agency flexibility, but intends to impose a legally 
binding restriction on an agency’s use of funds, it does so by 
means of explicit statutory language. . . . 

“Accordingly, it is our view that when Congress merely 
appropriates lump-sum amounts without statutorily 
restricting what can be done with those funds, a clear 
inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally 
binding restrictions, and indicia in committee reports and 
other legislative history as to how the funds should or are 
expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements 
on Federal agencies. . . . 

“We further point out that Congress itself has often 
recognized the reprogramming flexibility of executive 
agencies, and we think it is at least implicit in such 
[recognition] that Congress is well aware that agencies are 
not legally bound to follow what is expressed in Committee 
reports when those expressions are not explicitly carried 
over into the statutory language. . . . 

“We think it follows from the above discussion that, as a 
general proposition, there is a distinction to be made 
between utilizing legislative history for the purpose of 
illuminating the intent underlying language used in a statute 
and resorting to that history for the purpose of writing into 
the law that which is not there. . . . 

“As observed above, this does not mean agencies are free to 
ignore clearly expressed legislative history applicable to the 

Page 6-13 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

use of appropriated funds. They ignore such expressions of 
intent at the peril of strained relations with the Congress. 
The Executive branch . . . has a practical duty to abide by 
such expressions. This duty, however, must be understood 
to fall short of a statutory requirement giving rise to a legal 
infraction where there is a failure to carry out that duty.” 

55 Comp. Gen. at 318, 319, 321, 325. Accordingly, GAO concluded that 
Navy’s award did not violate the appropriation act and the contract 
therefore was not illegal. 

The same volume of the Decisions of the Comptroller General contains 
another often-cited case, 55 Comp. Gen. 812 (1976), the Newport News 
case. This case also involved the Navy. This time, Navy wanted to exercise 
a contract option for construction of a nuclear powered guided missile 
frigate, designated DLGN 41. The contractor, Newport News Shipbuilding 
and Dry Dock Company, argued that exercising the contract option would 
violate the Antideficiency Act by obligating more money than Navy had in 
its appropriation. 

The appropriation in question, the “Naval Vessels” appropriation, provided 
a lump sum for vessels, much of which was earmarked, including an 
earmark for DLGN: “For Naval vessels: for the Navy, $3,156,400,000, of 
which sum $244,300,000 shall be used only for the DLGN nuclear powered 
guided missile frigate program; . . .” The committee reports on the 
appropriation act and the related authorization act indicated that, out of 
the $244 million appropriated, $152 million was for construction of the 
DLGN 41 and the remaining $92 million was for long lead time activity on 
the DLGN 42. Clearly, if the $152 million specified in the committee reports 
for the DLGN 41 was legally binding, obligations resulting from exercise of 
the contract option would exceed the available appropriation. 

The Comptroller General applied the “LTV principle” and held that the 
$152 million was not a legally binding limit on obligations for the DLGN 41. 
As a matter of law, the entire $244 million was legally available for the 
DLGN 41 because the appropriation act did not include any restriction. 
Therefore, in evaluating potential violations of the Antideficiency Act, the 
relevant appropriation amount is the total amount of the lump-sum 
appropriation minus sums already obligated, not the lower figure derived 

Page 6-14 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

from the legislative history.16 As the decision recognized, Congress could 
have imposed a legally binding limit by the very simple device of 
appropriating a specific amount only for the DLGN 41, appropriating a 
specific amount only for the DLGN 42, or by incorporating the committee 
reports in the appropriation language. 

This decision illustrates another important point: The terms “lump-sum” 
and “line-item” are relative concepts. The $244 million appropriation in the 
Newport News case could be viewed as a line-item appropriation in relation 
to the broader “Shipbuilding and Conversion” category, but it was also a 
lump-sum appropriation in relation to the two specific vessels included. 
This factual distinction does not affect the applicable legal principle. As 
the decision explained: 

“Contractor urges that LTV is inapplicable here since LTV 
involved a lump-sum appropriation whereas the DLGN 
appropriation is a more specific ‘line item’ appropriation. 
While we recognize the factual distinction drawn by 
Contractor, we nevertheless believe that the principles set 
forth in LTV are equally applicable and controlling here. . . . 
[I]mplicit in our holding in LTV and in the other authorities 
cited is the view that dollar amounts in appropriation acts 
are to be interpreted differently from statutory words in 
general. This view, in our opinion, pertains whether the 
dollar amount is a lump-sum appropriation available for a 
large number of items, as in LTV, or, as here, a more specific 
appropriation available for only two items.” 

55 Comp. Gen. at 821–22. 

A precursor of LTV and Newport News provides another interesting 
illustration. In 1974, controversy and funding uncertainties surrounded the 
Navy’s “Project Sanguine,” a communications system for sending command 
and control messages to submerged submarines from a single transmitting 
location in the United States. The Navy had requested $16.6 million for 
Project Sanguine for Fiscal Year 1974. The House deleted the request; the 
Senate restored it; the conference committee compromised and approved 

16 Of course, all this meant was that there would be no Antideficiency Act violation at the 
time the option was exercised. The decision recognized that subsequent actions could still 
produce a violation. 55 Comp. Gen. at 826. 

Page 6-15 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

$8.3 million. The Sanguine funds were included in a $2.6 billion lump-sum 
Research and Development appropriation. Navy spent more than 
$11 million for Project Sanguine in Fiscal Year 1974. The question was 
whether Navy violated the Antideficiency Act by spending more than the 
$8.3 million provided in the conference report. GAO found that it did not, 
because the conference committee’s action was not specified in the 
appropriation act and was therefore not legally binding. Significantly, the 
appropriation act did include a proviso prohibiting use of the funds for “full 
scale development” of Project Sanguine (not involved in the $11 million 
expenditure), illustrating that Congress knows perfectly well how to 
impose a legally binding restriction when it desires to do so. GAO, Legality 
of the Navy’s Expenditures for Project Sanguine During Fiscal Year 
1974, LCD-75-315 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 20, 1975). See also 

B-168482-O.M., Aug. 15, 1974. 

Similarly, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare received a 
$12 billion lump-sum appropriation for public assistance in 1975. 
Committee reports indicated that $9.2 million of this amount was being 
provided for research and development activities of the Social and 
Rehabilitation Service. Since this earmarking of the $9.2 million was not 
carried into the appropriation act itself, it did not constitute a statutory 
limit on the amount available for the program. B-164031.3, Apr. 16, 1975. 

GAO has applied the rule of the LTV and Newport News decisions in a 
number of additional cases and reports, several of which involve variations 
on the basic theme.17 One variation involves something of a reverse LTV 
theme when agencies attempt to invoke legislative history to supply a legal 
basis for their action that is absent from the relevant statutory language. In 
B-278121, Nov. 7, 1997, the Library of Congress took the position that 
appropriation language earmarking $9,619,000 for a particular purpose, to 
remain available until expended, did not require the entire amount to be 
used exclusively for that purpose. Rather, the Library maintained, the 
figure constituted merely a “cap” or upper limit on the amount available for 

17 See B-285725, Sept. 29, 2000; B-278968, May 28, 1998; B-278121, Nov. 7, 1997; B-277241,

the stated purpose. The Library pointed to the way in which the 
conference committee described the figures relative to this appropriation 
as implicitly supporting its position. GAO rejected the Library’s 
interpretation of the statutory language and, in particular, its reliance on 
implications from the legislative history: 

“Because the language of the law is clear, we have no basis 
to resort to assumptions or inferences drawn from inexplicit 
statements contained in the conference report. When the 
Congress appropriates lump-sum amounts without 
statutorily restricting what can be done with these funds, a 
clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose 
legally binding restrictions, and indicia in committee reports 
and other legislative history as to how the funds should or 
are expected to be spent do not establish any legal 
requirements on federal agencies. 55 Comp. Gen. 307, 319 
(1975). Implicit within this holding is the more basic 
proposition that an existing statutory provision cannot be 
superseded or repealed by statements, explanations, 
recommendations, or tables contained in committee reports 
or in other legislative history. Id. In other words, if 
explanations or other comments in committee reports do 
not create any legally binding restrictions on an agency’s 
discretionary authority to spend a lump-sum 
appropriation as it chooses, such comments certainly 
cannot supersede an existing statutory provision that 
establishes a legally binding amount that the agency may 
dispose of as an available appropriation.” 

B-278121, at 2 (emphasis supplied). 

Similarly, the Comptroller General flatly rejected the notion that otherwise 
illegal agency actions could be ratified and thereby validated when the 
agency notified congressional committees of the actions and the 
committees expressed no objection. See B-285725, Sept. 29, 2000; 
B-248284, Sept. 1, 1992. The decision in B-285725 observed: 

“[N]othing we reviewed clearly communicates to the 
Congress that the District [of Columbia] was requesting that 
Congress ratify or otherwise validate an unauthorized 
disbursement made by the District in excess of an available 
appropriation let alone that the Congress enact legislation 

Page 6-17 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6

that expressly or impliedly authorizes the otherwise 
unauthorized action. While legislative history may be useful 
to clarify an ambiguity in legislative language, one may not 
refer to the legislative history to write into the law that 
which is not there. 55 Comp. Gen. 307, 325 (1975). The 
District would have us write into the language of the law 
something that is not even mentioned in the relevant 
committee reports.” 

The treatment of lump-sum appropriations as described above has been 
considered by the courts as well as GAO, and they reached the same 
result.18 The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit noted that lump-sum appropriations have a “well understood 
meaning” and stated the rule as follows: 

“A lump-sum appropriation leaves it to the recipient agency 
(as a matter of law, at least) to distribute the funds among 
some or all of the permissible objects as it sees fit.” 

International Union v. Donovan, 746 F.2d 855, 861 (D.C. Cir. 1984), cert. 
denied, 474 U.S. 825 (1985). The court in that case refused to impose a 
“reasonable distribution” requirement on the exercise of the agency’s 
discretion, and found that discretion unreviewable. Id. at 862–63. See also 
McCarey v. McNamara, 390 F.2d 601 (3rd Cir. 1968); Blackhawk Heating & 
Plumbing Co. v. United States, 622 F.2d 539, 547 n.6 (Ct. Cl. 1980). 

One court, at odds with the weight of authority, concluded that an agency 
was required by 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) (purpose statute) to spend money in 
accordance with an earmark appearing only in legislative history. Blue 
Ocean Preservation Society v. Watkins, 767 F. Supp. 1518 (D. Haw. 1991). 

The Supreme Court’s 1993 decision in Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, put to 
rest any lingering uncertainty that might have existed on this point. Writing 
for a unanimous Court, Justice Souter quoted the rule stated in the LTV 

18 The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel also reached the same conclusion. See, 
e.g., Memorandum for the General Counsel, United States Marshals Service, USMS 
Obligation to Take Steps To Avoid Anticipated Appropriations Deficiency, OLC Opinion, 
May 11, 1999; 16 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 77 (1992); 4B Op. Off. Legal Counsel 702 (1980); 
4B Op. Off. Legal Counsel 674 (1980).

decision and described it as “a fundamental principle of appropriations 
law.” Id. at 192. Specifically, the Court held that reprogrammings under 
lump-sum appropriations fall within the Administrative Procedure Act’s 
exemption for actions “committed to agency discretion” (5 U.S.C. 
§ 701(a)(2)) and, therefore, are not subject to judicial review. The Court 
said that the Administrative Procedure Act “makes clear that ‘review is not 
to be had’ in these rare circumstances where the relevant statute ‘is drawn 
so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge 
the agency’s exercise of discretion.’” Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191. 

Lincoln concerned a decision by the Indian Health Service to discontinue a 
health program that had exclusively assisted Indian children in the 
southwestern United States and to channel the funds into a nationwide 
program for similar purposes. While the program had been funded for 
some years under a lump-sum appropriation, it was never mentioned in the 
language of the appropriation acts. The Court stated in this regard: 

“The allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation 
is . . . traditionally regarded as committed to agency 
discretion. After all, the very point of a lump-sum 
appropriation is to give an agency the capacity to adapt to 
changing circumstances and meet its statutory 
responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or 
desirable way. 

* * * * * 

“[A]n agency’s allocation of funds from a lump-sum 
appropriation requires a complicated balancing of a number 
of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise: whether 
its resources are best spent on one program or another; 
whether it is likely to succeed in fulfilling its statutory 
mandate; whether a particular program best fits the 
agency’s overall policies; and, indeed, whether the agency 
has enough resources to fund a program at all. . . . [T]he 
agency is far better equipped than the courts to deal with 
the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its 
priorities. Of course, an agency is not free simply to 
disregard statutory responsibilities: Congress may always 
circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by 
putting restrictions in the operative statutes (though not, as 
we have seen, just in the legislative history). And, of course, 

Page 6-19 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

we hardly need to note that an agency’s decision to ignore 
congressional expectations may expose it to grave political 
consequences. But as long as the agency allocates funds 
from a lump-sum appropriation to meet permissible 
statutory objectives, [5 U.S.C.] § 701(a)(2) gives the courts 
no leave to intrude.” 

508 U.S. at 192–93 (citations and internal quotations omitted). 

The Court noted that while the agency had repeatedly informed Congress 
about the program in question, “as we have explained, these 
representations do not translate through the medium of legislative history 
into legally binding obligations.” Id. at 194. Subsequent judicial decisions 
have, of course, followed this approach. E.g., State of California v. United 
States, 104 F.3d 1086, 1093–94 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 806 (1997); 
State of New Jersey v. United States, 91 F.3d 463, 470–71 (3rd Cir. 1996); 
Vizenor v. Babbitt, 927 F. Supp. 1193 (D. Minn. 1996); Allred v. United 
States, 33 Fed. Cl. 349 (1995). But see Ramah Navajo School Board, Inc. v. 
Babbitt, 87 F.3d 1338 (D.C. Cir. 1996).19 

While Lincoln, LTV, and related decisions clearly affirm that agencies have 
very broad legal discretion when allocating funds under lump-sum 
appropriations, an important caveat must be noted: Such discretion 
obviously does not extend to allowing an agency to avoid contractual or 
other legal obligations imposed upon it. In other words, the agency cannot 
reprogram funds otherwise available for payments under a contract and 
then claim (at least successfully) that its hands are tied from making the 
contract payments. The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Cherokee 
Nation of Oklahoma v. Leavitt, 543 U.S. 631, 125 S. Ct. 1172 (2005), 
illustrates this point. 

19 In Ramah, Congress had capped the amount appropriated for contract support cost 
payments under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, 
25 U.S.C. §§ 450–450n, at less than the total amount all recipients would have received if 
paid their full allocations under the Act. The court rejected the government’s argument (and 
the lower court’s conclusion) that Lincoln precluded judicial review of the method the 
agency devised to distribute the reduced allocations. Distinguishing Lincoln, the court held 
that the Act provided sufficient law to apply in order to determine the legality of the 
agency’s distribution method. Indeed, the court further held that the agency’s distribution 
method violated the Act. The Ramah decision is discussed further in Chapter 2, section C.2, 
and Chapter 3, section C.5.

Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Leavitt addressed the Indian Health 
Service’s obligation to pay contract support costs under the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 
§§ 450–450n.20 The Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services,21 at the request of Indian tribes, to enter into self-determination 
contracts whereby the tribes agree to administer programs and provide 
services that would otherwise be the responsibility of the federal 
government. See generally 25 U.S.C. § 450f. The federal government 
makes contract payments of not less than the amounts the government 
would have incurred in administering the programs directly, including, 
among other things, certain administrative contract support costs. Id. 
§ 450j-1(a). With respect to contract funding, 25 U.S.C. § 450j-1(b) includes 
the following proviso: 

“Notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, the 
provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the 
availability of appropriations and the Secretary is not 
required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or 
activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another 
tribe or tribal organization under this subchapter.” 

The Cherokee Nation litigation grew out of the government’s refusal to pay 
the full support cost amounts claimed by the tribes under their contracts 
for certain fiscal years. The government maintained that appropriations for 
those fiscal years were insufficient to fund the full amounts. The Court 
disagreed. The Court noted that the self-determination contracts were no 
less legally binding than ordinary procurement contracts. Cherokee Nation 
of Oklahoma v. Leavitt, 125 S. Ct. at 1178–79. The contracts for the fiscal 
years in question were funded from lump-sum appropriations to the Indian 
Health Service that, the Court pointed out, far exceeded the total payments 

20 In Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Leavitt, the Court disposed of three decisions from 
different appellate courts: Thompson v. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, 334 F.3d 1075 (Fed. 
Cir. 2003), which the Court affirmed, as well as Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Thompson, 
311 F.3d 1054 (10th Cir. 2002), and Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation v. 
Thompson, 279 F.3d 660 (9th Cir. 2002), both of which the Court reversed. Ramah Navajo 
School Board, Inc. v. Babbitt, 87 F.3d 1338 (D.C. Cir. 1996), discussed previously, is another 
decision on this subject. 

21 The Act also applies to the Secretary of the Interior and programs administered by that 
department. However, the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Leavitt case concerned selfdetermination 
contracts for the provision of services by the Department of Health and 
Human Services’ Indian Health Service.

due under the contracts and contained no restrictions on the amounts of 
such payments. Id. at 1177. The Court then recited two basic propositions 
asserted by the tribes that, it noted, the government had conceded. 

The first was the “fundamental principle of appropriations law” recognized 
in Lincoln that when Congress appropriates lump-sum amounts 
unaccompanied by restrictions, a clear inference arises that it does not 
intend to impose legally binding restrictions and committee reports and 
other legislative history do not establish legally binding requirements. 
Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Leavitt, 125 S. Ct. at 1177. The second 
was that— 

“as long as Congress has appropriated sufficient legally 
unrestricted funds to pay the contracts at issue, the 
Government normally cannot back out of a promise to pay 
on grounds of ‘insufficient appropriations,’ even if the 
contract uses language such as ‘subject to the availability of 
appropriations,’ and even if an agency’s total lump-sum 
appropriation is insufficient to pay all the contracts the 
agency has made.” 

Id. In support of this proposition, the Court cited Ferris v. United States, 
27 Ct. Cl. 542 (1892), and Blackhawk Heating & Plumbing Co. v. United 
States, 622 F.2d 539 (Ct. Cl. 1980). To the same effect, the Court quoted the 
following statement from the government’s brief on the law applicable to 
ordinary procurement contracts: 

“[I]f the amount of an unrestricted appropriation is 
sufficient to fund the contract, the contractor is entitled to 
payment even if the agency has allocated the funds to 
another purpose or assumes other obligations that exhaust 
the funds.” 

Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Leavitt, 125 S. Ct. at 1179–80 (emphasis 
supplied). 

The Court rejected the government’s contentions that the provisos in 
25 U.S.C. § 450j-1(b), quoted previously, precluded full payment under the 
contracts. The Court observed that the first proviso making funding 
“subject to the availability of appropriations” is frequently used language 
that simply makes clear that contracts cannot become binding in advance 
of appropriations or otherwise without regard to the availability of 

Page 6-22 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

appropriations. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Leavitt, 125 S. Ct. 
at 1180–81. “Since Congress appropriated adequate funds here,” said the 
Court, the first proviso, “if interpreted as ordinarily understood, would not 
help the Government.” Id. at 1181. The Court concluded that the second 
proviso, stating that the government need not reduce funding benefiting 
other tribes in order to fund self-determination contracts was likewise 
unavailing to the government: 

“The Government argues that these other funds, though 
legally unrestricted (as far as the appropriations statutes’ 
language is concerned) were nonetheless unavailable to pay 
‘contract support costs’ because the Government had to use 
those funds to satisfy a critically important need, namely, to 
pay the costs of ‘inherent federal functions,’ such as the cost 
of running the Indian Health Service’s central Washington 
office. This argument cannot help the Government, 
however, for it amounts to no more than a claim that the 
agency has allocated the funds to another purpose, albeit 
potentially a very important purpose. If an important 
alternative need for funds cannot rescue the Government 
from the binding effect of its promises where ordinary 
procurement contracts are at issue, it cannot rescue the 
Government here, for we can find nothing special in the 
statute’s language or in the contracts. 

* * * * * 

“We recognize that agencies may sometimes find that they 
must spend unrestricted appropriated funds to satisfy needs 
they believe more important than fulfilling a contractual 
obligation. But the law normally expects the Government to 
avoid such situations, for example, by refraining from 
making less essential contractual commitments; or by 
asking Congress in advance to protect funds needed for 
more essential purposes with statutory earmarks; or by 
seeking added funding from Congress; or, if necessary, by 
using unrestricted funds for the more essential purpose 
while leaving the contractor free to pursue appropriate legal 
remedies arising because the Government broke its 
contractual promise. The Government, without denying 
that this is so as a general matter of procurement law, says 

Page 6-23 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

c. “Zero Funding” Under a 
Lump-Sum Appropriation 
nothing to convince us that a different legal rule should 
apply here.” 

Id. at 1180 (citations omitted; emphasis supplied).22 

Finally, the Court declined to construe an appropriation act provision 
enacted in a subsequent fiscal year as creating a statutory cap on funding 
for the years covered by the litigation. This later-enacted provision stated 
in part: 

“Notwithstanding any other provision of law . . . amounts 
appropriated to or earmarked in committee reports for the 
Indian Health Service . . . [for] payments to tribes . . . for 
contract support costs . . . are the total amounts available 
for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 for such purposes.”23 

The Court acknowledged that it was reasonable to interpret the language as 
restricting payments for the prior years. However, it opted not to do so 
since such an interpretation would treat the language as retroactively 
repudiating a binding government contract and thereby raising 
constitutional concerns. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Leavitt, 
125 S. Ct. at 1182. The Court also rejected the government’s contention that 
the language simply clarified that the prior ambiguous appropriation 
language was not unrestricted, concluding that there was nothing 
ambiguous about the prior language. Id. Rather, the Court treated the 
later-enacted language as affecting only unobligated carryover balances 
from the prior year appropriations. 

Does discretion under a lump-sum appropriation extend so far as to permit 
an agency to “zero fund” a particular program? Although there are few 
cases, the answer would appear, for the most part, to be yes, as long as the 
program is not mandatory and the agency uses the funds for other 
authorized purposes to avoid impoundment complications. E.g., B-209680, 

22 The logical conclusion from the Court’s finding that the Indian Self-Determination Act 
contracts are no different from ordinary procurement contracts is that the Indian Health 
Service, at the time it entered into the contracts, should have recorded an obligation against 
its appropriations for the full amount of the support costs to which the Tribes were entitled.

Act, 1999, Pub. L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-288 (Oct. 21, 1998).

Feb. 24, 1983 (agency could properly decide not to fund a program where 
committee reports on appropriation stated that no funds were being 
provided for that program, although agency would have been equally free 
to fund the program under the lump-sum appropriation); B-167656, June 18, 
1971 (agency has discretion to discontinue a function funded under a lumpsum 
appropriation to cope with a shortfall in appropriations); 4B Op. Off. 
Legal Counsel 701, 704 n.7 (1980) (same point). 

The more difficult question is whether the answer is the same where there 
is no shortfall problem and where it is clear that Congress wants the 
program funded. In International Union v. Donovan, 746 F.2d 855, 861 

(D.C.Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 825 (1985), discussed previously, the 
court upheld an agency’s decision to allocate no funds to a program 
otherwise authorized for funding under a lump-sum appropriation. 
Although there was in that case a “congressional realization, if not a 
congressional intent, that nothing would be expended” for the program in 
question, 746 F.2d at 859, it seems implicit from the court’s discussion of 
applicable law that the answer would have been the same if legislative 
history had “directed” that the program be funded. The same result would 
seem to follow from 55 Comp. Gen. 812 (1976), discussed above, holding 
that the entire unobligated balance of a lump-sum appropriation should be 
considered available for one of the objects included in the appropriation, at 
least for purposes of assessing potential violations of the Antideficiency 
Act. 
In B-114833, July 21, 1978, the Department of Agriculture wanted to use its 
1978 lump-sum Resource Conservation and Development appropriation to 
fund existing projects rather than starting any new ones, even though the 
appropriations committee reports indicated that the funds were for certain 
new projects. Since the language referring to new projects was stated in 
committee reports but not in the statute itself, the Department’s proposed 
course of action was legally permissible. 

In a very early, 1922 decision, 1 Comp. Gen. 623 (1922), GAO seemed to 
suggest that there are constraints on an agency’s discretion. The 
appropriation in question provided for “rent of offices of the recorder of 
deeds, including services of cleaners as necessary, not to exceed 30 cents 
per hour, . . . $6,000.” The Comptroller General held that the entire 
$6,000 could not be spent for rent. The decision stated: 

“[S]ince [the appropriation act] provides that the amount 
appropriated shall cover both rent and cleaning services, it 

Page 6-25 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

must be held that the entire amount can not be used for rent 
alone. 

“. . . The law leaves to the discretion of the commissioners 
the question as to what portion of the amount appropriated 
shall be paid for rent and what portion shall be paid for 
services of cleaners, but it does not vest in the 
commissioners the discretion to determine that the entire 
amount shall be paid for rent and that the cleaning services 
shall be left unprovided for, or be provided for from other 
funds.” 

Id. at 624. As a practical matter it would not have been possible to rent 
office space and totally eliminate cleaning services, and the use of any 
other appropriation would have been clearly improper. A factor which 
apparently influenced the decision was that the “regular office force” was 
somehow being coerced to do the cleaning, and these were employees paid 
from a separate appropriation. Id. 

2. Line-Item 
Appropriations and 
Earmarks 
Congress may wish to specifically designate, or “earmark,” part of a more 
general lump-sum appropriation for a particular object, as either a 
maximum, a minimum, or both. 

An earmark refers to the portion of a lump-sum appropriation designated 
for a particular purpose.24 The term earmark often is used interchangeably 
with the term “line item.” In appropriations language, however, a line item 
is an appropriation that is dedicated for a specific purpose, rather than an 
amount within a lump-sum appropriation.25 The following example of 
earmarking language in a lump-sum appropriation can be found in the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004: 

24 See GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, GAO-05-734SP 
(Washington, D.C.: September 2005), at 46–47. 

25 See Glossary, at 64.

“For necessary administrative expenses of the domestic 
nutrition assistance programs funded under this Act, 
$138,304,000, of which $5,000,000 shall be available only for 
simplifying procedures, reducing overhead costs, . . . and 
prosecution of fraud and other violations of law . . .”26 

In this example, the $5 million is an earmark. 

Often, cases interpreting earmarks turn on congressional intent. See, e.g., 
B-285794, Dec. 5, 2000 (use of statutory interpretation to determine 
whether the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) heading 
requiring competition for assistance “under this heading” applied to an 
earmark within the CDBG lump-sum appropriation). 

For simplicity of illustration, let us assume that we have a lump-sum 
appropriation of $1 million for “general construction” and a particular 
object within that appropriation is “renovation of office space.” If the 
appropriation specifies “not to exceed” $100,000 for renovation of office 
space or “not more than” $100,000 for renovation of office space, then 
$100,000 is the maximum available for renovation of office space. 
64 Comp. Gen. 263 (1985).27 A specifically earmarked maximum may not 
be supplemented with funds from the general appropriation. 

Statutory authority to transfer funds between appropriations may permit 
the augmentation of a “not to exceed” earmark in some cases. In 12 Comp. 
Gen. 168 (1932), it was held that general transfer authority could be used to 
increase maximum earmarks for personal services, subject to the 
percentage limitations specified in the transfer statute because, in this 
case, the transfer authority was remedial legislation designed to mitigate 
the impact of reduced appropriations. The decision pointed out that if the 
personal services earmark had been a separate line-item appropriation, the 
transfer authority would clearly apply. Id. at 170. Somewhat similarly, in 
36 Comp. Gen. 607 (1957), funds transferred to an operating appropriation 
from a civil defense appropriation could be used to exceed an 
administrative expense limitation in the operating appropriation. Congress 

26 Pub. L. No. 108-199, div. A, title IV, 118 Stat. 3, 27 (Jan. 23, 2004). 

27 A “not to exceed” earmark was held not to constitute a maximum in 19 Comp. Gen. 61 
(1939), where the earmarking language was inconsistent with other language in the general 
appropriation. This holding was based on an interpretation of the statute as a whole. See 
section D of Chapter 2 for additional information on statutory interpretation. 

Page 6-27 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

had imposed new civil defense functions but had neglected to adjust the 
administrative expenses limitation. However, in 33 Comp. Gen. 214 (1953), 
the Comptroller General held that general transfer authority could not be 
used to exceed a maximum earmark on an emergency assistance program 
where it was clear that Congress, aware of the emergency, intended that 
the program be funded only from the earmark. See also 18 Comp. Gen. 211 
(1938). As in many cases, these decisions turned on congressional intent. 

Under a “not to exceed” earmark, the agency is not required to spend the 
entire amount on the object specified. See, e.g., Brown v. Ruckelshaus, 
364 F. Supp. 258, 266 (C.D. Cal. 1973) (“the phrase ‘not to exceed’ connotes 
limitation, not disbursement”). If, in our hypothetical, the entire $100,000 is 
not used for renovation of office space, unobligated balances may—within 
the time limits for obligation—be applied to other unrestricted objects of 
the appropriation. B-290659, July 24, 2002; 31 Comp. Gen. 578, 579 (1952); 
15 Comp. Dec. 660 (1909); B-4568, June 27, 1939. 

If later in the fiscal year a supplemental appropriation is made for 
“renovation of office space,” the funds provided in the supplemental may 
not be used to increase the $100,000 maximum for general construction 
unless the supplemental appropriation act so specifies. See section D of 
this chapter for a further discussion of supplemental appropriations. 

An earmark that authorizes an agency to use a lump-sum appropriation for 
“not more than” a certain dollar amount has the same effect as a “not to 
exceed” earmark. For example, when the Department of State received a 
lump-sum appropriation for “International Organizations and Programs” 
authorizing it to make “not more than” $34 million of that lump sum 
available for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the 
Comptroller General concluded: 

“[W]hile the appropriation limits the State Department’s use 
of the lump-sum appropriation for ‘International 
Organizations and Programs’ for UNFPA to no more than 
$34 million, it does not require by law that any amounts be 
used for UNFPA.” 

Page 6-28 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

B-290659, July 24, 2002. In this case, the State Department could use the 
funds for UNFPA only after the Department ensured that UNFPA practices 
satisfied three statutory conditions, one of which was that UNFPA would 
not fund abortions. Pub. L. No. 107-115, § 576, 115 Stat. 2118, 2168 (Jan. 10, 
2002). The Department had delayed obligating funds for UNFPA pending 
an analysis of a report of a team reviewing UNFPA’s involvement in Chinese 
family planning practices, including the funding of abortions.28 

Words like “not more than” or “not to exceed” are not the only ways to 
establish a maximum limitation. If the appropriation includes a specific 
amount for a particular object (such as “for renovation of office space, 
$100,000”), then the appropriation establishes a maximum that may not be 
exceeded. 36 Comp. Gen. 526 (1957); 19 Comp. Gen. 892 (1940); 16 Comp. 
Gen. 282 (1936). 

Another device Congress has used to designate earmarks as maximum 
limitations is the following general provision: 

“Whenever in this Act, an amount is specified within an 
appropriation for particular purposes or objects of 
expenditure, such amount, unless otherwise specified, shall 
be considered as the maximum amount that may be 
expended for said purpose or object rather than an amount 
set apart exclusively therefor.” (Emphasis added.)29 

By virtue of the “unless otherwise specified” clause, the provision does not 
apply to amounts within an appropriation which have their own specific 
earmarking “words of limitation,” such as “exclusively.” 31 Comp. Gen. 578 
(1952). 

If a lump-sum appropriation includes several particular objects and 
provides further that the appropriation “is to be accounted for as one fund” 
or “shall constitute one fund,” then the individual amounts are not 
limitations, the only limitation being that the total amount of the lump-sum 

28 While the Comptroller General concluded that the Department did not have to use funds 
for UNFPA, he cautioned that whenever an agency withholds fiscal year funds from 
obligation, it must release the funds with sufficient time remaining in the fiscal year to 
obligate them before the end of the fiscal year. B-290659, July 24, 2002.

appropriation cannot be exceeded. However, individual items within that 
lump-sum appropriation that include the “not to exceed” language will still 
constitute maximum limitations. 22 Comp. Dec. 461 (1916); 3 Comp. 
Dec. 604 (1897); A-79741, Aug. 7, 1936. The “one fund” language is generally 
used when Congress authorizes an agency to transfer unexpended balances 
of prior appropriations to a current appropriation. For example, the 
Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for 2002 states that— 

“The unexpended balances of prior appropriations provided 
for activities in the Act may be transferred to appropriation 
accounts for such activities established pursuant to the title. 
Balances so transferred may be merged with funds in the 
applicable established accounts and thereafter may be 
accounted for as one fund for the same period as originally 
enacted.”30 

If Congress wishes to specify a minimum for the particular object but not a 
maximum, the appropriation act may provide “General construction, 
$1 million, of which not less than $100,000 shall be available for renovation 
of office space.” B-137353, Dec. 3, 1959. See also 64 Comp. Gen. 388 (1985); 
B-131935, Mar. 17, 1986. If the phrase “not less than” is used, in contrast 
with the “not to exceed” language, portions of the $100,000 not obligated 
for renovation of office space may not be applied to the other objects of the 
appropriation. 64 Comp. Gen. at 394–95; B-128943, Sept. 27, 1956. 

Another phrase Congress often uses to earmark a portion of a lump-sum 
appropriation is “shall be available.” There are variations. For example, 
our hypothetical $1 million “renovation of office space” appropriation may 
provide that, out of the $1 million, $100,000 “shall be available” or “shall be 
available only” or “shall be available exclusively” for renovation of office 
space. Still another variation is “$1 million, including $100,000 for 
renovation of office space.” 

If the “shall be available” phrase is combined with the maximum or 
minimum language noted above (“not to exceed,” “not less than,” etc.), then 
the above rules apply and the phrase “shall be available” adds little. See, 
e.g., B-137353, Dec. 3, 1959. However, if the earmarking phrase “shall be 

30 Pub. L. No. 107-66, § 305, 115 Stat. 486, 509 (Nov. 12, 2001).

available” is used without the “not to exceed” or “not less than” modifiers, 
the rules are not quite as firm. 

Cases interpreting the “shall be available” and “shall be available only” 
earmarks are somewhat less than consistent. The earlier decisions 
proclaimed “shall be available” to constitute a maximum but not a 
minimum (B-5526, Sept. 14, 1939), although it could be a minimum if 
Congress clearly expressed that intent (B-128943, Sept. 27, 1956). Later 
cases held the earmark to constitute both a maximum and a minimum 
which could neither be augmented nor diverted to other objects within the 
appropriation. B-137353, Dec. 3, 1959; B-137353-O.M., Oct. 14, 1958. 
Another early decision held summarily that “shall be available only” results 
in a maximum which cannot be augmented. 18 Comp. Gen. 1013 (1939). 
Later decisions, however, have expressed the view that the effect of “shall 
be available only”—whether it is a maximum or a minimum—depends on 
the underlying congressional intent. 53 Comp. Gen. 695 (1974); B-142190, 
Mar. 23, 1960. Applying this test, the earmark in 53 Comp. Gen. 695 was 
found to be a maximum; similar language had been found a minimum in 
B-142190, which could be exceeded. 

If the phrase “shall be available” may be said to contain an element of 
ambiguity, addition of the word “only” does not produce a plain meaning. 
The Claims Court, reviewing an authorization earmark for a Navy project 
known as RACER, commented: 

“[I]t is not apparent from the language of the authorization 
($45 million ‘is available only for’) that Congress necessarily 
mandated the Navy to spend all $45 million on the RACER 
system. Rather, Congress may have merely intended to 
preclude the Navy from spending that $45 million on any 
other activities, i.e., the money would be forfeited if not 
spent on the RACER system.” 

Solar Turbines, Inc. v. United States, 23 Cl. Ct. 142, 158 (1991). 

Use of the word “exclusively” is somewhat more precise. The earmark 
“shall be available exclusively” is both a maximum which cannot be 
augmented from the general appropriation, and a minimum which cannot 
be diverted to other objects within the appropriation. B-102971, Aug. 24, 
1951. Once again, however, clearly expressed congressional intent can 
produce a different result. B-113272-O.M., May 21, 1953; B-111392-O.M., 
Oct. 17, 1952 (earmark held to be a minimum only in both cases). 

Page 6-31 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

Similarly, the term “including” has been held to establish both a maximum 
and a minimum. A-99732, Jan. 13, 1939. As such, it cannot be augmented 
from a more general appropriation (19 Comp. Gen. 892 (1940)), nor can it 
be diverted to other uses within the appropriation (67 Comp. Gen. 401 
(1988)). 

To sum up, the most effective way to establish a maximum (but not 
minimum) earmark is by the words “not to exceed” or “not more than.” 
The words “not less than” most effectively establish a minimum (but not 
maximum). These are all phrases with well-settled plain meanings. The 
“shall be available” family of earmarking language presumptively “fences 
in” the earmarked sum (both maximum and minimum), but is more subject 
to variation based upon underlying congressional intent. 

Our discussion thus far has centered on the use of earmarking language to 
prescribe the amount available for a particular object. Earmarking 
language also may be used to vary the period of availability for obligation. 

An earmarked amount within a lump-sum appropriation that is available 
without fiscal year limitation is neither a maximum nor a minimum if the 
funds have not been designated for a specific purpose. The earmark 
addresses only the time availability of the earmarked amount. For 
example, in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for 2004, the 
Salaries, Officers and Employees appropriations lump-sum account 
contained the following language: 

“For compensation and expenses of officers and employees, 
as authorized by law, $156,896,000, including: . . . for salaries 
and expenses of the Office of the Chief Administrative 
Officer, $111,141,000, of which $8,400,000 shall remain 
available until expended . . .”31 

In this instance, the earmark extended the time period availability of 
$8,400,000 of the $111,141,000 appropriated for salaries and expenses but 
did not prescribe the amount available for a particular object. 

In a 1997 decision, GAO determined that an earmark extending the time 
period also constituted a minimum for the purpose for which it was 

31 Pub. L. No. 108-83, 117 Stat. 1007, 1015 (Sept. 30, 2003).

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

earmarked. B-278121, Nov. 7, 1997 (nondecision letter). The Library of 
Congress Salaries and Expenses lump-sum appropriation stated as follows: 

“For necessary expenses of the Library of Congress not 
otherwise provided for . . . $227,016,000 . . . Provided 
further, That of the total amount appropriated, $9,619,000 is 
to remain available until expended for acquisition of books, 
periodicals, newspapers, and all other materials including 
subscriptions for bibliographic services for the Library . . .”32 

GAO determined that the Library of Congress was required to make the 
entire $9,619,000 available for acquisition of books and materials, even if 
this required reducing other expenditures within the lump-sum 
appropriation.33 

Finally, earmarking language may be found in authorization acts as well as 
appropriation acts. The same meanings apply. Several of the cases cited 
above involve authorization acts. See, e.g., 64 Comp. Gen. 388 (1985); 
B-131935, Mar. 17, 1986. 

32 Pub. L. No. 105-55, 111 Stat. 1177, 1191–92 (Oct. 7, 1997). 

33 But see B-231711, Mar. 28, 1989 (appropriation provision earmarked portion of lump sum 
to remain available for an additional fiscal year for a specific purpose, but was neither 
maximum nor minimum limitation on amount available for particular object). While 
B-231711 was not explicitly overruled by B-278121, Nov. 7, 1997, it has little precedential 
value.

The Antideficiency Act is one of the major laws in the statutory scheme by 
which Congress exercises its constitutional control of the public purse. It 
has been termed “the cornerstone of Congressional efforts to bind the 
Executive branch of government to the limits on expenditure of 
appropriated funds.”34 

As with the series of funding statutes as a whole, the Antideficiency Act did 
not hatch fully developed but evolved over a period of time in response to 
various abuses. As we noted in Chapter 1, as late as the post-Civil War 
period, it was not uncommon for agencies to incur obligations in excess, or 
in advance, of appropriations. Perhaps most egregious of all, some 
agencies would spend their entire appropriations during the first few 
months of the fiscal year, continue to incur obligations, and then return to 
Congress for appropriations to fund these “coercive deficiencies.”35 These 
were obligations to others who had fulfilled their part of the bargain with 
the United States and who now had at least a moral—and in some cases 
also a legal—right to be paid. Congress felt it had no choice but to fulfill 
these commitments, but the frequency of deficiency appropriations played 
havoc with the United States budget. 

The congressional response to abuses of this nature was the Antideficiency 
Act. Its history is summarized in the following paragraphs:36 

“Control in the execution of the Government’s budgetary 
and financial programs is based on the provisions of section 
3679 of the Revised Statutes, as amended . . ., commonly 
referred to as the Antideficiency Act. As the name . . .

Act is cited as “section 3679 of the Revised Statutes,” a designation that is now obsolete.

implies, one of the principal purposes of the legislation was 
to provide effective control over the use of appropriations 
so as to prevent the incurring of obligations at a rate which 
will lead to deficiency (or supplemental) appropriations and 
to fix responsibility on those officials of Government who 
incur deficiencies or obligate appropriations without proper 
authorization or at an excessive rate. 

“The original section 3679 . . . was derived from legislation 
enacted in 1870 [16 Stat. 251] and was designed solely to 
prevent expenditures in excess of amounts appropriated. In 
1905 [33 Stat. 1257] and 1906 [34 Stat. 48], section 3679 . . . 
was amended to provide specific prohibitions regarding the 
obligation of appropriations and required that certain types 
of appropriations be so apportioned over a fiscal year as to 
‘prevent expenditures in one portion of the year which may 
necessitate deficiency or additional appropriations to 
complete the service of the fiscal year for which said 
appropriations are made.’ Under the amended section, the 
authority to make, waive, or modify apportionments was 
vested in the head of the department or agency concerned. 
By Executive Order 6166 of June 10, 1933, this authority was 
transferred to the Director of the [Office of Management 
and Budget]. . . . 

“During and following World War II, with the expansion of 
Government functions and the increase in size and 
complexities of budgetary and operational problems, 
situations arose highlighting the need for more effective 
control and conservation of funds. In order to effectively 
cope with these conditions it was necessary to seek 
legislation clarifying certain technical aspects of 
section 3679 of the Revised Statutes, and strengthening the 
apportionment procedures, particularly as regards to 
agency control systems. Section 1211 of the General 
Appropriation Act, 1951 [64 Stat. 765], amended 
section 3679 . . . to provide a basis for more effective control 
and economical use of appropriations. Following a 
recommendation of the second Hoover Commission that 
agency allotment systems should be simplified, Congress 
passed legislation in 1956 [70 Stat. 783] further amending 
section 3679 to provide that each agency work toward the 

Page 6-35 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

objective of financing each operating unit, at the highest 
practical level, from not more than one administrative 
subdivision for each appropriation or fund affecting such 
unit. In 1957 [71 Stat. 440] section 3679 was further 
amended, adding a prohibition against the requesting of 
apportionments or reapportionments which indicate the 
necessity for a deficiency or supplemental estimate except 
on the determination of the agency head that such action is 
within the exceptions expressly set out in the law. The 
revised Antideficiency Act serves as the primary foundation 
for the Government’s administrative control of funds 
systems.” 

In its current form, the law prohibits: 

• Making or authorizing an expenditure from, or creating or authorizing 
an obligation under, any appropriation or fund in excess of the amount 
available in the appropriation or fund unless authorized by law. 
31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1)(A). 
• Involving the government in any contract or other obligation for the 
payment of money for any purpose in advance of appropriations made 
for such purpose, unless the contract or obligation is authorized by law. 
31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1)(B). 
• Accepting voluntary services for the United States, or employing 
personal services in excess of that authorized by law, except in cases of 
emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of 
property. 31 U.S.C. § 1342.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

• Making obligations or expenditures in excess of an apportionment or 
reapportionment, or in excess of the amount permitted by agency 
regulations. 31 U.S.C. § 1517(a).37 
Subsequent sections of this chapter will explore these concepts in detail. 
However, the fiscal principles inherent in the Antideficiency Act are really 
quite simple. Government officials may not make payments or commit the 
United States to make payments at some future time for goods or services 
unless there is enough money in the “bank” to cover the cost in full. The 
“bank,” of course, is the available appropriation. 

The combined effect of the Antideficiency Act, in conjunction with the 
other funding statutes discussed throughout this publication, was 
summarized in a 1962 decision. The summary has been quoted in 
numerous later Antideficiency Act cases and bears repeating here: 

“These statutes evidence a plain intent on the part of the 
Congress to prohibit executive officers, unless otherwise 
authorized by law, from making contracts involving the 
Government in obligations for expenditures or liabilities 
beyond those contemplated and authorized for the period of 
availability of and within the amount of the appropriation 
under which they are made; to keep all the departments of 
the Government, in the matter of incurring obligations for 
expenditures, within the limits and purposes of 
appropriations annually provided for conducting their 
lawful functions, and to prohibit any officer or employee of 
the Government from involving the Government in any 
contract or other obligation for the payment of money for 
any purpose, in advance of appropriations made for such

purpose; and to restrict the use of annual appropriations to 
expenditures required for the service of the particular fiscal 
year for which they are made.” 

42 Comp. Gen. 272, 275 (1962). 

To the extent it is possible to summarize appropriations law in a single 
paragraph, this is it. Viewed in the aggregate, the Antideficiency Act and 
related funding statutes “[restrict] in every possible way the expenditures 
and expenses and liabilities of the government, so far as executive offices 
are concerned, to the specific appropriations for each fiscal year.” Wilder’s 
Case, 16 Ct. Cl. 528, 543 (1880). 

2. Obligation/Expenditure 
in Excess or Advance of 
Appropriations 
The key provision of the Antideficiency Act is 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1):38 
“(a)(1) An officer or employee of the United States 
Government or of the District of Columbia government may 
not— 
“(A) make or authorize an expenditure or obligation 
exceeding an amount available in an appropriation 
or fund for the expenditure or obligation; or 
“(B) involve either government in a contract or 
obligation for the payment of money before an 
appropriation is made unless authorized by law.” 
Not only is section 1341(a)(1) the key provision of the Act, it was originally 
the only provision, the others being added to ensure enforcement of the 
basic prohibitions of section 1341. 
The law is not limited to the executive branch, but applies to any “officer or 
employee of the United States Government” and thus extends to all 
branches. Examples of legislative branch applications are B-303964, Feb. 3, 

38 Prior to the 1982 recodification of title 31 of the United States Code, the Antideficiency 
Act consisted of nine lettered subsections of what was then 31 U.S.C. § 665. The 
recodification scattered the law among several new sections. To better show the 
relationship of the material, our organization in this chapter retains the sequence of the 
former subsections.

2005 (Capitol Police use of the Legislative Branch Emergency Response 
Fund); B-303961, Dec. 6, 2004 (Architect of the Capitol); B-107279, Jan. 9, 
1952 (Office of Legislative Counsel, House of Representatives); B-78217, 
July 21, 1948 (appropriations to Senate for expenses of Office of Vice 
President); 27 Op. Att’y Gen. 584 (1909) (Government Printing Office). 
Within the judicial branch, it applies to the Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts. E.g., 50 Comp. Gen. 589 (1971). However, whether a 
federal judge is an officer or employee for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1341(a)(1) appears to remain an open question, at least in some contexts. 
See Armster v. United States District Court, 792 F.2d 1423, 1427 n.7 
(9th Cir. 1986) (the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution prohibits 
suspension of civil jury trials for lack of funds, whether or not a judge is 
considered an employee or officer under the Antideficiency Act). The 
Antideficiency Act also applies to officers of the District of Columbia 
Courts. B-284566, Apr. 3, 2000. 

Some government corporations are also classified as agencies of the United 
States Government, and to the extent they operate with funds which are 
regarded as appropriated funds, they too are subject to 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1341(a)(1). E.g., B-223857, Feb. 27, 1987 (Commodity Credit 
Corporation); B-135075-O.M., Feb. 14, 1975 (Inter-American Foundation). 
It follows that section 1341(a)(1) does not apply to a government 
corporation that is not an agency of the United States Government. E.g., 
B-175155-O.M., July 26, 1976 (Amtrak). These principles are, of course, 
subject to variation if and to the extent provided in the relevant organic 
legislation. 

There are two distinct prohibitions in section 1341(a)(1). Unless otherwise 
authorized by law, no officer or employee of the United States may 

(1)make any expenditure or incur an obligation in excess of available 
appropriations, or (2) make an expenditure or incur an obligation in 
advance of appropriations. 
The distinction between obligating in excess of an appropriation and 
obligating in advance of an appropriation is clear in the majority of cases, 
but can occasionally become blurred. For example, an agency which tries 
to meet a current shortfall by “borrowing” from (i.e., obligating against) the 
unenacted appropriation for the next fiscal year is clearly obligating in 
advance of an appropriation. E.g., B-236667, Jan. 26, 1990. However, it is 
also obligating in excess of the currently available appropriation. Since 
both are equally illegal, determining precisely which subsection of 
31 U.S.C. § 1341(a) has been violated is of secondary importance. In any 

Page 6-39 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

event, the point to be stressed here is that the law is violated not just when 
there are insufficient funds in an account when a payment becomes due. 
The very act of obligating the United States to make a payment when the 
necessary funds are not already in the account is also a violation of 
31 U.S.C. § 1341(a). E.g., B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003. 

In B-290600, July 10, 2002, both the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) and the Airline Transportation Stabilization Board (ATSB) violated 
the Antideficiency Act when OMB apportioned, and ATSB obligated an 
appropriation, in advance of, and thus in excess of, its availability. The Air 
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act authorized the 
President to issue up to $10 billion in loan guarantees, and to provide the 
subsidy amounts necessary for such guarantees,39 to assist air carriers who 
incurred losses resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on 
the United States. Pub. L. No. 107-42, title I, § 101(a)(1), 115 Stat. 230 
(Sept. 22, 2001). Congress established the ATSB to review and decide on 
applications for these loan guarantees. The budget authority for the 
guarantees was available only “to the extent that a request, that includes 
designation of such amount as an emergency requirement . . . is transmitted 
by the President to Congress.” Id. at § 101(b). The President had not 
submitted such a request at the time OMB apportioned the funds to ATSB 
and the ATSB obligated the funds; therefore, both OMB and ATSB made 
funds available in advance of their availability, violating the Antideficiency 
Act. See section C of this chapter for a discussion of the apportionment 
process. 

Note that 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a) refers to overobligating and overspending the 
amount available in an “appropriation or fund.” The phrase “appropriation 
or fund” refers to appropriation and fund accounts. An appropriation 
account is the basic unit of an appropriation generally reflecting each 
unnumbered paragraph in an appropriation act. Fund accounts include 
general fund accounts, intragovernmental fund accounts, special fund 
accounts, and trust fund accounts.40 See, e.g., 72 Comp. Gen. 59 (1992) 
(Corps of Engineers was prohibited by the Antideficiency Act from 
overobligating its Civil Works Revolving Fund’s available budget authority). 

39 Pursuant to the Federal Credit Reform Act, agencies are required to have budget authority 
in advance to cover the long-term costs (i.e., subsidy costs) of direct loans and loan 
guarantees. 2 U.S.C. § 661c(b).

a. Exhaustion of an 
Appropriation 
Thus, for example, the Antideficiency Act applies to Indian trust funds 
managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. However, the investment of these 
funds in certificates of deposit with federally insured banks under authority 
of 25 U.S.C. § 162a does not, in GAO’s opinion, constitute an obligation or 
expenditure for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 1341. Accordingly, overinvested 
trust funds do not violate the Antideficiency Act unless the overinvested 
funds, or any attributable interest income, are obligated or expended by the 
Bureau. B-207047-O.M., June 17, 1983. Cf. B-303413, Nov. 8, 2004 (the 
Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) regulatory action to provide 
spectrum rights through a license modification instead of an auction did 
not violate section 1341; spectrum licenses that impose costs and expenses 
on the licensee do not constitute an obligation and expenditure of the 
FCC). GAO also views the Antideficiency Act as applicable to presidential 
and vice-presidential “unvouchered expenditure” accounts. B-239854, 
June 21, 1990 (internal memorandum). 

When we talk about an appropriation being “exhausted,” we are really 
alluding to any of several different but related situations: 

• Depletion of appropriation account (i.e., fully obligated and/or 
expended). 
• Similar depletion of a maximum amount specifically earmarked in a 
lump-sum appropriation.41 
• Depletion of an amount subject to a monetary ceiling imposed by some 
other statute (usually, but not always, the relevant program legislation). 
(1) Making further payments 
In simple terms, once an appropriation is exhausted, the making of any 
further payments, apart from using expired balances to liquidate or make 
adjustments to valid obligations recorded against that appropriation, 
violates 31 U.S.C. § 1341. When the appropriation is fully expended, no 
further payments may be made in any case. If an agency finds itself in this 
position, unless it has transfer authority or other clear statutory basis for 

41 See section B of this chapter for a discussion of earmarking. 

Page 6-41 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

making further payments, it has little choice but to seek a deficiency42 or 
supplemental appropriation from Congress, and to adjust or curtail 
operations as may be necessary. E.g., B-285725, Sept. 29, 2000; 61 Comp. 
Gen. 661 (1982); 38 Comp. Gen. 501 (1959). For example, when the 
Corporation for National and Community Service obligated funds in excess 
of the amount available to it in the National Service Trust, the Corporation 
suspended participant enrollment in the AmeriCorps program and 
requested a deficiency appropriation from Congress.43 

In many ways, the prohibitions in the Adequacy of Appropriations Act, 
41 U.S.C. § 11, parallel those of 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a). The Adequacy of 
Appropriations Act states in part that— 

“No contract or purchase on behalf of the United States 
shall be made, unless the same is authorized by law or is 
under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment, except in 
the Department of Defense and in the Department of 
Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is 
not operating as a service in the Navy, for clothing, 
subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation, or 
medical and hospital supplies, which, however, shall not 
exceed the necessities of the current year.” 

41 U.S.C. § 11(a). For example, a contract in excess of the available 
appropriation violates both statutes. E.g., 9 Comp. Dec. 423 (1903). 
However, a contract in compliance with 41 U.S.C. § 11 can still result in a 
violation of the Antideficiency Act. Assessment of Antideficiency Act 
violations is not frozen at the point when the obligation is incurred. Even if 
the initial obligation was well within available funds, the Antideficiency Act 
can still be violated if upward adjustments cause the obligation to exceed 
available funds. E.g., 55 Comp. Gen. 812, 826 (1976). 

42 See 31 U.S.C. §§ 1552(a), 1553(a), 1554(a), and Chapter 5, section D, for a discussion of 
expired and closed appropriation accounts.

What one authority termed the “granddaddy of all violations”44 occurred 
when the Navy overobligated and overspent nearly $110 million from its 
“Military Personnel, Navy” appropriation during the years 1969–1972. GAO 
summarized the violation in a letter report, B-177631, June 7, 1973. While 
there may have been some concealment, GAO concluded that the violation 
was not the result of some evil scheme; rather, the “basic cause of the 
violation was the separation of the authority to create obligations from the 
responsibility to control them.” The authority to create obligations had 
been decentralized while control was centralized in the Bureau of Naval 
Personnel. 

Granddaddy was soon to lose his place of honor on the totem pole. Around 
November of 1975, the Department of the Army discovered that, for a 
variety of reasons, it had overobligated four procurement appropriations in 
the aggregate amount of more than $160 million and consequently had to 
halt payments to some 900 contractors. The Army requested the 
Comptroller General’s advice on a number of potential courses of action it 
was considering. The resulting decision was 55 Comp. Gen. 768 (1976). 
The Army recognized its duty to mitigate the Antideficiency Act violation.45 
It was clear that without a deficiency appropriation, all the contractors 
could not be paid. One option—to use current appropriations to pay the 
deficiencies—had to be rejected because there is no authority to apply 
current funds to pay off debts incurred in a previous year. Id. at 773. An 
option GAO endorsed was to reduce the amount of the deficiencies by 
terminating some of the contracts for convenience, although the 
termination costs would still have to come from a deficiency appropriation 
unless there was enough left in the appropriation accounts to cover them. 

Id. 

(2) Limitations on contractor recovery 
If the Antideficiency Act prohibits any further payments when the 
appropriation is exhausted, where does this leave the contractor? Is the 
contractor expected to know how and at what rate the agency is spending 
its money? There is a small body of judicial case law which discusses the 
effect of the exhaustion of appropriations on government obligations. The 

44 Louis Fisher, Presidential Spending Power, 236 (1975). 

45 “We believe it is obvious that, once an Antideficiency Act violation has been discovered, 
the agency concerned must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the violation 
insofar as it remains executory.” 55 Comp. Gen. at 772. 

Page 6-43 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

fate of the contractor seems to depend on the type of appropriation 
involved and the presence or absence of notice, actual or constructive, to 
the contractor on the limitations of the appropriation. 

Where a contractor is but one party out of several to be paid from a general 
appropriation, the contractor is under no obligation to know the status or 
condition of the appropriation account on the government’s books. If the 
appropriation becomes exhausted, the Antideficiency Act may prevent the 
agency from making any further payments, but valid obligations will 
remain enforceable in the courts. For example, in Ferris v. United States, 
27 Ct. Cl. 542 (1892), the plaintiff had a contract with the government to 
dredge a channel in the Delaware River. The Corps of Engineers made him 
stop work halfway through the job because it had run out of money. In 
discussing the contractor’s rights in a breach of contract suit, the court 
said: 

“A contractor who is one of several persons to be paid out of 
an appropriation is not chargeable with knowledge of its 
administration, nor can his legal rights be affected or 
impaired by its maladministration or by its diversion, 
whether legal or illegal, to other objects. An appropriation 
per se merely imposes limitations upon the Government’s 
own agents; it is a definite amount of money entrusted to 
them for distribution; but its insufficiency does not pay the 
Government’s debts, nor cancel its obligations, nor defeat 
the rights of other parties.” 

Id. at 546. 

The rationale for this rule is that “a contractor cannot justly be expected to 
keep track of appropriations where he is but one of several being paid from 
the fund.” Ross Construction Corp. v. United States, 392 F.2d 984, 987 
(Ct. Cl. 1968). Other illustrative cases are Dougherty ex rel. Slavens v. 
United States, 18 Ct. Cl. 496 (1883), and Joplin v. United States, 89 Ct. 
Cl. 345 (1939). The Antideficiency Act may “apply to the official, but [does] 
not affect the rights in this court of the citizen honestly contracting with the 
Government.” Dougherty, 18 Ct. Cl. at 503. Thus, it is settled that 
contractors paid from a general appropriation are not barred from 
recovering for breach of contract even though the appropriation is 
exhausted. 

Page 6-44 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

However, under a specific line-item appropriation, the answer is different. 
The contractor in this situation is deemed to have notice of the limits on the 
spending power of the government official with whom he contracts. A 
contract under these circumstances is valid only up to the amount of the 
available appropriation. Exhaustion of the appropriation will generally bar 
any further recovery beyond that limit. E.g., Sutton v. United States, 
256 U.S. 575 (1921); Hooe v. United States, 218 U.S. 322 (1910); Shipman v. 
United States, 18 Ct. Cl. 138 (1883); Dougherty, 18 Ct. Cl. at 503. 

The distinction between the Ferris and Sutton lines of cases follows 
logically from the old maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse. If 
Congress appropriates a specific dollar amount for a particular contract, 
that amount is specified in the appropriation act and the contractor is 
deemed to know it. It is certainly not difficult to locate. If, on the other 
hand, a contract is but one activity under a larger appropriation, it is not 
reasonable to expect the contractor to know how much of that 
appropriation remains available for it at any given time. A requirement to 
obtain this information would place an unreasonable burden on the 
contractor, not to mention a nuisance for the government as well. 

In two cases in the 1960s, the Court of Claims permitted recovery on 
contractor claims in excess of a specific monetary ceiling. See Anthony P. 
Miller, Inc. v. United States, 348 F.2d 475 (Ct. Cl. 1965) (claim by Capehart 
Housing Act contractor); Ross Construction Corp. v. United States, 
392 F.2d 984 (Ct. Cl. 1968) (claim by contractor for “off-site” construction 
ancillary to Capehart Act housing). The court distinguished between 
matters not the fault or responsibility of the contractor (for example, 
defective plans or specifications or changed conditions under the “changed 
conditions” clause), in which case above-ceiling claims are allowable, and 
excess costs resulting from what it termed “simple extras,” in which case 
they are not. Without attempting to detail the fairly complex Capehart 
legislation here, we note merely that Ross is more closely analogous to the 
Ferris situation (392 F.2d at 986), while Anthony P. Miller is more closely 
analogous to the Sutton situation (392 F.2d at 987). The extent to which the 
approach reflected in these cases will be applied to the more traditional 
form of exhaustion of appropriations remains to be developed, although 
the Ross court intimated that it saw no real distinction for these purposes 
between a specific appropriation and a specific monetary ceiling imposed

b. Contracts or Other 
Obligations in Excess or 
Advance of Appropriations 
It is easy enough to say that the Antideficiency Act prohibits you from 
obligating a million dollars when you have only half a million left in the 
account, or that it prohibits you from entering into a contract in September 
purporting to obligate funds for the next fiscal year that have not yet been 
appropriated. Many of the situations that actually arise from day to day, 
however, are not quite that simple. A useful starting point is the 
relationship of the Antideficiency Act to the recording of obligations under 
31 U.S.C. § 1501. 

(1) Proper recording of obligations 
Proper recording practices are essential to sound funds control. An 
amount of recorded obligations in excess of the available appropriation is 
prima facie evidence of a violation of the Antideficiency Act, but is not 
conclusive. B-134474-O.M., Dec. 18, 1957. 46 

An example of this is B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003, in which the Corporation for 
National and Community Services failed to recognize and record 
obligations for national service educational benefits of AmeriCorps 
participants when it incurred that obligation. In that case, the Corporation 
made grant awards to state corporations, who, in turn, made subgrants to 
nonprofit entities, who enrolled participants. In its grant awards to the 
state corporations, the Corporation approved the enrollment of a specified 
number of new program participants. Because the Corporation in the grant 
agreement had committed to a specified number of new participants, the 
Corporation incurred an obligation for the participants’ educational 
benefits at that time; without further action by the Corporation, the 
Corporation was legally required to pay education benefits of all 
participants, up to the number the Corporation had specified in the grant 
agreement, if the grantee and subgrantee, who needed no further approval 
from the Corporation, enrolled that number of new participants, and if they 
satisfied the criteria for benefits. The Corporation’s failure to recognize 
and record its obligation did not ameliorate its violation of the Act. See also 

B-300480.2, June 6, 2003. 

Also, in many situations, the amount of the government’s liability is not 
definitely fixed at the time the obligation is incurred. An example is a 

46 GAO has cautioned, however, that an Antideficiency Act violation should not be 
determined solely on the basis of year-end reports prior to reconciliation and adjustment. 

B-114841.2-O.M., Jan. 23, 1986.

contract with price escalation provisions. A violation would occur if 
sufficient budget authority is not available when an agency must adjust a 
recorded obligation. See, e.g., B-240264, Feb. 7, 1994 (an agency would 
incur an Antideficiency Act violation if it must adjust an obligation for an 
incrementally funded contract to fully reflect the extent of the bona fide 
need contracted for and sufficient appropriations are not available to 
support the adjustment). 

This is illustrated in B-289209, May 31, 2002. After holding that the Coast 
Guard had wrongly used no-year funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust 
Fund for administrative expenses, GAO concluded that the agency should 
adjust its accounting records by deobligating the incorrectly charged 
expenses and charging them instead to the proper appropriation. GAO 
advised the Coast Guard that these adjustments could result in a violation 
of the Antideficiency Act to the extent that there was insufficient budget 
authority, and that the agency should report any deficiency in accordance 
with the Antideficiency Act. 

The incurring of an obligation in excess or advance of appropriations 
violates the Act, and this is not affected by the agency’s failure to record the 
obligation. E.g., 71 Comp. Gen. 502, 509 (1992); 65 Comp. Gen. 4, 9 (1985); 
62 Comp. Gen. 692, 700 (1983); 55 Comp. Gen. 812, 824 (1976); B-245856.7, 
Aug. 11, 1992. 

(2) Obligation in excess of appropriations 
Incurring an obligation in excess of the available appropriation violates 
31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1).47 As the Comptroller of the Treasury advised an 
agency head many years ago, “your authority in the matter was strictly 
limited by the amount of the appropriation; otherwise there would be no 
limit to your power to incur expenses for the service of a particular fiscal 
year.” 9 Comp. Dec. 423, 425 (1903). If you want higher authority, the 
Supreme Court has stated that, absent statutory authorization, “it is clear 
that the head of the department cannot involve the government in an 
obligation to pay any thing in excess of the appropriation.” Bradley v. 
United States, 98 U.S. 104, 114 (1878). 

47 Determining the amount of available budget authority against which obligations may be 
incurred is covered later in this chapter in section C.2.e under the heading “Amount of 
Available Appropriation or Fund.” 

Page 6-47 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

To take a fairly simple illustration, the statute was violated by an agency’s 
acceptance of an offer to install automatic telephone equipment for 
$40,000 when the unobligated balance in the relevant appropriation was 
only $20,000. 35 Comp. Gen. 356 (1955). 

In a 1969 case, the Air Force wanted to purchase computer equipment but 
did not have sufficient funds available. It attempted an arrangement 
whereby it made an initial down payment, with the balance of the purchase 
price to be paid in installments over a period of years, the contract to 
continue unless the government took affirmative action to terminate. This 
was nothing more than a sale on credit, and since the contract constituted 
an obligation in excess of available funds, it violated the Antideficiency Act. 

48 Comp. Gen. 494 (1969). 

(3) Variable quantity contracts 
A leading case discussing the Antideficiency Act ramifications of “variable 
quantity” contracts (requirements contracts, indefinite quantity contracts, 
and similar arrangements) is 42 Comp. Gen. 272 (1962).48 That decision 
considered a 3-year contract the Air Force had awarded to a firm to provide 
any service or maintenance work necessary for government aircraft 
landing on Wake Island. GAO questioned the legality of entering into a 
contract of more than 1 year since the Air Force had only a 1-year 
appropriation available. The Air Force argued that it was a “requirements” 
contract, that no obligation would arise unless or until some maintenance 
work was ordered, and that the only obligation was a negative one—not to 
buy service from anyone else but the contractor should the services be 
needed. GAO disagreed. The services covered were “automatic incidents 
of the use of the air field.” There was no place for a true administrative 
determination that the services were or were not needed. There was no 
true “contingency” as the services would almost certainly be needed if the 
base were to remain operational. Accordingly, the contract was not a true 
requirements contract but amounted to a firm obligation for the needs of 
future years, and was therefore an unauthorized multiyear contract. As 
such, it violated the Antideficiency Act. The solution was to contract on an 
annual basis with renewal options from year to year, and, if that did not 

48 We cover the obligational treatment of contracts of this type in Chapter 7, section B.1.e, 
which should be read in conjunction with this section.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

meet the Air Force’s needs, then ask Congress for multiyear procurement 
authority.49 

The Wake Island decision noted that the contract contained no provision 
permitting the Air Force to reduce or eliminate requirements short of a 
termination for convenience. Id. at 277. If the contract had included such 
a provision—and in the unlikely event that, given the nature of the contract, 
such a provision could have been meaningful—a somewhat different 
analysis might have resulted. Compare, for example, the situation in 
55 Comp. Gen. 812 (1976). The exercise of a contract option required the 
Navy to furnish various items of government-furnished property (GFP), but 
another contract clause authorized the Navy to unilaterally delete items of 
GFP. If the entire quantity of GFP had to be treated as a firm obligation at 
the time the option was exercised, the obligation would have exceeded 
available appropriations, resulting in an Antideficiency Act violation. 
However, since the Navy was not absolutely obligated to furnish all the 
GFP items at the time the option was exercised, the Navy could avert a 
violation if it were able to delete enough GFP to stay within the available 
appropriation; if it found that it could not do so, the violation would then 
exist.50 See also B-134474-O.M., Dec. 18, 1957. 

In 47 Comp. Gen. 155 (1967), GAO considered an Air Force contract for 
mobile generator sets which specified minimum and maximum quantities 
to be purchased over a 12-month period. Since the contract committed the 
Air Force to purchase only the minimum quantity, it was necessary to 
obligate only sufficient funds to cover that minimum. See also B-287619, 
July 5, 2001. Subsequent orders for additional quantities up to the 
maximum were not legally objectionable as long as the Air Force had 
sufficient funds to cover the cost when it placed those orders. See also 

49 The authority was subsequently sought and granted. See 10 U.S.C. § 2306(g). For a 
discussion of multiyear contracting authority for defense and civilian agencies, which 
authorize obligating annual funds in advance of appropriations, see Chapter 5, section B.9.b. 

50 The rationale worked in that case because the Navy could stay within the appropriation by 
deleting a relatively small percentage of GFP. If the numbers had been different, such that 
the amount of GFP to be deleted was so large as to effectively preclude contractor 
performance, the analysis might well have been different. In a 1964 report, for example, 
GAO found the Antideficiency Act violated where the Air Force, to keep within a “minor 
military construction” ceiling, deleted needed plumbing, heating, and lighting from a 
building alteration contract, resulting in an incomplete facility, and subsequently charged 
the deleted items to Operation and Maintenance appropriations. GAO, Continuing 
Inadequate Control over Programming and Financing of Construction, B-133316 
(Washington, D.C.: July 23, 1964), at 12–15.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

19 Comp. Gen. 980 (1940). The fact that the Air Force, at the time it entered 
into the contract, did not have sufficient funds available to cover the 
maximum quantity was, for Antideficiency Act purposes, irrelevant. The 
decision distinguished the Wake Island case on the basis that nothing in the 
mobile generator contract purported to commit the Air Force to obtain any 
requirements over and above the specified minimum from the contractor. 

In 63 Comp. Gen. 129 (1983), GAO found no Antideficiency Act problems 
with a General Services Administration “Multiple Award Schedule” 
contract under which no minimum purchases were guaranteed and no 
binding obligation would arise unless and until a using agency made an 
administrative determination that it had a requirement for a scheduled 
item. 

Regardless of whether we are dealing with a requirements contract, 
indefinite quantity contract, or some variation, two points apply as far as 
the Antideficiency Act is concerned: 

• Whether or not there is a violation at the time the contract is entered 
into depends on exactly what the government is obligated to do under 
the contract. 
• Even if there is no violation at the time the contract is entered into, a 
violation may occur later if the government subsequently incurs an 
obligation under the contract in excess of available funds, for example, 
by electing to order a maximum quantity without sufficient funds to 
cover the quantity ordered. 
A conceptually related situation is a contract that gives the government the 
option of two performances at different prices. The government can enter 
into such a contract without violating the Antideficiency Act as long as it 
has sufficient appropriations available at the time the contract is entered 
into to pay the lesser amount. For example, the Defense Production Act of 
1950 authorizes the President to contract for synthetic fuels, but the 
contract must give the President the option to refuse delivery and instead 
pay the contractor the amount by which the contract price exceeds the 
prevalent market price at the time of the delivery. Such a contract would 
not violate the Antideficiency Act at the time it is entered into as long as 
sufficient appropriations are available to pay any anticipated difference 
between the contract price and the estimated market price at the time of 
performance. 60 Comp. Gen. 86 (1980). Of course, the government could

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

choose not to accept delivery unless there were sufficient appropriations 
available at that time to cover the full cost of the fuel under the contract. 

An agreement to pay “special termination” costs under an incrementally 
funded contract creates a firm obligation, not a contingent liability, to pay 
the contractor because the contracting agency remains liable for the costs 
even if it decides not to fund the contract further. B-238581, Oct. 31, 1990. 

(4) Multiyear or “continuing” contracts 
A multiyear contract is a contract covering the needs or requirements of 
more than one fiscal year. Our discussion here presupposes a general 
familiarity with relevant portions of Chapter 5, primarily the nature of a 
fixed-term appropriation and the bona fide needs rule as it applies to 
multiyear contracts. 

We start with some very basic propositions: 

• A fixed-term appropriation (fiscal year or multiple year) may be 
obligated only during its period of availability. 
• A fixed-term appropriation may be validly obligated only for the bona 
fide needs of that fixed term. 
• The Antideficiency Act prohibits the making of contracts which exceed 
currently available appropriations or which purport to obligate 
appropriations not yet made. 
As we have seen in Chapter 5, performance may extend into a subsequent 
fiscal year in certain situations. Also, as long as a contract is properly 
obligated against funds for the year in which it was made, actual payment 
can extend into subsequent years. Apart from these situations, and unless 
the agency either has specific multiyear contracting authority (e.g., 
62 Comp. Gen. 569 (1983)), is contracting in compliance with the multiyear 
contracting provisions of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 
(discussed below and in Chapter 5 in relation to the bona fide needs rule), 
or is operating under a no-year appropriation (e.g., 43 Comp. Gen. 657 
(1964)), the Antideficiency Act, together with the bona fide needs rule, 
prohibits contracts purporting to bind the government beyond the 

Page 6-51 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

obligational duration of the appropriation.51 This is because the current 
appropriation is not available for future needs, and appropriations for 
those future needs have not yet been made. Citations to support this 
proposition are numerous.52 The rule applies to any attempt to obligate the 
government beyond the end of the fiscal year, even where the contract 
covers a period of only a few months. 24 Comp. Gen. 195 (1944). 

An understanding of the principles applicable to multiyear contracting 
begins with a discussion of a 1926 decision of the United States Supreme 
Court. An agency had entered into a long-term lease for office space with 
1-year (i.e., fiscal year) funds, but its contract specifically provided that 
payment for periods after the first year was subject to the availability of 
future appropriations. In Leiter v. United States, 271 U.S. 204 (1926), the 
Supreme Court specifically rejected that theory. The Court held that the 
lease was binding on the government only for one fiscal year, and it ceased 
to exist at the end of the fiscal year in which the obligation was incurred. It 
takes affirmative action to bring the obligation back to life. The Court 
stated its position as follows: 

“It is not alleged or claimed that these leases were made 
under any specific authority of law. And since at the time 
they were made there was no appropriation available for the 
payment of rent after the first fiscal year, it is clear that in so 
far as their terms extended beyond that year they were in 
violation of the express provisions of the [Antideficiency 
Act]; and, being to that extent executed without authority of 
law, they created no binding obligation against the United 
States after the first year. [Citations omitted.] A lease to the 
Government for a term of years, when entered into under an 
appropriation available for but one fiscal year, is binding on 
the Government only for that year. [Citations omitted.] And 
it is plain that, to make it binding for any subsequent year, it 
is necessary, not only that an appropriation be made 

51 Every violation of the bona fide needs rule does not necessarily violate the Antideficiency 
Act as well. Determinations must be made on a case-by-case basis. 71 Comp. Gen. 428, 431 
(1992); B-235086.2, Jan. 22, 1992 (nondecision letter). 

52 E.g., 67 Comp. Gen. 190 (1988); 66 Comp. Gen. 556 (1987); 61 Comp. Gen. 184, 187 (1981); 
48 Comp. Gen. 471, 475 (1969); 42 Comp. Gen. 272 (1962); 37 Comp. Gen. 60 (1957); 
36 Comp. Gen. 683 (1957); 33 Comp. Gen. 90 (1953); 29 Comp. Gen. 91 (1949); 27 Op. Att’y 
Gen. 584 (1909).

available for the payment of the rent, but that the 
Government, by its duly authorized officers, affirmatively 
continue the lease for such subsequent year; thereby, in 
effect, by the adoption of the original lease, making a new 
lease under the authority of such appropriation for the 
subsequent year.” 

Id. at 206–07. 

The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA) supplied the 
“specific authority of law” missing in Leiter to enable agencies to enter into 
multiyear contracts using fiscal year funds.53 The multiyear contracts 
provision, codified at 41 U.S.C. § 254c, authorizes executive agencies, using 
fiscal year funds, to enter into multiyear contracts (defined as contracts for 
more than 1 but not more than 5 years) for the acquisition of property or 
services. 

To take advantage of FASA, the agency must either (1) obligate the full 
amount of the contract to the appropriation current at the time it enters 
into the contract, or (2) obligate the costs of the first year of the contract 
plus termination costs. Of course, if the agency elects to obligate only the 
costs of the individual years for each year of the contract, the agency needs 
to obligate the costs of each such year against the appropriation current for 
that year. Contracts relying on FASA must provide that the contract will be 
terminated if funds are not made available for the continuation of the 
contract in any fiscal year covered by the contract. Funds available for 
termination costs remain available for such costs until the obligation for 
termination costs has been satisfied. 41 U.S.C. § 254c(b). 

Importantly, FASA does not apply to all contracts that are intended to meet 
the needs of more than one fiscal year. Obviously, if multiple year or noyear 
appropriations are legally available for the full contract period, an 
agency need not rely on FASA. Also, certain contract forms do not 
constitute multiyear contracts within the scope of FASA. For example, in 
B-302358, Dec. 27, 2004, GAO determined that a Bureau of Customs and 
Border Protection procurement constituted an “indefinite-delivery, 
indefinite-quantity” (IDIQ) contract that was not subject to FASA. The 

53 See also 10 U.S.C. §§ 2306b and 2306c, which provide similar authority for defense 
agencies and the other agencies listed in 10 U.S.C. § 2302(1). FASA does not affect these 
authorities. 41 U.S.C. § 254c(e). 

Page 6-53 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

decision explained that, unlike a contract covered by FASA, an IDIQ 
contract does not obligate the government beyond its initial year. Rather, it 
obligates the government only to order a minimum amount of supplies or 
services. The cost of that minimum amount is recorded as an obligation 
against the appropriation current when the contract is entered into.54 

Leiter provides the general framework governing the legality of contracts 
carrying potential liabilities beyond the fiscal year availability of the 
appropriations that funded them. While FASA provides the necessary 
authority to avoid the Leiter problems, the Leiter analysis remains relevant 
to the extent that FASA does not apply. Thus, GAO decisions interpreting 
Leiter before enactment of FASA still need to be considered. For example, 
GAO refused to approve an automatic, annual renewal of a contract for 
repair and storage of automotive equipment, even though the contract 
provided that the government had a right to terminate. The reservation of a 
right to terminate does not save the contract from the prohibition against 
binding the government in advance of appropriations. 28 Comp. Gen. 553 
(1949). 

The Post Office wanted to enter into a contract for services and storage of 
government-owned highway vehicles for periods up to 4 years because it 
could obtain a more favorable flat rate per mile of operations instead of an 
item by item charge required if the contract was for 1 year only. GAO held 
that any contract for continuous maintenance and storage of the vehicles 
would be prohibited by 31 U.S.C. § 1341 because it would obligate the 
government beyond the extent of the existing appropriation. However, 
there would be no legal objection to including a provision that gave the 
government an affirmative option to renew the contract from year to year, 
not to exceed 4 years as specified in the statute authorizing the Postmaster 
to enter into these types of contracts. 29 Comp. Gen. 451 (1950).55 

Where a contract gives the government a renewal option, it may not be 
exercised until appropriations for the subsequent fiscal year actually 
become available. 61 Comp. Gen. 184, 187 (1981). Under a 1-year contract 

54 See Chapter 7, section B.1.e for a further discussion of recording obligations under IDIQ 
and similar contracts. 

55 Some additional cases are 67 Comp. Gen. 190 (1988); 66 Comp. Gen. 556 (1987); 42 Comp. 
Gen. 272, 276 (1962); 37 Comp. Gen. 155, 160 (1957); 37 Comp. Gen. 60, 62 (1957); 36 Comp. 
Gen. 683 (1957); 9 Comp. Gen. 6 (1929); B-116427, Sept. 27, 1955. See also Cray Research v. 
United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 327 (1999). 

Page 6-54 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

with renewal options, the fact that funds become available in subsequent 
years does not place the government under an obligation to exercise the 
renewal option. Government Systems Advisors, Inc. v. United States, 
13 Cl. Ct. 470 (1987), aff’d, 847 F.2d 811 (Fed. Cir. 1988).56 

Note that, in Leiter, the inclusion of a contract provision conditioning the 
government’s obligation on the subsequent availability of funds was to no 
avail. In this regard, see also 67 Comp. Gen. 190, 194 (1988); 42 Comp. 
Gen. 272, 276 (1962); 36 Comp. Gen. 683 (1957). If a “subject to availability” 
clause were sufficient to permit multiyear contracting, the effect would be 
automatic continuation from year to year unless the government 
terminated. If funds were not available and the government nevertheless 
permitted or acquiesced in the continuation of performance, the contractor 
would obviously be performing in the expectation of being paid.57 Apart 
from questions of legal liability, the failure by Congress to appropriate the 
money might be viewed as a serious breach of faith. Congress, as a 
practical if not a legal matter, would have little real choice but to 
appropriate funds to pay the contractor. This is another example of a type 
of “coercive deficiency” the Antideficiency Act was intended to prohibit.58 
Thus, it is not enough for the government to retain the option to terminate 
at any time if sufficient funds are not available. Under Leiter and its 
progeny, the contract “dies” at the end of the fiscal year, and may be revived 
only by affirmative action by the government. This “new” contract is then 
chargeable to appropriations for the subsequent year. 

Although today FASA and the Federal Acquisition Regulation recognize 
“subject to availability” clauses, such a clause, by itself, is not sufficient. 
FASA provides that a multiyear contract for purposes of FASA— 

“may provide that performance under the contract during 
the second and subsequent years of the contract is 

56 The Claims Court based its conclusion in part on Leiter and the Antideficiency Act; the 
Federal Circuit relied on the language of the contract. 

57 The Federal Acquisition Regulation states that encouraging a contractor to continue 
performance in the absence of funds violates the Antideficiency Act. 48 C.F.R. § 32.704(c) 
(2005). In this regard, section C.3 of this chapter discusses how the Antideficiency Act’s 
prohibition against acceptance of voluntary services, 31 U.S.C. § 1342, prohibits contracting 
officers from soliciting or permitting a contractor to continue performance on a 
“temporarily unfunded” basis. 

58 See section C.1 of this chapter for a discussion of the coercive deficiency concept.

contingent upon the appropriation of funds and (if it does so 
provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made 
to the contractor if such appropriations are not made.” 

41 U.S.C. § 254c(d). If an agency decides to include a “subject to 
availability” clause for the second and subsequent years, the agency also 
has to provide for possible termination. Availability clauses are required by 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation in several situations. While the 
prescribed contract clauses vary in complexity, they all have one thing in 
common—each requires the contracting officer to specifically notify the 
contractor in writing that the contractor may resume performance. For 
example: (1) contract actions initiated prior to the availability of funds;59 

(2) certain requirements and indefinite-quantity contracts;60 (3) fully funded 
cost-reimbursement contracts;61 (4) facilities acquisition and use;62 and 
(5)incrementally funded cost-reimbursement contracts.63 See 48 C.F.R. 
subpt. 32.7. The objective of these clauses is compliance with the 
Antideficiency Act and other fiscal statutes. See ITT Federal Laboratories, 
ASBCA No. 12987, 69-2 BCA ¶ 7,849 (1969), rev’d and remanded on other 
grounds, ITT v. United States, 453 F.2d 1283 (1972). What is not sufficient 
is a simple “subject to availability” clause which would permit automatic 
continuation subject to the government’s right to terminate. 
In B-259274, May 22, 1996, the Air Force exercised an option to a severable 
service contract that extended the contract from September 1, 1994, to 
August 31, 1995, using fiscal year 1994 funds.64 However, the Air Force only 
had enough fiscal year 1994 budget authority to finance 4 months of the 
option period, leaving the remaining 8 months unfunded. The Air Force 
modified the agreement by adding a clause stating that the government’s 
obligation beyond December 31, 1994, was subject to the availability of 
appropriations. Significantly, however, the clause further stated that no

legal liability on the part of the government would arise for contract 
performance beyond December 31, 1994, unless and until the contractor 
received notice in writing from the Air Force contracting officer that the 
contractor could continue work. GAO held that this clause converted the 
government’s obligation for the remaining 8 months to no more than a 
negative obligation not to procure services elsewhere should such services 
be needed. Since this contractual obligation created no financial exposure 
on the part of the government, the Air Force had not violated the 
Antideficiency Act. 

It may be useful at this point to reiterate the basic principle that, in the 
context of contractual obligations, compliance with the Antideficiency Act 
is determined first on the basis of when an obligation occurs, not when 
actual payment is scheduled to be made. In the case of a contract with an 
option to renew, for example, as long as sufficient funds are available to 
cover the initial contract, there is no violation at the time the contract is 
made. No obligation accrues for future option years unless and until the 
government exercises its option. 

Another issue to consider with respect to multiyear contracts is the 
relationship between termination charges and the Antideficiency Act. As a 
general proposition, the government has the right to terminate a contract 
“for the convenience of the government” if that action is determined to be 
in the government’s best interests. The Federal Acquisition Regulation 
prescribes the required contract clauses. 48 C.F.R. subpt. 49.5.65 Under a 
termination for convenience, the contractor is entitled to be compensated, 
including a reasonable profit, for the performed portion of the contract, but 
may not recover anticipatory profits on the terminated portion. E.g., 
48 C.F.R. §§ 49.201, 49.202. Total recovery may not exceed the contract 
price. Id. § 49.207. 

In the typical contract covering the needs of only one fiscal year, 
termination does not pose a problem. Under 48 C.F.R. § 49.207, the 
contractor’s recovery cannot exceed the contract price; thus, the basic 
contract obligation will be sufficient to cover potential termination costs. 
Under a contract with options to renew, however, the situation may differ. 
A contractor who must incur substantial capital costs at the outset has a 

65 Where a termination for convenience clause is required by regulation, it will be read into 
the contract whether expressly included or not. G.L. Christian & Associates v. United 
States, 312 F.2d 418 and 320 F.2d 345 (Ct. Cl.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 954 (1963).

legitimate concern over recovering these costs if the government does not 
renew. A device sometimes used to address this problem, albeit with 
limited success, is a clause requiring the government to pay termination 
charges or “separate charges” upon early termination. As discussed in 
Chapter 5, section B.8.c, separate charges have been found to violate the 
bona fide needs rule to the extent they do not reasonably relate to the value 
of current fiscal year requirements. E.g., 36 Comp. Gen. 683 (1957), aff’d, 
37 Comp. Gen. 155 (1957). 

Separate charges also have been held to violate the Antideficiency Act. The 
leading case in this area is 56 Comp. Gen. 142 (1976), aff’d, 56 Comp. 
Gen. 505 (1977). The Burroughs Corporation protested the award of a 
contract to the Honeywell Corporation to provide automatic data 
processing (ADP) equipment to the Mine Enforcement and Safety 
Administration. If all renewal options were exercised, the contract would 
run for 60 months after equipment installation. The contract included a 
“separate charges” provision under which, if the government failed to 
exercise any renewal option or otherwise terminated prior to the end of the 
60-month systems life, the government would pay a percentage of all future 
years’ rentals based on Honeywell’s “list prices” at the time of failure to 
renew or of termination. This provision violated the Antideficiency Act for 
two reasons. First, it would amount to an obligation of fiscal year funds for 
the requirements of future years. And second, it would commit the 
government to indeterminate liability because the contractor could raise its 
list or catalog prices at any time. The government had no way of knowing 
the amount of its commitment. Similar cases involving separate charges 
are 56 Comp. Gen. 167 (1976); B-216718.2, Nov. 14, 1984; and B-190659, 
Oct. 23, 1978.66 

The Burroughs decision also offers guidance on when separate charges 
may be acceptable. One instance is where it is the only way the 
government can obtain its needs. Cited in this regard was 8 Comp. 
Gen. 654 (1929), a case involving the installation of equipment and the 

66 The Burroughs case was decided before the enactment of the FASA multiyear contracts 
provision. As discussed above, that provision now enables agencies to enter into contracts 
like the one at issue in the Burroughs case without running afoul of the Antideficiency Act 
as long as they follow the terms of the statute by either obligating the full contract amount 
against appropriations available at the time of the contract or obligating the first year costs 
plus estimated termination costs. With reference to termination costs, FASA requires the 
contract to include a clause stating that the contract shall be terminated if funds are not 
made available for its continuation in any fiscal year and provides that amounts obligated 
for termination costs shall remain available until the costs are paid. 41 U.S.C. § 254c(b).

procurement of a water supply from a town. There, however, the town was 
the only source of a water supply, a situation clearly inapplicable to a 
competitive industry like ADP. 56 Comp. Gen. at 157. In addition, separate 
charges are permissible if they, together with payments already made, 
reasonably represent the value of requirements actually performed. Thus, 
where the contractor has discounted its price based on the government’s 
stated intent to exercise all renewal options, separate charges may be 
based on the “reasonable value (e.g., ADP schedule price) of the actually 
performed work at termination based upon the shortened term.” Id. at 158. 
However, termination charges may not be inconsistent with the 
termination for convenience clause remedy; for example, they may not 
exceed the value of the contract or include costs not cognizable under a 
“T for C.” Id. at 157. 

Where termination charges are otherwise proper, the Antideficiency Act 
also requires that the agency have sufficient funds available to pay them if 
and when the contingency materializes. E.g., 62 Comp. Gen. 143 (1983); 
8 Comp. Gen. 654, 657 (1929). See also Aerolease Long Beach v. United 
States, 31 Fed. Cl. 342, 362 (1994), aff’d, 39 F.3d 1198 (Fed. Cir. 1994) 
(agency complied with Antideficiency Act requirements by including 
termination costs as current obligations). This requirement is sometimes 
specified in multiyear contracting legislation. An example is 40 U.S.C. 
§ 322, the Information Technology Fund. In operating the Fund, the 
General Services Administration is authorized to enter into information 
technology multiyear contracts if “amounts are available and adequate to 
pay the costs of the contract for the first fiscal year and any costs of 
cancellation or termination.” Id. § 322(e)(1)(A). Congress may also, of 
course, provide exceptions. E.g.,B-174839, Mar. 20, 1984. 

c. Indemnification Under an indemnification agreement, one party promises, in effect, to 
cover another party’s losses. It is no surprise that the government is often 
asked to enter into indemnification agreements. The problem is that such 
agreements create a risk that the government, at some point in the future, 
may have to pay amounts in excess of available funds. Consequently, with 
one very limited exception discussed below, GAO and numerous courts 
have adhered to the rule that, absent express statutory authority, the 
government may not enter into an agreement to indemnify where the 
amount of the government’s liability is indefinite, indeterminate, or 
Page 6-59 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

potentially unlimited.67 Such an agreement would violate both the 
Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341, and the Adequacy of Appropriations 
Act, 41 U.S.C. § 11, since it can never be said that sufficient funds have been 
appropriated to cover the government’s indemnification exposure. As 
discussed in this section, indemnity clauses have been upheld under 
certain conditions: 

• where the potential liability of the government was limited to a definite 
amount known at the time of the agreement, was within the amount of 
available appropriations, and was not otherwise prohibited by statute; 
• where the indemnification agreement is a legitimate object of an 
appropriation, the agreement specifically provides that the amount of 
liability is limited to available appropriations, and there is no 
implication that Congress will, at a later date, appropriate funds to 
meet deficiencies; or 
• where Congress has specifically authorized the agency to indemnify. 
Although a provision limiting liability to appropriations available at the 
time a loss arises would prevent any overt Antideficiency Act or Adequacy 
of Appropriations Act violation by removing the “unlimited liability” 
objection, it could have disastrous fiscal consequences for the agency as 
well as present other, practical problems. For example, payment of an 
especially large indemnity obligation at the beginning of a fiscal year could 
wipe out the entire unobligated balance of the agency’s appropriation for 
the rest of the fiscal year, forcing the agency to seek a supplemental 
appropriation to finance basic program activities. Conversely, if a liability 
arises toward the end of the fiscal year it is quite possible that no 
unobligated balance would be available for an indemnity payment, which 
means indemnification could prove largely illusory from the standpoint of 
the contractor or other “beneficiary.” 

Another practical problem concerns recording the obligations that may 
arise under indemnity clauses. The indemnity is a potential liability that 
may become an actual liability when some event outside of the 

67 The prohibition against incurring indefinite liabilities is not limited to indemnification 
agreements. It applies as well to types of liabilities such as contract termination charges. 
The cases are included in our preceding discussion of multiyear contracting. See 
section C.2.b of this chapter.

government’s control is triggered, at which point the liability becomes a 
recordable obligation. This creates a fiscal dilemma, however. While the 
liability is not sufficiently definite at the time the indemnity agreement is 
made to formally record an obligation, good financial management requires 
that the agency recognize its contingent liability.68 Although most of our 
cases do not directly address this issue, the ones that do, discussed below, 
have recommended either the obligation or administrative reservation69 of 
sufficient funds to cover the potential liability. Clearly, however, this could 
create a fiscal nightmare where an estimate of potential liability could 
encompass the entire appropriation for the agency for that fiscal year, and 
tying up that entire sum would prevent the agency from meeting its 
mission. 

What follows is a discussion of indemnification proposals in decisions 
issued over the years. As you will see, we have struggled with the practical 
problems posed by the inclusion of indemnity clauses in government 
contracts and agreements. For the past several years it has been our view 
that even if indemnification clauses are rewritten to meet the minimum 
requirements of the Antideficiency Act or Adequacy of Appropriations Act, 
there should be a clear governmentwide policy restricting their use. Given 
the potential liability of the government created by such clauses, 
exceptions to this policy should not be made without express 
congressional acquiescence, as has been done whenever Congress has 
decided that it was in the best interests of the government to assume the 
risks of having to pay off on an indemnity obligation. See, for example, 
10 U.S.C. § 2354, 42 U.S.C. § 2210, and other examples given below. 

(1) Prohibition against unlimited liability 
As noted above, absent specific statutory authority, the government 
generally may not enter into an indemnification agreement which would 
impose an indefinite or potentially unlimited liability on the government. 
In plain English, you cannot purport to bind the government to unlimited 
liability. The rule is not some arcane GAO concoction. The Court of Claims 
stated in California-Pacific Utilities Co. v. United States, 194 Ct. Cl. 703, 
715 (1971)): 

68 See section C.2.b of this chapter for a discussion of recording obligations.

“The United States Supreme Court, the Court of Claims, and 
the Comptroller General have consistently held that absent 
an express provision in an appropriation for reimbursement 
adequate to make such payment, [the Antideficiency Act, 
31 U.S.C. § 1341] proscribes indemnification on the grounds 
that it would constitute the obligation of funds not yet 
appropriated. [Citations omitted.]” 

For example, in an early case, the Interior Department, as licensee, entered 
into an agreement with the Southern Pacific Company under which the 
Department was to lay telephone and telegraph wires on property owned 
by the licensor in New Mexico. The agreement included a provision that 
the Department was to indemnify the Company against any liability 
resulting from the operation. Upon reviewing the indemnity provision, the 
Comptroller General found that it purported to impose indeterminate 
contingent liability on the government in violation of Revised Statutes 
§ 3732, the predecessor to the Adequacy of Appropriations Act, 41 U.S.C. 
§ 11. By including the indemnity provision, the contracting officer had 
exceeded his authority, and the provision was held void. 16 Comp. 
Gen. 803 (1937). 

Similarly, an indefinite and unlimited indemnification provision in a lease 
entered into by the General Services Administration without statutory 
authority was held to impose no legal liability on the government since it 
violated the provisions of 31 U.S.C. § 1341 and 41 U.S.C. § 11. 35 Comp. 
Gen. 85 (1955). 

In 59 Comp. Gen. 369 (1980), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) desired to undertake a series of hurricane seeding 
experiments off the coast of Australia in cooperation with its Australian 
counterpart. The State Department, as negotiator, sought GAO’s opinion 
on an Australian proposal under which the United States would agree to 
indemnify Australia against all damages arising from the activities. State 
recognized that an unlimited agreement would violate the Antideficiency 
Act and asked whether the proposal would be acceptable if it specified that 
the government’s liability would be subject to the appropriation of funds by 
Congress for that purpose. GAO expressed dissatisfaction with this 
proposal because, even though it would impose no legal obligation unless 
or until funds are appropriated, it would impose a moral obligation on the

United States to make good on its promise.70 There was a way out, 
however—insurance. Ordinarily, appropriations are not available to 
acquire insurance,71 but GAO concluded that the government’s policy of 
self-insurance did not apply here since the insurance would not be for the 
purpose of protecting against a risk to which the United States would be 
exposed but rather is the price exacted by Australia, as the United States’ 
partner in an international venture, to protect Australia’s interests. GAO 
said that NOAA could therefore purchase private insurance, with the 
premiums to be shared by the government of Australia, provided that the 
United States’ liability under the agreement was limited to its share of the 
insurance premiums. NOAA’s use of its appropriation for the United States’ 
share of the insurance premium would simply be a necessary expense of 
the project. 

Another decision applying the general rule held that the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency72 could not agree to provide 
indeterminate indemnification to agents and brokers under the National 
Flood Insurance Act. B-201394, Apr. 23, 1981. If the agency considered 
indemnification necessary to the success of its program, it could either 
insert a provision limiting the government’s liability to available 
appropriations or seek broader authority from Congress. 

In B-201072, May 3, 1982, the Department of Health and Human Services 
questioned the use of a contract clause entitled “Insurance—Liability to 
Third Persons,” found in the Federal Procurement Regulations 
(predecessor to the Federal Acquisition Regulation). The clause purported 
to permit federal agencies to agree to reimburse contractors, without limit, 
for liabilities to third persons for death, personal injury, or property 
damage, arising out of performance of the contract and not compensated 
by insurance, whether or not caused by the contractor’s negligence. Since 
the clause purported to commit the government to an indefinite liability 
which could exceed available appropriations, the Comptroller General 

70 This is still another example of a so-called “coercive deficiency,” particularly in light of the 
fact that the potential claimant was another sovereign nation and failure to honor the 
agreement would have international consequences. See section C.2.b of this chapter for a 
discussion of the “coercive deficiency” concept. 

71 For further information on the government’s policy regarding self-insurance, see 
Chapter 4, section C.10.

found it in violation of the Antideficiency Act and the Adequacy of 
Appropriations Act. This decision was affirmed upon reconsideration in 
62 Comp. Gen. 361 (1983), one of GAO’s more comprehensive discussions 
of the indemnification problem. 

For other cases applying or discussing the general rule, see B-260063, 
June 30, 1995; 35 Comp. Gen. 85 (1955); 20 Comp. Gen. 95, 100 (1940); 
7 Comp. Gen. 507 (1928); 15 Comp. Dec. 405 (1909); B-242146, Aug. 16, 
1991; B-117057, Dec. 27, 1957; A-95749, Oct. 14, 1938; 8 Op. Off. Legal 
Counsel 94 (1984); 2 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 219, 223–24 (1978). A brief 
letter report making the same point is GAO, Agreements Describing 
Liability in Undercover Operations Should Limit the Government’s 
Liability, GGD-83-53 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 15, 1983). 

In some of the earlier GAO cases—for example, 7 Comp. Gen. 507 and 
16 Comp. Gen. 803 (1937)—the Comptroller General offered as further 
support for the indemnification prohibition the then-existing principle that 
the United States was not liable for the tortious conduct of its employees. 
Of course, since the enactment of the Federal Tort Claims Act in 1946,73 this 
is no longer true. Thus, the reader should disregard any discussion of the 
government’s lack of tort liability appearing in the earlier cases. The thrust 
of those cases, namely, the prohibition against open-ended liability, remains 
valid. 

The Comptroller General recognized a limited exception to the rule in 
59 Comp. Gen. 705 (1980). In that decision, the Comptroller General held 
that the General Services Administration could agree to certain indemnity 
provisions in procuring public utility services for government agencies 
under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 
§ 501. To apply the general rule against indemnification in this situation, 
the Comptroller General suggested, would constitute “an overly technical 
and literal reading of the Anti-Deficiency Act.” Id. at 707. The decision 
reasoned as follows: 

“The procurement of goods or services from state-regulated 
utilities which are virtually monopolies is unique in 
important ways. As a practical matter, there is no other 
source for the needed goods or services. Moreover, the 
tariff requirements, such as this indemnification 

73 The Act is now codified at 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671–2680.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

undertaking, are applicable generally to all of the same class 
of customers of the utility, and are included in the tariff only 
after administrative proceedings in which the government 
has the opportunity to participate. The United States is not 
being singled out for discriminatory treatment nor, 
presumably, can it complain that the objectionable 
provision was imposed without notice and the opportunity 
for a hearing. 

“Under the circumstances, we have not objected in the past 
to the procurement of power by GSA under tariffs 
containing the indemnity clause and there is no reason to 
object to the purchase of power under contracts containing 
essentially the same indemnity clause. As noted already, 
this has of necessity been the practice in the past. The 
possibility of liability under the clause is in our judgment 
remote. In any event, we see little purpose to be served by a 
rule which prevents the United States from procuring a vital 
commodity under the same restrictions as other customers 
are subject to under the tariff if the utility insists that the 
restrictions are non-negotiable. However, because the 
possibility exists, however remote, that these agreements 
could result in future liability in excess of available 
appropriations, GSA should inform the Congress of the 
situation.” 

Id. 

Subsequent decisions emphasize that the extent of the exception carved 
out by 59 Comp. Gen. 705 is limited to its facts. See, e.g., B-260063, June 30, 
1995; 62 Comp. Gen. 361 (1983); B-242146, Aug. 16, 1991. In B-197583, 
Jan. 19, 1981, GAO once again applied the general rule and held that the 
Architect of the Capitol could not agree to indemnify the Potomac Electric 
Power Company (PEPCO) for loss or damages resulting from PEPCO’s 
performance of tests on equipment installed in government buildings or 
from certain other equipment owned by PEPCO which could be installed in 
government buildings to monitor electricity use for conservation purposes. 
GAO pointed to two distinguishing factors that justified—and limited—the 
exception in 59 Comp. Gen. 705. First, in 59 Comp. Gen. 705, there was no 
other source from which the government could obtain the needed utility 
services. Here, the testing and monitoring could be performed by 

Page 6-65 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

government employees. The second factor is summarized in the following 
excerpt from B-197583, Jan. 19, 1981: 

“An even more important distinction, though, is that unlike 
the situation in the GSA case [59 Comp. Gen. 705], the 
Architect has not previously been accepting the testing 
services or using the impulse device from PEPCO and has 
therefore not previously agreed to the liability represented 
by the proposed indemnity agreements. In the GSA case, 
GSA merely sought to enter a contract accepting the same 
service and attendant liability, previously secured under a 
non-negotiable tariff, at a rate more advantageous to the 
Government. Here, however, the Government has other 
means available to provide the testing and monitoring 
desired.” 

Thus, the case did not fall within the “narrow exception created by the GSA 
decision,” and the proposed indemnity agreement was improper. 

More recent decisions likewise reaffirm the general rule against openended 
indemnification agreements and reemphasize the limited application 
of the exception in 59 Comp. Gen. 705. In B-242146, Aug. 16, 1991, GAO 
held that the United States Park Police could not include in mutual 
assistance agreements with local law enforcement agencies a clause that 
the United States would indemnify the latter agencies against claims arising 
from police actions they took in national parks. Citing 62 Comp. Gen. 361 
(1983) and other cases, the decision observed: 

“This Office has long held that absent statutory authority, 
indemnity provisions which subject the United States to 
indefinite or potentially unlimited contingent liability 
contravene the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a) . . . 
since it can never be said that sufficient funds have been 
appropriated to cover the contingency. 

“Here, the potential liability of the Park Police is unknown 
because the clause in question provides an indemnity for 
property damage and personal injury. There is no possible 
way to know at the time the [mutual assistance] memoranda 
are signed whether there are sufficient funds in the 
appropriation to cover a liability or when it arises under the 

Page 6-66 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

indemnification clause because no one knows in advance 
how much the liability may be.” (Footnote omitted.) 

The decision rejected the argument that 59 Comp. Gen. 705 supported the 
indemnification clause in this case, stating: 

“[W]e were careful to point out in 62 Comp. Gen. at 364 . . . 
that 59 Comp. Gen. 705 should not serve as a precedent. 
Indeed, except for 59 Comp. Gen. 705, ‘the accounting 
officers of the Government have never issued a decision 
sanctioning the incurring of an obligation for an open-ended 
indemnity in the absence of statutory authority to the 
contrary.’ 62 Comp. Gen. 364–365.” 

In B-260063, June 30, 1995, GAO again distinguished 59 Comp. Gen. 705 in 
holding that a federal agency should not agree to indemnify a utility 
company for providing electricity to one of the agency’s remote facilities. 
The decision pointed out that, unlike the situation in 59 Comp. Gen. 705, 
the indemnity clause proposed here was not part of a generally applicable 
tariff but would discriminate against the agency. 

As indicated previously, the general rule against open-ended indemnity 
agreements has received consistent acceptance by the courts. Examples of 
court cases endorsing the general rule against open-ended indemnification 
are Frank v. United States, 797 F.2d 724, 727 (9th Cir. 1986); Union Pacific 
Railroad Corp. v. United States, 52 Fed. Cl. 730, 732–735 (2002); Lopez v. 
Johns Manville, 649 F. Supp. 149 (W.D. Wash. 1986), aff’d on other 
grounds, 858 F.2d 712 (Fed. Cir. 1988); In re All Asbestos Cases, 
603 F. Supp. 599 (D. Hawaii 1984); Johns-Manville Corp. v. United States, 
12 Cl. Ct. 1 (1987). Several of these are asbestos cases in which the courts 
rejected claims of an implied agreement to indemnify. In Johns-Manville 
Corp., the court stated: 

“Contractual agreements that create contingent liabilities 
for the Government serve to create obligations of funds just 
as much as do agreements creating definite or certain 
liabilities. The contingent nature of the liability created by 
an indemnity agreement does not so lessen its effect on 
appropriations as to make it immune to the limitations of 
[the Antideficiency Act].”

In Hercules, Inc. v. United States, 516 U.S. 417 (1996), the Supreme Court 
rejected the argument by a manufacturer of the Vietnam War-era defoliant 
“Agent Orange” that it had an implied-in-fact contract with the United 
States to indemnify it for tort damages arising from third-party claims 
against it. The Court noted that an implied-in-fact contract depends upon a 
meeting of the minds, and that such a meeting of the minds was unlikely 
given the rule against open-ended indemnity contracts: 

“There is . . . reason to think that a contracting officer would 
not agree to the open-ended indemnification alleged here. 
The Anti-Deficiency Act bars a federal employee or agency 
from entering into a contract for future payment of money 
in advance of, or in excess of, an existing appropriation. 
31 U.S.C. § 1341. Ordinarily no federal appropriation covers 
contractors’ payments to third-party tort claimants in these 
circumstances, and the Comptroller General has repeatedly 
ruled that Government procurement agencies may not enter 
into the type of open-ended indemnity for third-party 
liability that petitioner Thompson claims to have implicitly 
received under the Agent Orange contracts. We view the 
Anti-Deficiency Act, and the contracting officer’s presumed 
knowledge of its prohibition, as strong evidence that the 
officer would not have provided, in fact, the contractual 
indemnification [petitioner] claims.” 

516 U.S. at 426–427 (footnotes omitted). 

The Court cited several instances in which Congress had enacted statutory 
authorizations for indemnification, and noted that the existence of these 
statutory authorizations further militated against finding an implied 
contract to indemnify in this case: 

“These statutes [authorizing indemnification], set out in 
meticulous detail and each supported by a panoply of 
implementing regulations, . . . would be entirely 
unnecessary if an implied agreement to indemnify could 
arise from the circumstances of contracting. We will not 
interpret the [Agent Orange] contracts so as to render these 
statutes and regulations superfluous.”

Company, Inc. v. United States, 365 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2004), provides an 
interesting twist. The issue in that case was whether an indemnity clause 
contained in a World War II-era contract required the United States to 
reimburse the contractor for environmental cleanup costs it incurred at the 
contract site as a result of liability imposed on it under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 
(popularly known as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law), 42 U.S.C. 
§§ 9601–9675.75 The Court of Federal Claims had viewed the contract’s 
indemnity clause as extending to CERCLA liability, but concluded that the 
general rule against open-ended indemnification applied to invalidate the 
clause under the Antideficiency Act: 

“Even though the Indemnification Clause was included in 
this contract and it is quite reasonable to assume that both 
the contracting officer and the contractor believed this 
Clause to place the risk of virtually all liabilities on the 
government rather than the contractor, the state of the law 
compels us to hold this clause to be void and 
unenforceable. . . .

 “Although we are of the opinion that the current state of the 
law compels the result expressed, this result is so totally at 
odds with the agreement the parties clearly made 
concerning reimbursement and indemnity, and plaintiff is so 
clearly entitled to the indemnity it seeks under the plain 
language of the contract it had with the government, made 
during truly emergency, wartime conditions, we suggest that 
plaintiff may want to consider the avenue for potential relief 

74 The Supreme Court’s decision affirmed two Claims Court decisions that had similarly 
cited the general rule against indemnification agreements with respect to the Agent Orange 
contracts: Wm. T. Thompson Co. v. United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 17, 29 (1992); Hercules Inc. v. 
United States, 25 Cl. Ct. 616 (1992).

Costs Under World War II-Era Government Indemnification Clauses, 41 Air Force L. 
Rev. 163 (1997), for an extensive background discussion and analysis of the issues 
addressed in the DuPont case. This article also discusses at length the First War Powers Act 
and its successor, 50 U.S.C. § 1431 (Pub. L. No. 85-804, § 1, 72 Stat. 972 (Aug. 28, 1958)),

E.I.DuPont De Nemours & Company, Inc. v. United States, 54 Fed. 
Cl. 361, 372–373 (2002). 
The Federal Circuit reversed in E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Company, 
Inc., 365 F.3d 1367. The court did not question the general rule against 
open-ended indemnity provisions; nor did it dispute the lower court’s 
conclusion that the indemnity clause in the DuPont contract was originally 
invalid under that rule. However, the court concluded that the government 
in effect ratified the clause through actions taken under a subsequent 
statute—the Contract Settlement Act of 1944, at 41 U.S.C. §§ 101, 120(a)— 
that did permit such indemnity provisions. Thus, the court reasoned, the 
indemnity clause in this case satisfied the “otherwise authorized by law” 
exception in the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1)(B). E.I. DuPont 
De Nemours & Company, Inc., 365 F.3d at 1375–80. 

Executive branch adjudicative bodies such as boards of contract appeals 
and the Federal Labor Relations Authority have also applied the general 
anti-indemnity rule. See Appeals of National Gypsum Co., ASBCA 
No. 53259, 03-1 B.C.A. ¶ 32,054 (2002) (indemnity provision of World War II 
contract unenforceable because in violation of the Antideficiency Act and 
the Executive Order under which the contract was entered into); KMS 
Development Co. v. General Services Administration, GSBCA No. 12584, 
95-2 B.C.A. ¶ 27, 663 (1995) (no implied-in-fact contract of indemnity since 
such a contract would be ultra vires as a violation of the Antideficiency 
Act); National Federation of Federal Employees and U.S. Department of 
the Interior, 35 F.L.R.A. 1034 (1990) (proposal to indemnify union against 
judgments and litigation expenses resulting from drug testing program held 
contrary to law and therefore nonnegotiable); American Federation of 
State, County and Municipal Employees and U.S. Department of Justice, 

42 F.L.R.A. 412, 515–17 (1991) (similar proposal for drug testing 
indemnification). 

In sum, the GAO decisions, court cases, and other administrative decisions 
reflect a clear rule against open-ended indemnification agreements (absent 
statutory authority). Indeed, the Supreme Court’s opinion in Hercules, 
Inc. v. United States, 516 U.S. 417 (1996), discussed previously, 
commented upon the nearly uniform line of Comptroller General decisions 
on this point, noting that 59 Comp. Gen. 705 stood as the “one peculiar 
exception.” 516 U.S. at 428.

(2) When indemnification may be permissible 
Indemnification agreements may be proper if they are limited to available 
appropriations and are otherwise authorized. Before ever getting to the 
question of amount, for an indemnity agreement to be permissible in the 
first place, it must be authorized either expressly or under a necessary 
expense theory. 59 Comp. Gen. 369 (1980). The determination as to 
whether an expense is necessary as incident to the object of the applicable 
funding source is determined on a case-by-case basis.76 Although GAO 
generally affords agencies broad discretion in determining whether a 
specific expenditure is reasonably related to the accomplishment of an 
authorized purpose, an agency’s discretion in such matters is not unlimited. 
18 Comp. Gen. 285, 292 (1938). GAO has had occasion both to approve and 
to disapprove contract indemnification provisions as necessary or incident 
to the object of the applicable funding source. See, e.g., 63 Comp. Gen. 145, 
150 (1984) (all but one indemnity provision in contracts for vessels were 
approved as incidental expenses under the Navy’s authorized 
prepositioning ship chartering program); 59 Comp. Gen. 369 
(disapproved—general statutory authority to carry out international 
programs did not provide authority for the United States to agree to 
provide complete indemnification of another country for all damages 
resulting from an international weather modification project); 42 Comp. 
Gen. 708, 712 (1963) (approved—obligation of an agency for damage or 
destruction that might arise under an indemnity clause in an aircraft rental 
contract was a necessary expense incident to the hiring of aircraft for 
which the agency’s appropriation was expressly available); B-201394, 
Apr. 23, 1981 (disapproved—no specific appropriation was available to pay 
costs arising under a clause indemnifying agents and brokers under the 
National Flood Insurance program); B-137976, Dec. 4, 1958 (disapproved— 
an obligation arising under an indemnity provision in an agency’s 
agreement for training with a nongovernment facility was not a necessary 
expense under the statute authorizing such training agreements). 

Once you cross the purpose hurdle—that is, once you determine that the 
indemnification proposal you are considering is a legitimate object on 
which to spend your appropriations—you are ready to grapple with the 
unlimited liability issue. 

76 See Chapter 4, section B for a discussion of the necessary expense rule.

One way to deal with this issue is to specifically limit the amount of the 
liability assumed. Such a limitation of an indemnity agreement may come 
about in either of two ways: it may follow necessarily from the nature of 
the agreement itself or it may be expressly written into the agreement, 
coupled with an appropriate obligation or administrative reservation of 
funds. The latter alternative is the only acceptable one where the 
government’s liability would otherwise be potentially unlimited. 

For example, where the government rented buses to transport Selective 
Service registrants for physical examination or induction, there was no 
objection to the inclusion of an indemnity provision for damage to the 
buses caused by the registrants. This was a standard provision in the 
applicable motor carrier charter coach tariff. 48 Comp. Gen. 361 (1968). 
Potential liability was not indefinite since it was necessarily limited to the 
value of the motor carrier’s equipment. 

Similarly, under a contract for the lease of aircraft, the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) could agree to indemnify the owner for loss or 
damage to the aircraft in order to eliminate the need to reimburse the 
owner for the cost of “hull insurance” and thereby secure a lower rental 
rate. The liability could properly be viewed as a necessary expense 
incident to hiring the aircraft, FAA had no-year appropriations available to 
pay for any such liability, and, as in the Selective Service case, the 
agreement was not indefinite because maximum liability was measurable 
by the fair market value of the aircraft. 42 Comp. Gen. 708 (1963). See also 
22 Comp. Gen. 892 (1943) (Maritime Commission could amend contract to 
agree to indemnify contractor against liability to third parties, in lieu of 
reimbursing contractor for cost of liability insurance premiums, to the 
extent of available appropriations and provided liability was limited to the 
amount of coverage of the discontinued insurance policies replaced by the 
indemnity agreement).77 

In B-114860, Dec. 19, 1979, the Farmers Home Administration asked 
whether it could purchase surety bonds or enter into an indemnity 
agreement in order to obtain the release of deeds of trust for borrowers in 
Colorado where the original promissory notes had been lost while in the 

77 The decision in 22 Comp. Gen. 892 is discussed in 62 Comp. Gen. 361, 362–63 (1983), and 
Johns-Manville Corp. v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. 1, 23 (1987). The Claims Court noted the 
“significant deficiency” of 22 Comp. Gen. 892 in that it nowhere mentions the Antideficiency 
Act.

Administration’s custody. Colorado law required one or the other where 
the canceled original note could not be delivered to the Colorado public 
trustee. GAO concluded that the indemnity agreement was permissible as 
long as it was limited to an amount not to exceed the original principal 
amount of the trust deed. The decision further advised that the 
Administration should reserve sufficient funds to cover its potential 
liability. The latter aspect of the decision was reconsidered in B-198161, 
Nov. 25, 1980. Reviewing the particular circumstances involved, GAO was 
unable to foresee situations in which the government might be required to 
indemnify the public trustee, and accordingly advised the Administration 
that the reservation of funds would not be necessary. While reservation of 
the funds may not have been necessary, GAO did state: “Although the 
liability which arises from an indemnity agreement to secure the release of 
a trust deed may be contingent, the maximum cost of liquidating that 
liability would normally be a recordable expense limited by the 
administration’s annual budget authority.” 

In 63 Comp. Gen. 145 (1984), certain indemnification provisions in a shipchartering 
agreement were found not to impose indefinite or potentially 
unlimited contingent liability because liability could be avoided by certain 
separate actions solely under the government’s control. 

In cases like the Selective Service bus case (48 Comp. Gen. 361) and the 
FAA aircraft case (42 Comp. Gen. 708), even though the government’s 
potential liability is limited and determinable, this fact alone does not 
guarantee that the agency will have sufficient funds available should the 
contingency ripen into an obligation. This concern is met in one of two 
ways. The first is either to obligate or to reserve administratively sufficient 
funds to cover the potential liability, although this point has not been 
completely explored in past decisions. In particular cases, reservation may 
be determined unnecessary, as in B-198161, Nov. 25, 1980, discussed above. 
Also, naturally, a specific directive from Congress will render reservation of 
funds unnecessary. See B-159141, Aug. 18, 1967 (reservation of termination 
costs for supersonic aircraft contract). The second way is for the 
agreement to expressly limit the government’s liability to appropriations 
available at the time of the loss with no implication that Congress will 
appropriate funds to make up any deficiency. 

This second device—the express limitation of the government’s liability to 
available appropriations—is sufficient to cure an otherwise fatally 
defective (i.e., unlimited) indemnity proposal. For example, the 
government may in limited circumstances assume the risk of loss to 

Page 6-73 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

contractor-owned property. While the maximum potential liability would 
be determinable, it could be very large and the administrative reservation 
of funds is not feasible. Thus, without some form of limitation, such an 
agreement could result in obligations in excess of available appropriations. 
The rules concerning the government’s assumption of risk on property 
owned by contractors and used in the performance of their contracts are 
set forth in 54 Comp. Gen. 824 (1975), modifying B-168106, July 3, 1974. 
The rules are summarized below:78 

• If administratively determined to be in the best interest of the 
government, the government may assume the risk for contractor-owned 
property which is used solely in the performance of government 
contracts. 
• The government may not assume the risk for contractor-owned 
property which is used solely for nongovernment work. If the property 
is used for both government and nongovernment work and the 
nongovernment portion is separable, the government may not assume 
the risk relating to the nongovernment work. 
• Where the amount of a contractor’s commercial work is so insignificant 
when compared to the amount of the contractor’s government work 
that the government is effectively bearing the entire risk of loss by in 
essence paying the full insurance premiums, the government may 
assume the risk if administratively determined to be in the best interest 
of the government. 
Any agreement for the assumption of risk by the government under the 
above rules must contain a clause to clearly provide that, in the event the 
government has to pay for losses, payments may not exceed appropriations 
available at the time of the losses, and that nothing in the contract may be 
considered as implying that Congress will at a later date appropriate funds 
sufficient to meet deficiencies. 54 Comp. Gen. at 827. 

78 The decision in 54 Comp. Gen. 824 overruled a portion of 42 Comp. Gen. 708 (the FAA 
aircraft lease case), discussed in the text, to the extent it held that there was no need to 
either obligate or reserve funds. Thus, in a situation like 42 Comp. Gen. 708, the agency 
would presumably have to either obligate or administratively reserve funds or include a 
provision that payments for losses may not exceed appropriations available at the time of 
the loss and nothing in the contract may be construed as implying that Congress will 
appropriate funds to meet any deficiencies at a later date.

A somewhat different situation was discussed in 60 Comp. Gen. 584 (1981), 
involving an “installment purchase plan” for automatic data processing 
equipment. Under the plan, the General Services Administration would 
make monthly payments until the entire purchase price was paid, at which 
time GSA would acquire unencumbered ownership of the equipment. 
GSA’s obligation was conditioned on its exercising an option at the end of 
each fiscal year to continue payments for the next year. The contract 
contained a risk of loss provision under which GSA would be required to 
pay the full price for any equipment lost or damaged during the term of the 
contract. GAO concluded that the equipment should be treated as 
contractor-owned property for purposes of the risk of loss provision, and 
that the provision would be improper unless one of the following 
conditions were met: 

• The contract includes the clause specified in 54 Comp. Gen. 824 
limiting GSA’s liability to appropriations available at the time of the loss 
and expressly precluding any inference that Congress would 
appropriate sufficient funds to meet any deficiency; or 
• If the contract does not include these restrictions, then GSA must 
obligate sufficient funds to cover its possible liability under the risk of 
loss provision. 
If neither of these conditions is met, the assumption of risk clause could 
violate the Antideficiency Act by creating an obligation in excess of 
available appropriations if any equipment is lost or damaged during the 
term of the contract. 

In 1982, the Defense Department and the state of New York entered into a 
contract for New York to provide certain support functions for the 1980 
Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid. The contract provided for federal 
reimbursement of any disability benefits which New York might be 
required to pay in case of death or injury of persons participating in the 
operation. The contract specified that the government’s liability could not 
exceed appropriations for assistance to the Games available at the time of a 
disabling event, and that the contract did not imply that Congress would 
appropriate funds sufficient to meet any deficiencies. Since these 
provisions satisfied the test of 54 Comp. Gen. 824, the indemnity agreement 
was not legally objectionable. B-202518, Jan. 8, 1982. Under this type of 
arrangement, GAO noted that an estimated amount should have been 
recorded as an obligation when the agency was notified that a disabling 
event had occurred. However, no violation of the Antideficiency Act 

Page 6-75 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

actually occurred in this case because sufficient funds remained available 
for obligation at the time New York filed its claim for indemnification under 
the contract. 

Also, the decision in the National Flood Insurance Act case mentioned 
above (B-201394, Apr. 23, 1981) noted that the defect could have been 
cured by inserting a clause along the lines of the clause in 54 Comp. 
Gen. 824. The same point was made in B-201072, May 3, 1982, also 
discussed earlier. See also National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. United 
States, 3 Cl. Ct. 516, 521 (1983) (indemnification agreement between the 
Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak did not violate Antideficiency 
Act where liability was limited to amount of appropriation). 

However, as noted in the introduction to this section, over the years GAO 
has expressed the view that indemnity agreements, even with limiting 
language, should not be entered into without congressional approval in 
view of their potentially disruptive fiscal consequences to the agency.79 
63 Comp. Gen. 145, 147 (1984); 62 Comp. Gen. 361, 368 (1983); B-242146, 
Aug. 16, 1991. If an agency thinks that indemnification agreements in a 
particular context are sufficiently in the government’s interest, the 
preferable approach is for the agency to go to Congress and seek specific 
statutory authority. See B-201394, Apr. 23, 1981. 

As discussed below, Congress has seen fit to enact legislation authorizing 
indemnification agreements when warranted by the circumstances. In 
1986, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation, Senate 
Committee on Environment and Public Works, in connection with 
proposed Price-Anderson Act amendments the committee was considering, 
asked GAO to identify possible funding options for a statutory 
indemnification provision. GAO’s response, B-197742, Aug. 1, 1986, listed 
several options and noted the benefits and drawbacks of each from the 
perspective of congressional flexibility. The options ranged from creating a 
statutory entitlement with a permanent indefinite appropriation for 
payment (indemnity guaranteed but no congressional flexibility), to 
making payment fully dependent on the appropriations process (full 
congressional flexibility but no guarantee of payment). In between were 

79 To illustrate the potential fiscal consequences, an authorized indemnity agreement 
entered into in 1950 produced liability of over $64 million plus interest more than four 
decades later. See E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co. v. United States, 24 Cl. Ct. 635 (1991), 
aff’d, 980 F.2d 1440 (Fed. Cir. 1992).

various other devices such as contract authority, use of contract provisions 
such as those in 54 Comp. Gen. 824, and various forms of limited funding 
authority.80 

The discussion in B-197742 highlights the essence of the indemnification 
funding problem: 

“An indemnity statute should generally include two 
features—the indemnification provisions and a funding 
mechanism. Indemnification provisions can range from a 
legally binding guarantee to a mere authorization. Funding 
mechanisms can similarly vary in terms of the degree of 
congressional control and flexibility retained. It is 
impossible to maximize both the assurance of payment and 
congressional flexibility. Either objective is enhanced only 
at the expense of the other. . . . 

* * * * * 

“If payment is to be assured, Congress must yield control 
over funding, either in whole or up to specified ceilings . . . . 
Conversely, if Congress is to retain funding control, 
payment cannot be assured in any legally binding form and 
the indemnification becomes less than an entitlement.” 

B-197742 at 9, 11. 

(3) Statutorily authorized indemnification 
When we first stated the anti-indemnity rule at the outset of this discussion, 
we noted that the rule applies in the absence of express statutory authority 
to the contrary. Naturally, an indemnification agreement, however openended 
it may be, will be “legal” if it is expressly authorized by statute. 

One statutory exception to the indemnification rules exists for certain 
defense-related contracts by virtue of 50 U.S.C. § 1431, often referred to by 

80 Note that the Price-Anderson Act, at 42 U.S.C. § 2210(j), provided contract rather than 
indemnity authority to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to address 
indemnification and other financial protection that NRC is required to provide nuclear 
licensees, contractors, and others to cover the consequences of nuclear incidents.

its Public Law designation, Public Law 85-804.81 The statute evolved from a 
temporary wartime measure, section 201 of the First War Powers Act, 1941, 
ch. 493, 55 Stat. 838, 839 (Dec. 18, 1941). The implementing details on 
indemnification are found in Executive Order No. 10789, as amended,82 and 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R. part 50 (2005). For 
example, while the decision to indemnify under Public Law 85-804 is 
discretionary, B-287121, Mar. 20, 2001, such discretion must be exercised by 
the agency head and cannot be delegated. B-257139, Aug. 30, 1994, citing 
FAR, 48 C.F.R. § 50.201(d). 

Other examples of statutory exceptions are: 

• section 4 of the Price-Anderson Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2210, which provides 
contract authority permitting, among other things, indemnification 
agreements with Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensees and 
Department of Energy contractors to pay claims resulting from nuclear 
accidents; 
• section 119 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9619, which authorizes 
indemnification of certain Superfund cleanup contractors against 
negligence (but not gross negligence or intentional misconduct); 
• section 308 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act, 42 U.S.C. 
§ 2458b, which authorizes the Administrator of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to indemnify users of 
NASA space vehicles against third party claims that are not covered by 
insurance; 
• section 2354 of title 10, United States Code, which authorizes the 
military departments to indemnify research and development 
contractors against liability not covered by insurance; and 
81 Pub. L. No. 85-804, § 1, 72 Stat. 972 (Aug. 28, 1958).

§ 1431 note. A decision approving an indemnity agreement under authority of the First War 
Powers Act is B-33801, Apr. 19, 1943. A later related decision is B-33801, Oct. 27, 1943. Both 
of these decisions involved the famed “Manhattan Project,” although that fact is wellconcealed. 
The decisions had been classified, but were declassified in 1986.

Limitations/Purpose 
Violations 
• section 7423(2) of title 26, United States Code, which authorizes 
indemnification of federal employees for damages awarded in suits 
involving their performance of duties under the Internal Revenue Code. 
Congress also may enact legislation to provide indemnification for a 
specific or one-time event. For example, Congress specifically indemnified 
the manufacturers, distributors, and those who administered the swine flu 
vaccine purchased and used as part of the National Swine Flu 
Immunization Program of 1976 against liability for other than their own 
negligence to persons alleging personal injury or death arising out of the 
administration of such vaccine. Pub. L. No. 94-380, 90 Stat. 1113 (Aug. 12, 
1976). 

In Chapter 4 we covered in some detail 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a), which prohibits 
the use of appropriations for purposes other than those for which they 
were appropriated. As seen in that chapter, violations of purpose 
availability can arise in a wide variety of contexts—charging an obligation 
or expenditure to the wrong appropriation, making an obligation or 
expenditure for an unauthorized purpose, violating a statutory prohibition 
or restriction, etc. The question we explore in this section is the 
relationship of purpose availability to the Antideficiency Act. In other 
words, when and to what extent does a purpose violation also violate the 
Antideficiency Act? 

Why does it matter whether you have violated one statute or two statutes? 
One reason is that, if the second statute is the Antideficiency Act, there are 
statutory reporting requirements and potential penalties to consider in 
addition to any administrative sanctions that agencies may impose through 
internal processes for violations of section 1301 alone. 

A useful starting point is the following excerpt from 63 Comp. Gen. 422, 424 
(1984): 

“Not every violation of 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) also constitutes a 
violation of the Antideficiency Act. . . . Even though an 
expenditure may have been charged to an improper source, 
the Antideficiency Act’s prohibition against incurring 
obligations in excess or in advance of available 
appropriations is not also violated unless no other funds 
were available for that expenditure. Where, however, no 
other funds were authorized to be used for the purpose in 
question (or where those authorized were already 

Page 6-79 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

obligated), both 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) and § 1341(a) have been 
violated. In addition, we would consider an Antideficiency 
Act violation to have occurred where an expenditure was 
improperly charged and the appropriate fund source, 
although available at the time, was subsequently obligated, 
making readjustment of accounts impossible.” 

First, suppose an agency charges an obligation or expenditure to the wrong 
appropriation account, either charging the wrong appropriation for the 
same time period, or charging the wrong fiscal year. The above passage 
from 63 Comp. Gen. 422 provides the answer—if the appropriation that 
should have been charged in the first place has sufficient available funds to 
enable the adjustment of accounts, there is no Antideficiency Act violation. 
The decision in 73 Comp. Gen. 259 (1994) illustrates this point. In that case, 
an agency had erroneously charged a furniture order to the wrong 
appropriation account, but had sufficient funds in the proper account to 
support an adjustment correcting the error. Thus, GAO concluded, there 
was no violation of the Antideficiency Act. Id. at 261. On the other hand, a 
violation exists if the proper account does not have enough money to 
permit the adjustment, and this includes cases where sufficient funds 
existed at the time of the error but have since been obligated or expended. 
See also 70 Comp. Gen. 592 (1991); B-222048, Feb. 10, 1987; B-95136, Aug. 8, 
1979. 

Other cases illustrating or applying this principle are 57 Comp. Gen. 459 
(1978) (grant funds charged to wrong fiscal year); B-224702, Aug. 5, 1987 
(contract modifications charged to expired accounts rather than current 
appropriations); and B-208697, Sept. 28, 1983 (items charged to General 
Services Administration Working Capital Fund which should have been 
charged to other operating appropriations). Actually, the concept of 
“curing” a violation by making an appropriate adjustment of accounts is not 
new. See, e.g., 16 Comp. Dec. 750 (1910); 4 Comp. Dec. 314, 317 (1897). The 
Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals also has followed this principle. 
New England Tank Industries of New Hampshire, Inc., ASBCA No. 26474, 
88-1 BCA ¶ 20,395 (1987).83 

83 Although the Board’s decision was vacated and remanded on other grounds by the Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, New England Tank Industries of New Hampshire v. 
United States, 861 F.2d 685 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court noted its agreement with the Board’s 
Antideficiency Act conclusions. Id. at 692 n.15.

The next situation to consider is an obligation or expenditure in excess of a 
statutory ceiling. This may be an earmarked maximum in a more general 
appropriation or a monetary ceiling imposed by some other legislation. An 
obligation or expenditure in excess of the ceiling violates 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1341(a). See, for example, the following: 

• Monetary ceilings on minor military construction (10 U.S.C. 
§ 2805): 63 Comp. Gen. 422 (1984); GAO, Continuing Inadequate 
Control Over Programming and Financing of Construction, 
B-133316 (Washington, D.C.: July 23, 1964); Review of Programming 
and Financing of Selected Facilities Constructed at Army, Navy, and 
Air Force Installations, B-133316 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 24, 1961).84 
• Monetary ceiling on lease payments for family housing units in 
foreign countries (10 U.S.C. § 2828(e)): 66 Comp. Gen. 176 (1986); 
B-227527, B-227325, Oct. 21, 1987 (nondecision letter); GAO, Leased 
Military Housing Costs in Europe Can Be Reduced by Improving 
Acquisition Practices and Using Purchase Contracts, 
GAO/NSIAD-85-113 (Washington, D.C.: July 24, 1985), at 7–8. 

• Ceiling in supplemental appropriation: B-204270, Oct. 13, 1981 
(dollar limit on Standard Level User Charge payable by agency to 
General Services Administration).85 
• Ceiling in authorizing legislation: 64 Comp. Gen. 282 (1985) (dollar 
limit on two Small Business Administration direct loan programs). 
In a statutory ceiling case, the account adjustment concept described 
above may or may not come into play. If the ceiling represents a limit on 
the amount available for a particular object, then there generally will be no 
other funds available for that object and hence no “correct” funding source 
from which to reimburse the account charged. If, however, the ceiling 
represents only a limit on the amount available from a particular 

84 Another report in this series, making similar findings under a different statutory ceiling, is 
GAO, Illegal Use of Operation and Maintenance Funds for Rehabilitation and 
Construction of Family Housing and Construction of a Related Facility, B-133102 
(Washington, D.C.: Aug. 30, 1963). 

85 This case also illustrates that the Antideficiency Act applies to interagency transactions 
the same as any other obligations or expenditures. Cf. B-247348, June 22, 1992 
(nonreimbursable interagency personnel detail).

appropriation and not an absolute limit on expenditures for the object, as 
in the minor military construction cases, for example, then it may be 
possible to cure violations by an appropriate adjustment. 63 Comp. Gen. 
at 424. 

The final situation is an obligation or expenditure for an object that is 
prohibited or simply unauthorized. In 60 Comp. Gen. 440 (1981), a proviso 
in the Customs Service’s 1980 appropriation expressly prohibited the use of 
the appropriation for administrative expenses to pay any employee 
overtime pay in an amount in excess of $20,000. By allowing employees to 
earn overtime pay in excess of that amount, the Customs Service violated 
31 U.S.C. § 1341. The Comptroller General explained the violation as 
follows: 

“When an appropriation act specifies that an agency’s 
appropriation is not available for a designated purpose, and 
the agency has no other funds available for that purpose, 
any officer of the agency who authorizes an obligation or 
expenditure of agency funds for that purpose violates the 
Antideficiency Act. Since the Congress has not 
appropriated funds for the designated purpose, the 
obligation may be viewed either as being in excess of the 
amount (zero) available for that purpose or as in advance of 
appropriations made for that purpose. In either case the 
Antideficiency Act is violated.” 

Id. at 441. 

In B-201260, Sept. 11, 1984, the Comptroller General advised that 
expenditures in contravention of the Boland Amendment would violate the 
Antideficiency Act (although none were found in that case). The Boland 
Amendment, an appropriation rider, provided that “[n]one of the funds 
provided in this Act may be used” for certain activities in Central America. 
In B-229732, Dec. 22, 1988, GAO found the Antideficiency Act violated 
when the Department of Housing and Urban Development used its funds 
for commercial trade promotion activities in the Soviet Union, an activity 
beyond its statutory authority. Similarly, a nonreimbursable interagency 
detail of an employee, contrary to a specific statutory prohibition, 
produced a violation in B-247348, June 22, 1992 (letter to Public Printer). 
All three cases also involved purpose violations and are consistent with 

Page 6-82 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

60 Comp. Gen. 440, the rationale being that expenditures would be in 
excess of available appropriations, which were zero.86 

More recent GAO decisions likewise consistently apply the principle that 
the use of appropriated funds for unauthorized or prohibited purposes 
violates the Antideficiency Act (absent an alternative funding source) since 
zero funds are available for that purpose. B-302710, May 19, 2004 (use of 
funds in violation of statutory prohibition against publicity or propaganda); 
B-300325, Dec. 13, 2002 (appropriations used for unauthorized technical 
assistance purposes); B-300192, Nov. 13, 2002 (violation of appropriation 
rider prohibiting use of funds to implement an Office of Management and 
Budget memorandum); B-290005, July 1, 2002 (appropriation used to 
procure unauthorized legal services); 71 Comp. Gen. 402, 406 (1992) 
(unauthorized use of Training and Employment Services appropriation); 
B-246304, July 31, 1992 (potential violation of appropriation act “Buy 
American” provision); B-248284, Sept. 1, 1992 (nondecision letter) 
(reprogramming of funds to an unauthorized purpose). 

One court reached a result that appears to interpret the Antideficiency Act 
somewhat differently. In Southern Packaging and Storage Co. v. United 
States, 588 F. Supp. 532 (D.S.C. 1984), the court found that the Defense 
Department had purchased certain combat meal products (“MRE”) in 
violation of a “Buy American” appropriation rider, which provided that 
“[n]o part of any appropriation contained in this Act . . . shall be available” 
to procure items not grown or produced in the United States. The court 
rejected the contention that the violation also contravened the 
Antideficiency Act, stating: 

“There is no evidence in this case to show that [the Defense 
Personnel Supply Center] authorized expenditures beyond 
the amount appropriated by Congress for the procurement 
of the MRE rations and the component foods thereof.” 

Id. at 550. 

86 There are also a few older cases finding violations of both statutes, but they are of little 
help in attempting to formulate a reasoned approach. Examples are 39 Comp. Gen 388 
(1959), which does not discuss the relationship, and 22 Comp. Gen. 772 (1943), which 
includes a rationale, now obsolete, based on the then-existing lack of authority to include 
interest stipulations in contracts.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

e. Amount of Available 
Appropriation or Fund 
Given the sparse discussion in the decision, the fact that Congress does not 
make specific appropriations for MRE rations, and the fact that the 
Antideficiency Act regulates both obligations and expenditures in excess of 
available authority, it is difficult to discern precisely how the Southern 
Packaging court would apply the Antideficiency Act. In any event, we have 
found no subsequent judicial or administrative decision that cites this 
aspect of the Southern Packaging opinion. 

Questions occasionally arise over precisely what assets an agency may 
count for purposes of determining the amount of available resources 
against which it may incur obligations. 

The starting point, of course, is the unobligated balance of the relevant 
appropriation. In section F of this chapter, we discuss the rule that 
subdivisions of a lump-sum appropriation appearing in legislative history 
are not legally binding on the agency. They are binding only if carried into 
the appropriation act itself, or are made binding by some other statute. 
Thus, the entire unobligated balance of an unrestricted lump-sum 
appropriation is available for Antideficiency Act purposes. 55 Comp. 
Gen. 812 (1976). 

Where an agency is authorized to retain certain receipts or collections for 
credit to an appropriation or fund under that agency’s control, those 
receipts are treated the same as direct appropriations for purposes of 
obligation and the Antideficiency Act, subject to any applicable statutory 
restrictions. E.g., 71 Comp. Gen. 224 (1992) (National Technical 
Information Service may use subscription payments to defray its operating 
expenses but, under governing legislation, may use customer advances 
only for costs directly related to firm orders). 

In addition, certain other assets may be “counted” as available budget 
authority, that is, obligated against. For example, OMB Circular No. A-11 
includes certain spending authority from offsetting collections as a form of 
“budget authority.”87 See also B-134474-O.M., Dec. 18, 1957. This does not 
mean anticipated receipts from transactions that have not yet occurred or 
orders that have not yet been placed. Thus, the Library of Congress could 

87 See generally OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the 
Budget, §§ 20.4(b), 20.7, and 20.12 (June 21, 2005). See also the definitions of “Budget 
Authority” and “Collections” in GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget 
Process, GAO-05-734SP (Washington, D.C.: September 2005), at 20–23, 28–30.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

not retain in a revolving fund advances from federal agencies in excess of 
amounts needed to cover current orders in anticipation of applying the 
excess amounts to future orders. B-288142, Sept. 6, 2001. Obligations 
cannot be charged against anticipated proceeds from an anticipated sale of 
property. See, e.g., B-209758, Sept. 29, 1983 (nondecision memorandum) 
(sale of assets seized from embezzler). Thus, the Customs Service violated 
the Antideficiency Act by obligating against anticipated receipts from 
future sales of seized property unless it had sufficient funds available from 
other sources to cover the obligation. B-237135, Dec. 21, 1989. Similarly, 
the Comptroller General found that the Air Force violated the 
Antideficiency Act by overobligating its Industrial Fund based on estimated 
or anticipated customer orders. See GAO, The Air Force Has Incurred 
Numerous Overobligations in its Industrial Fund, AFMD-81-53 
(Washington, D.C.: Aug. 14, 1981); 62 Comp. Gen. 143, 147 (1983). Even 
where receivables are properly included as budgetary resources, an agency 
may not incur obligations against receipts expected to be received after the 
end of the current fiscal year without specific statutory authority. 
51 Comp. Gen. 598, 605 (1972). 

In 60 Comp. Gen. 520 (1981), GAO considered whether the General 
Services Administration (GSA) could obligate against the value of 
inventory in the General Supply Fund. GSA buys furniture and other 
equipment for other agencies through the General Supply Fund, a revolving 
fund established by statute. Agencies pay GSA either in advance or by 
reimbursement. For reasons of economy, GSA normally makes 
consolidated and bulk purchases of commonly used items. Concern over 
the application of the Antideficiency Act arose when, for several reasons, 
the Fund began experiencing cash flow problems. To help remedy its “cash 
flow” problems GSA wanted to consider the amount of available budget 
authority to include inventory as well as cash assets and advances. 

The Comptroller General held that inventory in the General Supply Fund 
did not constitute a budgetary resource against which obligations could be 
incurred. The items in the inventory had already been purchased and could 
not be counted again as a new budgetary resource. Thus, for 
Antideficiency Act purposes, GSA could not incur obligations using the 
value of inventory as an available “budgetary resource.” 

Supplemental appropriations requested but not yet enacted obviously may 
not be counted as a budgetary resource. B-230117-O.M., Feb. 8, 1989.

f. Intent/Factors beyond 
Agency Control 
A violation of the Antideficiency Act does not depend on intent or lack of 
good faith on the part of contracting or other officials who obligate or pay 
in advance or in excess of appropriations. Although these factors may 
influence the applicable penalty, they do not affect the basic determination 
of whether a violation has occurred. 64 Comp. Gen. 282, 289 (1985). The 
Comptroller General once expressed the principle in the following passage 
which, although stated in a slightly different context, is equally applicable 
here: 

“Where a payment is prohibited by law, the utmost good 
faith on the part of the officer, either in ignorance of the 
facts or in disregard of the facts, in purporting to authorize 
the incurring of an obligation the payment of which is so 
prohibited, cannot take the case out of the statute, 
otherwise the purported good faith of an officer could be 
used to nullify the law.” 

A-86742, June 17, 1937. 

To illustrate, a contracting officer at the United States Mission to the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization accepted an offer for installation of automatic 
telephone equipment at twice the amount of the unobligated balance 
remaining in the applicable account. The Department of State explained 
that the contracting officer had misinterpreted GAO regulations and 
implementing State Department procedures. But for this misinterpretation, 
additional funds could have been placed in the account. State therefore felt 
that the transaction should not be considered in violation of the Act. GAO 
did not agree and held that the overobligation must be immediately 
reported as required by 31 U.S.C. § 1517(b). The official’s state of mind was 
not relevant in deciding whether a violation had occurred. 35 Comp. 
Gen. 356 (1955). 

An overobligation may result from external factors beyond the agency’s 
control. Whether this will produce an Antideficiency Act violation depends 
on the particular circumstances. In 58 Comp. Gen. 46 (1978), the Army 
asked whether it could make payments to a contractor under a contract 
requiring payment in local (foreign) currency where the original dollar 
obligation was well within applicable funding limitations but, due to 
subsequent exchange rate fluctuations, payment would exceed those 
limitations. The Army argued that a payment under these circumstances 
should not be considered a violation of the Act because currency 
fluctuations are totally beyond the control of the contracting officer or any 

Page 6-86 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

other agency official. GAO disagreed. The fact that the contracting officer 
was a victim of circumstances does not make a payment in excess of 
available appropriations any less illegal. (It is, of course, as with state of 
mind, relevant in assessing penalties for the violation.) See also 38 Comp. 
Gen. 501 (1959) (severe adverse weather conditions or prolonged employee 
strikes generally are not sufficient to justify overobligation by former Post 
Office Department, but facts in a particular case could justify deficiency 
apportionment). 

In apparent contrast, the Comptroller General stated in 62 Comp. Gen. 692, 
700 (1983) that an overobligation resulting from a judicial award of 
attorney’s fees under 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d), the Equal Access to Justice Act, 
would not violate the Antideficiency Act. See also 63 Comp. Gen. 308, 312 
(1984) (judgments or board of contract appeals awards under Contract 
Disputes Act, same answer); B-227527, B-227325, Oct. 21, 1987 
(nondecision letter) (amounts awarded by court judgment not counted in 
determining whether statutory ceiling on lease payments has been 
exceeded and Antideficiency Act thereby violated). 

The distinction is based on the extent to which the agency can act to avoid 
the overobligation even though it is imposed by some external force 
beyond its control. Thus, the currency fluctuation decision stated: 

“[W]hen a contracting officer finds that the dollars required 
to continue or make final payment on a contract will exceed 
a statutory limitation he may terminate the contract, 
provided the termination costs will not exceed the statutory 
limitations. Alternatively, the contracting officer may issue 
a stop work order and the agency may ask Congress for a 
deficiency appropriation citing the currency fluctuation as 
the reason for its request.” 

58 Comp. Gen. at 48. Similarly, the Postmaster General could curtail 
operations if necessary. 38 Comp. Gen. 501, 504 (1959). See also 66 Comp. 
Gen. 176 (1986) (Antideficiency Act would not preclude Air Force from 
entering into lease for overseas family housing without provision limiting 
annual payments to statutory ceiling, even though certain costs could 
conceivably escalate above ceiling, where good faith cost estimates were 
well below ceiling and lease included termination for convenience clause). 
Where the agency could have acted to avert the overobligation but did not, 
there will be a violation. In contrast, in the case of a payment ordered by a 
court, comparable options (apart from seeking a deficiency appropriation) 

Page 6-87 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

are not available. (Curtailing activities after the overobligation has 
occurred to avoid compounding the violation is a separate question.) 

g. Exceptions The Antideficiency Act by its own terms recognizes that Congress can and 
may grant exceptions. 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a). The statute prohibits contracts 
or other obligations in advance or excess of available appropriations, 
“unless authorized by law.” This is nothing more than the recognition that 
Congress can authorize exceptions to the statutes it enacts. 
(1) Contract authority 
At the outset, it is necessary to distinguish between “contract authority” 
and the “authority to enter into contracts.” A contract is simply a legal 
device employed by two or more parties to create binding and legally 
enforceable obligations in furtherance of some objective. The federal 
government uses contracts every day to procure a wide variety of goods 
and services. An agency does not need specific statutory authority to enter 
into contracts. It has long been established that a government agency has 
the inherent authority to enter into binding contracts in the execution of its 
duties. Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U.S. 151, 154 (1886); United 
States v. Maurice, 26 F. Case 1211, 1216–17 (No. 15,747) (C.C.D. Va. 1823). 
It should be apparent that these contracts, “authorized by law” though they 
may be, are not sufficient to constitute exceptions to the Antideficiency 
Act, else the Act would be meaningless. 

For purposes of the Antideficiency Act exception, a contract authorized by 
law requires not only authority to enter into a contract, but authority to do 
so without regard to the availability of appropriations. While the former 
may be inherent, the latter must be conferred by statute. The most 
common example of this is “contract authority” as that term is defined and 
described in Chapter 2—statutory authority to enter into binding contracts 
without the funds adequate to make payments under them. 

In some cases, the “exception” language will be unmistakably explicit. An 
example is the Price-Anderson Act, which provides authority to “make 
contracts in advance of appropriations and incur obligations without 
regard to” the Antideficiency Act. 42 U.S.C. § 2210(j). Other examples of 
clear authority, although perhaps not as explicit as the Price-Anderson Act, 
are discussed in 27 Comp. Gen. 452 (1948) (long-term operating-differential 
subsidy agreements under the Merchant Marine Act); B-211190, Apr. 5, 1983 
(contracts with states under the Federal Boat Safety Act); B-164497.3, 
June 6, 1979 (certain provisions of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973); 

Page 6-88 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

and B-168313, Nov. 21, 1969 (interest subsidy agreements with educations 
institutions under the Housing Act of 1950). 

In an earlier case involving contract authority, GAO insisted that the Corps 
of Engineers had to include a “no liability unless funds are later made 
available” clause for any work done in excess of available funds. 2 Comp. 
Gen. 477 (1923). The Corps later had trouble with this clause because a 
Court of Claims decision, C.H. Leavell & Co. v. United States, 530 F.2d 
878 (Ct. Cl. 1976), allowed the contractor an equitable adjustment for 
suspension of work due to a delay in enacting an appropriation to pay him, 
notwithstanding the “availability of funds” clause. In 56 Comp. Gen. 437 
(1977), GAO overruled 2 Comp. Gen. 477, deciding that section 10 of the 
River and Harbor Act of 1922, 33 U.S.C. § 621, by expressly authorizing the 
Corps to enter into large multiyear civil works projects without seeking a 
full appropriation in the first year, constituted the necessary exception to 
the Antideficiency Act and a “funds available” clause was not necessary. 
This applies as well to contracts financed from the Corps’ Civil Works 
Revolving Fund. B-242974.6, Nov. 26, 1991 (internal memorandum). The 
rationale of 56 Comp. Gen. 437 also has been applied to long-term fuel 
storage facilities contracts authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 2388. New England 
Tank Industries of New Hampshire, Inc., ASBCA No. 26474, 88-1 BCA 
¶ 20,395 (1987), vacated on other grounds, New England Tank Industries 
of New Hampshire v. United States, 861 F.2d 685 (Fed. Cir. 1988). 

In 28 Comp. Gen. 163 (1948), the Comptroller General considered whether 
the Commissioner of Reclamation had budget authority to enter into 
certain contracts in advance of appropriations (contract authority). 
Congress had authorized the contract authority in an appropriation act but 
made it subject to a monetary ceiling. Since the contract authority was 
explicit, with no language making it contingent on appropriations being 
made at some later date, the Comptroller General concluded that the 
statute authorized the Commissioner to enter into a firm and binding 
contract. 

The Bureau of Mines was authorized to enter into a contract (in advance of 
the appropriation) to construct and equip an anthracite research 
laboratory. The Bureau asked the General Services Administration (GSA) 
to enter into the contract on its behalf pursuant to section 103 of the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, ch. 288, 63 Stat. 
377, 380 (June 30, 1949), which provided that “funds appropriated to . . . 
other Federal agencies for the foregoing purposes [execution of contracts 
and supervision of construction] shall be available for transfer to and 

Page 6-89 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

expenditure by the [GSA].” GAO held that the Bureau’s contract authority 
provided a sufficient legal basis for GSA to enter into contracts for 
construction of the laboratory pursuant to section 103. 29 Comp. Gen. 504 
(1950).88 

A somewhat different kind of contract authority is found in 41 U.S.C. § 11, 
the so-called Adequacy of Appropriations Act. An exception to the 
requirement to have adequate appropriations—or any appropriation at 
all—is made for procurements by the military departments for “clothing, 
subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation, or medical and hospital 
supplies, which, however, shall not exceed the necessities of the current 
year.” By administrative interpretation, the Defense Department has 
limited this authority to emergency circumstances where immediate action 
is necessary. Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation 
7000.14-R, vol. 3, ch. 12, ¶ 120201 (Jan. 31, 2001). 

It should again be emphasized that to constitute an exception to 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1341(a), the “contract authority” must be specific authority to incur the 
obligation in excess or advance of appropriations, not merely the general 
authority any agency has to enter into contracts to carry out its functions. 
Also, an appropriation obviously is needed to liquidate the contract 
obligation. 

Congress may grant authority to contract beyond the fiscal year in terms 
which amount to considerably less than the type of contract authority 
described above. An example is 43 U.S.C. § 388, which authorizes the 
Secretary of the Interior to enter into certain contracts relating to 
reclamation projects “which may cover such periods of time as the 
Secretary may consider necessary but in which the liability of the United 
States shall be contingent upon appropriations being made therefore.” See 
PCL Construction Services, Inc. v. United States, 41 Fed. Cl. 242, 257 
(1998), aff’d, 96 Fed. Appx. 672 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 
§ 388, firm fixed-price contract awarded by the Bureau of Reclamation to 
construct a visitors center and parking structure at Hoover Dam could be 
incrementally funded without violating the Antideficiency Act). While this 
provision has been referred to as an exception to the Antideficiency Act 
(B-72020, Jan. 9, 1948), it authorizes only “contingent contracts” under 

88 The Public Buildings Act of 1959, Pub. L. No. 86-249, 73 Stat. 479 (Sept. 9, 1959), 
superseded the provisions of the 1949 legislation discussed in 29 Comp. Gen. 504. The 
substance of the Public Buildings Act of 1959 is codified in 40 U.S.C. §§ 3301–3315.

which there is no legal obligation to pay unless and until appropriations are 
provided. 28 Comp. Gen. 163 (1948). A similar example, discussed in 
B-239435, Aug. 24, 1990, is 38 U.S.C. § 230(c) (Supp. II 1990) (subsequently 
recodified at 38 U.S.C. § 316) which authorized the Department of Veterans 
Affairs to enter into certain leases for periods of up to 35 years but further 
provided that the government’s obligation to make payments was “subject 
to the availability of appropriations for that purpose.” For another 
example, see B-248647.2, Apr. 24, 1995, which discussed the Federal 
Triangle Development Act, 40 U.S.C. §§ 1101–1109. This act directed GSA 
to enter into a long-term lease and required the lease agreement to 
recognize that GSA could obligate funds for lease payments only on an 
annual basis. 40 U.S.C. § 1105. Therefore, the GSA multiyear lease 
agreement at issue was specifically “authorized by law” and did not violate 
the Antideficiency Act. B-248647.2 at fn. 3. 

(2) Other obligations “authorized by law” 
The “authorized by law” exception in 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a) applies to 
noncontractual obligations as well as to contracts. The basic approach is 
the same. The statutory authority must be more than just authority to 
undertake the particular activity. For example, statutory authority to 
acquire land and to pay for it from a specified fund is not an exception to 
the Antideficiency Act. 27 Comp. Gen. 662 (1921). It merely authorizes 
acquisitions to the extent of funds available in the specified source at the 
time of purchase. Id. Similarly, the authority to conduct hearings, without 
more, does not confer authority to do so without regard to available 
appropriations. 16 Comp. Dec. 750 (1910). Provisions in the District of 
Columbia Code requiring Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital to treat all patients who 
meet admission eligibility requirements were held not to authorize the 
Hospital to operate beyond the level of its appropriations. If mandatory 
expenditures, together with nonmandatory expenditures, would cause a 
deficiency, the Hospital would have to reduce nonmandatory expenditures. 

61 Comp. Gen. 661 (1982). 

Congress may expressly state that an agency may obligate in excess of the 
amounts appropriated, or it may implicitly authorize an agency to do so by 
virtue of a law that necessarily requires such obligations. See B-262069, 
Aug. 1, 1995. Several cases have considered the effect of various statutory 
salary or compensation increases. If a statutory increase is mandatory and 
does not vest discretion in an administrative office to determine the 
amount, or if it gives some administrative body discretion to determine the 
amount, payment of which then becomes mandatory, the obligation is

deemed “authorized by law” for Antideficiency Act purposes. See, e.g., 
39 Comp. Gen. 422 (1959) (salary increases for Wage Board employees); 
B-168796, Feb. 2, 1970 (mandatory statutory increase in retired pay for Tax 
Court judges); B-107279, Jan. 9, 1952 (mandatory increases for certain 
legislative personnel). GAO has not treated the granting of increases 
retroactively to correct past administrative errors as creating the same type 
of exception. See 24 Comp. Gen. 676 (1945). Increases which are 
discretionary do not permit the incurring of obligations in excess or 
advance of appropriations. 31 Comp. Gen. 238 (1951) (discretionary 
pension increases); 28 Comp. Gen. 300 (1948).89 

Some other examples of obligations authorized by law for Antideficiency 
Act purposes are: 

• Defense Health Program obligations for medical services. B-287619, 
July 5, 2001. 
• Mandatory pilot program in Vermont under Farms for the Future Act of 
1990 (loan guarantees and interest assistance). B-244093, July 19, 1991. 
• Mandatory transfer from one appropriation account to another where 
“donor” account contained insufficient unobligated funds. 38 Comp. 
Gen. 93 (1958). 
• Provision in Criminal Justice Act of 1964 imposing unequivocal 
legislative directive for commencement of certain programs which 
would necessarily involve creation of financial obligations. B-156932, 
Aug. 17, 1965. 
• Provision in District of Columbia Criminal Justice Act of 1974 (CJA), as 
amended, making attorney representation in CJA cases a mandatory 
expense. B-283599, Sept. 15, 1999. See also B-284566, Apr. 3, 2000. 
• Statute authorizing Interstate Commerce Commission to order a 
substitute rail carrier to serve shippers abandoned by their primary 
89 The decision in 28 Comp. Gen. 300 concerned increases to Wage Board employees under 
legislation which is now obsolete (see 39 Comp. Gen. 422, cited in the text). However, it is 
still useful for the basic proposition that nonmandatory increases are not obligations 
“authorized by law” as that term is used in 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a). 28 Comp. Gen. at 302.

carrier in emergency situations, and to reimburse certain costs of the 

substitute carrier. B-196132, Oct. 11, 1979. 

What are perhaps the outer limits of the “authorized by law” exception are 
illustrated in B-159141, Aug. 18, 1967. The Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) had entered into long-term, incrementally funded contracts for the 
development of a civil supersonic aircraft (SST). To ensure compliance 
with the Antideficiency Act, the FAA each year budgeted for, and obligated, 
sufficient funds to cover potential termination liability. The appropriations 
committees became concerned that unnecessarily large amounts were 
being tied up this way, especially in light of the highly remote possibility 
that the SST contracts would be terminated. In considering the FAA’s 1968 
appropriation, the House Appropriations Committee reduced the FAA’s 
request by the amount of the termination reserve, and in its report directed 
the FAA not to obligate for potential termination costs. The Comptroller 
General advised that if the Senate Appropriations Committee did the same 
thing—a specific reduction tied to the amount requested for the reserve, 
coupled with clear direction in the legislative history—then an 
overobligation resulting from a termination would be regarded as 
authorized by law and not in violation of the Antideficiency Act. 

3. Voluntary Services 
Prohibition 
a. Introduction We previously discussed the Antideficiency Act prohibitions contained in 
section 1341 of title 31, United States Code. The next section of the 
Antideficiency Act is 31 U.S.C. § 1342: 
“An officer or employee of the United States Government or 
of the District of Columbia government may not accept 
voluntary services for either government or employ 
personal services exceeding that authorized by law except 
for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the 
protection of property. . . .”

This provision first appeared, in almost identical form, in a deficiency 
appropriation act enacted in 1884.90 Although the original prohibition read 
“hereafter, no department or officer of the United States shall accept . . .,” it 
was included in an appropriation for the then Indian Office of the Interior 
Department, and the Court of Claims held that it was applicable only to the 
Indian Office. Glavey v. United States, 35 Ct. Cl. 242, 256 (1900), rev’d on 
other grounds, 182 U.S. 595 (1901). The Comptroller of the Treasury 
continued to apply it across the board. See, e.g., 9 Comp. Dec. 181 (1902). 
In any event, the applicability of the 1884 statute soon became moot 
because Congress reenacted it as part of the Antideficiency Act in 190591 
and again in 1906.92 

Prior to the 1982 recodification of title 31, section 1342 was subsection (b) 
of the Antideficiency Act, while the basic prohibitions of section 1341, 
previously discussed, constituted subsection (a). The proximity of the two 
provisions in the United States Code reflects their relationship, as 
section 1342 supplements and is a logical extension of section 1341. If an 
agency cannot directly obligate in excess or advance of its appropriations, 
it should not be able to accomplish the same thing indirectly by accepting 
ostensibly “voluntary” services and then presenting Congress with the bill, 
in the hope that Congress will recognize a “moral obligation” to pay for the 
benefits conferred—another example of the so-called “coercive 
deficiency.”93 In this connection, the chairman of the House committee 
responsible for what became the 1906 reenactment of the voluntary 
services prohibition stated: 

“It is a hard matter to deal with. We give to Departments 
what we think is ample, but they come back with a 
deficiency. Under the law they can [not] make these 
deficiencies, and Congress can refuse to allow them; but

93 See section C.1 of this chapter for a discussion of the coercive deficiency concept. See 
also PCL Construction Services, Inc. v. United States, 41 Fed. Cl. 242, 251–260 (1998) 
(incrementally funded contract did not raise coercive deficiency issues where contract 
clauses clearly provided that contractor assumed the sole risk of working at a rate that 
would exhaust funding.)

In addition, as we have noted previously, the Antideficiency Act was 
intended to keep an agency’s level of operations within the amounts 
Congress appropriates for that purpose. The unrestricted ability to use 
voluntary services would permit circumvention of that objective. Thus, 
without section 1342, section 1341 could not be fully effective. Note that 
31 U.S.C. § 1342 contains two distinct although closely related prohibitions: 
It bans, first, the acceptance of any type of voluntary services for the 
United States, and second, the employment of personal services “exceeding 
that authorized by law.” 

(1) The rules—general discussion 
One of the evils that the “personal services” prohibition was designed to 
correct was a practice existing in 1884, whereby lower-grade government 
employees were being asked to “volunteer” their services for overtime 
periods in excess of the periods allowed by law. This enabled the agency to 
economize at the employees’ expense but nevertheless generated claims by 
the employees.95 Currently, 31 U.S.C. § 1342 serves a number of other 
purposes and is relevant in a number of contexts involving services by 
government employees or services which would otherwise have to be 
performed by government employees. For example, one court suggested 
that 31 U.S.C. § 1342 also is based in part on the principle that only public 
officials should be allowed to perform governmental functions. See Suss v. 
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 823 F. Supp. 
181, 189 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (“The risks of abuse of power by private parties 
exercising functions involving [the] exercise of sovereign compulsion is 
one reason for the limitations imposed by federal law on the use of 
volunteers in implementing public sector programs.”). However, as 
mentioned previously, the fundamental purposes embodied in section 1342 
are to preserve the integrity of the appropriations process by avoiding 
“coercive deficiencies” and augmentations.

One of the earliest questions to arise under 31 U.S.C. § 1342—and an issue 
that has generated many cases—was whether a government officer or 
employee, or an individual about to be appointed to a government position, 
could voluntarily work for nothing or for a reduced salary. Initially, the 
Comptroller of the Treasury ducked the question on the grounds that it did 
not involve a payment from the Treasury, and suggested that the question 
was appropriate to take to the Attorney General. 19 Comp. Dec. 160, 163 
(1912). 

The very next year, the Attorney General tackled the question when asked 
whether a retired Army officer could be employed as superintendent of an 
Indian school without additional compensation. In what has become the 
leading case construing 31 U.S.C. § 1342, the Attorney General replied that 
the appointment would not violate the voluntary services prohibition. 
30 Op. Att’y Gen. 51 (1913). In reaching this conclusion, the Attorney 
General drew a distinction that the Comptroller of the Treasury thereafter 
adopted, and that GAO and the Justice Department continue to follow to 
this day—the distinction between “voluntary services” and “gratuitous 
services.” The key passages from the Attorney General’s opinion are set 
forth below: 

“[I]t seems plain that the words ‘voluntary service’ were not 
intended to be synonymous with ‘gratuitous service’ and 
were not intended to cover services rendered in an official 
capacity under regular appointment to an office otherwise 
permitted by law to be non-salaried. In their ordinary and 
normal meaning these words refer to service intruded by a 
private person as a ‘volunteer’ and not rendered pursuant to 
any prior contract or obligation . . . . It would be stretching 
the language a good deal to extend it so far as to prohibit 
official services without compensation in those instances in 
which Congress has not required even a minimum salary for 
the office. 

“The context corroborates the view that the ordinary 
meaning of ‘voluntary services’ was intended. The very next 
words ‘or employ personal service in excess of that 
authorized by law’ deal with contractual services, thus 
making a balance between ‘acceptance’ of ‘voluntary 
service’ (i.e., the cases where there is no prior contract) and 
‘employment’ of ‘personal service’ (i.e., the cases where 
there is such prior contract, though unauthorized by law).

“Thus it is evident that the evil at which Congress was 
aiming was not appointment or employment for authorized 
services without compensation, but the acceptance of 
unauthorized services not intended or agreed to be 
gratuitous and therefore likely to afford a basis for a future 
claim upon Congress. . . .” 

Id. at 52–53, 55. 

The Comptroller of the Treasury agreed with this interpretation: 

“[The statute] was intended to guard against claims for 
compensation. A service offered clearly and distinctly as 
gratuitous with a proper record made of that fact does not 
violate this statute against acceptance of voluntary service. 
An appointment to serve without compensation which is 
accepted and properly recorded is not a violation of 
[31 U.S.C. § 1342], and is valid if otherwise lawful.” 

27 Comp. Dec. 131, 132–33 (1920). 

Two main rules emerge from 30 Op. Att’y Gen. 51 and its progeny. First, if 
compensation for a position is fixed by law, an appointee may not agree to 
serve without compensation or to waive that compensation in whole or in 
part. Id. at 56. This portion of the opinion did not break any new ground. 
The courts had already held, based on public policy, that compensation 
fixed by law could not be waived.96 Second, and this is really just a 
corollary to the rule just stated, if the level of compensation is 
discretionary, or if the relevant statute prescribes only a maximum (but not 
a minimum), the compensation can be set at zero, and an appointment 
without compensation or a waiver, entire or partial, is permissible. Id.; 
27 Comp. Dec. at 133. 

96 Glavey v. United States, 182 U.S. 595 (1901); Miller v. United States, 103 F. 413 

(C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1900). See also 9 Comp. Dec. 101 (1902). Later cases following Glavey are 
MacMath v. United States, 248 U.S. 151 (1918), and United States v. Andrews, 240 U.S. 90 
(1916). The policy rationale is that to permit agencies to disregard compensation prescribed 
by statute could work to the disadvantage of those who cannot, or are not willing to, accept 
the position for less than the prescribed salary. See Miller, 103 F. at 415–16.

Both GAO and the Justice Department have had frequent occasion to 
address these issues, and there are numerous decisions illustrating and 
applying the rules.97 

In a 1988 opinion, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel 
considered whether the Iran-Contra Independent Counsel could appoint 
Professor Laurence Tribe as Special Counsel under an agreement to serve 
without compensation. Applying the rules set forth in 30 Op. Att’y Gen. 51, 
the Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the appointment would not 
contravene the Antideficiency Act since the statute governing the 
appointment set a maximum salary but no minimum. Memorandum 
Opinion for the Acting Associate Attorney General, Independent Counsel’s 
Authority to Accept Voluntary Services—Appointment of Laurence H. 
Tribe, OLC Opinion, May 19, 1988. 

Similarly, the Comptroller General held in 58 Comp. Gen. 383 (1979) that 
members of the United States Metric Board could waive their salaries since 
the relevant statute merely prescribed a maximum rate of pay. In addition, 
since the Board had statutory authority to accept gifts, a member who 
chose to do so could accept compensation and then return it to the Board 
as a gift. Both cases make the point that compensation is not “fixed by law” 
for purposes of the “no waiver” rule where the statute merely sets a 
maximum limit for the salary. 

A good illustration of the kind of situation 31 U.S.C. § 1342 is designed to 
prevent is 54 Comp. Gen. 393 (1974). Members of the Commission on 
Marihuana and Drug Abuse had, apparently at the chairman’s urging, 
agreed to waive their statutory entitlement to $100 per day while engaged 
in Commission business. The year after the Commission ceased to exist, 
one of the former members changed his mind and filed a claim for a portion 
of the compensation he would have received but for the waiver. Since the 
$100 per day had been a statutory entitlement, the purported waiver was 
invalid and the former commissioner was entitled to be paid. Similar 
claims by any or all of the other former members would also have to be 
allowed. If insufficient funds remained in the Commission’s now-expired 
appropriation, a deficiency appropriation would be necessary. 

97 Some cases in addition to those cited in the text are 32 Comp. Gen. 236 (1952); 23 Comp. 
Gen. 109, 112 (1943); 14 Comp. Gen. 193 (1934); 34 Op. Att’y Gen. 490 (1925); 30 Op. Att’y 
Gen. 129 (1913); 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 113 (1989); 3 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 78 (1979).

A few earlier cases deal with fact situations similar to that considered in 
30 Op. Att’y Gen. 51—the acceptance by someone already on the federal 
payroll of additional duties without additional compensation. In 23 Comp. 
Gen. 272 (1943), for example, GAO concluded that a retired Army officer 
could serve, without additional compensation, as a courier for the State 
Department. The voluntary services prohibition, said the decision, does 
not preclude “the assignment of persons holding office under the 
Government to the performance of additional duties or the duties of 
another position without additional compensation.” Id. at 274. Another 
World War II era decision held that American Red Cross Volunteer Nurses’ 
Aides who also happened to be full-time federal employees could perform 
volunteer nursing services at Veterans Administration hospitals. 23 Comp. 
Gen. 900 (1944). 

One thing the various cases discussed above have in common is that they 
involve the appointment of an individual to an official government position, 
permanent or temporary. Services rendered prior to appointment are 
considered purely voluntary and, by virtue of 31 U.S.C. § 1342, cannot be 
compensated. Lee v. United States, 45 Ct. Cl. 57, 62 (1910); B-181934, 
Oct. 7, 1974.98 It also follows that post-retirement services, apart from 
appointment as a reemployed annuitant, are not compensable. 65 Comp. 
Gen. 21 (1985). In that case, an alleged agreement to the contrary by the 
individual’s supervisor was held unauthorized and therefore invalid. 

It also has been held that experts and consultants employed under 
authority of 5 U.S.C. § 3109 (the basic governmentwide authority for 
procuring expert and consultant services) may serve without 
compensation without violating the Antideficiency Act as long as it is 
clearly understood and agreed that no compensation is expected. 
27 Comp. Gen. 194 (1947); 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 160 (1982). Cf. 
B-185952, Aug. 18, 1976 (uncompensated participation in pre-bid 
conference, on-site inspection, and bid opening by contractor engineer who 
had prepared specifications regarded as “technical violation” of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1342). 

98 While the principle in B-181934 remains valid, the decision was overruled by 55 Comp. 
Gen. 109 (1975) on factual grounds. Additional information showed that the individual 
involved in that case was a “de facto employee” performing under color of appointment and 
with a claim of right to the position. A “voluntary” employee has no such “color of 
appointment” or indicia of lawful employment.

Several of the decisions note the requirement for a written record of the 
agreement to serve without compensation. Proper documentation is 
important for evidentiary purposes should a claim subsequently be 
attempted. E.g., 27 Comp. Gen. at 195; 26 Comp. Gen. 956, 958 (1947); 
27 Comp. Dec. 131, 132–33 (1920); 2 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 322, 323 (1977). 
Specifically, the decisions state that the individuals should acknowledge in 
writing and in advance that they will receive no compensation and that they 
should explicitly waive any and all claims against the government on 
account of their service. 

The rule that compensation fixed by statute may not be waived does not 
apply if the waiver or appointment without compensation is itself 
authorized by statute. The Comptroller General stated the principle as 
follows in 27 Comp. Gen. at 195: 

“[E]ven where the compensation for a particular position is 
fixed by or pursuant to law, the occupant of the position 
may waive his ordinary right to the compensation fixed for 
the position and thereafter forever be estopped from 
claiming and receiving the salary previously waived, if there 
be some applicable provision of law authorizing the 
acceptance of services without compensation.” (Emphasis 
in original.) 

As noted above, the decision in 27 Comp. Gen. 194 cited as the provision 
authorizing the acceptance of services without compensation in that case 
what is now section 3109(b) of title 5, United States Code. Under 
section 3109(b), agencies may, when authorized by an appropriation or 
other act, procure the services of experts or consultants for up to 1 year 
without regard to other provisions of title 5 governing appointment and 
compensation. This authority is subject to a maximum rate of 
compensation in some cases, but there is no minimum rate. 

In B-139261, June 26, 1959, GAO reiterated the above principle, and gave 
several additional examples of statutes sufficient for this purpose. The 
examples included the following statutory provisions that remain 
essentially the same in substance as they were in 1959: 

• section 204(b) of title 29, United States Code, which authorizes the 
Administrator of the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division to 
utilize voluntary and uncompensated services; 
Page 6-100 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

• section 401(7) of title 39, United States Code, which authorizes the 
Postal Service to accept gifts or donations of services or property; and 
• section 210(b) of title 47, United States Code, which states that no 
provision of law shall be construed to prohibit common carriers from 
rendering free service to any agency of the government in connection 
with preparation for the national defense, subject to rules prescribed by 
the Federal Communications Commission. 
At this point a 1978 case, 57 Comp. Gen. 423, should be noted. The decision 
held that a statute authorizing the Agency for International Development 
(AID) to accept gifts of “services of any kind” (22 U.S.C. § 2395(d)) did not 
permit waiver of salary by AID employees whose compensation was fixed 
by statute. Section 2395(d) is very similar to one of the examples given in 
B-139261, June 26, 1959, discussed above, of statutes that would authorize 
the acceptance of voluntary services. See 39 U.S.C. § 401(7). However, 
57 Comp. Gen. 423 is distinguishable from B-139261, 27 Comp. Gen. 194, 
and the other voluntary services cases discussed previously. The question 
in 57 Comp. Gen. 423 was whether AID could invoke its gift-acceptance 
authority to justify paying regular federal employees less than the salaries 
prescribed by law. The decision held that it did not: 

“Section 2395(d) . . . authorizes the acceptance of gifts. 
Therefore, AID may accept services from private sources 
either gratuitously or at a fraction of their value. However, 
section 2395(d) does not authorize individuals to be 
appointed to regular positions having compensation rates 
fixed by or pursuant to statute at rates less than those 
specified. It, therefore, differs from the statute, which was 
the subject of 27 Comp. Gen. 194, supra, and accordingly is 
not a provision of law authorizing employees whose 
compensation is fixed by or pursuant to statute to waive any 
part of such compensation.” 

57 Comp. Gen. at 424–25.99 

99 Further support for the decision’s conclusion that 22 U.S.C. § 2395(d) was addressed to 
services from private sources rather than federal employees can be found in the 
immediately preceding subsection, which states: “It is the sense of Congress that the 
President, in furthering the purposes of this [chapter], shall use to the maximum extent 
practicable the services and facilities of voluntary, nonprofit organizations registered with, 
and approved by, the Agency for International Development.” 22 U.S.C. § 2395(c).

As noted earlier, 27 Comp. Gen. 194 concerned temporary experts or 
consultants. B-139261 concerned civilian volunteers who sought to provide 
services for an Air Force reserve center. Likewise, the other statutory 
examples cited in B-139261 clearly were aimed at individuals other than 
regular federal employees. Thus, 57 Comp. Gen. 423 appears to represent 
the sensible caveat that general statutory authorities to accept voluntary 
services or “gifts” of services do not supersede statutes providing for the 
compensation of federal employees and cannot be invoked to avoid the 
consequences of those statutes. 

The rules for waiver of salary or appointment without compensation may 
be summarized as follows: 

• If compensation is not fixed by statute, that is, if it is fixed 
administratively or if the statute merely prescribes a maximum but no 
minimum, it may be waived as long as the waiver qualifies as 
“gratuitous.” There should be an advance written agreement waiving 
all claims. 
• If compensation is fixed by statute, it may not be waived, the voluntary 
versus gratuitous distinction notwithstanding, without specific 
statutory authority. This authority generally may take the form of 
authority to accept donations of services or to employ persons without 
compensation. 
• If the employing agency has statutory authority to accept gifts, the 
employee can accept the compensation and return it to the agency as a 
gift. Even if the agency has no such authority, the employee can still 
accept the compensation and donate it to the United States Treasury. 
(2) Student interns 
In 26 Comp. Gen. 956 (1947), the then Civil Service Commission asked 
whether an agency could accept the uncompensated services of college 
students as part of a college’s internship program. The students “would be 
assigned to productive work, that is, to the regular work of the agency in a 
position which would ordinarily fall in the competitive civil service.” The 
answer was no. Since the students would be used in positions the 
compensation for which was fixed by law, and since compensation fixed by 
law cannot be waived, the proposal would require legislative authority.

Thirty years later, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel 
considered another internship program and provided similar advice. 
Without statutory authority, uncompensated student services that 
furthered the agency’s mission, that is, “productive work,” could not be 
accepted. 2 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 185 (1978). 

In view of the long-standing rule, supported by decisions of the Supreme 
Court,100 prohibiting the waiver of compensation for positions required by 
law to be salaried, GAO and Justice had little choice but to respond as they 
did. Clearly, however, this answer had its downside. It meant that 
uncompensated student interns could be used only for essentially “makework” 
tasks, a benefit to neither the students nor the agencies. 

The solution, apparent from both cases, was legislative authority, which 
Congress provided later in 1978 by the enactment of 5 U.S.C. § 3111. The 
statute authorizes agencies, subject to regulations of the Office of 
Personnel Management, to accept the uncompensated services of high 
school and college students, “[n]otwithstanding section 1342 of title 31,” if 
the services are part of an agency program designed to provide educational 
experience for the student, if the student’s educational institution gives 
permission, and if the services will not be used to displace any employee. 
5 U.S.C. § 3111(b). 

A paper entitled A Part-Time Clerkship Program in Federal Courts for 
Law Students by the Honorable Jack B. Weinstein and William B. 
Bonvillian, written in 1975 and printed at 68 F.R.D. 265, considered the use 
of law students as part-time law clerks, without pay, to mostly supplement 
the work of the regular law clerks in furtherance of the official duties of the 
courts. Based on the statute’s legislative history and 30 Op. Att’y Gen. 51 
(1913), previously discussed, Judge Weinstein concluded that the program 
did not violate the Antideficiency Act. Although this aspect of the issue is 
not explicitly discussed in the paper, it appears that the compensation of 
regular law clerks is fixed administratively. See 28 U.S.C. § 604(a)(5). In 
any event, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts was given 
authority in 1978 to “accept and utilize voluntary and incompensated 
(gratuitous) services.” 28 U.S.C. § 604(a)(17).

(3) Program beneficiaries 
Programs are enacted from time to time to provide job training assistance 
to various classes of individuals. The training is intended, among other 
things, to enable participants to enter the labor market at a higher level of 
skill. Questions have arisen under programs of this nature as to the 
authority of federal agencies to serve as employers. 

A 1944 case, 24 Comp. Gen. 314, considered a vocational rehabilitation 
program for disabled war veterans. GAO concluded that 31 U.S.C. § 1342 
did not preclude federal agencies from providing on-the-job training, 
without payment of salary, to program participants. The decision is further 
discussed in 26 Comp. Gen. 956, 959 (1947). 

In 51 Comp. Gen. 152 (1971), GAO concluded that 31 U.S.C. § 1342 
precluded federal agencies from accepting work by persons hired by local 
governments for public service employment under the Emergency 
Employment Act of 1971.101 Four years later, GAO modified the 1971 
decision, holding that a federal agency could provide work without 
payment of compensation to (i.e., accept the free services of) trainees 
sponsored and paid by nonfederal organizations from federal grant funds 
under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973.102 
54 Comp. Gen. 560 (1975). The decision stated: 

“[C]onsidering that the services in question will arise out of 
a program initiated by the Federal Government, it would be 
anomalous to conclude that such services are proscribed as 
being voluntary within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. § [1342]. 
That is to say, it is our opinion that the utilization of 
enrollees or trainees by a Federal agency under the 
circumstances here involved need not be considered the 
acceptance of ‘voluntary services’ within the meaning of 
that phrase as used in 31 U.S.C. § [1342].”

Chapter 6

In B-211079.2, Jan. 2, 1987, the relevant program legislation expressly 
authorized program participants to perform work for federal agencies 
“notwithstanding section 1342 of title 31.” The decision suggests that the 
statutory authority was necessary not because of the Antideficiency Act 
but to avoid an impermissible augmentation of appropriations. It is in any 
event consistent in result with 24 Comp. Gen. 314 and 54 Comp. Gen. 560. 
The relationship between voluntary service and the augmentation concept 
is explored later in this chapter in our discussion of augmentation of 
appropriations. 

(4) Applicability to legislative and judicial branches 
The applicability of 31 U.S.C. § 1342 to the legislative and judicial branches 
of the federal government does not appear to have been seriously 
questioned. 

The salary of a Member of Congress is fixed by statute and therefore 
cannot be waived without specific statutory authority. B-159835, Apr. 22, 
1975; B-123424, Mar. 7, 1975; B-123424, Apr. 15, 1955; A-8427, Mar. 19, 1925; 
B-206396.2, Nov. 15, 1988 (nondecision letter). However, as each of these 
cases points out, nothing prevents a Senator or Representative from 
accepting the salary and then, as several have done, donate part or all of it 
back to the United States Treasury. 

In 1977, GAO was asked by a congressional committee chairman whether 
section 1342 applies to Members of Congress who use volunteers to 
perform official office functions. GAO responded, first, that section 1342 
seems clearly to apply to the legislative branch. GAO then summarized the 
rules for appointment without compensation and advised that, to the 
extent that a particular employee’s salary could be fixed administratively 
by the Member in any amount he or she chooses to set, that employee’s 
salary could be fixed at zero. This once again was essentially an 
application of the rules set down decades earlier in 30 Op. Att’y Gen. 51 
(1913) and 27 Comp. Dec. 131 (1920). See also B-69907, Feb. 11, 1977. 

The salary of a federal judge is also “fixed by law”—even more so because 
of the constitutional prohibition against diminishing the compensation of a 
federal judge while in office. U.S. Const. art III, § 1. A case applying the 
standard “no waiver” rules to a federal judge is B-157469, July 24, 1974. 

Before entering the mainstream of the modern case law, two very early 
decisions should be noted. In 12 Comp. Dec. 244 (1905), the Comptroller of 

Page 6-105 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

the Treasury held that an offer by a meat-packing firm to pay the salaries of 
Department of Agriculture employees to conduct a pre-export pork 
inspection could not be accepted because of the voluntary services 
prohibition.103 Similar cases have since come up, but they have been 
decided under the augmentation theory without reference to 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1342. See 59 Comp. Gen. 294 (1980) and 2 Comp. Gen. 775 (1923), 
discussed later in section E of this chapter. 

To restate, apart from the 1905 decision, which has not been followed 
since, the voluntary services prohibition has not been applied to donations 
of money. In another 1905 decision, a vendor asked permission to install an 
appliance on Navy property for trial purposes at no expense to the 
government. Presumably, if the Navy liked the appliance, it would then buy 
it. The Comptroller of the Treasury pointed out an easily overlooked 
phrase in the voluntary service prohibition—the services that are 
prohibited are voluntary services “for the United States.” Here, temporary 
installation by the vendor for trial purposes amounted to service for his 
own benefit and on his own behalf, “as an incident to or necessary 
concomitant of a proper exhibition of his appliance for sale.” Therefore, 
the Navy could grant permission without violating the Antideficiency Act as 
long as the vendor agreed to remove the appliance at his own expense if the 
Navy chose not to buy it. 11 Comp. Dec. 622 (1905). This case has not been 
cited since. 

For the most part, the subsequent cases have been resolved by applying the 
“voluntary versus gratuitous” distinction first enunciated by the Attorney 
General in 1913 in 30 Op. Att’y Gen. 51, discussed above. The underlying 
philosophy is perhaps best conveyed in the following statement by the 
Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel: 

“Although the interpretation of § [1342] has not been 
entirely consistent over the years, the weight of authority 
does support the view that the section was intended to 
eliminate subsequent claims against the United States for 
compensation of the ‘volunteer,’ rather than to deprive the 
government of the benefit of truly gratuitous services.” 

103 It would now also contravene 18 U.S.C. § 209, which prohibits payment of salaries of 
government employees from nongovernmental sources. This statute did not exist at the 
time of the 1905 decision.

6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 160, 162 (1982). 

In an early formulation that has often been quoted since, the Comptroller 
General noted that: 

“The voluntary service referred to in [31 U.S.C. § 1342] is not 
necessarily synonymous with gratuitous service, but 
contemplates service furnished on the initiative of the party 
rendering the same without request from, or agreement 
with, the United States therefor. Services furnished 
pursuant to a formal contract are not voluntary within the 
meaning of said section.” 

7 Comp. Gen. 810, 811 (1928). 

In 7 Comp. Gen. 810, a contractor had agreed to prepare stenographic 
transcripts of Federal Trade Commission public proceedings and to furnish 
copies to the Commission without cost, in exchange for the exclusive right 
to report the proceedings and to sell transcripts to the public. The decision 
noted that consideration under a contract does not have to be monetary 
consideration, and held that the contract in question was supported by 
sufficient legal consideration. While the case is thus arguably not a true 
“voluntary services” case, it has often been cited since, not so much for the 
actual holding but for the above-quoted statement of the rule. 

For example, in B-13378, Nov. 20, 1940, the Comptroller General held that 
the Secretary of Commerce could accept gratuitous services from a private 
agency, created by various social science associations, which had offered 
to assist in the preparation of official monographs analyzing census data. 
The services were to be rendered under a cooperative agreement which 
specified that they would be free of cost to the government. The 
Commerce Department agreed to furnish space and equipment, but the 
monographs would not otherwise have been prepared. 

Applying the same approach, GAO found no violation of 31 U.S.C. § 1342 
for the Commerce Department to accept services by the Business Advisory 
Council, which were agreed in advance to be gratuitous. B-125406, Nov. 4, 
1955. Likewise, the Commission on Federal Paperwork could accept free 
services from the private sector as long as they were agreed in advance to 
be gratuitous. B-182087-O.M., Nov. 26, 1975. 

Page 6-107 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

In a 1982 decision, the American Association of Retired Persons wanted to 
volunteer services to assist in crime prevention activities (distribute 
literature, give lectures, etc.) on Army installations. GAO found no 
Antideficiency Act problem as long as the services were agreed in advance, 
and so documented, as gratuitous. B-204326, July 26, 1982. 

In B-177836, Apr. 24, 1973, the Army had entered into a contract with a 
landowner under which it acquired the right to remove trees and other 
shrubs from portions of the landowner’s property incident to an easement. 
A subsequent purchaser of the property complained that some tree stumps 
had not been removed, and the Army proceeded to contract to have the 
work done. The landowner then submitted a claim for certain costs he had 
incurred incident to some preliminary work he had done prior to the 
Army’s contract. Since the landowner’s actions had been purely voluntary 
and had been taken without the knowledge or consent of the government, 
31 U.S.C. § 1342 prohibited payment. 

In 7 Comp. Gen. 167 (1927), a customs official had stored, in his own 
private boathouse, a boat which had been seized for smuggling whiskey. 
The customs official later filed a claim for storage charges. Noting that “the 
United States did not expressly or impliedly request the use of the premises 
and therefore did not by implication promise to pay therefor,” GAO 
concluded that the storage had been purely a voluntary service, payment 
for which would violate 31 U.S.C. § 1342. 

As if to prove the adage that there is nothing new under the sun, GAO 
considered another storage case over 50 years later, B-194294, July 12, 
1979. There, an Agriculture Department employee had an accident while 
driving a government-owned vehicle assigned to him for his work. A 
Department official ordered the damaged vehicle towed to the employee’s 
driveway, to be held there until it could be sold. Since the government did 
have a role in the employee’s assumption of responsibility for the wreck, 
GAO found no violation of 31 U.S.C. § 1342 and allowed the employee’s 
claim for reasonable storage charges on a quantum meruit basis.104 

Section 1342 covers any type of service which has the effect of creating a 
legal or moral obligation to pay the person rendering the service. Naturally, 
this includes government contractors. See PCL Construction Services, 

104 See generally Chapter 12, section C.2.b in volume III of the second edition of Principles 
of Federal Appropriations Law.

Inc. v. United States, 41 Fed. Cl. 242, 257–260 (1998), quoting with approval 
from the second edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations Law on 
this point. The prohibition includes arrangements in which government 
contracting officers solicit or permit—tacitly or otherwise—a contractor to 
continue performance on a “temporarily unfunded” basis while the agency, 
which has exhausted its appropriations and cannot pay the contractor 
immediately, seeks additional appropriations. This was one of the options 
considered in 55 Comp. Gen. 768 (1976), discussed previously in 
connection with 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a). The Army proposed a contract 
modification which would explicitly recognize the government’s obligation 
to pay for any work performed under the contract, possibly including 
reasonable interest, subject to subsequent availability of funds. The 
government would use its best efforts to obtain a deficiency appropriation. 
Certificates to this effect would be issued to the contractor, including a 
statement that any additional work performed would be done at the 
contractor’s own risk. In return, the contractor would be asked to defer 
any action for breach of contract. 

GAO found this proposal “of dubious validity at best.” Although the 
certificate given to the contractor would say that continued performance 
was at the contractor’s own risk, it was clear that both parties expected the 
contract to continue. The government expected to accept the benefits of 
the contractor’s performance and the contractor expected to be paid— 
eventually—for it. This is certainly not an example of a clear written 
understanding that work for the government is to be performed 
gratuitously. Also, the proposal to pay interest was improper as it would 
compound the Antideficiency Act violation. Although 55 Comp. Gen. 768 
does not specifically discuss 31 U.S.C. § 1342, the relationship should be 
apparent. 

GAO’s opinion in B-302811, July 12, 2004, provides a recent example of an 
appropriate “gratuitous services” type contract that did not run afoul of the 
31 U.S.C. § 1342 prohibition against voluntary services. This decision 
concerned the General Services Administration’s (GSA) proposed National 
Brokers Contract, under which GSA would award four real estate brokers 
exclusive rights to represent the United States with respect to all GSA real 
property leases. The brokers would be required to provide a range of 
services commonly offered in commercial leasing transactions such as 
assisting federal agencies in developing their space requirements, 
surveying the rental market, and negotiating and preparing leases. The 
proposal took the form of a “no-cost” contract in which GSA would make 
no payments to the brokers for their services. Rather, the brokers would 

Page 6-109 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


d. Exceptions 
Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

collect commissions from the landlords who leased property to the federal 
agencies. In approving the legality of this proposed arrangement, the 
decision observed: 

“Because the contract was constructed as a no cost 
contract, GSA will have no financial liability to brokers, and 
brokers will have no expectation of a payment from GSA. 
The acceptance of services without payment pursuant to a 
valid, binding no-cost contract does not augment an 
agency’s appropriation nor does it violate the voluntary 
services prohibition. Although the brokers contract clearly 
expects that brokers will be remunerated by commissions 
from landlords, as is a common practice in the real estate 
industry, GSA does not require landlords to pay 
commissions. If a landlord were to fail to pay a broker, the 
broker would have no claim against GSA.” 

Id. at 7.105 

Two kinds of exceptions to 31 U.S.C. § 1342 have already been discussed— 
where acceptance of services without compensation is specifically 
authorized by law, and where the government and the volunteer have a 
written agreement that the services are to be rendered gratuitously with no 
expectation of future payment. 

There is a third exception, written into the statute itself: “emergencies 
involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.” The cases 
dealing with this statutory exception have arisen in a variety of contexts 
and are discussed below, along with recent developments. 

105 The July 12, 2004, opinion clarified an earlier opinion on the subject of the National 
Brokers Contract, B-291947, Aug. 15, 2003. Also, it distinguished another opinion, B-300248, 
Jan. 15, 2004, which held that the Small Business Administration improperly augmented its 
appropriations by requiring certain lenders to pay fees to an agency contractor. See 
section E.2.a of this chapter for a detailed discussion of the Small Business Administration 
opinion and how it compares with the GSA opinion. 

Page 6-110 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

(1) Safety of human life 
In order to invoke this exception, the services provided to protect human 
life must have been rendered in a true emergency situation. What 
constitutes an emergency was discussed in several early decisions. 

In 12 Comp. Dec. 155 (1905), a municipal health officer disinfected several 
government buildings to prevent the further spread of diphtheria. Several 
cases of diphtheria had already occurred at the government compound, 
including four that resulted in deaths. The Comptroller of the Treasury 
found that the services had been rendered in an emergency involving the 
loss of human life, and held accordingly that the doctor could be 
reimbursed for the cost of materials used and the fair value of his services. 

In another case, the S.S. Rexmore, a British vessel, deviated from its course 
to London to answer a call for help from an Army transport ship carrying 
over 1,000 troops. The ship had sprung a leak and appeared to be in danger 
of sinking. The Comptroller General allowed a claim for the vessel’s actual 
operating costs plus lost profits attributable to the services performed. The 
Rexmore had rendered a tangible service to save the lives of the people 
aboard the Army transport, as well as the transport vessel itself. 2 Comp. 
Gen. 799 (1923). 

On the other hand, GAO denied payment to a man who was boating in the 
Florida Keys and saw a Navy seaplane make a forced landing. He offered 
to tow the aircraft over two miles to the nearest island, and did so. His 
claim for expenses was denied. The aircraft had landed intact and the pilot 
was in no immediate danger. Rendering service to overcome mere 
inconvenience or even to avoid a potential future emergency is not enough 
to overcome the statutory prohibition. 10 Comp. Gen. 248 (1930). 

(2) Protection of property 
The main thing to remember here is that the property must be either 
government-owned property or property for which the government has 
some responsibility. The standard was established by the Comptroller of 
the Treasury in 9 Comp. Dec. 182, 185 (1902) as follows: 

“I think it is clear that the statute does not contemplate 
property in which the Government has no immediate 
interest or concern; but I do not think it was intended to 
apply exclusively to property owned by the Government. 

Page 6-111 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

The term ‘property’ is used in the statute without any 
qualifying words, but it is used in connection with the 
rendition of services for the Government. The implication 
is, therefore, clear that the property in contemplation is 
property in which the Government has an immediate 
interest or in connection with which it has some duty to 
perform.” 

In the cited decision, an individual had gathered up mail scattered in a train 
wreck and delivered it to a nearby town. The government did not “own” 
the mail but had a responsibility to deliver it. Therefore, the services came 
within the statutory exception and the individual could be paid for the 
value of his services. 

Applying the approach of 9 Comp. Dec. 182, the Comptroller General held 
in B-152554, Feb. 24, 1975, that section 1342 did not permit the Agency for 
International Development to make expenditures in excess of available 
funds for disaster relief in foreign countries. A case clearly within the 
exception is 3 Comp. Gen. 979 (1924), allowing reimbursement to a 
municipality which had rendered firefighting assistance to prevent the 
destruction of federal property where the federal property was not within 
the territory for which the municipal fire department was responsible. 

An exception was also recognized in 53 Comp. Gen. 71 (1973), where a 
government employee brought in food for other government employees in 
circumstances which would justify a determination that the expenditure 
was incidental to the protection of government property in an extreme 
emergency. In this case, the General Services Administration had to 
assemble and maintain for 5 days a cadre of approximately 175 special 
police in connection with the unauthorized occupation of a Bureau of 
Indian Affairs building. The police officers were required to perform tours 
of duty that sometimes extended to 24 hours. They were kept at the ready 
to reoccupy the building and they were not permitted to leave the 
marshalling area because of the imminence of court orders and 
administrative directives. 

(3) Recent developments 
During the past two decades, cases addressing the “emergencies involving 
the safety of human life or the protection of property” exception to 
31 U.S.C. § 1342 have arisen primarily in the context of “funding gaps” 
where an agency is faced with an appropriations lapse (or potential lapse) 

Page 6-112 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

usually at the outset of a fiscal year. These cases are discussed in detail in 
section C.6 of this chapter. However, several points from that discussion 
are also relevant here. Most notably, in 1990, Congress amended 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1342 by adding the following language: 

“As used in this section, the term ‘emergencies involving the 
safety of human life or the protection of property’ does not 
include ongoing, regular functions of government the 
suspension of which would not imminently threaten the 
safety of human life or the protection of property.”106 

Two recent GAO decisions have considered the emergency exception to 
31 U.S.C. § 1342 (including its 1990 amendment) in a context other than a 
funding gap. The question in B-262069, Aug. 1, 1995, was whether the 
District of Columbia could exceed its appropriation for certain programs, 
including Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Medicaid, without 
violating the Antideficiency Act. The main issue in that decision was 
whether the “unless authorized by law exception” to the Antideficiency Act 
in 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1)(A) applied. GAO held that it did not. The decision 
also noted the existence of the emergencies exception to 31 U.S.C. § 1342, 
but held that it was likewise inapplicable: 

“An ‘emergency’ under section 1342 ‘does not include 
ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of 
which would not imminently threaten the safety of human 
life or the protection of property.’ We are not presently 
aware of any facts or circumstances that would make this 
limited exception available to the District. See, 5 Op. 
O.L.C. 1, 7–11 (1981).” 

B-262069 at 3, fn. 1. 

The decision in B-262069 addressed a hypothetical situation; the District 
had not actually exceeded its appropriation there. Unfortunately, a 
subsequent opinion, B-285725, Sept. 29, 2000, involved the real thing. In 
that case, the District of Columbia Health and Hospitals Public Benefit 
Corporation (PBC) had incurred obligations and made payments in excess 

106 As explained in section C.6, this amendment was intended to guard against what might 
have been viewed as an overly broad application of one of the Attorney General’s funding 
gap opinions. 

Page 6-113 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

of its appropriations. The PBC maintained that the emergency exception to 
31 U.S.C. § 1342 as construed by the Attorney General applied; thus, there 
was no violation. GAO disagreed: 

“The funding gap situations discussed by the Attorney 
General arise typically at the beginning of a fiscal year 
because of the absence or expiration of budget authority 
under circumstances that are beyond an agency’s control. 
In the present situation, the exhaustion of appropriations 
occurred during the fiscal year because of a rate of 
operations and obligations in excess of available resources. 
Viewed in this light, PBC’s failure to regulate its activities 
and spending so as to operate within its available budget 
resources is not the type of ‘emergency’ covered either by 
the Attorney General’s earlier opinions or 31 U.S.C. § 1342.” 

B-285725, Enclosure at 9. 

The opinion acknowledged that PBC’s ongoing functions of operating a 
hospital and clinics involved the provision of services essential to the 
protection of human life. However, the opinion observed that PBC, like 
many federal agencies engaged in protecting human life and safety, 
requested and received appropriations to cover these functions. It added: 

“Once the Congress enacts appropriation[s], it is incumbent 
on the PBC (and similarly situated federal agencies) to 
manage its resources to stay within the authorized level. 
Nothing in the District’s Submission demonstrates that the 
PBC’s exhaustion of appropriations prior to the end of the 
fiscal year was caused by some unanticipated event or 
events (e.g., mass injuries resulting from hurricane, flood or 
other natural disasters) requiring PBC to provide services 
for the protection of life beyond the level it should have 
reasonably been expected to anticipate when it prepared its 
budget.” 

Id. By way of summary, the opinion observed: 

“While the failure of Congress to enact appropriations at the 
beginning of the fiscal year may qualify as an emergency 
event for purposes of section 1342, it would be a novel

proposition, one that we are unwilling to endorse, to 
conclude that an agency’s failure to manage and live within 
the resources provided for an activity involved in protecting 
human life permits it to incur obligations in excess of 
amounts provided. Nothing that we have been provided 
warrants the conclusion that the overobligations resulted 
from an unanticipated emergency rather than from the 
PBC’s failure to manage and live within its budgetary 
resources during the fiscal year.”107 

B-285725 at 3. 

In essence, B-285725 held that the emergencies exception to 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1342 does not apply where an agency exceeds its appropriations—at least 
absent events beyond the agency’s control that the agency (and presumably 
the Congress) could not have foreseen in determining the agency’s funding 
levels. 

In two opinions to the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in 1999 and 
2000, the Office of Legal Counsel addressed a potential exhaustion of 
USMS appropriations, which never materialized: Memorandum Opinion 
for the General Counsel, United States Marshals Service, USMS Obligation 
To Take Steps To Avoid Anticipated Appropriations Deficiency, OLC 
Opinion, May 11, 1999, and Memorandum Opinion for the General Counsel, 
United States Marshals Service, Continuation of Federal Prisoner 
Detention Efforts in the Face of a USMS Appropriations Deficiency, OLC 
Opinion, Apr. 5, 2000. The opinions dealt with a potential exhaustion of 
appropriations for USMS prisoner-detention functions, but did not describe 
the circumstances giving rise to the potential exhaustion. While these 
opinions recognized the “affirmative obligation” on the part of agencies to 
manage available appropriations in order to avoid deficiencies, they did not 
address the important distinction between an exhaustion of appropriations 
(or funding gap) resulting from unforeseen circumstances and an 
exhaustion of appropriations resulting from the agency’s failure to manage 
its operations within the limits of enacted appropriations. We would 
disagree with the Office of Legal Counsel opinions to the extent they could 
be read to suggest that regardless of the reasons for the exhaustion of 

107 Finally, the opinion noted that, even if the exception to section 1342 applied, it would not 
sanction the agency’s actual disbursement of funds in excess of its appropriations. Thus, 
the agency violated the Antideficiency Act in any event.

appropriations, whenever an agency like USMS, whose statutory mission 
involves the protection of life and property, runs out of money, it has openended 
authority to continue to incur obligations under the Antideficiency 
Act’s emergencies exception.108 This is exactly the “coercive deficiency” 
that the Congress legislated against in enacting the Antideficiency Act.109 
See B-285725, Sept. 29, 2000. The Antideficiency Act was intended to keep 
agency operations at a level within the amounts that Congress appropriates 
for that purpose. If an agency concludes that it needs more funds than 
Congress has appropriated for a fiscal year, the agency should ask 
Congress to enact a supplemental appropriation; it should not continue 
operations without regard to the Antideficiency Act. 

A related line of decisions are the so-called “voluntary creditor” cases. A 
voluntary creditor is an individual, government or private, who pays what 
he or she perceives to be a government obligation from personal funds. 
The rule is that the voluntary creditor cannot be reimbursed, although 
there are significant exceptions. For the most part, the decisions have not 
related the voluntary creditor prohibition to the Antideficiency Act, with 
the exception of one very early case (17 Comp. Dec. 353 (1910)) and two 
more recent ones (53 Comp. Gen. 71 (1973) and 42 Comp. Gen. 149 (1962)). 
The voluntary creditor cases are discussed in detail in Chapter 12, 
section C.4.c in volume III of the second edition of Principles of Federal 
Appropriations Law, dealing with claims against the United States. 

4. Apportionment of 
Appropriations 
Because of the apportionment and related provisions of the Antideficiency 
Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 1511–1519, an agency generally does not have the full 
amount of its appropriations available to it at the beginning of the fiscal 
year. Apportionment is an administrative process by which, as its name 
suggests, appropriated funds are distributed to agencies in portions over 
the period of their availability. The Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) apportions funds for executive branch agencies. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1513(b); Exec. Order No. 6166, § 16 (June 10, 1933), at 5 U.S.C. § 901 
note. Appropriations for legislative branch agencies, the judicial branch, 

108 The opinions did acknowledge, of course, that USMS could not actually spend funds if its 
appropriations were exhausted. They also noted that a determination whether particular 
obligations would satisfy the emergencies exception could not be made in the abstract and 
would require case-by-case evaluation. 

109 See section C.2.b of this chapter for a discussion of the “coercive deficiency” concept.

the District of Columbia, and the International Trade Commission are

31 U.S.C. § 1513(a). In addition to apportionment, appropriations are 
subject to further administrative subdivision by the heads of the agencies 
to which the appropriations are made. 31 U.S.C. § 1514. 

Section 1517(a) of title 31 prohibits officers and employees of the federal 
and District of Columbia governments from making or authorizing an 
expenditure or obligation that exceeds an apportionment or the amount 
permitted under certain other subdivisions of appropriated funds. 
Agencies must report violations of section 1517(a) to the Congress and the 
President. Those who violate section 1517(a) are subject to administrative 
discipline as well as criminal penalties in the case of willful violations. 
See 31 U.S.C. §§ 1517(b), 1518, and 1519. 

Subsection (a) of section 1512 establishes the basic requirement for the 
apportionment of appropriations: 

“(a) Except as provided in this subchapter, an 
appropriation available for obligation for a definite period 
shall be apportioned to prevent obligation or expenditure at 
a rate that would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or 
supplemental appropriation for the period. An 
appropriation for an indefinite period and authority to make 
obligations by contract before appropriations shall be 
apportioned to achieve the most effective and economical 
use. An apportionment may be reapportioned under this 
section.” 

Although apportionment was first required legislatively in 1905,110 the 
current form of the statute derives from a revision enacted in 1950 in 
section 1211 of the General Appropriation Act, 1951.111 The 1950 revision 
was part of an overall effort by Congress to amplify and enforce the basic 
restrictions against incurring deficiencies in violation of the Antideficiency 
Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341.

Section 1512(a) requires that all appropriations be administratively 
apportioned so as to ensure their obligation and expenditure at a controlled 
rate which will prevent deficiencies from arising before the end of a fiscal 
year. Although section 1512 does not tell you who is to make the 
apportionment, section 1513 names the President as the apportioning 
official for most executive branch agencies. The President delegated the 
function to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget in 1933,112 and it now 
reposes in the successor to that office, the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB).113 Legislative and judicial branch 
appropriations are apportioned by officials in those branches. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1513(a). 

The term “apportionment” may be defined as follows: 

“The action by which [the apportioning official] distributes 
amounts available for obligation, including budgetary 
reserves established pursuant to law, in an appropriation or 
fund account. An apportionment divides amounts available 
for obligation by specific time periods (usually quarters), 
activities, projects, objects, or a combination thereof. The 
amounts so apportioned limit the amount of obligations that 
may be incurred. An apportionment may be further 
subdivided by an agency into allotments, suballotments, and 
allocations. In apportioning any account, some funds may 
be reserved to provide for contingencies or to effect savings 
made possible pursuant to the Antideficiency Act. Funds 
apportioned to establish a reserve must be proposed for 
deferral or rescission pursuant to the Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. §§ 681–688). 

“The apportionment process is intended to (1) prevent the 
obligation of amounts available within an appropriation or 
fund account in a manner that would require deficiency or 
supplemental appropriations and (2) achieve the most

vested in the former Bureau of the Budget. Executive Order No. 11541, 35 Fed. Reg. 10737 
(July 1, 1970), 31 U.S.C. § 501 note, transferred those functions to the Director of OMB.

effective and economical use of amounts made available for 
obligation.”114 

Apportionment is required not only to prevent the need for deficiency or 
supplemental appropriations, but also to ensure that there is no drastic 
curtailment of the activity for which the appropriation is made. 36 Comp. 
Gen. 699 (1957). See also 38 Comp. Gen. 501 (1959). In other words, the 
apportionment requirement is designed to prevent an agency from 
spending its entire appropriation before the end of the fiscal year and then 
putting Congress in a position in which it must either enact an additional 
appropriation or allow the entire activity to come to a halt. 64 Comp. 
Gen. 728, 735 (1985). See also Memorandum Opinion for the General 
Counsel, United States Marshals Service, USMS Obligation To Take Steps 
To Avoid Anticipated Appropriations Deficiency, OLC Opinion, May 11, 
1999 (opining that 31 U.S.C. § 1512(a) imposes “an affirmative obligation” 
on federal agencies to take steps to use their available funds in a way that 
will avoid the need for a deficiency or supplemental appropriations, citing 
64 Comp. Gen. 728 and 36 Comp. Gen. 699). 

In 36 Comp. Gen. 699, Post Office funds had been reapportioned in such a 
way that the fourth quarter funds were substantially less than those for the 
third quarter. The Comptroller General stated: 

“A drastic curtailment toward the close of a fiscal year of 
operations carried on under a fiscal year appropriation is a 
prima facie indication of a failure to so apportion an 
appropriation ‘as to prevent obligation or expenditure 
thereof in a manner which would indicate a necessity for 
deficiency or supplemental appropriations for such period.’ 
In our view, this is the very situation the amendment of the 
law in 1950 was intended to remedy.” 

36 Comp. Gen. at 703. See also 64 Comp. Gen. 728, 735–36 (1985). 
However, the mere fact that an agency faces a severe lack of funds and 
needs to curtail services late in a fiscal year does not necessarily mean that 
the apportioning authority has violated 31 U.S.C. § 1512(a). Programmatic

factors that could not reasonably be foreseen at the time of an 
apportionment or reapportionment may affect the pattern or pace of 
spending over the course of the year. Also, as discussed hereafter in 
section C.4.e, the statute itself permits apportionments indicating the need 
for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation in certain limited 
circumstances. 

A 1979 decision involved the Department of Agriculture’s Food Stamp 
Program. The program was subject to certain spending ceilings which it 
seemed certain, given the rate at which the Department was incurring 
expenditures, that the Department was going to exceed. The Department 
feared that, if it was bound by a formula in a different section of its 
authorizing act to pay the mandated amount to each eligible recipient, it 
would have to stop the whole program when the funds were exhausted. 
Based on both the Antideficiency Act and the program legislation, GAO 
concluded that there had to be an immediate pro rata reduction for all 
participants. Discontinuance of the program when the funds ran out would 
violate the purpose of the apportionment requirement. A-51604, Mar. 28, 
1979. 

This is not to say that every subactivity or project must be carried out for 
the full fiscal year, on a reduced basis, if necessary. Section 1512(a) applies 
to amounts made available in an appropriation or fund. Where, for 
example, the then Veterans Administration (VA) nursing home program 
was funded from moneys made available in a general, lump-sum VA 
medical care appropriation, the agency was free to discontinue the nursing 
home program and reprogram the balance of its funds to other programs 
also funded under that heading. B-167656, June 18, 1971. (The result would 
be different if the nursing home program had received a line-item 
appropriation.) 

The general rule against apportionments that indicate the need for a 
deficiency or supplemental appropriation does not preclude an agency 
from requesting an apportionment of all or most of its existing 
appropriations at the same time that it is seeking a supplemental so long as 
the agency has in place a plan that would enable it to function through the 
end of the fiscal year should Congress not enact the supplemental. 
64 Comp. Gen. 728, 735 (1985). See also B-255529, Jan. 10, 1994. In 
64 Comp. Gen. 728, the former Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) 
had requested an apportionment of the full annual amount available to it 
under a continuing resolution at the outset of fiscal year 1985. At the same 
time, the ICC voted to seek a supplemental appropriation in order to avoid 

Page 6-120 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

severe staffing cuts that would have been required without it. The 
Comptroller General held that the apportionment was not improper: 

“As we have indicated, at the recommendation of its 
Managing Director the ICC adopted an operating plan for 
fiscal year 1985 which included a request for a supplemental 
appropriation. However, part of that operating plan was an 
emergency plan which would enable the ICC to operate for 
the entire fiscal year even without a supplemental. Under 
the plan, if the Congress did not enact a supplemental 
appropriation by the end of March, the Commission was to 
furlough all its employees for 1 day per week for the 
remainder of the year. This would allow the Commission to 
operate through the end of the fiscal year within the 
$48 million already appropriated. In fact a supplemental 
was not passed by the end of March and the furlough was 
implemented. . . . 

“[T]he actions taken by the ICC . . . demonstrate that from 
the time at which the Congress and the President approved 
legislation reducing ICC’s funding below the requested level, 
every decision related to expenditures was made to avoid 
violation of the Antideficiency Act.” 

64 Comp. Gen. at 735. 

The requirement to apportion applies not only to 1-year appropriations and 
other appropriations limited to a fixed period of time, but also to “no-year” 
money and even to contract authority (authority to contract in advance of 
appropriations). 31 U.S.C. §§ 1511(a), 1512(a). In the case of indefinite 
appropriations and contract authority, the requirement states only that the 
apportionment is to be made in such a way as “to achieve the most effective 
and economical use” of the budget authority. Id. § 1512(a). 

Prior to the 1982 recodification of title 31 of the United States Code, the 
apportionment requirement applied explicitly to government corporations 
which are instrumentalities of the United States.115 While the applicability 
of the requirement has not changed, the recodification dropped the explicit 

115 31 U.S.C. § 665(d)(2) (1976 ed.).

language, viewing it as covered by the broad definition of “executive 
agency” in 31 U.S.C. § 102.116 The authority of some government 
corporations to determine the necessity of their expenditures and the 
manner in which they shall be incurred is not sufficient to exempt a 
corporation from the apportionment requirement. 43 Comp. Gen. 759 
(1964). 

The apportionment process provides a set of administrative controls over 
the use of appropriations in addition to those Congress has imposed 
through the appropriations act itself. The apportionment process cannot 
alter or otherwise affect the operation of statutory requirements 
concerning the availability or use of appropriated funds. In this regard, 
OMB’s guidance on apportionments states: 

“. . . The apportionment of funds should not be used as a 
means of resolving any question dealing with the legality of 
using funds for the purposes for which they are 
appropriated. Any questions as to the legality of using funds 
for a particular purpose must be resolved through legal 
channels.” 

OMB Circ. No. A-11, pt. 4, § 120.17.117 

Furthermore, an apportioning official cannot apportion funds in advance of 
their availability for obligation or expenditure. In B-290600, July 10, 2002, 
OMB had apportioned certain budget authority for loan guarantees to the 
Air Transportation Stabilization Board pursuant to the Board’s request. 
The statute enacting this budget authority had conditioned its availability 
such that the budget authority “shall be available only to the extent that a 
request . . . that includes designation of such amount as an emergency 
requirement . . . is transmitted by the President to Congress.” The 
President had not transmitted this designation at the time of the 
apportionment. Therefore, GAO concluded that OMB and the Board had 
violated the Antideficiency Act. OMB and the Board recognized the 
violation and had already taken steps to avoid a recurrence. 

Section 1512(c) of 31 U.S.C. provides as follows: 

116 See the codification note following 31 U.S.C. § 1511. 
117 Before 2002, OMB’s guidance on apportionments was located in Circular No. A-34.

“(c)(1) In apportioning or reapportioning an appropriation, 
a reserve may be established only— 

“(A) to provide for contingencies; 

“(B) to achieve savings made possible 
by or through changes in requirements 
or greater efficiency of operations; or 

“(C) as specifically provided by law. 

“(2) A reserve established under this subsection may be 
changed as necessary to carry out the scope and objectives 
of the appropriation concerned. When an official 
designated in section 1513 of this title to make 
apportionments decides that an amount reserved will not be 
required to carry out the objectives and scope of the 
appropriation concerned, the official shall recommend the 
rescission of the amount in the way provided in chapter 11 
of this title for appropriation requests. Reserves established 
under this section shall be reported to Congress as provided 
in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 681 et 
seq.).” 

Section 1512(c) seeks to limit the circumstances in which the full 
appropriation is not apportioned or utilized and a reserve fund is 
established. Under this provision, the apportioning official is authorized to 
establish reserves only to provide for contingencies or to effect savings, 
unless the reserve is specifically authorized by statute. 

At one time, this section was a battleground between the executive and 
legislative branches. The executive branch had relied on this portion of the 
Antideficiency Act to impound funds for general fiscal or economic policy 
reasons such as containment of federal spending and executive judgment 
of the relative merits, effectiveness, and desirability of competing federal 
programs (often referred to as “policy impoundments”). See 54 Comp. 
Gen. 453, 458 (1974); B-135564, July 26, 1973. 

Prior to 1974, the predecessor of 31 U.S.C. § 1512(c) contained rather 
expansive language to the effect that a reserve fund could be established 
pursuant to “other developments subsequent to the date on which [the] 
appropriation was made available.” 31 U.S.C. § 665(c)(2) (1970 ed.). 

Page 6-123 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

Despite this expansive language, the Comptroller General’s position had 
been that the authority to establish reserves under the Antideficiency Act 
was limited to providing for contingencies or effecting savings which are in 
furtherance of, or at least consistent with, the purposes of an 
appropriation. B-130515, July 10, 1973. The Comptroller General did not 
interpret the law as authorizing a reserve of funds (i.e., an impoundment) 
based upon general economic, fiscal, or policy considerations that were 
extraneous to the individual appropriation or were in derogation of the 
appropriation’s purpose. B-125187, Sept. 11, 1973; B-130515, July 10, 1973. 
See also State Highway Commission of Missouri v. Volpe, 479 F.2d 1099, 
1118 (8th Cir. 1973), which held that the right to reserve funds in order to 
“effect savings” or due to “subsequent events,” etc., must be considered in 
the context of the applicable appropriation statute. 

The Impoundment Control Act of 1974118 amended section 1512(c) by 
eliminating the “other developments” clause and by prohibiting the 
establishment of appropriation reserves except as provided under the 
Antideficiency Act for contingencies or savings, or as provided in other 
specific statutory authority. The intent was to preclude reliance on 
section 1512(c) as authority for “policy impoundments.” City of New 
Haven v. United States, 809 F.2d 900, 906 (D.C. Cir. 1987); 54 Comp. 
Gen. 453 (1974); B-148898-O.M., Aug. 28, 1974. 

The executive branch, however, continued to defer for policy reasons, 
arguing that section 1013 of the Impoundment Control Act provided 
authority, independent of the Antideficiency Act, to withhold funds from 
obligation temporarily for fiscal policy reasons. GAO agreed that this 
interpretation was consistent with the language of the Impoundment 
Control Act and with the statutory scheme, pointing out that Congress had 
reserved the power under the Impoundment Control Act to disapprove any 
deferral, particularly deferrals for fiscal policy reasons, as a counterweight 
to the President’s power to defer. 54 Comp. Gen. at 455. At that time, the 
Impoundment Control Act provided for disapproval using a one-house 
veto. This counterweight vanished when the Supreme Court held onehouse 
legislative veto provisions unconstitutional. Immigration & 
Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983). Accordingly, in a 
decision issued on January 20, 1987, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia invalidated section 1013, which was the sole general

legislative authority for policy deferrals.119 City of New Haven, 809 F.2d 
at 902, 905–09. In September of 1987, Congress reenacted section 1013(b) 
of the Impoundment Control Act, 2 U.S.C. § 684(b), without the 
unconstitutional legislative veto provision and reiterated that the same 
limits on appropriation reserves that appear in 31 U.S.C. § 1512(c) are the 
sole justifications for deferrals. See Pub. L. No. 100-119, § 206, 101 Stat. 
754, 785 (Sept. 29, 1987). See Chapter 1, section D.3.b for a general 
discussion of impoundments and the Impoundment Control Act. 

The Comptroller General discussed examples of permissible (i.e., 
nonpolicy) reserves in 51 Comp. Gen. 598 (1972) and 51 Comp. Gen. 251 
(1971). The first decision concerned the provisions of a long-term charter 
of several tankers for the Navy. The contract contained options to renew 
the charter for periods of 15 years. In the event that the Navy declined to 
renew the charter short of a full 15-year period, the vessels were to be sold 
by a Board of Trustees, acting for the owners and bondholders. Any 
shortfall in the proceeds over the termination value was to be 
unconditionally guaranteed by the Navy. GAO held that it would not violate 
the Antideficiency Act to cover this contingent liability by setting up a 
reserve. 51 Comp. Gen. 598 (1972). In 51 Comp. Gen. 251 (1971), GAO said 
that it was permissible to provide in regulations for a clause to be inserted 
in future contracts for payment of interest on delayed payments of a 
contractor’s claim. Reserving sufficient funds from the appropriation used 
to support the contract to cover these potential interest costs would 
protect against potential Antideficiency Act violations. 

In 1981, the Community Services Administration established a reserve as a 
cushion against Antideficiency Act violations while the agency was 
terminating its operations. Grantees argued that the reserve improperly 
reduced amounts available for discretionary grants. In Rogers v. United 
States, 14 Cl. Ct. 39, 46–47 (1987), aff’d, 801 F.2d 729 (Fed. Cir. 1988), 
cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1034 (1989), the court held that a reasonable reserve 
for contingencies was properly within the agency’s discretion. 

The remaining portions of 31 U.S.C. § 1512 are subsections (b) and (d), set 
forth below: 

119 The Court concluded that the one-house legislative veto was not severable from the Act’s 
deferral provision, and invalidated that provision as well. Id.

“(b)(1) An appropriation subject to apportionment is 
apportioned by— 

“(A) months, calendar quarters, operating 
seasons, or other time periods; 

“(B) activities, functions, projects, or objects; or 

“(C) a combination of the ways referred to in 
clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph. 

* * * * * 

“(d) An apportionment or reapportionment shall be 
reviewed at least 4 times a year by the official designated in 
section 1513 of this title to make apportionments.” 

Subsection (b) and (d) are largely technical, implementing the basic 
apportionment requirement of 31 U.S.C. § 1512(a). Section 1512(b) makes 
it clear that apportionments need not be made strictly on a monthly, 
quarterly, or other fixed time basis, nor must they be for equal amounts in 
each time period. The apportioning officer is free to take into account the 
“activities, functions, projects, or objects” of the program being funded and 
the usual pattern of spending for such programs in deciding how to 
apportion the funds. Absent some statutory provision to the contrary, 
OMB’s determination is controlling. Thus, in Maryland Department of 
Human Resources v. United States Department of Health & Human 
Services, 854 F.2d 40 (4th Cir. 1988), the court upheld OMB’s quarterly 
apportionment of social services block grant funds, rejecting the state’s 
contention that it should receive its entire annual allotment at the 
beginning of the fiscal year. Section 1512(d) requires a minimum of four 
reviews each year to enable the apportioning officer to make 
reapportionments or other adjustments as necessary. 

Conversely, OMB may decide to apportion all or most of an available 
appropriation at the outset of a fiscal year. In B-255529, Jan. 10, 1994, GAO 
held that OMB’s apportionments at the beginning of the fiscal year of the 
full amounts available for two State Department appropriation 
(“Contributions to International Organizations” and “Contributions for 
International Peacekeeping Activities”) constituted an appropriate exercise 
of OMB’s discretion. Quoting from an earlier opinion, B-152554, Feb. 17,

d. Control of Apportionments 
Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

1972, the decision then observed that the amounts to be apportioned 
depended on the needs of the programs as determined by OMB: 

“It must be recognized that, with respect to a number of 
programs, particularly where grant or other assistance 
funds are involved, a large portion of the funds normally are 
obligated during the early part of the fiscal year. The 
pattern of obligations is much different than where, for 
example, an appropriation is primarily available for salaries 
and administrative expenses. In such case the expenditures 
would be comparatively constant throughout the year. The 
pattern of obligations, however, is primarily an 
administrative matter . . . [for resolution through] the 
apportionment process.” 

The decision pointed out that, according to the State Department, 
payments under the Contributions to International Organizations account 
traditionally were made in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Payments 
under the Peacekeeping account usually occurred as bills were received 
and funds were available, but the Department advised GAO that there was 
a large backlog of bills at the time funds became available, thereby 
justifying immediate apportionment of the entire annual appropriation.120 

Section 1513 of title 31, United States Code, specifies the authorities and 
timetables for making the apportionments or reapportionments of 
appropriations required by section 1512. Section 1513(a) applies to 
appropriations of the legislative and judicial branches of the federal 
government, as well as appropriations of the International Trade 
Commission and the District of Columbia government.121 It assigns 
authority to apportion to the “official having administrative control” of the 

120 The two decisions cited concerned apportionments that OMB made under continuing 
resolutions. As a general matter, the discussion of OMB’s apportionment discretion would 
apply to any appropriation. For a discussion of continuing resolutions, see Chapter 8. 

121 A permanent provision of law included in the 1988 District of Columbia appropriation act 
states that appropriations for the D.C. government “shall not be subject to apportionment 
except to the extent specifically provided by statute.” Pub. L. No. 100-202, § 135, 101 Stat. 
1329, 1329-102 (1987). This provision appears to implicitly repeal 31 U.S.C. § 1513(a) as 
applied to the D.C. government.

appropriation.122 Apportionment must be made 30 days before the start of 
the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made, or within 30 days after 
the enactment of the appropriation, whichever is later. The apportionment 
must be in writing. 

Section 1513(b) deals with apportionments for the executive branch. The 
President is designated as the apportioning authority. As we have seen, the 
function has been delegated to the Director, Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB).123 The Director of OMB has up to 20 days before the start of 
the fiscal year or 30 days after enactment of the appropriation act, 
whichever is later, to make the actual apportionment and notify the agency 
of the action taken. 31 U.S.C. § 1513(b)(2). Again, the apportionments 
must be in writing. Although primary responsibility for a violation of 
section 1512 lies with the Director of OMB, the head of the agency 
concerned also may be found responsible if he or she fails to send the 
Director accurate information on which to base an apportionment. 

In B-163628, Jan. 4, 1974, GAO responded to a question from the chairman 
of a congressional committee about the power of OMB to apportion the 
funds of independent regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC). The Comptroller General agreed with the 
chairman that independent agencies should generally be free from 
executive control or interference. The response then stated: 

“[T]he apportionment power may not lawfully be used as a 
form of executive control or influence over agency 
functions. Rather, it may only be exercised by OMB in the 
manner and for the purposes prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 
§ [1512]—i.e., to prevent obligation or expenditure in a 
manner which would give rise to a need for deficiency or 
supplemental appropriations, to achieve the most effective 
and economical use of appropriations and to establish 
reserves either to provide for contingencies or to effect 
savings which are in furtherance of or at least consistent 
with, the purposes of an appropriation. 

122 Neither section 1513 nor case law defines the phrase “official having administrative 
control.” Consequently, the apportioning official for legislative and judicial appropriations 
is named by the head of the agency to whom the appropriation is made. 

123 See footnote 113, supra, and accompanying text.

“As thus limited, the apportionment process serves a 
necessary purpose—the promotion of economy and 
efficiency in the use of appropriations. . . . 

* * * * * 

“[S]ince a useful purpose is served by OMB’s proper 
exercise of the apportionment power, we do not believe that 
the potential for abuse of the power is sufficient to justify 
removing it from OMB.” 

Thus, the appropriations of independent regulatory agencies like the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are subject to apportionment 
by OMB, but OMB may not lawfully use its apportionment power to 
compromise the independence of those agencies. 

The Impoundment Control Act may permit OMB, in effect, to delay the 
apportionment deadlines prescribed in 31 U.S.C. § 1513(b). For example, 
when the President sends a rescission message to Congress, the budget 
authority proposed to be rescinded may be withheld for up to 45 days 
pending congressional action on a rescission bill. 2 U.S.C. §§ 682(3), 
683(b). In B-115398.33, Aug. 12, 1976, GAO responded to a congressional 
request to review a situation in which an apportionment had been withheld 
for more than 30 days after enactment of the appropriation act. The 
President had planned to submit a rescission message for some of the 
funds but was late in drafting and transmitting his message. If the full 
amount contained in the rescission message could be withheld for the 
entire 45-day period, and Congress ultimately declined to enact the full 
rescission, release of the funds for obligation would occur only a few days 
before the budget authority expired. The Comptroller General suggested 
that, where Congress has completed action on a rescission bill rescinding 
only a part of the amount proposed, OMB should immediately apportion 
the amounts not included in the rescission bill without awaiting the 
expiration of the 45-day period. See also B-115398.33, Mar. 5, 1976. 

In our discussion of the basic requirement for apportionment, we quoted 
31 U.S.C. § 1512(a) to the effect that appropriations must be apportioned 
“to prevent obligation or expenditure at a rate that would indicate a 
necessity for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation.” The 
requirement that appropriations be apportioned so as to avoid the need for 

Page 6-129 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

deficiency or supplemental appropriations is fleshed out in 31 U.S.C. § 1515 
(formerly subsection (e) of the Antideficiency Act): 

“(a) An appropriation required to be apportioned under 
section 1512 of this title may be apportioned on a basis that 
indicates the need for a deficiency or supplemental 
appropriation to the extent necessary to permit payment of 
such pay increases as may be granted pursuant to law to 
civilian officers and employees (including prevailing rate 
employees whose pay is fixed and adjusted under 
subchapter IV of chapter 53 of title 5) and to retired and 
active military personnel. 

“(b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, 
an official may make, and the head of an executive agency 
may request, an apportionment under section 1512 of this 
title that would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or 
supplemental appropriation only when the official or agency 
head decides that the action is required because of— 

“(A) a law enacted after submission to 

Congress of the estimates for an appropriation 

that requires an expenditure beyond 

administrative control; or 

“(B) an emergency involving the safety of 

human life, the protection of property, or the 

immediate welfare of individuals when an 

appropriation that would allow the United States 

Government to pay, or contribute to, amounts 

equired to be paid to individuals in specific 

amounts fixed by law or under formulas 

prescribed by law, is insufficient. 

“(2) If an official making an apportionment decides that an 
apportionment would indicate a necessity for a deficiency 
or supplemental appropriation, the official shall submit 
immediately a detailed report of the facts to Congress. The 
report shall be referred to in submitting a proposed 
deficiency or supplemental appropriation.”

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

Section 1515 thus provides certain exceptions to the requirement of 
section 1512(a) that apportionments be made in such manner as to assure 
that the funds will last throughout the fiscal year and there will be no 
necessity for a deficiency appropriation. Under subsection 1515(a), 
deficiency apportionments are permissible if necessary to pay salary 
increases granted pursuant to law to federal civilian and military personnel. 
Under subsection 1515(b), apportionments can be made in an unbalanced 
manner (e.g., an entire appropriation could be obligated by the end of the 
second quarter) if the apportioning officer determines that (1) a law 
enacted subsequent to the transmission of budget estimates for the 
appropriation requires expenditures beyond administrative control, or 

(2)there is an emergency involving safety of human life, protection of 
property, or immediate welfare of individuals in cases where an 
appropriation for mandatory payments to those individuals is insufficient. 
Prior to 1957, what is now subsection 1515(b) prohibited only the making 
of an apportionment indicating the need for a deficiency or supplemental 
appropriation, so the only person who could violate this subsection was the 
Director of OMB. An amendment in 1957 made it equally a violation for an 
agency to request such an apportionment. See 38 Comp. Gen. 501 (1959). 
The exception in subsection 1515(b)(1)(A) for expenditures “beyond 
administrative control” required by a statute enacted after submission of 
the budget estimate may be illustrated by statutory increases in 
compensation, although many of the cases would now be covered by 
subsection (a). We noted several of the cases in our consideration of when 
an obligation or expenditure is “authorized by law” for purposes of 
31 U.S.C. § 1341.124 Those cases established the rule that a mandatory 
increase is regarded as “authorized by law” so as to permit overobligation, 
whereas a discretionary increase is not. The same rule applies in 
determining when an expenditure is “beyond administrative control” for 
purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 1515(b). Thus, statutory pay increases for Wage 
Board employees granted pursuant to a wage survey meet the test. 
39 Comp. Gen. 422 (1959); 38 Comp. Gen. 538, 542 (1959). See also 
45 Comp. Gen. 584, 587 (1966) (severance pay in fiscal year 1966).125 
Discretionary increases, just as they are not “authorized by law” for 
purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 1341, are not “beyond administrative control” for 

124 See section C.2.g of this chapter. 

125 The law mandating payment of severance pay was enacted after the start of fiscal year 
1966, which is why the expenditures in that case would qualify under 31 U.S.C. § 1515(b).

purposes of section 1515(b). 44 Comp. Gen. 89 (1964) (salary increases to 
Central Intelligence Agency employees); 31 Comp. Gen. 238 (1951) 
(pension increases to retired District of Columbia police and firefighters). 

The Wage Board exception was separately codified in 1957 and now 
appears at 31 U.S.C. § 1515(a), quoted above. Subsection 1515(a) reached 
its present form in 1987 when Congress expanded it to include pay 
increases granted pursuant to law to non-Wage Board civilian officers and 
employees and to retired and active military personnel.126 

The “emergency” exceptions in subsection 1515(b)(1)(B) have not been 
discussed in GAO decisions, although a 1989 internal memorandum 
suggested that the exception would apply to Forest Service appropriations 
for fighting forest fires. B-230117-O.M., Feb. 8, 1989. The exceptions for 
safety of human life and protection of property appear to be patterned after 
identical exceptions in 31 U.S.C. § 1342 (acceptance of voluntary services), 
so the case law under that section would likely be relevant for construing 
the scope of the exceptions under section 1515(b). See 43 Op. Att’y 
Gen. 293, 5 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 1, 9–10 (1981) (“as provisions containing 
the same language, enacted at the same time, and aimed at related 
purposes, the emergency provisions of” sections 1342 and 1515(b)(1)(B) 
“should be deemed in pari materia and given a like construction”); 
Memorandum for the General Counsel, United States Marshals Service, 

Continuation of Federal Prisoner Detention Efforts in the Face of a 
USMS Appropriation Deficiency, OLC Opinion, Apr. 5, 2000 (“we think it 
clear that, if an agency’s functions fall within § 1342’s exception for 
emergency situations, the standard for the ‘emergency’ exception under 
§ [1515(b)(1)(B)] also will be met”). See also Memorandum for the 
Director, Office of Management and Budget, Government Operations in 
the Event of a Lapse in Appropriations, OLC Opinion, Aug. 16, 1995, at 7, 
fn. 6. 

It is less obvious that the converse would necessarily be true—that is, that 
an “emergency” for purposes of subsection 1515(b)(1)(B) automatically 
qualifies as an “emergency” for purposes of section 1342. As we pointed 
out in discussing section 1342, this section was amended in 1990 to add the 
following language: 

126 Pub. L. No. 100-202, § 105, 101 Stat. 1329, 1329-433 (Dec. 22, 1987) (1988 continuing 
resolution).

“As used in this section, the term ‘emergencies involving the 
safety of human life or the protection of property’ does not 
include ongoing, regular functions of government the 
suspension of which would not imminently threaten the 
safety of human life or the protection of property.” 

Such language was not added to subsection 1515(b)(1)(B). Thus, on its 
face, subsection 1515(b)(1)(B) may embody at least a slightly more flexible 
standard of “emergency” than section 1342, although we have found no 
cases addressing this point. 

Importantly, the exceptions in 31 U.S.C. § 1515(b) are exceptions only to 
the prohibition against making or requesting apportionments requiring 
deficiency estimates; they are not exceptions to the basic prohibitions in 
31 U.S.C. § 1341 against obligating or spending in excess or advance of 
appropriations. The point was discussed at some length in B-167034, 
Sept. 1, 1976. Legislation had been proposed in the Senate to repeal 
41 U.S.C. § 11 (the Adequacy of Appropriations Act),127 which prohibits the 
making of a contract, not otherwise authorized by law, unless there is an 
appropriation “adequate to its fulfillment,” except in the case of contracts 
made by a military department for “clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, 
quarters, transportation, or medical and hospital supplies.” The question 
was whether, if 41 U.S.C. § 11 were repealed, the military departments 
would have essentially the same authority under section 1515(b). 

The Defense Department expressed the view that section 1515(b) would 
not be an adequate substitute for the 41 U.S.C. § 11 exception which allows 
the incurring of obligations for limited purposes even though the applicable 
appropriation is insufficient to cover the expenses at the time the 
commitment is made. Defense commented as follows: 

“The authority to apportion funds on a deficiency basis in 
[31 U.S.C. § 1515(b)] does not, as alleged, provide authority 
to incur a deficiency. It merely authorizes obligating funds 
at a deficiency rate under certain circumstances, e.g., a 
$2,000,000 appropriation can be obligated in its entirety at 
the end of the third quarter, but it does not provide authority 
to obligate one dollar more than $2,000,000.”

f. Exemptions from 
Apportionment 
Requirement 
Letter from the Deputy Secretary of Defense to the Chairman, House 
Armed Services Committee, Apr. 2, 1976 (quoted in B-167034, Sept. 1, 1976). 

The Comptroller General agreed with the Deputy Secretary, stating: 

“[Section 1515(b)] in no way authorizes an agency of the 
Government actually to incur obligations in excess of the 
total amount of money appropriated for a period. It only 
provides an exception to the general apportionment rule set 
out in [31 U.S.C. § 1512(a)] that an appropriation be 
allocated so as to insure that it is not exhausted 
prematurely. [Section 1515(b)] says nothing about 
increasing the total amount of the appropriation itself or 
authorizing the incurring of obligations in excess of the total 
amount appropriated. On the contrary, as noted above, 
apportionment only involves the subdivision of 
appropriations already enacted by Congress. It necessarily 
follows that the sum of the parts, as apportioned, could not 
exceed the total amount of the appropriations being 
apportioned. 

“Any deficiency that an agency incurs where obligations 
exceed total amounts appropriated, including a deficiency 
that arises in a situation where it was determined that one of 
the exceptions set forth in [section 1515(b)] was applicable, 
would constitute a violation of 31 U.S.C. § [1341(a)] . . . .” 

B-167034, Sept. 1, 1976. 

A number of exemptions from the apportionment requirement, formerly 
found in subsection (f) of the Antideficiency Act, are now gathered in 
31 U.S.C. § 1516: 

“An official designated in section 1513 of this title to make 
apportionments may exempt from apportionment— 

“(1) a trust fund or working fund if an 
expenditure from the fund has no significant 
effect on the financial operations of the 
United States Government; 

Page 6-134 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

“(2) a working capital fund or a revolving fund 
established for intragovernmental operations; 

“(3) receipts from industrial and power 
operations available under law; and 

“(4) appropriations made specifically for— 

“(A) interest on, or retirement of, 
the public debt; 

“(B) payment of claims, judgments, 
refunds, and drawbacks; 

“(C) items the President decides are 
of a confidential nature; 

“(D) payment under a law requiring 
payment of the total amount of the 
appropriation to a designated payee; 
and 

“(E) grants to the States under the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.).” 

Section 1516 is largely self-explanatory and the various enumerated 
exceptions appear to be readily understood. Note that the statute does not 
make the exemptions mandatory. It merely authorizes them, within the 
discretion of the apportioning authority (OMB). OMB’s implementing 
instructions, OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and 
Execution of the Budget, part 4, § 120 (June 21, 2005), have not adopted all 
of the exemptions permitted under the statute. For example, the Circular’s 
list of funds exempted from apportionment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 1516 
does not include trust funds or intragovernmental revolving funds. See 
OMB Cir. No. A-11, at § 120.7. 

In addition, 10 U.S.C. § 2201(a) authorizes the President to exempt 
appropriations for military functions of the Defense Department from 
apportionment upon determining “such action to be necessary in the 
interest of national defense.”

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

g. Administrative Division of 
Apportionments 
Another exemption, this one mandatory, is contained in 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1511(b)(3): appropriations for “the Senate, the House of Representatives, 
a committee of Congress, a member, officer, employee, or office of either 
House of Congress, or the Office of the Architect of the Capitol or an 
officer or employee of that Office” are exempt from the apportionment 
requirement. The remainder of the legislative branch along with the 
judicial branch are subject to apportionment. See 31 U.S.C. § 1513(a). 

Thus far, we have reviewed the provisions of the Antideficiency Act 
directed at the appropriation level and the apportionment level. The law 
also addresses agency subdivisions. 

The first provision to note is 31 U.S.C. § 1513(d): 

“An appropriation apportioned under this subchapter may 
be divided and subdivided administratively within the limits 
of the apportionment.” 

Thus, administrative subdivisions are expressly authorized. The precise 
pattern of subdivisions will vary based on the nature and scope of activities 
funded under the apportionment and, to some extent, agency preference. 
The levels of subdivision below the apportionment level are, in descending 
order, allotment, suballotment, and allocation. See OMB Circular No. A-11, 
Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, § 20.3 (June 21, 
2005), which notes under its definition of apportionment: “An 
apportionment may be further subdivided by an agency into allotments, 
suballotments, and allocations.” As we will see later in our discussion of 
31 U.S.C. § 1517(a), there are definite Antideficiency Act implications 
flowing from how an agency structures its fund control system. 

The next relevant statute is 31 U.S.C. § 1514:128 

“(a) The official having administrative control of an 
appropriation available to the legislative branch, the judicial 
branch, the United States International Trade Commission, 
or the District of Columbia government, and, subject to the 
approval of the President, the head of each executive 

128 Prior to the 1982 recodification of title 31, sections 1513(d) and 1514 had been combined 
as subsection (g) of the Antideficiency Act.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

agency (except the Commission) shall prescribe by 
regulation a system of administrative control not 
inconsistent with accounting procedures prescribed under 
law. The system shall be designed to— 

“(1) restrict obligations or expenditures from each 
appropriation to the amount of apportionments or 
reapportionments of the appropriation; and 

“(2) enable the official or the head of the executive 
agency to fix responsibility for an obligation or 
expenditure exceeding an apportionment or 
reapportionment. 

“(b) To have a simplified system for administratively 
dividing appropriations, the head of each executive agency 
(except the Commission) shall work toward the objective of 
financing each operating unit, at the highest practical level, 
from not more than one administrative division for each 
appropriation affecting the unit.” 

Section 1514 is designed to ensure that the agencies in each branch of the 
government keep their obligations and expenditures within the bounds of 
each apportionment or reapportionment. The official in each agency who 
has administrative control of the apportioned funds is required to set up, by 
regulation, a system of administrative controls to implement this objective. 
The system must be consistent with any accounting procedures prescribed 
by or pursuant to law, and must be designed to (1) prevent obligations and 
expenditures in excess of apportionments or reapportionments, and (2) fix 
responsibility for any obligation or expenditure in excess of an 
apportionment or reapportionment.129 Agency fund control regulations in 
the executive branch must be approved by OMB. See OMB Cir. No. A-11, 
pt. 4, § 150.7.

Subsection (b) of 31 U.S.C. § 1514 was added in 1956130 and was intended to 
simplify agency allotment systems. Prior to 1956, it was not uncommon for 
agencies to divide and subdivide their apportionments into numerous 
“pockets” of obligational authority called “allowances.” Obligating or 
spending more than the amount of each allowance was a violation of the 
Antideficiency Act as it then existed. The Second Hoover Commission 
(Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government) 
had recommended simplification in 1955. The Senate and House 
Committees on Government Operations agreed. Both committees reported 
as follows: 

“The making of numerous allotments which are further 
divided and suballotted to lower levels leads to much 
confusion and inflexibility in the financial control of 
appropriations or funds as well as numerous minor 
violations of [the Antideficiency Act].” 

S. Rep. No. 84-2265, at 9 (1956); H.R. Rep. No. 84-2734, at 7 (1956). The 
result was what is now 31 U.S.C. § 1514(b).131 
As noted, one of the objectives of 31 U.S.C. § 1514 is to enable the agency 
head to fix responsibility for obligations or expenditures in excess of 
apportionments. The statute encourages agencies to fix responsibility at 
the highest practical level, but does not otherwise prescribe precisely how 
this is to be done. Apart from subsection (b), the substance of section 1514 
derives from a 1950 amendment to the Antideficiency Act.132 In testimony 
on that legislation, the Director of the then Bureau of the Budget stated: 

“At the present time, theoretically, I presume the agency 
head is about the only one that you could really hold 
responsible for exceeding [an] apportionment. The revised 
section provides for going down the line to the person who 
creates the obligation against the fund and fixes the 

130 Pub. L. No. 863, ch. 814, § 3, 70 Stat. 782, 783 (Aug. 1, 1956). 
131 The historical summary in this paragraph is taken largely from 37 Comp. Gen. 220 (1957). 
132 Pub. L. No. 759, ch. 896, § 1211, 64 Stat. 595, 765 (Sept. 6, 1950).

responsibility on the bureau head or the division head, if he 
is the one who creates the obligation.”133 

Thus, depending on the agency regulations and the level at which 
administrative responsibility is fixed, the violating individual could be the 
person in charge of a major agency bureau or operating unit, or it could be 
a contracting officer or finance officer. 

Identifying the person responsible for a violation will be easy in probably 
the majority of cases. However, where there are many individuals involved 
in a complex transaction, and particularly where the actions producing the 
violation occurred over a long period of time, pinpointing responsibility 
can be much more difficult. Hopkins and Nutt, in their study of the 
Antideficiency Act, present the following as a sensible approach: 

“Generally, [the individual to be held responsible] will be the 
highest ranking official in the decision-making process who 
had knowledge, either actual or constructive, of 

(1) precisely what actions were taken and (2) the 
impropriety or at least questionableness of such actions. 
There will be officials who had knowledge of either factor. 
But the person in the best and perhaps only position to 
prevent the ultimate error—and thus the one who must be 
held accountable—is the highest one who is aware of 
both. 134 
Thus, Hopkins and Nutt conclude, where multiple individuals are involved 
in a violation, the individual to be held responsible “must not be too remote 
from the cause of the violation and must be in a position to have prevented 
the violation from occurring.”135

“(a) An officer or employee of the United States 
Government or of the District of Columbia government may 
not make or authorize an expenditure or obligation 
exceeding— 

“(1) an apportionment; or 

“(2) the amount permitted by regulations 
prescribed under section 1514(a) of this title.” 

Section 1517(a) must be read in conjunction with sections 1341, 1512, and 
1514, previously discussed. 

Subsection 1517(a)(1) prohibits obligations or expenditures in excess of an 
apportionment. Thus, an agency must observe the limits of its 
apportionments just as it must observe the limits of its appropriations. It 
follows that an agency cannot obligate or expend appropriations before 
they have been apportioned. Thus, GAO stated in B-290600, July 10, 2002: 

“The Antideficiency Act prohibits . . . the making or the 
authorizing of obligations or expenditures in advance of, or 
in excess of, available appropriations. 31 U.S.C. § 1341. An 
agency may obligate an appropriation only after OMB has 
apportioned it to the agency.” 

Page 6-140 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

Since the Antideficiency Act requires an apportionment before an agency 
can obligate the appropriation, 31 U.S.C. § 1512(a), an obligation in 
advance of an apportionment violates the Act. See B-255529, Jan. 10, 1994. 
In other words, if zero has been apportioned, zero is available for obligation 
or expenditure.136 When an agency anticipates a need to obligate 
appropriations upon their enactment, it may request (but not receive) an 
apportionment before a regular appropriation or continuing resolution has 
been enacted. Typically, for regular appropriation acts, agencies submit 
their apportionment requests to OMB by August 21 or within 10 calendar 
days after enactment of the appropriation, whichever is later. See OMB 
Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, 
§ 120.30 (June 21, 2005). OMB permits agencies to submit requests on the 
day Congress completes action on the appropriation bill. Id. § 120.34. 
OMB encourages agencies to begin their preparation of apportionment 
requests as soon as the House and Senate have reached agreement on 
funding levels (id. § 120.30) and to discuss the proposed request with OMB 
representatives (id. § 120.34). OMB will entertain expedited requests and, 
for emergency funding needs, may approve the apportionment request by 
telephone or fax. Id. For continuing resolutions, OMB typically expedites 
the process by making “automatic” apportionments under continuing 
resolutions. See B-255529, Jan. 10, 1994; OMB Cir. No. A-11, § 123.5. 

136 But see Cessna Aircraft Co. v. Dalton, 126 F.3d 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 
525 U.S. 818 (1998). In that case, the Navy had exercised an option to extend a contract on 
October 1. The appropriation that Navy charged the obligation to was signed into law on 
October 1; however, OMB had not yet apportioned the appropriation. Cessna, trying to get 
out of the contract, argued that the obligation for the contract extension was not valid since 
it was made in advance of the apportionment. The court held that the provisions of the 
Antideficiency Act were only internal government operating requirements and, as such, they 
did not confer legal rights on outside parties. Id. at 1451–52. See generally Blackhawk 
Heating & Plumbing Co. v. United States, 622 F.2d 539, 552 n.9 (Ct. Cl. 1980); Rough 
Diamond Co. v. United States, 351 F.2d 636, 640, 642 (Ct. Cl. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 
957 (1966). 

In dicta, the court said that apportionment is not a prerequisite to the obligation of 
appropriated funds. The court noted that 31 U.S.C. § 1341 explicitly prohibits obligations 
both in excess of and (unless otherwise authorized) in advance of appropriations. By 
contrast, the court pointed out, the apportionment sections of title 31 explicitly prohibit 
only obligations exceeding an apportionment; they do not literally forbid obligations in 
advance of an apportionment. Cessna, 126 F.3d at 1450–51. The court also rejected 
Cessna’s reliance on provisions of the Defense Department accounting manual that 
generally prohibited obligations in advance of an apportionment. The Cessna dicta has not 
been followed in any subsequent case.

Under some circumstances, an agency may have a legal duty to seek an 
additional apportionment from OMB. Blackhawk Heating & Plumbing 
Co. v. United States, 622 F.2d 539, 552 n.9 (Ct. Cl. 1980); Berends v. Butz, 
357 F. Supp. 143, 155–56 (D. Minn. 1973). In Berends v. Butz, the Secretary 
of Agriculture had terminated an emergency farm loan program, allegedly 
due to a shortage of funds. The court found the termination improper and 
directed reinstatement of the program. Since the shortage of funds related 
to the amount apportioned and not the amount available under the 
appropriation, the court found that the Secretary had a duty to request an 
additional apportionment in order to continue implementing the program. 
The case does not address the nature and extent of any duty OMB might 
have in response to such a request. 

Subsection 1517(a)(2) makes it a violation to obligate or expend in excess 
of an administrative subdivision of an apportionment to the extent 
provided in the agency’s fund control regulations prescribed under 
section 1514. The importance of 31 U.S.C. § 1514 becomes much clearer 
when it is read in conjunction with 31 U.S.C. § 1517(a)(2). Section 1514 
does not prescribe the level of fiscal responsibility for violations below the 
apportionment level. It merely recommends that the agency set the level at 
the highest practical point and suggests no more than one subdivision 
below the apportionment level. The agency thus, under the statute, has a 
measure of discretion. If it chooses to elevate overobligations or 
overexpenditures of lower-tier subdivisions to the level of Antideficiency 
Act violations, it is free to do so in its fund control regulations. 

At this point, it is important to return to OMB Circular No. A-11. Since 
agency fund control regulations must be approved by OMB (id. § 150.7), 
OMB has a role in determining what levels of administrative subdivision 
should constitute Antideficiency Act violations. Under OMB Circular 
No. A-11, § 145.2, overobligation or overexpenditure of an allotment or 
suballotment are always violations. Overobligation or overexpenditure of 
other administrative subdivisions are violations only if and to the extent 
specified in the agency’s fund control regulations. See 31 U.S.C. §§ 1514(a), 
1517(a)(2). 

In 37 Comp. Gen. 220 (1957), GAO considered proposed fund control 
regulations of the Public Housing Administration. The regulations 
provided for allotments as the first subdivision below the apportionment 
level. They then authorized the further subdivision of allotments into 
“allowances,” but retained responsibility at the allotment level. The 
“allowances” were intended as a means of meeting operational needs 

Page 6-142 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

rather than an apportionment control device. GAO advised that this 
proposed structure conformed to the purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 1514, 
particularly in light of the 1956 addition of section 1514(b), and that 
expenditures in excess of an “allowance” would not constitute 
Antideficiency Act violations. 

For further illustration, see 35 Comp. Gen. 356 (1955) (overobligation of 
allotment stemming from misinterpretation of regulations); B-95136, 
Aug. 8, 1979 (overobligation of regional allotments would constitute 
reportable violation unless sufficient unobligated balance existed at central 
account level to adjust the allotments); B-179849, Dec. 31, 1974 
(overobligation of allotment held a violation of section 1517(a) where 
agency regulations specified that allotment process was the “principal 
means whereby responsibility is fixed for the conduct of program activities 
within the funds available”); B-114841.2-O.M., Jan. 23, 1986 (no violation in 
exceeding allotment subdivisions termed “work plans”); B-242974.6, 
Nov. 26, 1991 (nondecision memorandum) (under Defense Department 
regulations, overobligations of administrative subdivisions of funds that 
are exempt from apportionment do not constitute Antideficiency Act 
violations.). 

5. Penalties and Reporting 
Requirements 
a. Administrative and Penal 
Sanctions 
Violations of the Antideficiency Act are subject to sanctions of two types, 
administrative and penal. The Antideficiency Act is the only one of the 
title 31, United States Code, fiscal statutes to prescribe penalties of both 
types, a fact which says something about congressional perception of the 
Act’s importance. 

An officer or employee who violates 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a) (obligate/expend in 
excess or advance of appropriation), section 1342 (voluntary services 
prohibition), or section 1517(a) (obligate/expend in excess of an 
apportionment or administrative subdivision as specified by regulation) 
“shall be subject to appropriate administrative discipline including, when 
circumstances warrant, suspension from duty without pay or removal from 
office.” 31 U.S.C. §§ 1349(a), 1518. For a case in which an official was 
reduced in grade and reassigned to other duties, see Duggar v. Thomas, 
550 F. Supp. 498 (D.D.C. 1982) (upholding the agency’s action against a 
charge of discrimination). 

Page 6-143 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

In addition, an officer or employee who “knowingly and willfully” violates 
any of the three provisions cited above “shall be fined not more than 
$5,000, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both.” 31 U.S.C. §§ 1350, 
1519. As far as GAO is aware, it appears that no officer or employee has 
ever been prosecuted, much less convicted, for a violation of the 
Antideficiency Act as of this writing. The knowing and willful failure to 
record an overobligation in order to conceal an Antideficiency Act violation 
is also a criminal offense. See 71 Comp. Gen. 502, 509–10 (1992) 
(discussing several relevant criminal provisions in title 18, United States 
Code). 

Earlier in this chapter, we pointed out that factors such as the absence of 
bad faith or the lack of intent to commit a violation are irrelevant for 
purposes of determining whether a violation has occurred. However, intent 
is relevant in evaluating the assessment of penalties. Note that the criminal 
penalties are linked to a determination that the law was “knowingly and 
willfully” violated, but the administrative sanction provisions do not 
contain similar language. Thus, intent or state of mind may (and probably 
should) be taken into consideration when evaluating potential 
administrative sanctions (whether to assess them and, if so, what type), but 
must be taken into consideration in determining applicability of the 
criminal sanctions. Understandably, the provisions for fines and/or jail are 
intended to be reserved for particularly flagrant violations. 

Finally, the administrative and penal sanctions apply only to violations of 
the three provisions cited—31 U.S.C. §§ 1341(a), 1342, and 1517(a). They 
do not, for example, apply to violations of 31 U.S.C. § 1512 (requiring that 
all appropriations be administratively apportioned so as to ensure 
obligation and expenditure at a controlled rate which will prevent 
deficiencies from arising before the end of a fiscal year). 36 Comp. 
Gen. 699 (1957). 

b. Reporting Requirements Once it is determined that there has been a violation of 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a), 
1342, or 1517(a), the agency head “shall report immediately to the President 
and Congress all relevant facts and a statement of actions taken.” 31 U.S.C. 
§§ 1351, 1517(b). Further instructions on preparing the reports may be 
found in OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution 
of the Budget, § 145 (June 21, 2005). The reports are to be signed by the 
agency head. Id. § 145.7. The report to the President is to be forwarded 
through the Director of OMB. Id.

In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, Congress amended the 
Antideficiency Act to add that the heads of executive branch agencies and 
the Mayor of the District of Columbia shall also transmit “[a] copy of each 
report . . . to the Comptroller General on the same date the report is 
transmitted to the President and Congress.”137 

The report is to include all pertinent facts and a statement of all actions 
taken to address and correct the Antideficiency Act violation (any 
administrative discipline imposed, referral to the Justice Department 
where appropriate, new safeguards imposed, etc.). An agency also should 
include a request for a supplemental or deficiency appropriation when 
needed. It is also understood that the agency will do everything it can 
lawfully do to correct or mitigate the financial effects of the violation. For 
example, when the Fish and Wildlife Service improperly entered into 
contracts for legal services, we explained that there were a number of ways 
the Department of Interior could correct the Service’s Antideficiency Act 
violations if unable to obtain a deficiency appropriation of the budget 
authority needed to cover amounts the Service paid to these contractors, 
including ratifying the contracts and covering their costs out of unobligated 
balances of the applicable fiscal year appropriation, or paying the 
contractors on a quantum meruit basis138 out of unobligated balances.

772 (1976); B-223857, Feb. 27, 1987; B-114841.2-O.M., Jan. 23, 1986. In view 
of the explicit provisions of 31 U.S.C. § 1351, there is no private right of 
action for declaratory, mandatory, or injunctive relief under the 
Antideficiency Act. Thurston v. United States, 696 F. Supp. 680 (D.D.C. 
1988). 

Factors such as mistake, inadvertence, lack of intent, or the minor nature 
of a violation do not affect the duty to report. For example, the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) and the Air Transportation Stabilization 

137 31 U.S.C. §§ 1351, 1517(b), as amended by Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, Pub. L. 
No. 108-447, div. G, title II, § 1401, 118 Stat. 2809, 3192 (Dec. 8, 2004). See, in this regard, the 
Comptroller General’s Memorandum to Heads of Departments, Agencies, and Others 
Concerned, Transmission of Antideficiency Act Reports to the Comptroller General of the 
United States, B-304335, Mar. 8, 2005. 

138 Payment under this authority is appropriate where there is no enforceable contractual 
obligation on the part of the government but where the government has received a benefit 
not prohibited by law conferred in good faith. See chapter 12, section C.2.b in volume III of 
the second edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations Law for a general discussion of 
quantum meruit claims.

Board (ATSB) were required to report an Antideficiency Act violation 
when, as discussed in section C.2 above, OMB erroneously apportioned, 
and ATSB erroneously obligated, funds to cover the subsidy cost of a loan 
guarantee prior to the availability of budget authority. B-290600, July 10, 
2001. Of course, if the agency feels there are extenuating circumstances, it 
is entirely appropriate to include them in the report. 35 Comp. Gen. 356 
(1955). 

What if GAO uncovers a violation but the agency thinks GAO is wrong? 
The agency must still make the required reports, and must include an 
explanation of its disagreement. OMB Cir. No. A-11, § 145. See also GAO, 
Anti-Deficiency Act: Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service Violates 
the Anti-Deficiency Act, GAO/AFMD-87-20 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 17, 
1987). 

6. Funding Gaps The term “funding gap” refers to a period of time between the expiration of 
an appropriation and the enactment of a new one. A funding gap is one of 
the most difficult fiscal problems a federal agency may have to face. As our 
discussion here will demonstrate, the case law reflects an attempt to forge 
a workable solution to a bad situation. 
Funding gaps occur most commonly at the end of a fiscal year when new 
appropriations, or a continuing resolution, have not yet been enacted. In 
this context, a gap may affect only a few agencies (if, for example, only one 
appropriation act remains unenacted as of October 1), or the entire federal 
government. A funding gap may also occur if a particular appropriation 
becomes exhausted before the end of the fiscal year, in which event it may 
affect only a single agency or a single program, depending on the scope of 
the appropriation. In the latter case the lack of funds occurs as a 
consequence of unforeseen circumstances beyond the agency’s control as 
opposed to the exhaustion of appropriations as a result of poor 
management. 

Funding gaps occur for a variety of reasons. For one thing, the complexity 
of the budget and appropriations process makes it difficult at best for 
Congress and the President to get everything done on time. Add to this the 
enormity of some programs and the need to address budget deficits, and 
the scope of the problem becomes more apparent. Also, funding gaps are 
perhaps an inevitable reflection of the political process. 

Page 6-146 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

As GAO has pointed out, funding gaps, actual or threatened, are both 
disruptive and costly.139 They also produce difficult legal problems under 
the Antideficiency Act. The basic question, easy to state but not quite as 
easy to answer, is—what is an agency permitted or required to do when 
faced with a funding gap? Can it continue with “business as usual,” must it 
lock up and go home, or is there some acceptable middle ground? 

In 1980, a congressional subcommittee asked GAO whether agency heads 
could legally permit employees to come to work when the applicable 
appropriation for salaries had expired and Congress had not yet enacted 
either a regular appropriation or a continuing resolution for the next fiscal 
year. The Comptroller General replied in B-197841, Mar. 3, 1980, that 
31 U.S.C. §§ 1341(a) and 1342 were both violated if agency employees 
reported for work under those circumstances. Permitting the employees to 
come to work would result in an obligation to pay salary for the time 
worked, an obligation in advance of appropriations in violation of 
section 1341(a). With respect to section 1342, no one was suggesting that 
the employees were offering to work gratuitously, even assuming they 
could lawfully do so, which for the most part they cannot. The fact that 
employees were willing to take the risk that the necessary appropriation 
would eventually be enacted did not avoid the violation. Clearly, the 
employees still expected to be paid eventually. “During a period of expired 
appropriations,” the Comptroller General stated, “the only way the head of 
an agency can avoid violating the Antideficiency Act is to suspend the 
operations of the agency and instruct employees not to report to work until 
an appropriation is enacted.” B-197841, at 3. 

Notwithstanding the literal effect of the Antideficiency Act, however, the 
Comptroller General went on to observe in B-197841, “[W]e do not believe 
that the Congress intends that federal agencies be closed during periods of 
expired appropriations.” In this regard, the opinion pointed out that at the 
beginning of fiscal year 1980, GAO had prepared an internal memorandum 
to address its own operations in the event of a funding gap. The 
memorandum said, in effect, that employees could continue to come to 
work, but that operations would have to be severely restricted. No new 
obligations could be incurred for contracts or small purchases of any kind, 

139 See, e.g., GAO, Government Shutdown: Funding Lapse Furlough Information, 
GAO/GGD-96-52R (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 1, 1995); Government Shutdown: Permanent 
Funding Lapse Legislation Needed, GAO/GGD-91-76 (Washington, D.C.: June 6, 1991); 
Funding Gaps Jeopardize Federal Government Operations, PAD-81-31 (Washington, D.C.: 
Mar. 3, 1981).

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

and of course the employees could not actually be paid until appropriations 
were enacted. The opinion further noted that the then chairman of the 
Senate Appropriations Committee had placed the 1980 GAO memorandum 
in the Congressional Record, and had described it as providing “common 
sense guidelines.”140 The opinion also pointed to the fact that when 
Congress enacted appropriations following a funding gap, it generally made 
the appropriations retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year and 
included language ratifying obligations incurred during the funding gap. 

“It thus appears,” the opinion concluded, “that the Congress expects that 
the various agencies of the Government will continue to operate and incur 
obligations during a period of expired appropriations.” Nevertheless, the 
opinion conceded that this approach would “legally produce widespread 
violations of the Antideficiency Act.” B-197841, at 4. Therefore, the 
opinion reiterated GAO’s support at that time for legislation then pending 
that would provide permanent statutory authority to continue the pay of 
federal employees during funding gaps. Id.141 

Less than two months after GAO issued B-197841, the Attorney General 
issued his opinion to the President. The Attorney General essentially 
agreed with GAO’s analysis that permitting employees to work during a 
funding gap would violate the Antideficiency Act, but concluded further 
that the approach outlined in the GAO internal memorandum went beyond 
what the Act permitted. 43 Op. Att’y Gen. 224, 4A Op. Off. Legal Counsel 16 
(1980). The opinion stated: 

“[T]here is nothing in the language of the Antideficiency Act 
or in its long history from which any exception to its terms 
during a period of lapsed appropriations may be inferred. . . . 

* * * * * 

“[F]irst of all . . ., on a lapse in appropriations, federal 
agencies may incur no obligations that cannot lawfully be 
funded from prior appropriations unless such obligations 
are otherwise authorized by law. There are no exceptions to 

140 125 Cong. Rec. 26974 (Oct. 1, 1979) (remarks of Sen. Magnuson).

The legislation was not enacted.

this rule under current law, even where obligations incurred 
earlier would avoid greater costs to the agencies should 
appropriations later be enacted. 

“Second, the Department of Justice will take actions to 
enforce the criminal provisions of the Act in appropriate 
cases in the future when violations of the Antideficiency Act 
are alleged. This does not mean that departments and 
agencies, upon a lapse in appropriations, will be unable 
logistically to terminate functions in an orderly way. . . . 
[A]uthority may be inferred from the Antideficiency Act 
itself for federal officers to incur those minimal obligations 
necessary to closing their agencies.” 

4A Op. Off. Legal Counsel at 19, 20. 

This opinion stands for the proposition that agencies had little choice but 
to lock up and go home. A second opinion, 43 Op. Att’y Gen. 293, 5 Op. Off. 
Legal Counsel 1 (1981), went into much more detail on possible exceptions 
and should be read in conjunction with the 1980 opinion. 

As set forth in the 1981 Attorney General opinion, the exceptions fall into 
two broad categories. The first category is obligations “authorized by law.” 
Within this category, there are four types of exceptions: 

• Activities funded with appropriations that do not expire at the end of 
the fiscal year, that is, multiple year and no-year appropriations.142 
• Activities authorized by statutes that expressly permit obligations in 
advance of appropriations, such as contract authority (see section C.2.g 
of this chapter). 
• Activities “authorized by necessary implication from the specific terms 
of duties that have been imposed on, or of authorities that have been 
invested in, the agency.” To take the example given in the opinion, 
there will be cases where benefit payments under an entitlement 
program are funded from other than 1-year appropriations (e.g., a trust 
142 This would also include certain revolving fund operations, but not those whose use 
requires affirmative authorization in annual appropriation acts. B-241730.2, Feb. 14, 1991 
(Government Printing Office revolving fund). 

Page 6-149 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

fund), but the salaries of personnel who administer the program are 
funded by 1-year money. As long as money for the benefit payments 
remains available, administration of the program is, by necessary 
implication, “authorized by law,” unless the entitlement legislation or its 
legislative history provides otherwise or Congress takes affirmative 
measures to suspend or terminate the program. 

• Obligations “necessarily incident to presidential initiatives undertaken 
within his constitutional powers,” for example, the power to grant 
pardons and reprieves. This same rationale would apply to legislative 
branch agencies that incur obligations “necessary to assist the 
Congress in the performance of its constitutional duties.” B-241911, 
Oct. 23, 1990 (nondecision letter). 
The second broad category reflected the exceptions authorized under 
31 U.S.C. § 1342—emergencies involving the safety of human life or the 
protection of property (see also the discussion of this provision in 
section C.3.d of this chapter). The Attorney General suggested the 
following rules for interpreting the scope of this exception: 

“First, there must be some reasonable and articulable 
connection between the function to be performed and the 
safety of human life or the protection of property. Second, 
there must be some reasonable likelihood that the safety of 
human life or the protection of property would be 
compromised, in some degree, by delay in the performance

The Attorney General then cited the identical exception language in the 
deficiency apportionment prohibition of 31 U.S.C. § 1515, and noted that 
the Office of Management and Budget followed a similar approach in 
granting deficiency apportionments over the years.143 Given the wide 
variations in agency activities, it would not be feasible to attempt an 
advance listing of functions or activities that might qualify under this 
exception. Accordingly, the Attorney General made the following 
recommendation: 

143 See section C.4 of this chapter for a more detailed discussion of apportionment 
authorities.

“To erect the most solid foundation for the Executive 
Branch’s practice in this regard, I would recommend that, in 
preparing contingency plans for periods of lapsed 
appropriations, each government department or agency 
provide for the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget some written description, that could be transmitted 
to Congress, of what the head of the agency, assisted by its 
general counsel, considers to be the agency’s emergency 
functions.” 

5 Op. Off. Legal Counsel at 11. 

Lest this approach be taken too far, Congress added the following sentence 
to 31 U.S.C. § 1342: 

“As used in this section, the term ‘emergencies involving the 
safety of human life or the protection of property’ does not 
include ongoing, regular functions of government the 
suspension of which would not imminently threaten the 
safety of human life or the protection of property.” 

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508, 
§ 13213(b), 104 Stat. 1388, 1388-621 (Nov. 5, 1990). 

The conference report on the 1990 legislation explained the intent: 

“The conference report also makes conforming changes to 
title 31 of the United States Code to make clear that . . . 
ongoing, regular operations of the Government cannot be 
sustained in the absence of appropriations, except in limited 
circumstances. These changes guard against what the 
conferees believe might be an overly broad interpretation of 
an opinion of the Attorney General issued on January 16, 
1981, regarding the authority for the continuance of 
Government functions during the temporary lapse of 
appropriations, and affirm that the constitutional power of 
the purse resides with Congress.”

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals added to the list of exceptions, holding 
the suspension of the civil jury trial system for lack of funds 
unconstitutional. Armster v. United States District Court, 792 F.2d 1423 
(9th Cir. 1986). Faced with the potential exhaustion of appropriations for 
juror fees, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, at the 
direction of the Judicial Conference of the United States, had sent a 
memorandum to all district court judges advising that civil jury trials would 
have to be suspended until more money was available.144 Basing its holding 
on the Constitution and expressly declining to rule on the Antideficiency 
Act, the court held that a suspension for more than a “most minimal” time 
violated the seventh amendment. Id. at 1430. See also Hobson v. Brennan, 
637 F. Supp. 173 (D.D.C. 1986). The court said that “we do not hold that the 
Anti-Deficiency Act requires the result suggested by the Administrative 
Office. If it did, its commands would, of course, have to yield to those of 
the Constitution.”145 Armster, 792 F.2d at 1430 n.13. 

Since the appropriation was not yet actually exhausted, and since there 
was still ample time for Congress to provide additional funds, the court 
noted that its decision did not amount to ordering Congress to appropriate 
money. The court noted, but did not address, the far more difficult 
question of what would happen if the appropriation became exhausted and 
Congress refused to appropriate additional funds. Armster, 792 F.2d 
at 1430–31 and 1431 n.14. 

This, then, is the basic framework. There are a number of exceptions to the 
Antideficiency Act which would permit certain activities to continue during 
a funding gap. For activities not covered by any of the exceptions, 
however, the agency must proceed with prompt and orderly termination or 
violate the Act and risk invocation of the criminal sanctions. A very brief 
restatement may be found in 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 555 (1982). 

Within this framework, GAO and the Justice Department addressed a 
number of specific problems agencies encountered in coming to grips with 
funding gaps during the 1980s and early 1990s. For example, toward the 

144 The Administrative Office noted a combination of factors contributing to its projected 
shortfall, including Congress’s decision to enact an appropriation in an amount less than the 
Administrative Office had requested and the appointment of new judges, which increased 
the number of jury trials. Armster, 792 F.2d at 1425 n.3. 

145 Although this case addressed an agency’s projected exhaustion of its appropriations 
rather than a funding gap, the court’s dicta would appear relevant for a funding gap.

end of fiscal year 1982, the President vetoed a supplemental appropriations 
bill. As a result, the Defense Department did not have sufficient funds to 
meet the military payroll. The total payroll obligation consisted of (1) the 
take-home pay of the individuals, and (2) various items the employing 
agency was required to withhold and transfer to someone else, such as 
federal income tax and Social Security contributions. The Treasury 
Department published a change to its regulations permitting a temporary 
deferral of the due date for payment of the withheld items, and the Defense 
Department, relying on the “safety of human life or protection of property” 
exception, used the funds it had available to pay military personnel their 
full take-home pay. The Attorney General upheld the legality of this action. 
43 Op. Att’y Gen. 369, 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 27 (1982). The Comptroller 
General agreed, but questioned the blanket assumption that all military 
personnel fit within the exception. B-208985, Oct. 29, 1982; B-208951, 
Oct. 5, 1982. The extent to which this device might be available to civilian 
agencies would depend on (1) Treasury’s willingness to grant a similar 
deferral, and (2) the extent to which the agency could legitimately invoke 
the emergency exception. 

Additional cases dealing with funding gap problems are: 

• Salaries of commissioners of Copyright Royalty Tribunal attach by 
virtue of their status as officers without regard to availability of funds. 
Salary obligation is therefore viewed as “authorized by law” for 
purposes of Antideficiency Act, and commissioners could be 
retroactively compensated for periods worked without pay during a 
funding gap. 61 Comp. Gen. 586 (1982). 
• Richmond district office of Internal Revenue Service shut down for half 
a day in October 1986 due to a funding gap. Subsequent legislation 
authorized retroactive compensation of employees affected. GAO 
concluded that the legislation applied to intermittent as well as regular 
full-time employees, and held that the intermittent employees could be 
compensated in the form of administrative leave for time lost during 
the half-day furlough. B-233656, June 19, 1989. 
• Witness who had been ordered to appear in federal court was stranded 
without money to return home when court did not convene due to 
funding gap. Cash disbursement to permit witness to return home or 
secure overnight lodging was held permissible since hardship 
circumstances indicated reasonable likelihood that safety of witness 
would be jeopardized. 5 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 429 (1981).

There are also a few cases addressing actions an agency has taken to 
forestall the effects of a funding gap. In 62 Comp. Gen. 1 (1982), the Merit 
Systems Protection Board, faced with a substantial cut in its appropriation, 
placed most of its employees on half-time, half-pay status in an attempt to 
stretch its appropriation through the end of the fiscal year. A subsequent 
supplemental appropriation provided the necessary operating funds. GAO 
advised that it was within the Board’s discretion, assuming the availability 
of sufficient funds, to grant retroactive administrative leave to the 
employees who had been affected by the partial shutdown. 

GAO reviewed another furlough plan in 64 Comp. Gen. 728 (1985). The 
Interstate Commerce Commission had determined that if it continued its 
normal rate of operations, it would exhaust its appropriation six weeks 
before the end of the fiscal year. To prevent this from happening, it 
furloughed its employees for one day per week. GAO found that the 
Commission’s actions were in compliance with the Antideficiency Act. 
While the ICC was thus able to continue essential services, the price was 
financial hardship for its employees, plus “serious backlogs, missed 
deadlines and reduced efficiency.” Id. at 732. 

During the 1980s and early 1990s, GAO also issued several reports on 
funding gaps. The first was Funding Gaps Jeopardize Federal 
Government Operations, PAD-81-31 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 3, 1981). In 
that report, GAO noted the costly and disruptive effects of funding gaps, 
and recommended the enactment of permanent legislation to permit 
federal agencies to incur obligations, but not disburse funds, during a 
funding gap. In the second report, Continuing Resolutions and an 
Assessment of Automatic Funding Approaches, GAO/AFMD-86-16 
(Washington, D.C.: Jan. 29, 1986), GAO compared several possible options 
but this time made no specific recommendation. The Office of 
Management and Budget had pointed out, and GAO agreed, that automatic 
funding legislation could have the undesirable effects of (1) reducing 
pressure on Congress to make timely funding decisions, and (2) permitting 
major portions of the government to operate for extended periods without 
action by either House of Congress or the President. The ideal solution, 
both agencies agreed, is the timely enactment of the regular appropriation 
bills. 

In Managing the Cost of Government: Proposals for Reforming Federal 
Budgeting Practices, GAO/AFMD-90-1 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 1, 1989) 
at 28–29, GAO reiterated its support for the concept of an automatic 
continuing resolution in a form that does not reduce the incentive to

complete action on the regular appropriation bills. A 1991 GAO report 
analyzed the impact of a funding gap which occurred over the 1990 
Columbus Day weekend and again renewed the recommendation for 
permanent legislation to, at a minimum, allow agencies to incur obligations 
to compensate employees during temporary funding gaps but not pay them 
until enactment of the appropriation. Government Shutdown: Permanent 
Funding Lapse Legislation Needed, GAO/GGD-91-76 (Washington, D.C.: 
June 6, 1991). The report stated: 

“In our opinion, shutting down the government during 
temporary funding gaps is an inappropriate way to 
encourage compromise on the budget. Beyond being 
counterproductive from a financial standpoint, a shutdown 
disrupts government services. In addition, forcing agency 
managers to choose who will and will not be furloughed 
during these temporary funding lapses severely tests agency 
management’s ability to treat its employees fairly.” 

Id. at 9. 

The history of funding gaps over recent decades reveals several distinct 
phases, which were captured in an analysis by a Congressional Research 
Service report to Congress entitled Preventing Federal Government 
Shutdowns: Proposals for an Automatic Continuing Resolution, 

No. RL30339 (Washington, D.C.: May 19, 2000) (hereafter “CRS Report”). 
The first phase, covering fiscal years 1977 through 1980, was a period in 
which agencies reacted to funding gaps along the lines suggested in GAO’s 
opinion in B-197841, Mar. 3, 1980, described previously, by curtailing 
operations but not shutting down. During this period, there were 6 funding 
gaps that lasted from 8 to 17 days. See the CRS Report at 4, Table 1. The 
second phase, covering fiscal years 1981 through 1995, occurred under the 
stricter approach to funding gaps reflected in the Attorney General 
opinions described above. As the CRS Report notes, funding gaps during 
this period were less frequent and shorter. There were 11 funding gaps in 
all over this period, many of which took place over weekends. None lasted 
more than 3 days. Id. 

The string of shorter funding gaps came to an abrupt halt in fiscal year 
1996. As CRS reported, the unusually difficult and acrimonious budget 
negotiations for that year led to two funding gaps: the first was 5 days and 
the second, the longest in history, lasted for 21 days. Id. at 3, 5. Both of 
these funding gaps resulted in widespread shutdowns of government

Chapter 6

operations. During the first funding gap, an estimated 800,000 federal 
employees were furloughed. During the second, about 284,000 employees 
were furloughed and another 475,000 continued to work in a nonpay status 
under the emergency exception to the Antideficiency Act.146 

Not surprisingly, the events of 1995–1996 spawned additional legal opinions 
from the Office of Legal Counsel. These opinions essentially followed the 
legal framework described previously and did not break much new ground. 
However, they do illustrate the scope and application of the Antideficiency 
Act in different funding gap contexts. See, e.g., Memorandum for the 
Attorney General, Effect of Appropriations for Other Agencies and 
Branches on the Authority To Continue Department of Justice Functions 
During the Lapse in the Department’s Appropriations, OLC Opinion, 
Dec. 13, 1995 (if a suspension of the Justice Department’s functions during 
the period of anticipated funding lapse would prevent or significantly 
damage the execution of those functions, the Department’s functions and 
activities may continue); Memorandum for the Attorney General, 

Participation in Congressional Hearings During An Appropriations

Services of White House Office Employees During An Appropriations

during a funding gap); Memorandum for the Director of the Office of

Department’s existing narrow interpretation that the emergency exception

applied only in the case of an imminent threat or set of circumstances 
requiring immediate action).147 

The 1995–1996 funding gaps also produced at least one lawsuit, although it 
did not reach a final decision on the merits. In American Federation of 
Government Employees v. Rivlin, Civ. A. No. 95-2115 (EGS) (D.D.C. 
Nov. 17, 1995), the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to 
prevent the executive branch from requiring federal employees who had 
been designated “emergency” personnel to work during the funding gap. 
They contended that forcing employees to work without pay violated 
several personnel statutes and also constituted a misapplication of 
31 U.S.C. § 1342 since many of the employees did not meet the emergency 
criteria under section 1342. The court denied the requested relief, 
observing: 

“[T]he court is not convinced at this juncture that plaintiffs 
will either suffer irreparable harm in the event a temporary 
restraining order is not issued or that the interests of the 
public will be best served by the issuance of a temporary 
restraining order. Plaintiffs essentially concede that if the 
court were to issue a TRO, the government would indeed be 
shut down, because the Executive Branch could not require 
its employees to work without compensation. Although 
undoubtedly the public has an interest in having the budget 
impasse resolved and indeed has an interest in the outcome 
of this judicial proceeding, one could easily imagine the 
chaos that would be attendant to a complete governmental 
shutdown. It is inconceivable, by any stretch of the 
imagination, that the best interests of the public at large 
would somehow be served by the creation of that chaos.” 

American Federation of Government Employees, slip. op. at 4. 

147 The August 1995 opinion was discussed at length and reaffirmed in a Memorandum for 
the General Counsel, United States Marshals Service, Continuation of Federal Prisoner 
Detention Efforts in the Face of a USMS Appropriation Deficiency, OLC Opinion, Apr. 5, 
2000. Current Office of Management and Budget guidance still references the August 1995 
opinion as well as the earlier opinions in 43 Op. Att’y Gen. 224 (1980) and 43 Op. Att’y 
Gen. 293 (1981) as the principal legal authorities governing what agencies can do during a 
funding gap. See OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the 
Budget, § 124.1 (a) (June 21, 2005).

The court further observed that it was “purely speculative” whether any 
employees would actually go without pay since Congress had always 
appropriated funds to compensate employees for services rendered during 
a government shutdown. Id. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed as 
moot following resolution of the budget impasse. American Federation of 
Government Employees v. Rivlin, 995 F. Supp. 165 (D.D.C. 1998). 

The current phase in the history of funding gaps commenced on the heels 
of the 1995–1996 government shutdowns and has featured, thus far, the 
total absence of funding gaps. While there have been delays in the 
enactment of regular appropriations, there has been no funding gap since 
1996. 

Of course, the potential for future funding gaps still exists and proposals 
for legislation to cushion their impact have been raised again in recent 
years. However, such proposals have met with little enthusiasm. GAO was 
more cautionary in its most recent comments on this subject. See GAO, 
Budget Process: Considerations for Updating the Budget Enforcement 
Act, GAO-01-991T (Washington, D.C.: July 19, 2001), at 12: 

“The periodic experience of government ‘shutdowns’—or 
partial shutdowns when appropriations bills have not been 
enacted—has led to proposals for an automatic continuing 
resolution. The automatic continuing resolution, however, 
is an idea for which the details are critically important. 
Depending on the detailed structure of such a continuing 
resolution, the incentive for policymakers—some in the 
Congress and the President—to negotiate seriously and 
reach agreement may be lessened.” 

For example, GAO pointed out that some negotiators might find the 
“default position” specified in an automatic continuing resolution to be 
preferable to proposals on the table. 

Likewise, several efforts to enact an automatic continuing resolution in 
recent years have been unsuccessful. In 1997, President Clinton vetoed a

supplemental appropriations bill that contained such a provision. In 2000, 
the House of Representatives rejected such a proposal in a floor vote.148 

D. Supplemental and 
Deficiency 
Appropriations 
A supplemental appropriation may be defined as “[a]n act appropriating 
funds in addition to those already enacted in an annual appropriation act.” 
GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, GAO-05734SP 
(Washington, D.C.: September 2005) (Glossary), at 93. The Glossary 
adds that: 

“Supplemental appropriations provide additional budget 
authority usually in cases where the need for funds is too 
urgent to be postponed until enactment of the regular 
appropriation bill. Supplementals may sometimes include 
items not appropriated in the regular bills for lack of timely 
authorizations.” 

Id. 

The Glossary, at 43, defines a deficiency appropriation as “[a]n 
appropriation made to pay obligations for which sufficient funds are not 
available.” 

There is an important distinction between supplemental appropriations 
and deficiency appropriations. A supplemental appropriation 
“supplements the original appropriation,” 4 Comp. Dec. 61 (1897); that is, it 
provides additional appropriations to cover additional obligations to meet 
needs identified by the executive branch and concurred in by Congress in 
advance of the obligational event. A deficiency appropriation is an 
appropriation made to pay obligations for which sufficient funds were not 
available at the time the obligations were incurred. 27 Comp. Gen. 96 
(1947); 25 Comp. Gen. 601, 604 (1946); 4 Comp. Dec. 61, 62 (1897). The 
need for deficiency appropriations often results from violations of the 
Antideficiency Act, and they can be made in the same fiscal year as the 
overobligated appropriation or in a later year. Notwithstanding the 

148 These legislative actions are described in the Congressional Research Service report, 

Preventing Federal Government Shutdowns: Proposals for an Automatic Continuing 
Resolution, cited previously. Other automatic continuing resolution bills have been 
introduced but died in committee. See H.R. 29, 107th Cong. (2000); H.R. 3744, 107th Cong. 
(2001). 

Page 6-159 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

distinctions between supplemental and deficiency appropriations, 
Congress often will use supplemental appropriations bills as the legislative 
vehicle for enacting deficiency appropriations, just as Congress may use a 
supplemental appropriations bill as the legislative vehicle to enact new 
appropriations in addition to those supplementing appropriations already 
enacted. 

Because a supplemental appropriation “supplements the original 
appropriation,” it “partakes of its nature, and is subject to the same 
limitations as to the expenses for which it can be used as attach by law to 
the original appropriation” unless otherwise provided. 4 Comp. Dec. 61. 
See also 27 Comp. Gen. 96 (1947); 25 Comp. Gen. 601 (1946); 20 Comp. 
Gen. 769 (1941). This means that a supplemental appropriation is subject 
to the purpose and time limitations, plus any other applicable restrictions, 
of the appropriation being supplemented. 

Thus, an appropriation made to supplement the regular annual 
appropriation of a given fiscal year is available beyond the expiration of 
that fiscal year only to liquidate obligations incurred within the fiscal year. 
The unobligated balance of a supplemental appropriation will expire at the 
end of the fiscal year in the same manner as the regular annual 
appropriation. See 27 Comp. Gen. 96; 4 Comp. Dec. 61; 3 Comp. Dec. 72 
(1896). Of course, Congress can enact a supplemental appropriation, just 
like any other appropriation, to be available until expended (no-year). E.g., 

36 Comp. Gen. 526 (1957); B-72020, Jan. 9, 1948. 

Unless otherwise provided, a restriction contained in an annual 
appropriation act will apply to funds provided in a supplemental 
appropriation act even though the restriction is not repeated in the 
supplemental. For example, a restriction in a foreign assistance 
appropriation act prohibiting the use of funds for assistance to certain 
countries would apply equally to funds provided in a supplemental 
appropriation for foreign assistance for the same fiscal year. B-158575, 
Feb. 24, 1966. Similarly, a provision in an annual appropriation act that “no 
part of any appropriation for the Bureau of Reclamation contained in this 
Act shall be used for the salaries and expenses” (emphasis added) of 
certain officials who were not qualified engineers would apply as well to 
Bureau funds appropriated in supplemental appropriation acts for the same 
fiscal year, so long as the supplemental appropriation adds funds to 
amounts already enacted in the regular appropriation, but not to any new 
appropriations enacted in the supplemental appropriation act. B-86056, 
May 11, 1949. The rule applies to supplemental authorizations as well as 

Page 6-160 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

supplemental appropriations. B-106323, Nov. 27, 1951. If a supplemental 
appropriation act includes a new appropriation which is separate and 
distinct from the appropriations being supplemented, restrictions 
contained in the original appropriation act will not apply to the new 
appropriation unless specifically provided. Id. The fiscal year limitations 
of the original appropriation, however, would still apply. 

The rule that supplemental appropriations are subject to restrictions 
contained in the regular appropriation act being supplemented applies 
equally to specific dollar limitations. Thus, if a regular annual 
appropriation act specifies a maximum limitation for a particular object, 
either by using the words “not to exceed” or otherwise, a more general 
supplemental appropriation for the same fiscal year does not authorize an 
increase in that limitation. 19 Comp. Gen. 324 (1939); 4 Comp. Gen. 642 
(1925); B-71583, Feb. 20, 1948; B-66030, May 9, 1947. Naturally, this 
principle will not apply if the supplemental appropriation specifically 
provides for the object in question. 19 Comp. Gen. 832 (1940). 

New restrictions appearing in a supplemental appropriation act may or may 
not reach back and apply to balances remaining in the original annual 
appropriation, depending on the precise statutory language used. Thus, 
without more, a restriction in a supplemental applicable by its terms to 
“this appropriation” would apply only to the supplemental funds. B-31546, 
Jan. 12, 1943. See also 31 Comp. Gen. 543 (1952). 

At one time, supplemental appropriation acts specified that the funds were 
for the same objects and subject to the same limitations as the 
appropriations being supplemented. The then Bureau of the Budget 
wanted to delete this language pursuant to its mandate to eliminate 
unnecessary words in appropriations.149 The Comptroller General agreed 
that the language was unnecessary, pointing out that these conditions 
would apply even without being explicitly stated in the supplemental 
appropriation acts themselves. B-13900, Dec. 17, 1940. 

In addition to supplementing prior appropriations, a supplemental 
appropriation act may make entirely new appropriations and enact new 

149 Prior to the 1982 recodification of title 31, the mandate was found in 31 U.S.C. § 623. The 
recodifiers thought those words themselves were unnecessary, and the concept is now 
included in the general mandate in 31 U.S.C. § 1104(a) to “use uniform terms” in requesting 
appropriations.

legislative provisions which are separate and distinct from those made by 
an earlier appropriation act. Where a supplemental appropriation act 
contains new legislation, whether permanent or temporary, the new 
legislation will take effect on the date the supplemental is enacted absent a 
clear intent to make it retroactive. 20 Comp. Gen. 769 (1941). In the cited 
decision, a supplemental appropriation enacted late in fiscal year 1941 for 
the first time permitted payment of transportation expenses of certain 
military dependents. The provision was held effective on the date of 
enactment of the supplemental act and not on the first day of fiscal year 
1941. 

A supplemental appropriation also may add funds to a lump-sum 
appropriation for a new object. If the original appropriation was not 
available for that object, then the supplemental amounts to a new 
appropriation that is, in effect, distinct from the lump-sum appropriation. 
For example, a fiscal year 1957 supplemental appropriation for the 
Maritime Administration provided $18 million for a nuclear-powered 
merchant ship under the heading “ship construction.” Funds for the 
nuclear-powered ship had been sought under the regular “ship 
construction” lump-sum appropriation for fiscal year 1957, but had been 
denied. Under the circumstances, the Comptroller General found that the 
supplemental appropriation amounted to a specifically earmarked 
maximum for the vessel, and that the agency could not exceed the 
$18 million by using funds from the regular appropriation. 36 Comp. 
Gen. 526 (1957). 

E. Augmentation of 
Appropriations 
1. The Augmentation 
Concept 
As a general proposition, an agency may not augment its appropriations 
from outside sources without specific statutory authority. When Congress 
makes an appropriation, it also is establishing an authorized program level. 
In other words, it is telling the agency that it cannot operate beyond the 
level that it can finance under its appropriation. To permit an agency to 
operate beyond this level with funds derived from some other source 
without specific congressional sanction would amount to a usurpation of 
the congressional prerogative. Restated, the objective of the rule against 
augmentation of appropriations is to prevent a government agency from 

Page 6-162 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

undercutting the congressional power of the purse by circuitously 
exceeding the amount Congress has appropriated for that activity. As one 
recent decision put it: 

“When Congress establishes a new program or activity, it 
also must decide how to finance it. Typically it does this by 
appropriating funds from the U.S. Treasury. In addition to 
providing necessary funds, a congressional appropriation 
establishes a maximum authorized program level, meaning 
that an agency cannot, absent statutory authorization, 
operate beyond the level that can be paid for by its 
appropriations. An agency may not circumvent these 
limitations by augmenting its appropriations from sources 
outside the government. One of the objectives of these 
limitations is to prevent agencies from avoiding or usurping 
Congress’ ‘power of the purse.” 

B-300248, Jan. 15, 2004 (citations omitted). 

There is no statute which, in those precise terms, prohibits the 
augmentation of appropriated funds. The concept does nevertheless have 
an adequate statutory basis, although it must be derived from several 
separate enactments. Specifically: 

• 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b), the “miscellaneous receipts” statute. 
• 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a), restricting the use of appropriated funds to their 
intended purposes. Early Comptroller of the Treasury decisions often 
based the augmentation prohibition on the combined effect of 31 U.S.C. 
§§ 3302(b) and 1301(a). See, e.g., 17 Comp. Dec. 712 (1911); 9 Comp. 
Dec. 174 (1902). 
• 18 U.S.C. § 209, which prohibits the payment of, contribution to, or 
supplementation of the salary of a government officer or employee as 
compensation for his or her official duties from any source other than 
the government of the United States. 
The augmentation concept manifests itself in a wide variety of contexts. 
One application is the prohibition against transfers between appropriations 
without specific statutory authority. An unauthorized transfer is an 
improper augmentation of the receiving appropriation. E.g., 23 Comp. 
Gen. 694 (1944); B-206668, Mar. 15, 1982. In B-206668, a department 

Page 6-163 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

received a General Administration appropriation plus separate 
appropriations for the administration of its component bureaus. The 
unauthorized transfer of funds from the bureau appropriations to the 
General Administration appropriation was held to be an improper 
augmentation of the latter appropriation. Likewise, the Department of 
Labor illegally augmented its departmental management account by 
“pooling” funds from component appropriations in order to purchase 
computer equipment where the costs borne by the components far 
exceeded the value of the equipment they received. 70 Comp. Gen. 592 
(1991). The Comptroller General rejected the Department’s 
characterization of this transaction as a “reprogramming,” viewing it 
instead as an unauthorized transfer among appropriations. 

As with the transfer prohibition itself, however, the augmentation rule has 
no application at the agency allotment level within the same appropriation 
account. 70 Comp. Gen. 601 (1991). It also should be apparent that the 
augmentation rule is related to the concept of purpose availability. A very 
early case pointed out that charging a general appropriation when a 
specific appropriation is exhausted not only violates 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) by 
using the general appropriation for an unauthorized purpose, but also 
improperly augments the specific appropriation. [1] Bowler, First Comp. 
Dec. 257, 258 (1894). However, the augmentation rule is most closely 
related to the subject of this chapter—availability as to amount—because it 
has the effect of restricting executive spending to the amounts 
appropriated by Congress. In this respect, it is a logical, perhaps 
indispensable, complement to the Antideficiency Act. 

For the most part, although the cases are not entirely consistent, GAO has 
distinguished between receipts of money and receipts of services, dealing 
with the former under the augmentation rule and the latter under the 
voluntary services prohibition (31 U.S.C. § 1342).150 For example, in 
B-13378, Nov. 20, 1940, a private organization was willing to donate either 
funds or services. Since the agency lacked statutory authority to accept 
gifts, acceptance of a cash donation would improperly augment its 
appropriations. Acceptance of services was distinguished, however, and 
addressed in relation to the limits on acceptance of voluntary services set 
forth in 31 U.S.C. § 1342. GAO drew the same distinction in B-125406, 
Nov. 4, 1955. See also B-287738, May 16, 2002, distinguishing between 

150 For a further discussion of the voluntary services prohibition, see section C.3 of this 
chapter.

agency acceptance of money as compensation for damage to government 
property, which would constitute an augmentation if retained in agency 
appropriations, and acceptance of actual repairs to the property, which 
would be permissible.151 

In apparent conflict with these cases, however, is B-211079.2, Jan. 2, 1987, 
which stated that, without statutory authority, an agency would improperly 
augment its appropriations by accepting the uncompensated services of 
“workfare” participants to do work which would normally be done by the 
agency with its own personnel and funds. Logic would seem to support the 
formulation in B-211079.2. Certainly, if I wash your car without charge or if 
I give you money to have it washed, the result is the same—the car gets 
washed and your own money is free to be used for something else. Be that 
as it may, the majority of the cases support limiting the augmentation rule 
to the receipt of money. In the final analysis, the distinction probably 
makes little practical difference. In view of 31 U.S.C. § 1342, limiting the 
augmentation rule to the receipt of funds does not mean that the rule can 
be negated by the unrestricted acceptance of services.152 

In a 1991 case, 70 Comp. Gen. 597, GAO concluded that the then Interstate 
Commerce Commission (ICC) would not improperly augment its 
appropriations by permitting private carriers to install computer equipment 
at the ICC headquarters, to facilitate access to electronically filed rate 
tariffs. Installation was viewed as a reasonable exercise of the ICC’s 
statutory authority to prescribe the form and manner of tariff filing by 
those over whom the agency has regulatory authority. Somewhat similar in 

151 In a 1984 decision, GAO found that acceptance by the Federal Communications 
Commission of booth space and utility services at industry trade shows did not augment the 
Commission’s appropriation because “no money changed hands, nor was money paid on the 
Commission’s behalf to anyone else.” 63 Comp. Gen. 459, 461 (1984). GAO found that there 
was a “mutually beneficial arrangement” between the Commission and trade show 
promoters that was “neither an augmentation of appropriations nor an illegal retention of a 
gift.” Id. For a discussion of “no-cost” contract, see section E.2.b of this chapter. 

152 Akin to B-211079.2, the decision in B-286182, Jan. 11, 2001, suggested that acceptance of 
services might be considered an improper augmentation in some circumstances. That 
decision concerned a settlement agreement in a rate case whereby a company agreed to 
provide telecommunications equipment and services valued at $1.53 million to the District 
of Columbia courts for the purpose of facilitating access to the legal system. The decision 
concluded, however, that there was no augmentation issue in this case because the courts 
had statutory gift-acceptance authority, which is discussed in section E.3 of this chapter.

concept to the workfare case, however, the decision suggests that use of 
the equipment for other purposes, such as word processing by ICC staff, 
would be an improper augmentation, and advised the ICC to establish 
controls to prevent this. See also B-277521, July 31, 1997 (granting the 
Radio and TV Correspondents Association a permit to locate equipment in 
the Capitol in order to broadcast events would not constitute an 
augmentation of congressional appropriations since the equipment is not 
for official business use of the government). 

2. Disposition of Moneys 
Received: Repayments 
and Miscellaneous 
Receipts 
a. General Principles (1) The “miscellaneous receipts” statute 
A very important statute in the overall scheme of government fiscal 
operations is 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b), known as the “miscellaneous receipts” 
statute. Originally enacted on March 3, 1849 (ch. 110, 9 Stat. 398), 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3302(b) states: 
“Except as provided in section 3718(b) of this title, an 
official or agent of the Government receiving money for the 
Government from any source shall deposit the money in the 
Treasury as soon as practicable without deduction for any 
charge or claim.”153 
Penalties for violating 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) are found in 31 U.S.C. § 3302(d), 
and include the possibility of removal from office. In addition, if funds 
which should have been deposited in the Treasury (but were not) are lost 
or stolen, the official may be personally liable. E.g., 20 Op. Att’y Gen. 24 
(1891) (liability would attach where funds, which disbursing agent had 
placed in bank which was not an authorized depositary, were lost due to 
bank failure). 

153 The exception referenced as section 3718(b) now appears in section 3718(d). It permits 
agencies to contract for assistance in the collection of debts due the United States, and to 
pay the contractor from the amounts recovered. For a decision addressing the scope and 
application of this exception, see 72 Comp. Gen. 85 (1993).

“It is difficult to see,” said an early decision, “how a legislative prohibition 
could be more clearly expressed.” 10 Comp. Gen. 382, 384 (1931). Simply 
stated, any money an agency receives for the government from a source 
outside of the agency must be deposited into the Treasury. This means 
deposited into the general fund (“miscellaneous receipts”) of the 
Treasury,not into the agency’s own appropriations, even though the 
agency’s appropriations may be technically still “in the Treasury” until the 
agency actually spends them.154 The Comptroller of the Treasury explained 
the distinction in the following terms: 

“It [31 U.S.C. § 3302(b)] could hardly be made more 
comprehensive as to the moneys that are meant and these 
moneys are required to be paid ‘into the Treasury.’ This 
does not mean that the moneys are to be added to a fund 
that has been appropriated from the Treasury and may be in 
the Treasury or outside. [Emphasis in original.] It seems to 
me that it can only mean that they shall go into the general 
fund of the Treasury which is subject to any disposition 
which Congress might choose to make of it. This has been 
the holding of the accounting officers for many years . . . 
[citations omitted]. If Congress intended that these moneys 
should be returned to the appropriation from which a 
similar amount had once been expended it could have been 
readily so stated, and it was not.” 

22 Comp. Dec. 379, 381 (1916). See also 5 Comp. Gen. 289 (1925). 

The term “miscellaneous receipts” does not refer to any single account in 
the Treasury. Rather, it refers to a number of receipt accounts under the 
heading “General Fund.” These are all listed in the Treasury Department’s 
Federal Account Symbols and Titles Book, recently revised according to 
the Treasury Financial Manual Announcement No. A-2005-04, May 2005. 
The revised version can be accessed at www.fms.treas.gov/fastbook (last 
visited September 15, 2005). 

154 As a general proposition, an agency’s appropriations do remain “in the Treasury” until 
needed for a valid purpose. Unless Congress expressly so provides, an agency may not have 
its appropriations paid over directly to it to be held pending disbursement. 21 Comp. 
Gen. 489 (1941).

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

In addition to 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b), several other statutes require that 
moneys received in various specific contexts be deposited as 
miscellaneous receipts.155 Examples are: 

• 7 U.S.C. §§ 384, 2241, 2246, 2247 (proceeds from sale of various 
products by Secretary of Agriculture); 
• 16 U.S.C. § 499 (revenue from the national forests, such as timber sales 
and proceeds from hunting, fishing, and camping permits, subject to the 
deductions specified in 16 U.S.C. §§ 500 and 501); 
• 19 U.S.C. § 527 (customs fines, penalties, and forfeitures); 
• 40 U.S.C. § 571 (proceeds from the transfer of excess property or the 
sale of surplus public property, except as otherwise provided in 
subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 40).156 
Although it is preferable, it is not necessary that the statute use the words 
“miscellaneous receipts.” A statute requiring the deposit of funds “into the 
Treasury of the United States” will be construed as meaning the general 
fund of the Treasury. 27 Comp. Dec. 1003 (1921). 

To understand the significance of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) and related statutes, it 
is necessary to recall the provision in article I, section 9, clause 7 of the 

U.S. Constitution, the so-called “Appropriations Clause,” directing that “No 
Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of 
Appropriations made by Law.” Once money is deposited into a 
“miscellaneous receipts” account, it takes an appropriation to get it out. 
E.g., 3 Comp. Gen. 296 (1923); 2 Comp. Gen. 599, 600 (1923); 13 Comp. 
Dec. 700, 703 (1907). Thus, the effect of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) is to ensure 
155 Several specific references to miscellaneous receipts in the pre-1982 version of title 31 
were deleted in the recodification because they were regarded as covered by the general 
prescription of the new section 3302. An example is the so-called User Charge Statute. The 
pre-recodification version, 31 U.S.C. § 483a, required fees to be deposited as miscellaneous 
receipts. The current version, 31 U.S.C. § 9701, omits the requirement because, as the 
Revision Note points out, it is covered by § 3302. 

156 Section 571 stems from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 
ch. 288, 63 Stat. 377 (June 30, 1949). Prior to this law, proceeds from the sale of public 
property were required to be deposited as miscellaneous receipts under the more general 
authority of what is now 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). See Mammoth Oil Co. v. United States, 
275 U.S. 13, 34 (1927); Pan-American Petroleum & Transport Co. v. United States, 273 U.S. 
456, 502 (1927). (These are the notorious “Teapot Dome” cases.)

that the executive branch remains dependent upon the congressional 
appropriation process. Viewed from this perspective, 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) 
emerges as another element in the statutory pattern by which Congress 
retains control of the public purse under the separation of powers doctrine. 
See B-302825, Dec. 22, 2004; B-303413, Nov. 8, 2004, at 9; B-287738, May 16, 
2002; 51 Comp. Gen. 506, 507 (1972); 11 Comp. Gen. 281, 283 (1932). See 
also 10 Comp. Gen. 382, 383 (1931) (the intent is that “all the public moneys 
shall go into the Treasury; appropriations then follow”). 

As the court observed in Scheduled Airlines Traffic Offices v. Department 
of Defense, 87 F.3d 1356, 1361 (D.C. Cir. 1996), the miscellaneous receipts 
statute “derives from and safeguards a principle fundamental to our 
constitutional structure, the separation-of-powers precept embedded in the 
Appropriations Clause” (U.S. Const. art I, § 9, cl. 7). See also Kate Stith, 
Congress’ Power of the Purse, 97 Yale L. J. 1343 (1988). Professor Stith 
notes that the miscellaneous receipts statute “articulates the Principle of 
the Public Fisc: All monies of the federal government must be claimed as 
public revenues, subject to public control through constitutional 
processes.” Id. at 1364. This is indeed an important role for a statute that 
she describes as having such an “unfortunately bland and unrevealing 
name.” Id. at 1365. 

Accordingly, for an agency to retain and credit to its own appropriation 
moneys which it should have deposited into the general fund of the 
Treasury is an improper augmentation of the agency’s appropriation. This 
applies even though the appropriation is a no-year appropriation. 46 Comp. 
Gen. 31 (1966). (No-year status relates to duration, not amount.) 

Receipts in the form of “monetary credits” are treated for deposit and 
augmentation purposes the same as cash. 28 Comp. Gen. 38 (1948) (use by 
government of monetary credits received as payment for sale of excess 
electric power held unauthorized unless agency transfers corresponding 
amount from its appropriated funds to miscellaneous receipts). This will 
not apply, however, where it is clear that the appropriation or other 
legislation involved contemplates a different treatment. B-125127, Feb. 14, 
1956 (transfer to miscellaneous receipts not required where settlement of 
accounts was to be made on “net balance” basis). See also B-283731, 
Dec. 21, 1999 (Defense Department has specific statutory authority to 
accept credits under contracts for travel-related services); 62 Comp. 
Gen. 70, 74–75 (1982) (credit procedure which would differ from treatment 
of cash receipts recognized in legislative history). When an agency is 
entitled to retain a fund in its appropriations (see section E.2.a, below), it

Chapter 6

may accept the refund in the form of a credit against future payments due 
to the party owing the refund instead of requiring the party to issue a 
separate refund check. 72 Comp. Gen. 63, 64 (1992). 

(2) Exceptions 
Exceptions to the miscellaneous receipts requirement fall into two broad 
categories, statutory and nonstatutory: 

• An agency may retain moneys it receives if it has statutory authority to 
do so. In other words, 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) will not apply if there is 
specific statutory authority for the agency to retain the funds. E.g., 
72 Comp. Gen. 164, 165–66 (1993) and cases cited.157 
• Receipts that qualify as “repayments” to an appropriation may be 
retained to the credit of that appropriation and are not required to be 
deposited into the General Fund. B-302366, July 12, 2004; 6 Comp. 
Gen. 337 (1926); 5 Comp. Gen. 734, 736 (1926); B-138942-O.M., Aug. 26, 
1976. 
Repayments falling within the above nonstatutory exception may be 
further defined in terms of two general classes, reimbursements and 
refunds, as follows: 

• Reimbursements are sums received as a result of commodities sold or 
services furnished either to the public or to another government 
account, which are authorized by law to be credited directly to a 
specific appropriation. 
• Refunds are repayments for excess payments and are to be credited to 
the appropriation or fund accounts from which the excess payments 
were made. They must be directly related to previously recorded 
expenditures and are reductions of those expenditures. Refunds to 
157 In addition to instances described elsewhere in the text, the following are examples of 
statutory exceptions to section 3302(b): 42 U.S.C. § 8287 (measured savings from energy 
savings performance contracts), discussed in B-287488, June 19, 2001; 42 U.S.C. § 8256 and 
note (rebates received by federal agencies from utility companies on account of energysaving 
measures), discussed in B-265734, Feb. 13, 1996; and 38 U.S.C. § 1729A 
(compensatory settlement amounts under the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act stemming 
from care provided at Department of Veterans Affairs facilities), discussed in Memorandum 
Opinion for the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, Miscellaneous Receipts Act 
Exception for Veterans’ Health Care Recoveries, OLC Opinion, Dec. 3, 1998. 

Page 6-170 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

appropriations represent amounts collected from outside sources for 
payments made in error, overpayments, or adjustments for previous 
amounts disbursed. 

See, e.g., 62 Comp. Gen. 70, 73 (1982); see also, GAO, Policy and 
Procedures Manual for the Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 5.4 
(Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993). 

As used in the above definitions, the term “reimbursement” generally refers 
to situations in which retention by the agency is authorized by statute. The 
term “refund” embraces a category of mostly nonstatutory exceptions in 
which the receipt is directly related to, and is a direct reduction of, a 
previously recorded expenditure. Thus, the recovery of an erroneous 
payment or overpayment which was erroneous at the time it was made 
qualifies as a refund to the appropriation originally charged. E.g., 
B-139348, May 12, 1959 (utility overcharge refund); B-138942-O.M., Aug. 26, 
1976 (collections resulting from disallowances by GAO under the “Fly 
America Act”). Also, the return of an authorized advance, such as a travel 
advance, is a refund. 

At this point, an important distinction must be made. Moneys collected to 
reimburse the government for expenditures previously made are not 
automatically the same as “adjustments for previous amounts disbursed.” 
Reimbursements must generally, absent statutory authority to the contrary, 
be deposited as miscellaneous receipts. The mere fact that the 
reimbursement is related to the prior expenditure—although this is an 
indispensable element of an authorized refund—is not in itself sufficient to 
remove the transaction from the scope of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). See, e.g., 
16 Comp. Gen. 195 (1936); 24 Comp. Dec. 694 (1918); 22 Comp. Dec. 253 
(1915); B-45198, Oct. 27, 1944. The controlling principles were stated as 
follows in two early decisions: 

“The question as to whether moneys collected to reimburse 
the Government for expenditures previously made should 
be used to reimburse the appropriations from which the 
expenditures were made or should be covered into the 
general fund of the Treasury has often been before the 
accounting officers of the Treasury and this office, and it 
has been uniformly held that in the absence of an express 
provision in the statute to the contrary, such funds should 
be covered in as miscellaneous receipts.” 

Page 6-171 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

5 Comp. Gen. 289, 290 (1925). 

“On the other hand, if the collection involves a refund or 
repayment of moneys paid from an appropriation in excess 
of what was actually due such refund has been held to be 
properly for credit to the appropriation originally 
charged . . . .” 

5 Comp. Gen. 734, 736 (1926). 

The key language in the above passage is “in excess of what was actually 
due.” Apart from the more obvious situations—refunds of overpayments, 
erroneous payments, unused portions of authorized advances—the type of 
situation contemplated by the “adjustments for previous amounts 
disbursed” portion of the definition is illustrated by 23 Comp. Gen. 652 
(1944). The Agriculture Department was authorized to enter into 
cooperative agreements with states for soil conservation projects. Some 
states were prohibited by state law from making advances and were limited 
to making reimbursements after the work was performed. In these cases, 
Agriculture initially put up the state’s share and was later reimbursed. The 
Comptroller General held that Agriculture could credit the reimbursements 
to the appropriation charged for the project. The distinction between this 
type of situation and the simpler “related to a previous expenditure” 
situation in which the money must go to miscellaneous receipts lies in the 
nature of the agency’s obligation. Here, Agriculture was not required to 
contribute the state’s share; it could simply have foregone the projects in 
those states which could not advance the funds. This is different from a 
situation in which the agency is required to make a given expenditure in 
any event, subject to later reimbursement. In 23 Comp. Gen. 652, the 
agency made payments larger than it was required to make, knowing that 
the “excess” of what it paid over what it had to pay would (or at least was 
required to) be returned. See also 64 Comp. Gen. 431 (1985); 61 Comp. 
Gen. 537 (1982); B-69813, Dec. 8, 1947; B-220911.2-O.M., Apr. 13, 1988. For 
more recent decisions dealing with an agency’s authority to retain “excess” 
payments, see B-271127.2, Jan. 30, 1997; 73 Comp. Gen. 321 (1994). 

The rationale for crediting refunds to an appropriation account is to enable 
the account to be made whole for the overpayment that gave rise to the 
refund. As a recent decision pointed out, the refund exception to the 
general requirement of section 3302(b) “simply restores to the 
appropriation amounts that should not have been paid from the 
appropriation.” B-302366, July 12, 2004. It follows that the exception does 

Page 6-172 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

not permit crediting refunds to appropriations in amounts greater than the 
overpayment. The decision in B-302366 illustrates this point. In that case, 
a Department of Energy contractor turned over to the department a refund 
it had received from the State of Washington for taxes which the contractor 
had previously paid and for which it had been reimbursed by the 
department. Along with the tax refund, the contractor also turned over to 
the department an additional amount it had received from the state as 
interest on the refunded taxes. GAO agreed with the department that the 
tax refund itself could be credited to the appropriation originally used to 
reimburse the contractor for the tax payment. However, the decision held 
that the additional amount representing interest could not be credited to 
the appropriation but must be returned to the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b): 

“The nonstatutory refund exception . . . does not allow the 
department to retain the interest paid by the state. Because 
the nonstatutory exception operates simply and solely to 
restore to an appropriation amounts that should not have 
been paid from the appropriation, crediting an amount in 
excess of that paid from the appropriation would 
improperly augment the appropriation.” 

In this regard, the decision rejected the department’s suggestion that the 
interest payment could be regarded as merely restoring the appropriation 
to an amount adjusted for inflation. The decision noted that Congress does 
not appropriate on a net present value basis. Likewise, GAO has held that 
agencies may retain and credit to their appropriations refunds in the form 
of recoveries under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729) to the extent 
that they represent compensatory damages to reimburse erroneous 
payments, but not “exemplary” damages in the nature of penalties. 

B-281064, Feb. 14, 2000; 69 Comp. Gen. 260 (1990). 

For other examples of refunds that may be retained to the credit of an 
appropriation, see 65 Comp. Gen. 600 (1986) (rebates from Travel 
Management Center contractors); 62 Comp. Gen. 70 (1982) (partial 
repayment of contribution to International Natural Rubber Organization 
occasioned by addition of new members); B-139348, May 12, 1959 (refund 
of overcharge by public utility); and B-209650-O.M., July 20, 1983 (same). 

It should be noted that crediting refunds to agency appropriations is 
permissive, not mandatory. Thus, the Comptroller General advised the 
General Services Administration that rebates received from travel

management contractors could be deposited to the general fund of the 
Treasury if the small amounts involved did not justify the cost of processing 
these payments to the credit of the agency appropriation accounts that 
“earned” them. 73 Comp. Gen. 210 (1994). The Comptroller General also 
approved crediting de minimis ($100 or less) rebates to currently available 
accounts rather than the prior year accounts that earned them. 72 Comp. 
Gen. 63 (1992). However, the Comptroller General refused to extend this 
de minimis exception to rebates that could aggregate $1,000 or more. 

72 Comp. Gen. 109 (1993). 

A repayment is credited to the appropriation initially charged with the 
related expenditure, whether current or expired. If the appropriation is 
still current, then the funds remain available for further obligation within 
the time and purpose limits of the appropriation. However, if the 
appropriation has expired for obligational purposes (but has not yet been 
closed), the repayment must be credited to the expired account, not to 
current funds. See 23 Comp. Gen. 648 (1944); 6 Comp. Gen. 337 (1926); 
B-138942-O.M., Aug. 26, 1976. If the repayment relates to an expired 
appropriation, crediting the repayment to current funds is an improper 
augmentation of the current appropriation unless authorized by statute. 
B-114088, Apr. 29, 1953. These same principles apply to a refund in the 
form of a credit, such as a credit for utility overcharges. B-139348, May 12, 
1959; B-209650-O.M., July 20, 1983.158 Cf. B-260063, June 30, 1995, fn. 3 
(there is no authority for an agency to hold refunds of erroneous payments 
in an interest bearing account pending final payment to a contractor since 
such refunds should be credited to the appropriation account initially 
charged with the erroneous payment). Once an appropriation account has 
been closed in accordance with 31 U.S.C. §§ 1552(a) or 1555, repayments 
must be deposited as miscellaneous receipts regardless of how they would 
have been treated prior to closing. 31 U.S.C. § 1552(b). See also B-260993, 
June 26, 1996; B-257905, Dec. 26, 1995; 73 Comp. Gen. 210, 211 (1994). 

Where funds are authorized to be credited to an appropriation, restrictions 
on the basic appropriation apply to the credits as well as to the amount 
originally appropriated. A-95083, June 18, 1938. 

158 It should not be automatically assumed that every form of credit accruing to the 
government under a contract will qualify as a refund to the appropriation. See, e.g., 

B-302366, July 12, 2004; A-51604, May 31, 1977.

The fact that some particular reimbursement is authorized or even required 
by law is not, standing alone, sufficient to overcome 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). 
E.g., 67 Comp. Gen. 443 (1988); 22 Comp. Dec. 60 (1915); 1 Comp. Dec. 568 
(1895). The accounting for that reimbursement—whether it may be 
retained by the agency and, if so, how it is to be credited—will depend on 
the terms of the statute. Some statutes, for example, permit 
reimbursements to be credited to current appropriations regardless of 
which appropriation “earned” the reimbursement. See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. 
§ 2208(g); 10 U.S.C. § 2210(a)(1); 22 U.S.C. § 2392(c); 22 U.S.C. § 2509(g). 
As a general proposition, however, this practice, GAO has pointed out, 
diminishes congressional control.159 

As might be expected, there have been a great many decisions involving the 
miscellaneous receipts requirement. It is virtually impossible to draw 
further generalizations from the decisions other than to restate the basic 
rule: An agency must deposit into the General Fund of the Treasury any 
funds it receives from sources outside of the agency unless the receipt 
constitutes an authorized repayment or unless the agency has statutory 
authority to retain the funds for credit to its own appropriations. 

(3) Timing of deposits 
As to the timing of the deposit in the Treasury, 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) says 
merely “as soon as practicable.” There is another statute, however, now 
found at 31 U.S.C. § 3302(c), which provides in relevant part: 

“(1) A person having custody or possession of public money, 
including a disbursing official having public money not for 
current expenditure, shall deposit the money without delay 
in the Treasury or with a depositary designated by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under law. Except as provided in 
paragraph (2), money required to be deposited pursuant to 
this subsection shall be deposited not later than the third 
day after the custodian receives the money. . . . 

159 For further discussion of these concepts in the context of statutes applicable to the 
Defense Department, see GAO, Reimbursements to Appropriations: Legislative 
Suggestions for Improved Congressional Control, FGMSD-75-52 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 1, 
1976). A more recent report made a similar point in relation to agencies crediting user fee 
proceeds to their appropriations. GAO, Federal User Fees: Budgetary Treatment, Status, 
and Emerging Management Issues, GAO/AIMD-98-11 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 19, 1997). 

Page 6-175 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6

“(2) The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation 
prescribe that a person having custody or possession of 
money required by this subsection to be deposited shall 
deposit such money during a period of time that is greater or 
lesser than the period of time specified by the second 
sentence of paragraph (1).” 

This statute, formerly designated as Revised Statutes § 3621, originated on 
March 3, 1857 (ch. 114, 11 Stat. 249). It was amended on May 28, 1896 
(ch. 252, § 5, 29 Stat. 179), to specify a deadline of 30 days. The time limit 
was reduced to 3 days by section 2652(b)(1) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 
1984, Pub. L. No. 98-369, div. B. title VI, 98 Stat. 494, 1152 (July 18, 1984). 

A Treasury Department regulation urges agencies to “achieve same day 
deposit of money.” When same day deposit is not cost-effective or is 
impracticable, the regulation generally requires next-day deposit. 31 C.F.R. 
§ 206.5 (2005).160 

As a general proposition, section 3302(c) and the Treasury regulations 
place an outer limit on what is practicable under section 3302(b). 11 Comp. 
Gen. 281, 283–84 (1932); 10 Comp. Gen. 382, 385 (1931). The deadline 
applies to all receipts, including those to be credited to an appropriation 
account (which, of course, is “in the Treasury”), not just those for deposit 
as miscellaneous receipts. E.g., 10 Comp. Gen. 382. 

The deposit timing requirements of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(c) and the 
implementing Treasury regulations apply as well when public moneys are 
held by nonfederal custodians. Thus, GAO found that these requirements 
were violated where the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) allowed 
contractors to hold payments it collected on VA loans in an interest-bearing 
account for 30 days or more before transferring the payments to the 
Treasury. See GAO, Internal Controls: VA Lacked Accountability Over Its 
Direct Loan and Loan Sale Activities, GAO/AIMD-99-24 (Washington, 
D.C.: Mar. 24, 1999), at 16–18. 

160 Further guidance is contained in I Treasury Financial Manual chapter 6-8000. For 
example, the Manual provides at section 6-8030.20 that collections totaling less than 
$5,000 may be accumulated and deposited when the total reaches $5,000. However, deposits 
must be made at least weekly regardless of amount.

(4) Money received (or not received) “for the Government” 
As originally enacted, 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) required deposit into the Treasury 
of moneys received “for the use of the United States.”161 The 1982 
codification of title 31 changed this language to moneys received “for the 
Government.”162 The meaning, of course, is the same. There is no 
distinction between money received for the use of the United States and 
money received for the use of a particular agency; such a distinction would 
largely nullify the statute. 

Although the concept of money received “for the use of the United States” 
or “for the Government” does not lend itself to precise definition, both the 
Comptroller General and the courts have applied this concept broadly, 
consistent with the key role and purpose of section 3302(b), in preserving 
Congress’s constitutional power of the purse. For example, as one recent 
decision observed: 

“[T]he miscellaneous receipts statute . . . requires that 
money received for the use of the United States be 
deposited in the Treasury unless otherwise authorized by 
law. Court cases and decisions of this Office make clear 
that an agency cannot avoid the miscellaneous receipts 
statute simply by changing the form of its transactions to 
avoid the receipt of money otherwise owed to it.” 

B-303413, Nov. 8, 2004. See also B-300826, Mar. 3, 2005, at 6, noting that an 
agency cannot avoid section 3302(b) by authorizing a contractor to charge 
fees to outside parties and keep the payments in order to offset costs that 
would otherwise be borne by agency appropriations. 

Neither of the above-cited decisions actually involved transactions that 
violated section 3302(b). However, another recent Comptroller General 
opinion held that a fee arrangement between the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) and a contractor did violate 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) and 
constituted an improper augmentation of SBA’s appropriations. B-300248, 

161 Act of March 3, 1849, ch. 110, 9 Stat. 398. 
162 Pub. L. No. 97-258, § 1, 96 Stat. 877, 948 (Sept. 13, 1982).

Jan. 15, 2004.163 This case concerned SBA’s “Preferred Lender Program” 
(PLP). Lenders in this program, so-called “PLP lenders,” had authority to 
make loans without prior SBA approval; however, the law specifically 
required SBA to conduct assessments of these lenders at least annually. 
SBA contracted with a firm to assist in conducting the required 
assessments. Under the contract, assessments were conducted by a review 
team consisting of an SBA employee and one or more employees of the 
contractor. The SBA employees, of course, were paid from agency 
appropriations. However, the contractor was compensated from fees that 
SBA imposed on the PLP lenders and that the lenders paid directly to the 
contractor. 

SBA maintained that the fee proceeds did not constitute “money for the 
Government” within the application of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) since they were 
paid directly to the contractor as compensation for the contractor’s work. 
The agency also argued that “no-cost” contracts such as this were largely 
beyond the reach of the augmentation rule or section 3302(b). The 
Comptroller General rejected these arguments, holding that SBA had 
“effectively retained and used the fees without specific authorization” and 
that the agency’s “constructive disposition” of the fees violated 
section 3302(b). In essence, the opinion reasoned that the fee arrangement 
amounted to shifting to PFP lenders an expense imposed upon SBA 
incident to carrying out its statutory duties that should be borne by the 
agency’s appropriations: 

“SBA’s position . . . is in conflict with our prior decisions and 
not supported by the courts. A government official or agent 
is deemed to receive money for the government under the 
Miscellaneous Receipts Statute if the money is to be used to 
bear the expenses of the government or pay the government 
obligations. . . . SBA’s functions clearly include conducting 
oversight of PLP lenders, whether the review is conducted 
by SBA’s own employees or with the assistance of a 
contractor. These functions are among the purposes for 
which Congress appropriates funds to SBA . . . Thus the fees 
paid by PLP lenders represent expenses SBA would have to 
pay from its appropriations regardless of whether the 
expenses were for actions performed by SBA employees or 

163 The opinion also concluded that the fee arrangement was not authorized under the user 
charge statute, 31 U.S.C. § 9701, or under provisions of SBA’s organic legislation.

by a contractor’s employees. SBA has devised an 
arrangement by which another party incurs these expenses, 
in effect using the PLP review fees to substitute for 
appropriated funds in paying the cost of the PLP reviews.” 

B-300248 at 7. 

The courts also have given broad application to the section 3302(b) 
concept of money received “for the Government.” In Reeve Aleutian 
Airways, Inc. v. Rice, 789 F. Supp. 417 (D.D.C. 1992), the Air Force had 
awarded a contract to a commercial air carrier (MarkAir) to provide 
passenger and cargo service to a remote base in the Aleutian Islands. The 
carrier’s revenue would be derived almost entirely from fares either 
purchased directly or reimbursed by the United States (military personnel, 
their dependents, and government contractor employees). The contract 
granted the carrier landing rights and ground support at the base, and the 
contractor agreed to return a specified portion of its receipts as a 
“concession fee,” to be deposited in the base morale, welfare, and 
recreation fund. In upholding a disappointed bidder’s challenge to the 
award, the court stated: 

“[T]he so-called concession fees to be paid by MarkAir were 
‘public monies’ both in the sense that they would be paid by 
MarkAir exclusively to purchase the use of property of the 
United States and in the sense that the funds were or were 
derived directly from public sources—United States 
taxpayers and the creditors of the United States who have 
lent it funds to cover expenses which exceed its revenue. 
Obviously, innovation consistent with the law should be 
encouraged but this transaction so plainly violates the 
express terms of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) . . . that it should be 
nipped in the bud.” 

Reeve Aleutian Airways, 789 F. Supp. at 421. 

Since there was no authority to divert the funds from the Treasury to the 
welfare fund, and since the diversion would actually increase the cost to 
the government, the court found the contract award to be arbitrary and 
capricious and declared the contract “null, void and of no force and effect.” 
Id. at 423.

In a case it regarded as “virtually identical” to Reeve Aleutian Airways, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that a 
Department of Defense contract solicitation requiring payment of the 
portion of concession fees derived from unofficial travel to a morale fund 
rather than to the Treasury violated 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). Scheduled 
Airlines Traffic Offices, Inc. v. Department of Defense, 87 F.3d 1356, 1363 

(D.C.Cir. 1996).164 The court stated: 
“Mindful of both the plain language of the Miscellaneous 
Receipts statute and its underlying purpose to preserve 
congressional control of the appropriations power, we have 
no doubt that concession fees for unofficial travel constitute 
‘money for the Government’ within the meaning of the 
statute. Travel agents pay the fees pursuant to contracts 
awarded by agencies of the United States, doing so in 
consideration for government resources—the right to 
occupy agency office space, to utilize government services 
associated with that space, and to serve as the exclusive onsite 
travel agent.” 

Id. at 1362. The court was not persuaded by the argument that the required 
payments to the morale fund did not violate 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) since they 
were attributable entirely to commissions on unofficial travel purchased 
with private funds: 

“This argument is inconsistent with the statute’s 
unequivocal language. Government officials must deposit in 
the Treasury ‘money for the Government from any source.’ 
31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) (emphasis added). The original source 
of the money—whether from private parties or the 
government—is thus irrelevant.” 

Id.165 

164 The court’s disposition in Scheduled Airlines differed from a Comptroller General 
decision that had denied a protest against this solicitation. 73 Comp. Gen. 310 (1994). 

165 Subsequently, Congress enacted legislation that specifically authorized Defense agencies 
to enter into contracts of the type invalidated in Scheduled Airlines Traffic Offices that 
permit a portion of commissions from unofficial travel to be deposited into nonappropriated 
morale funds. 10 U.S.C. § 2646. See, in this regard, B-283731, Dec. 21, 1999.

In two decisions, GAO found that the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) and the Federal Election Commission did not violate the 
miscellaneous receipts statute when they engaged contractors to respond 
to public requests for information and to charge, and retain, fees for the 
service. In B-166506, Oct. 20, 1975, the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) had a number of contracts with private firms for the processing, 
storage, and retrieval of various kinds of recorded environmental 
information. Much of this information was of value to private parties and 
available under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552. 
Fees collected by an agency under FOIA must be deposited as 
miscellaneous receipts. Here, however, EPA proposed advising requesting 
parties to deal directly with the contractors, who would charge and retain 
fees for providing the data, although the requestors would retain the right 
to deal with EPA. GAO approved the proposal, concluding that fees 
charged by the contractors in these circumstances did not constitute 
money received for the government. 

The EPA decision viewed the contract arrangement as an alternative to the 
FOIA process for satisfying information requests and reasoned that the 
contractors acted as “independent entrepreneurs” rather than as agents of 
EPA in providing such information. The decision cautioned, however, that 
the fees charged and retained by the contractors could not exceed the fees 
which EPA could charge if it provided the services directly. Thus, the fees 
could include the direct costs of document search and duplication, but not 
costs associated with developing the information. In 61 Comp. Gen. 285 
(1982), GAO provided similar advice to the Federal Election Commission in 
connection with requests from the public for microfilm copies of its 
reports, citing B-166506, Oct. 20, 1975. 

It may be hard to reconcile the EPA and Federal Election Commission 
decisions with more recent decisions, and they should be approached with 
caution. The contractor fee arrangements in both of these cases clearly 
had at least the indirect effect of relieving the agencies of expenses 
incident to the performance of their statutory obligations that otherwise 
would have been paid from their appropriations. 

In a recent decision, GAO considered whether an agency improperly 
avoided the miscellaneous receipts statute by structuring a regulatory 
action so that money would not be owed to the government. B-303413, 
Nov. 8, 2004. The Federal Communications Commission proposed to 
provide spectrum rights to a private company through a “license 
modification” in which the company would not pay the government for the 

Page 6-181 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

spectrum but would pay certain costs incurred by it and other spectrum 
users. If the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, at 47 U.S.C. 
§ 309(j), required the Commission to license the spectrum through auction 
instead of a license modification, then the Commission’s proposed 
regulatory action would improperly avoid the government’s receipt of 
money otherwise owed to it and thus would violate the miscellaneous 
receipts statute. GAO found the Commission’s proposed regulatory action 
to be within the scope of its authority under the Federal Communications 
Act, at 47 U.S.C. § 316(a)(1), and concluded that the license modification 
did not violate the miscellaneous receipts statute. 

Both the Comptroller General and the courts have on occasion held that 
certain receipts of money did not constitute the receipt of moneys within 
the scope of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). In B-205901, May 19, 1982, a railroad had 
furnished 15,000 gallons of fuel to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) for use in an undercover investigation of thefts of diesel fuel from the 
railroad. The railroad and FBI agreed that the fuel or the proceeds from its 
sale would be returned upon completion of the investigation. In view of 
31 U.S.C. § 3302(b), the FBI then asked whether money generated from the 
sale of the fuel had to be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts. In one sense, it could be argued that the money was received “for 
the use of the United States,” in that the FBI planned to use it as evidence. 
However, the Comptroller General pointed out, this is not the kind of 
receipt contemplated by 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). The decision concluded that 
“[f]unds are received for the use of the United States only if they are to be 
used to bear the expenses of the Government or to pay the obligations of 
the United States.” Therefore, there was no legal barrier to returning the 
funds to the railroad. 

In another case, GAO held that misconduct fines levied on Job Corps 
participants by the Labor Department need not be treated as money 
received for the Government for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). The 
governing legislation specifically authorized “reductions of allowances” as 
a disciplinary measure. Labor felt that, in some cases, immediate 
collection of a cash fine from the individual’s pocket would be more 
effective. Finding a legislative intent to confer broad discretion in matters 
of enrollee discipline, GAO agreed that the cash fines could be regarded as 
a form of disciplinary allowance reduction, and accordingly credited to Job 
Corps appropriations. B-130515, Aug. 18, 1970. GAO followed the same 
approach in a similar question several years later in 65 Comp. Gen. 666, 671 
(1986). The two Job Corps decisions relied heavily on the language of the 

Page 6-182 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

program statute involved in those cases and appear to have little, if any, 
application beyond that statute. 

In 64 Comp. Gen. 217 (1985), a food service concession contract required 
the contractor to reserve a percentage of income to be used for the 
replacement of government-owned equipment. The reserve was found not 
to constitute money for the Government within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3302(b). GAO distinguished an earlier decision, 35 Comp. Gen. 113 
(1955), on the basis that the reserve here constituted “a mere bookkeeping 
entry” whereas the proposal in the 1955 case would have required the 
actual transfer of funds to a bank account. 64 Comp. Gen. at 219. 

In Thomas v. Network Solutions, Inc., 176 F.3d 500 (D.C. Cir. 1999), cert. 
denied, 528 U.S. 1115 (2000), the court concluded that fees charged by a 
party to a cooperative agreement did not constitute money for the 
government and thus were not subject to deposit into the Treasury under 
31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). In Thomas, the National Science Foundation (NSF) 
entered into a cooperative agreement with Network Solutions to register 
Internet domain names and provide related services to the registrants. In 
return, Network Solutions was permitted to charge registrants a fee and to 
retain the fee as payment for its services. The plaintiff domain registrants 
challenged the legality of the registration fees. Relying in part on the 
above-cited Comptroller General decisions dealing with EPA and the 
Federal Election Commission, the plaintiffs asserted, among other things, 
that the fees exceeded the amount that NSF itself could have imposed 
under the user charges statute, 31 U.S.C. § 9701, had the agency provided 
domain registration services directly. The court rejected this argument and 
distinguished the Comptroller General decisions on the basis that Network 
Solutions was not assisting NSF in performing a statutory duty imposed 
upon it. Since Congress did not require NSF or any other federal agency to 
register Internet domain names, the registration was not a government 
service. Thus, neither 31 U.S.C. § 9701 nor 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) applied. 
Thomas, 176 F.3d at 510–12. 

Finally, several of the trust fund cases discussed hereafter in section E.2.h 
of this chapter also address the money received “for the Government” 
concept. As explained in section E.2.h, the general rule is that funds 
properly received by an agency in a trust capacity are not subject to section 
3302(b); however, there are exceptions and limits to this general rule.

b. Contract Matters (1) Excess reprocurement costs 
We use the term “excess reprocurement costs” here to include two 
factually different but conceptually related situations: 

• Original contractor defaults. Agency still needs the work done and 
contracts with someone else to complete the work, almost invariably at 
a cost higher than the original contract price. Original contractor is 
liable to the government for these “excess reprocurement costs.” 
• Defective work by original contractor. Agency incurs additional 
expense to correct defective work. Contractor is liable for the amount 
of this additional expense. 
Disposition of amounts recovered in these situations has generated 
numerous cases. Generally, the answer depends on the timing of the 
recovery in relation to the agency’s reprocurement or corrective action and 
the status of the applicable appropriation. The objective is to avoid the 
depletion of currently available appropriations to get what the government 
was supposed to get under the original obligation. The rules were 
summarized, and the case law reviewed, in 65 Comp. Gen. 838 (1986). 

The rules are as follows: 

• If, at the time of the recovery from the original contractor, the agency 
has not yet incurred the additional expense, the agency may retain the 
amount recovered to the extent necessary to fund the reprocurement 
or corrective measures. The collection is credited to the appropriation 
obligated for the original contract, without regard to the status of that 
appropriation. Even if that appropriation has expired and is generally 
no longer available for obligation, it usually can still be used to fund the 
reprocurement or corrective measures under the “replacement 
contract” theory until it closes.166 
166 See Chapter 5, section B.6. The basic rule is that where it becomes necessary to 
terminate a contract because of the contractor’s default, the funds obligated under the 
original contract are available, beyond their original period of availability, for purposes of 
funding a contract to complete the unfinished work. Id. As discussed in section B.6, certain 
conditions must be met in order to invoke the replacement contract rule. Excess 
reprocurement costs recovered from defaulting contractors cannot be retained by an 
agency in its appropriations and applied to a new contract if the reprocurement does not 
constitute an appropriate replacement contract. Cf. B-242274, Aug. 27, 1991 (applying this 
principle in the context of recovered liquidated damages).

• If, at the time of recovery from the original contractor, the agency has 
already incurred the additional reprocurement or corrective expense, 
the agency may retain the recovery for credit to the applicable 
appropriation, to the extent necessary to reimburse itself, if that 
appropriation is still available for obligation. 
• If the appropriation has expired and is no longer available for 
obligation, the recovery should go to miscellaneous receipts.167 
These rules apply equally to default and defective work situations but vary 
with the type and status of the appropriation involved. If the appropriation 
used to fund the original contract is a no-year appropriation, the recovery 
may be credited to that appropriation regardless of whether the agency has 
or has not yet actually incurred the additional costs. If the appropriation is 
an annual or multiple year appropriation and the agency has not yet 
incurred the additional costs as of the time of recovery, the agency may 
credit the collection to the appropriation regardless of whether it is still 
current or expired up until the time the account closes. In the case of an 
annual or multiple year appropriation, where the agency has already 
incurred the reprocurement or corrective costs as of the time of recovery, 
the agency may retain the recovery if the appropriation is still available for 
obligation, but not if it has expired. (Where the excess costs have already 
been incurred and the appropriation has expired at the time of recovery, it 
is too late to avoid a depletion of currently available funds.) 

Prior to 1983, essentially two separate lines of cases dealt with defective 
work and default. The defective work cases had always applied the above 
principles, although not necessarily in those terms. Some illustrative cases 
are summarized below: 

• Supplies delivered by a contractor were found upon inspection to be 
unsatisfactory for use, that is, not in accordance with the terms of the 
contract. A refund by the contractor could be credited to the 
167 In 1990, subsequent to the decision in 65 Comp. Gen. 838 and many of the other decisions 
discussed in this section, Congress amended the statutory provisions applicable to the 
closing of appropriation accounts and the disposition of account balances. See generally 
Chapter 5, section D. These statutory changes do not fundamentally affect the substantive 
rules discussed in this section, although the changes they make in the time periods that 
appropriation accounts retain their identity after they expire for obligation purposes and 
before they close may affect the practical application of those rules in particular 
circumstances.

appropriation originally charged, on the theory that the payment was 
improperly made from the appropriation in the first instance. The 
appropriation involved was an annual appropriation, and the corrective 
costs had not been paid as of the time of the recovery. 8 Comp. 
Gen. 103 (1928). 

• An amount recovered from a contractor’s surety because the work 
failed to meet specifications, after the contractor had received final 
payment, was regarded as in the nature of a reduction in contract price 
representing the value of unfinished work, and therefore amounted to 
the recovery of an unauthorized overpayment. It could thus be 
deposited in the appropriation charged with the contract and expended 
for completion of the work. The appropriation involved was a no-year 
appropriation. 34 Comp. Gen. 577 (1955). 
• Recovery for defective work could be credited to an expired annual 
appropriation. Because the corrective work had not yet been 
undertaken, the funds would remain available for that corrective work 
under the “replacement contract” theory. 44 Comp. Gen. 623 (1965). 
In default cases, however, the decisions had consistently held for several 
decades that excess reprocurement costs recovered from defaulting 
contractors had to be deposited as miscellaneous receipts.168 

The two lines of cases met in a 1983 decision, 62 Comp. Gen. 678. That 
decision recognized that there was no real reason to distinguish between 
default and defective work for purposes of accounting for recoveries. The 
rules should be the same in both situations. Accordingly, 62 Comp. 
Gen. 678 modified the prior default cases and held, in effect, that the rules 
previously applied in the defective work cases should be applied in the 
future to all excess reprocurement cost cases “without reference to the 
event that gave rise to the need for the replacement contract—that is, 
whether occasioned by a default or by defective workmanship.” Id. at 681. 
The decision further held that the Bureau of Prisons could retain damages 

168 E.g., 46 Comp. Gen. 554 (1966); 40 Comp. Gen. 590 (1961); 27 Comp. Gen. 117 (1947); 
14 Comp. Gen. 729 (1935); 14 Comp. Gen. 106 (1934); 10 Comp. Gen. 510 (1931); 8 Comp. 
Gen. 284 (1928); 26 Comp. Dec. 877 (1920); 23 Comp. Dec. 352 (1916); A-26073, Mar. 20, 1929, 
aff’d upon reconsideration, A-26073, Aug. 8, 1929; A-24614, June 20, 1929. The rule was 
applied regardless of whether the funds were actually collected back from the contractor or 
merely withheld from future contract payments due. 52 Comp. Gen. 45 (1972).

recovered from a contractor charged with defective work, for credit to the 
appropriation which had been used to replace the defective work. 

The 1983 decision added another new element: Where the recovery, by 
virtue of factors such as inflation or underbidding, exceeds the amount 
paid to the original contractor, any amounts recovered over and above 
what is actually necessary to fund the reprocurement or corrective work 
(or to reimburse the appropriation charged with that work, if it is still 
currently available) must be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts. Authority to retain funds enables the agency to get what it 
originally bargained for, not to make a “profit” on the transaction. 

62 Comp. Gen. at 683. 

Logically, the proceeds of a forfeited performance bond should be available 
to the contracting agency if and to the extent necessary to fund a 
replacement contract to complete the work of the original contract, and 
this was the holding in 64 Comp. Gen. 625 (1985). 

In 65 Comp. Gen. 838 (1986), GAO reviewed the evolution of the case law 
on excess reprocurement costs, restated the rules, and pointed out that in 
no case had GAO approved agency retention of recovered funds where the 
reprocurement or corrective costs “had already been paid from an 
appropriation which, at the time of the recovery, was no longer available 
for obligation.” Id. at 841 n.5. 

Before leaving the subject, it may be helpful to again summarize the rules in 
a slightly different manner. Considering the status and the timing of agency 
action, in the following five categories, an agency may retain amounts 
recovered to the extent necessary to fund the reprocurement or corrective 
work, or to reimburse itself for costs already incurred: 

• No-year appropriation where recovery was made before agency incurs 
additional costs. 
• No-year appropriation where additional costs were incurred prior to 
recovery. 
• Annual or multiple year appropriation where recovery is made before 
the agency incurs additional costs and the appropriation is still current 
at time of recovery. 
Page 6-187 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

• Annual or multiple year appropriation where additional costs were 
incurred prior to recovery and the appropriation is still current at time 
of recovery. 
• Annual or multiple year appropriation where recovery is made before 
the agency incurs additional costs and the appropriation expired at 
time of recovery. 
Finally, the recovery goes to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts when 
an agency has annual or multiple year appropriations where additional 
costs were incurred prior to recovery and the appropriation had expired at 
time of recovery. 

(2) Other damage claims 
One form of other damage claims is liquidated damages. Liquidated 
damages constitute a specific amount of money stipulated in advance by 
the contracting parties as the measure of damages for certain breaches of 
the contract, such as failure to meet applicable performance deadlines. See 
B-148493, Mar. 25, 1963. See also 44 Comp. Gen. 623 (1965). The traditional 
rule for liquidated damages is that they may be credited to the 
appropriation originally charged in circumstances similar to those 
applicable to excess reprocurement costs, as discussed above. 44 Comp. 
Gen. 623; 23 Comp. Gen. 365 (1943); 9 Comp. Gen. 398 (1930); 18 Comp. 
Dec. 430 (1911). See also B-237421, Sept. 11, 1991. The rationale for 
retaining liquidated damages in the appropriation account rather than 
depositing them in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts is that liquidated 
damages effect an authorized reduction in the price of the individual 
contract concerned, and also that this would make the damages available 
for return to the contractor should the liability subsequently be relieved. 
B-242274, Aug. 27, 1991. However, where this rationale does not apply—for 
example, in a case where the contractor did nothing and therefore earned 
nothing and remission of liquidated damages under 41 U.S.C. § 256a169 had 
been denied—the liquidated damages should be deposited in the Treasury 
as miscellaneous receipts. 46 Comp. Gen. 554 (1966). Likewise, as in 

169 This section provides that whenever a federal contract includes a provision for liquidated 
damages for delay, the Secretary of the Treasury may, upon the recommendation of the head 
of the procuring agency, remit all or part of the damages if such action would be just and 
equitable. The Comptroller General formerly exercised this remission function, but it was 
transferred by law to the executive branch in 1996. See the codification note following 
41 U.S.C. § 256a. 

Page 6-188 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

B-242274, Aug. 27, 1991, liquidated damages cannot be retained and used to 
fund reprocurements that do not constitute “replacement contracts” for the 
contract that gave rise to the liquidated damages. 

In some liquidated damage situations, the agency will not have incurred 
any additional reprocurement or corrective costs. This might happen in a 
case where an agency received liquidated damages for delay in 
performance but the contractor’s performance, though late, was otherwise 
satisfactory. In other cases, however, the agency will incur additional 
costs. In the situation described in 46 Comp. Gen. 554, for example, the 
agency would presumably need to reprocure, in which event it could retain 
the liquidated damages in accordance with the rules for excess 
reprocurement costs just discussed. 64 Comp. Gen. 625 (1985) (modifying 
46 Comp. Gen. 554 to that extent). Consistent with these rules, liquidated 
damages credited to an expired appropriation may not be used for work 
which is not part of a legitimate replacement contract. B-242274, Aug. 27, 
1991. 

(3) Refunds and credits 
As discussed previously, the general rule is that refunds, which include 
returns of erroneous or excess contract payments as well as adjustments to 
previous contract payments, represent an exception to the miscellaneous 
receipts deposit requirement of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) and are to be credited 
to the appropriation or fund accounts from which the original payments 
were made.170 Thus, refunds received by the government under a price 
redetermination clause may be credited to the appropriation from which 
the contract was funded. 33 Comp. Gen. 176 (1953). Contra 24 Comp. 
Gen. 847, 851 (1945).171 

Refunds received by the government under a warranty clause may be 
considered as an adjustment in the contract price and therefore credited to 
the appropriation originally charged under the contract. 34 Comp. Gen. 145 
(1954). The same result applies where the warranty refund is in the form of 
a replacement purchase credit. 27 Comp. Gen. 384 (1948). (These cases 

170 See section E.2.a of this chapter and 65 Comp. Gen. 600 (1986). 

171 The 1953 decision is inconsistent with the 1945 decision on this point and appears to have 
effectively overruled the latter decision.

are conceptually related to the “defective work” cases discussed earlier, 
and the result follows logically from the result in those cases.) 

Not all contract adjustments qualify as “refunds” for purposes of the 
section 3302(b) exception. In B-265727, July 19, 1996, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) asked whether it could reduce its obligation 
of appropriated funds for its building lease to reflect the reduced rent SEC 
paid as a result of a sublease. Under the arrangement in question, an SEC 
employee group subleased parking in the building from the SEC but paid 
the landlord directly for this sublease. SEC deducted these payments 
under the sublease from its own lease payments. Relying on the two cases 
cited above—34 Comp. Gen. 145 and 27 Comp. Gen. 384—SEC argued that 
the sublease payment was a “refund” that it could use to reduce the rental 
payments from its appropriations. GAO rejected this argument, holding 
that SEC’s use of amounts paid by the sublessee to reduce the obligation 
created by SEC’s own lease with the landlord constituted an improper 
augmentation of its appropriations. The decision stated: 

“In situations where we treated a contract adjustment or 
price renegotiation as a refund that could be credited to an 
appropriation like those cited by the SEC . . . the ‘refund’ 
reflected a change in the amount the government owed its 
contractor based on the contractor’s performance or a 
change in the government’s requirements.” 

 It went on to point out that neither of these factors was present in the SEC 
case. 

A different type of credit was discussed in 53 Comp. Gen. 872 (1974). 
Prospective timber sale purchasers were to be required to make certain 
property surveys, the cost of which would be credited against the sale 
price. Forest Service appropriations had previously financed the surveys. 
GAO viewed the proposal as an unauthorized augmentation of those 
appropriations. Similarly, the Department of Agriculture could not apply 
savings in the form of credits accrued under a contract for the handling of 
food stamp sales receipts to offset the cost of a separate data collection 
contract, even though both contracts were necessary to the same program 
objective. A-51604, May 31, 1977. 

Credits in the form of rebates may be credited to agency accounts where 
they meet the criteria for refunds, that is, they represent adjustments to 
previous expenditures from those accounts and thus serve to make the 

Page 6-190 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

accounts whole. In 65 Comp. Gen. 600 (1986), GAO held that agencies 
could credit rebates of travel agent commissions to the appropriations 
charged with the costs of federal employee travel that included those 
commissions. See also 73 Comp. Gen. 210 (1994); 72 Comp. Gen. 109 
(1993); 72 Comp. Gen. 63 (1992). On the other hand, rebates that do not 
meet these criteria must be deposited into the Treasury pursuant to 
31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) unless the agency has specific statutory authority to 
retain them. Thus, in a 1996 decision, GAO observed that energy efficiency 
rebates received by the SEC from a local utility company did not meet the 
criteria for refunds. B-265734, Feb. 13, 1996, at fn. 1. Nevertheless, GAO 
held that, because SEC had the necessary specific statutory authority,172 it 
could credit half of an energy efficiency rebate to the accounts that funded 
its energy and water conservation activities. 

Recoveries of amounts paid under fraudulent contracts constitute 
“refunds” that may be deposited to the credit of the appropriation charged 
with the payments until the appropriation account is closed. Once the 
account is closed, the recoveries should be deposited to the general fund of 
the Treasury to the credit of the appropriate receipt account. B-257905, 
Dec. 26, 1995. 

If a contract requires the government to pay a deposit on containers and 
provides for a refund by the contractor of the deposit upon return of the 
empty containers by the government, the refund may be credited to the 
appropriation from which the deposit was paid. B-8121, Jan. 30, 1940. 
However, if the contract establishes a time limit for the government to 
return the empty containers and provides further that thereafter title to the 
containers shall be deemed to pass to the government, a refund received 
from the contractor after expiration of the time limit is treated as a sale of 
surplus property and must be deposited as miscellaneous receipts. 

23 Comp. Gen. 462 (1943). 

(4) “No-cost” contracts 
The federal government sometimes enters into so-called “no-cost” 
contracts to obtain services. Typically, the contractor receives no 
compensation from the government. B-300248, Jan. 15, 2004. In 63 Comp. 
Gen. 459 (1984), GAO considered whether the Federal Communications 

172 See 42 U.S.C. § 8256(c)(5)(A), which authorizes such credits for most agencies, subject to 
appropriation.

Commission could accept offers from industry trade show promoters of 
“rent-free” exhibition space and “other free services” intended to entice the 
Commission to participate in industry trade shows. The Commission’s 
participation in a trade show entailed erecting an exhibition booth and 
placing staff members and equipment there for the duration of the show in 
order to educate the public and respond to questions about the 
Commission and its activities. Id. at 459–60. The Commission felt that it 
could not afford to rent space from the promoters; the promoters, realizing 
that the Commission’s presence at their show would be a “drawing card,” 
offered the Commission rent-free space, as well as free electricity and 
other services necessary to support the Commission’s display. Id. GAO 
found a “mutually beneficial arrangement” between the Commission and 
the promoters, although it did not refer to the mutually beneficial 
arrangement as a no-cost contract: 

“[I]t is to the advantage of the promoters to solicit the 
Commission’s participation and to waive the usual fees. [At 
the same time,] acceptance of the free space and services 
affords [the Commission] with an additional opportunity to 
inform the public . . . at no increased cost to the agency.” 

Id. 

Several recent GAO decisions have addressed no-cost contracts in relation 
to the miscellaneous receipts statue, 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). As a study of 
these decisions will show, an agency considering a no-cost contract should 
approach the proposed contract with a great deal of care lest the agency 
find that it has incurred a constructive augmentation. 

In one case, a no-cost contract arrangement was specifically authorized by 
law and thus obviously did not violate section 3302(b). See B-283731, 
Dec. 21, 1999 (no-cost contract for travel services authorized by 10 U.S.C. 
§ 2646). In two related decisions, GAO also held that the General Services 
Administration’s proposed no-cost national real estate brokers contract 
would not violate section 3302(b). B-302811, July 12, 2004; B-291947, 
Aug. 15, 2003. Under the proposed contract, real estate brokers would 
provide lease acquisition and related services to federal agencies without 
cost to the government. Rather, consistent with industry practice, their 
compensation would take the form of commissions paid by the lessors. In 
affirming the legality of this arrangement, the decision in B-302811 
observed: 

Page 6-192 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

“Because the contract was constructed as a no cost 
contract, GSA will have no financial liability to brokers, and 
brokers will have no expectation of a payment from GSA. 
The acceptance of services without payment pursuant to a 
valid, binding no-cost contract does not augment an 
agency’s appropriation nor does it violate the voluntary 
services prohibition. Although the brokers contract clearly 
expects that brokers will be remunerated by commissions 
from landlords, as is a common practice in the real estate 
industry, GSA does not require landlords to pay 
commissions. If a landlord were to fail to pay a broker, the 
broker would have no claim against GSA.” 

However, the fact that an agency makes no direct payment for contractor 
services does not necessarily mean that arrangement constitutes a no-cost 
contract with no implications under 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). In B-300248, 
Jan. 15, 2004, discussed at length in section E.2 of this chapter, the 
contractor was compensated from fees that the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) imposed on lenders and that the lenders paid directly 
to the contractor. The opinion rejected SBA’s argument that the “no-cost” 
nature of the contract took it outside the application of the normal 
augmentation and miscellaneous receipts principles: 

“SBA’s assertion regarding no-cost contracts . . . is 
misplaced. Although we have observed that no-cost 
contracts do not per se violate the prohibition against 
augmentation, we have neither applied nor endorsed the 
principle that an agency may avoid the prohibition merely 
by requiring third parties to pay for an agency’s contractual 
commitment.” 

GAO’s opinion in B-302811, July 12, 2004, elaborated on the distinction 
between the SBA contract, which was found to be a “constructive 
augmentation” in violation of section 3302(b), and the GSA contract, which 
did not constitute an illegal augmentation: 

“The important difference between the GSA and SBA 
contracts is that under GSA’s contract with brokers, brokers 
offer their services without any expectation of payment 
from GSA, whereas under SBA’s contract, the contractor 
offered its services only after SBA agreed to impose a fee on

Property and Other Tort 
Liability 
its preferred lenders to cover the contractor’s costs and to 
require the lenders to pay that fee to the contractor.” 

As a general proposition, amounts recovered by the government for loss or 
damage to government property cannot be credited to the appropriation 
available to repair or replace the property, but must be deposited in the 
Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. B-287738, May 16, 2002 (damage to 
government buildings); 64 Comp. Gen. 431 (1985) (damage to government 
motor vehicle); 26 Comp. Gen. 618 (1947) (recovery from insurance 
company for damage to government vehicle); 3 Comp. Gen. 808 (1924) 
(loss of Coast Guard vessel resulting from collision).173 While the recovery 
may well be “related” to a prior expenditure for repair of the property, it 
does not constitute a refund in the form of an “adjustment” of a previous 
disbursement that would qualify for crediting to agency accounts. 
64 Comp. Gen. 431, 433 (1985). 

There are statutory exceptions to this general proposition. One involves 
property purchased and maintained by the General Services Administration 
from the General Supply Fund, a revolving fund established by 40 U.S.C. 
§ 321. By virtue of 40 U.S.C. § 321(b)(2), recoveries for loss or damage to 
General Supply Fund property are credited to the General Supply Fund. 
This includes recoveries from other federal agencies for damage to GSA 
motor pool vehicles. 59 Comp. Gen. 515 (1980). 

Another is 16 U.S.C. § 579c, which authorizes the Forest Service to retain 
the proceeds of bond forfeitures resulting from failure to complete 
performance under a permit or timber sale contract, and money received 
from a judgment, compromise, or settlement of a government claim for 
present or potential damage to lands or improvements under the 
administration of the Forest Service. If the receipt exceeds the amount 
necessary to complete the required work or make the needed repairs, the 
excess must be transferred to miscellaneous receipts. This provision is 
discussed in 67 Comp. Gen. 276 (1988), holding that the proceeds of a bond 
forfeiture could be used to reimburse a general Forest Service 
appropriation which had been charged with the cost of repairs. 

173 Additional cases for this proposition are 35 Comp. Gen. 393 (1956); 28 Comp. Gen. 476 
(1949); 15 Comp. Gen. 683 (1936); 5 Comp. Gen. 928 (1926); 20 Comp. Dec. 349 (1913); 
14 Comp. Dec. 87 (1907); and 9 Comp. Dec. 174 (1902).

In addition, where an agency has statutory authority to retain income 
derived from the use or sale of certain property, and the governing 
legislation evinces an intent for the particular program or activity to be selfsustaining, 
the agency may also retain recoveries for loss or damage to that 
property. 27 Comp. Gen. 352 (1947) (recovery from party responsible for 
loss or damage); 24 Comp. Gen. 847 (1945) (recovery from insurer); 
22 Comp. Gen. 1133 (1943) (same). 

There is also a nonstatutory exception to the general proposition. Where a 
private party responsible for loss or damage to government property agrees 
to replace it in kind or to have it repaired to the satisfaction of the proper 
government officials and to make payment directly to the party making the 
repairs, the arrangement is permissible and the agency is not required to 
transfer an amount equal to the cost of the repair or replacement to 
miscellaneous receipts.174 This principle was first recognized in 14 Comp. 
Dec. 310 (1907) and has been followed, either explicitly or implicitly, ever 
since. E.g., B-287738, May 16, 2002; 67 Comp. Gen. 510 (1988); B-87636, 
Aug. 4, 1949; B-128209-O.M., July 12, 1956. The exception applies even 
though the money would have to go to miscellaneous receipts if the 
responsible party paid it directly to the government. 67 Comp. Gen. at 511; 
B-87636, Aug. 4, 1949. For an apparent “exception to the exception” based 
on the specific legislation involved, see 28 Comp. Gen. 476 (1949). 

Logically, the nonstatutory exception in 14 Comp. Dec. 310 appears difficult 
to support. It is, in fact, an extremely rare instance in which decisions have 
sanctioned doing indirectly something that cannot be done directly. Be 
that as it may, the exception has been followed since 1907 and appears 
firmly entrenched. Thus, in B-128209-O.M., July 12, 1956, GAO addressed 
the relationship between 14 Comp. Dec. 310 and 28 Comp. Gen. 476, stating 
that “14 Comp. Dec. 310 has been followed for almost 50 years and we have 
never expressed disagreement with the conclusion reached therein.” The 
exception does not disturb the rule itself; it is “nothing more than an 
exception that may be advantageous if the timing of repair and payment 
can be made to coincide.” 64 Comp. Gen. 431, 433 (1985). 

174 A 1943 case suggested a different result, that is, the agency might have to transfer the 
value of the repairs to miscellaneous receipts, if the agency had a specific appropriation for 
repair or replacement of the property in question. 22 Comp. Gen. 1133, 1137 (1943). GAO 
indicated in 67 Comp. Gen. 510 (1988) that this would not be the case, although 67 Comp. 
Gen. 510 did not deal with a specific repair appropriation, which would appear to be a rare 
case in any event.

Compensation paid by an insurance company for damage to government 
property caused by a contractor may not be used to augment the agency’s 
appropriation used for the contract. Therefore, absent specific statutory 
authority, the moneys, whether paid to the government or to the contractor, 
are for deposit into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. B-287738, 
May 16, 2002; 67 Comp. Gen. 129 (1987); 48 Comp. Gen. 209 (1968). The 
retention of insurance proceeds was also at issue in B-93322, Apr. 19, 1950, 
an apparent exception based on the particular circumstances involved. In 
that case, the General Services Administration had entered into a contract 
for renovation of the Executive Mansion. The contract required the 
contractor to carry adequate fire and hazard insurance. The renovation 
project had been undertaken under a specific appropriation which was 
enough for the initial cost but would not have been sufficient for repairs in 
the event of a fire or other hazard. Since the renovation was a “particular 
job of a temporary nature,” and since a contrary result would defeat the 
purpose of the appropriation, the Comptroller General held that insurance 
proceeds received if a covered risk occurred could be retained and used for 
the cost of repairs. Id. at 4.175 

The rule that recoveries for loss or damage to government property must 
be deposited as miscellaneous receipts applies equally to recoveries from 
common carriers for government property lost or damaged in transit. 
46 Comp. Gen. 31 (1966); 28 Comp. Gen. 666 (1949); 22 Comp. Dec. 703 
(1916); 22 Comp. Dec. 379 (1916). There is a narrow exception in cases 
where the freight bill on the shipment of the property lost or damaged 
equals or exceeds the amounts paid for repairs and both are payable from 
the same appropriation, in which event the bill is reduced and the amount 
deducted to cover the cost of repairs is allowed to remain to the credit of 
the appropriation. 21 Comp. Dec. 632 (1915), as amplified by 8 Comp. 
Gen. 615 (1929) and 28 Comp. Gen. 666 (1949). The rule and exception are 
discussed in 46 Comp. Gen. 31 and in B-4494, Sept. 19, 1939. Also, as with 
receipts in general, the miscellaneous receipts requirement does not apply 
if the appropriation or fund involved is made reimbursable by statute. 
46 Comp. Gen. at 33–34. 

In 50 Comp. Gen. 545 (1971), the Comptroller General held that the 
requirement to deposit as miscellaneous receipts recoveries from carriers 
for property lost or damaged in transit does not apply to operating funds of 

175 As these cases demonstrate, the government occasionally purchases insurance; however, 
it is a self-insurer in most areas. See generally Chapter 4, section C.10.

the National Credit Union Administration. The decision noted that, under 
12 U.S.C. § 1755, the Administration’s funds consist entirely of fees and 
assessments collected from member credit unions and do not include any 
general revenue appropriations. Thus, the recoveries should go to the 
source that bore the costs of the transactions that gave rise to them. 

What happens when one federal agency damages the property of another 
agency? Under the so-called “interdepartmental waiver doctrine,” the 
general rule is that funds available to the agency causing the damage may 
not be used to pay claims for damages by the agency whose property 
suffered the damage. 65 Comp. Gen. 910, 911 (1986); 46 Comp. Gen. 586, 
587 (1966). The interdepartmental waiver doctrine is based primarily on 
the concept that property of the various agencies is not the property of 
separate entities but rather of the government as a single entity, and there 
can be no reimbursement by the government for damages to or loss of its 
own property. B-302962, June 10, 2005; 46 Comp. Gen. at 586, 587. 
However, as GAO pointed out in B-302962, this general rule also has a wellestablished 
exception: 

“The interdepartmental waiver doctrine does not apply . . . 
where an agency has statutory authority to retain income 
derived from the use or sale of certain property, and the 
governing legislation shows an intent for the particular 
program or activity to be self-sustaining. 24 Comp. Gen. 847 
(1945). Thus, where an agency operation is financed 
through reimbursements or a revolving fund, the prohibition 
does not apply. 65 Comp. Gen. 910 (1986). See also 3 Comp. 
Gen. 74, 75 (1923). In such cases, the agency should recover 
amounts sufficient to cover loss or damage to property 
financed by the reimbursements or revolving fund, 
regardless of whether that damage is caused by another 
federal agency or a private party, and deposit those funds 
into the revolving fund. See 65 Comp. Gen. 910. The 
rationale for this exception is that the revolving fund, 
established to operate like a self-sustaining business, should 
not bear the cost for ‘other than objects for which the fund 
was created.’ Id.” 

The decision in B-302962 held that the exception to the interdepartmental 
waiver doctrine applied in the case of damage to facilities of the National 
Archives and Records Administration whose operations were financed by a 
revolving fund. Thus, the Administration should collect from other federal 

Page 6-197 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

agencies, their contractors, or the Administration’s own contractors, as the 
case may be, amounts sufficient to repair damages they caused to the 
Administration’s facilities and deposit those amounts into the revolving 
fund. 

While the preceding cases involved loss or damage to property, the United 
States may also recover amounts resulting from tortious injury to persons, 
for example, under the so-called Federal Medical Care Recovery Act, 
42 U.S.C. § 2651. See, e.g., 57 Comp. Gen. 781 (1978). Such recoveries, 
absent express congressional authorization, must be deposited in the 
Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. 52 Comp. Gen. 125 (1972). Because of 
a statutory exception to the miscellaneous receipts statute, the Department 
of Veterans Affairs may retain recoveries under the Federal Medical Care 
Recovery Act to the extent of medical care or services furnished under 
chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code. The recoveries may be deposited 
into the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Care Collections Fund. 
Memorandum Opinion for the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, 

Miscellaneous Receipts Act Exception for Veterans’ Health Care 
Recoveries, OLC Opinion, Dec. 3, 1998 (construing 38 U.S.C. § 1729A). 

A case involving the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees Claims Act 
of 1964, 31 U.S.C. § 3721, provides a good illustration of an adjustment to a 
prior disbursement, that is, an authorized refund which the agency may 
retain for credit to the disbursing appropriation. The statute authorizes 
agencies to pay claims by their employees for personal property lost or 
damaged incident to service. In cases where there may be third-party 
liability (e.g., an insurer or carrier), the agency has a choice. It may pay the 
entire amount of the employee’s claim and be subrogated to the employee’s 
claim against the third party, or it may require the employee to pursue the 
third-party claim first. If the agency chooses the former option, it may 
retain any third-party recoveries for credit to the appropriation used to pay 
the claim. 61 Comp. Gen. 537 (1982). An agency adopting the former 
policy, the decision stated, 

“will be making payments in some cases that are, strictly 
speaking, higher than are required. In such cases, it is 
entirely legitimate to treat a third-party recovery as a 
reduction in the amount previously disbursed rather than as 
an augmentation of the agency’s appropriation.”

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

A comparison of 61 Comp. Gen. 537 to the Federal Medical Care Recovery 
Act case discussed above, 52 Comp. Gen. 125 (1972), illustrates the 
distinction previously discussed with respect to applying the definition of 
“refund”—61 Comp. Gen. 537 is an example of an adjustment to an amount 
previously disbursed; 52 Comp. Gen. 125 illustrates a collection which must 
go to miscellaneous receipts even though it is “related” to a prior 
expenditure. 

Federal agencies must have statutory authority both (1) to charge fees for 
their programs and activities in the first instance and (2), even if they have 
fee-charging authority, to retain in their appropriations and use the 
amounts collected. See, e.g., B-300826, Mar. 3, 2005; B-300248, Jan. 15, 
2004. Thus, fees and commissions paid either to the government itself or to 
a government employee for activities relating to official duties must be 
deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, absent statutory 
authority to the contrary. 

In the case of fees paid directly to the government, the result is a simple 
application of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). Thus, the following items must be 
deposited as miscellaneous receipts: 

• Commissions from the use of pay telephones in government buildings. 
59 Comp. Gen. 213 (1980); 44 Comp. Gen. 449 (1965); 23 Comp. 

Gen. 873 (1944); 14 Comp. Gen. 203 (1934); 5 Comp. Gen. 354 (1925); 

B-4906, Oct. 11, 1951. 

• Fees and related reimbursable incidental expenses paid to the 
Department of Agriculture in connection with the investigation of and 
issuance of certifications of quality on certain farm products. 2 Comp. 
Gen. 677 (1923). 
• Fees collected under the Freedom of Information Act. 4B Op. Off. 
Legal Counsel 684, 687 (1980). 
• Fees for copying and shipping documents by the Office of Federal 
Housing Enterprise Oversight as part of discovery in administrative 
proceedings before that agency. B-302825, Dec. 22, 2004. 
Of course, if and to the extent expressly authorized by statute an agency 
may retain fees and use them to offset operating costs. See, e.g., 2 U.S.C. 
§ 68-7(b) (fees and other charges collected for services provided by the 
Senate Office of Public Records); 7 U.S.C. § 7333(k)(3) (fees for certain

services collected by the Commodity Credit Corporation); 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1921(e) (fees collected by the United States Marshals Service for service 
of civil process and judicial execution seizures and sales, to the extent 
provided in advance in appropriation acts); 28 U.S.C. § 1931 (specified 
portions of filing fees paid to the clerk of court). The relevant legislation 
will determine precisely what may be retained. E.g., 34 Comp. Gen. 58 
(1954). 

Training fees illustrate both the general rule and statutory exceptions. 
Under the Government Employees Training Act, an agency may extend its 
training programs to employees of other federal agencies on a 
reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis. 5 U.S.C. § 4104. The agency, 
unless it receives appropriations for interagency training, may retain the 
fees. B-241269, Feb. 28, 1991 (nondecision letter). Similarly, an agency 
may admit state and local government employees to its training programs 
and may charge a fee or waive it in whole or in part. 42 U.S.C. § 4742(a). 
Under 42 U.S.C. § 4742(b), the agency that provided the training is 
authorized to credit its appropriation for reimbursement of fees received. 
The agency may also admit private persons to its training programs on a 
space-available and fee basis, but, unless it has statutory authority to the 
contrary, the agency must deposit the fees as miscellaneous receipts. 

B-271894, July 24, 1997; 65 Comp. Gen. 666 (1986); 42 Comp. Gen. 673 
(1963); B-241269, Feb. 28, 1991; B-190244, Nov. 28, 1977. 

Parking fees assessed by federal agencies under the authority of 40 U.S.C. 
§ 586 are to be credited to the appropriation or fund originally charged for 
providing the service. However, any amounts collected in excess of the 
actual cost of providing the service must be deposited as miscellaneous 
receipts. 55 Comp. Gen. 897 (1976). Statutes other than 40 U.S.C. § 586 
may authorize parking fees, in which event the terms of the particular 
statute must be examined. For example, parking fees at Department of 
Veterans Affairs medical facilities are addressed in 38 U.S.C. § 8109. 
Originally, the fees had to go to miscellaneous receipts under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3302(b). 45 Comp. Gen. 27 (1965). However, 38 U.S.C. § 8109 was 
amended, and the fees now go into a revolving fund. 

Income derived from the installation and operation of vending machines on 
government-owned or controlled property is generally for deposit as 
miscellaneous receipts. 32 Comp. Gen. 124 (1952); A-44022, Aug. 14, 1944. 
There are, however, two major exceptions. First, if an employee 
association with administrative approval makes a contractual arrangement 
with the vendor, the employee group may retain the income. 32 Comp. 

Page 6-200 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

Gen. 282 (1952); B-112840, Feb. 2, 1953. Second, under the Randolph-
Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. § 107d-3, vending machine income in certain cases 
must go to blind licensee-operators or state agencies for the blind. See 
B-238937, Mar. 22, 1991; B-199132, Sept. 10, 1980 (nondecision letters). 

Donations, which are voluntary, and fees and assessments, which are not, 
require different dispositions of amounts collected.176 Statutory authority 
to accept gifts and donations does not include fees and assessments 
exacted involuntarily. 25 Comp. Gen. 637, 639 (1946); B-195492, Mar. 18, 
1980; B-225834.2-O.M., Apr. 11, 1988. However, on occasion, GAO has held 
that gift-acceptance authorities extended to certain payments that were not 
wholly gratuitous or purely voluntary. See B-286182, Jan. 11, 2001 
(statutory authority of the District of Columbia courts to accept gifts 
permits acceptance of services provided as part of an administrative 
settlement in a rate case); B-232482, June 4, 1990 (not improper for 
Commerce Department to treat certain registration fees as “contributions” 
within scope of 22 U.S.C. § 2455(f)). For a discussion of the difference 
between the statutory authority to accept donations and the authority to 
charge fees to cover the costs of services provided, see B-272254, Mar. 5, 
1997. 

Fees paid to individual employees require a two-step analysis. The first 
step is the principle that the earnings of a government employee in excess 
of the regular compensation gained in the course of or in connection with 
his or her services belong to the government. See, e.g., 62 Comp. Gen. 39, 
40 (1982) and cases cited (military member must remit to the government 
fee for service on state jury while he was not in leave status). The second 
step is the application of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). Using this analysis, GAO has 
held that agencies must deposit such fees as miscellaneous receipts in the 
following instances: 

• An honorarium paid to an Army officer for lecturing at a university in 
his capacity as an officer of the United States. 37 Comp. Gen. 29 (1957). 
• Fees collected from private individuals by government employees for 
their services as notaries public. 16 Comp. Gen. 306 (1936). 
• Witness fees and any allowances for travel and subsistence, over and 
above actual expenses, paid to federal employees for testifying in 
176 See section E.3 of this chapter for a discussion of gifts and donations.

certain state court proceedings. 36 Comp. Gen. 591, 592 (1957); 
23 Comp. Gen. 628 (1944); 15 Comp. Gen. 196 (1935); B-160343, Nov. 23, 
1966. 

Applying the same analysis, a proposal under which a nonprofit 
corporation funded entirely by private industry would pay monthly 
“bonuses” to Army enlistees to encourage enlistment and satisfactory 
service, even if otherwise proper, could not be implemented without 
specific statutory authority, because the payments could not be retained by 
the enlistees but would have to be deposited in the Treasury under 
31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). B-200013, Apr. 15, 1981. 

The Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 1535 and 1536, authorizes the inter-and 
intra-departmental furnishing of materials or performance of work or 
services on a reimbursable basis.177 It is a statutory exception to the 
miscellaneous receipts statute, 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b), authorizing a 
performing agency to credit reimbursements to the appropriation or fund 
charged in executing its performance.178 Crediting Economy Act 
reimbursements to agency appropriations is not mandatory. The 
performing agency may, at its discretion, deposit reimbursements for both 
direct and indirect costs in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. 
57 Comp. Gen. 674, 685 (1978), modifying 56 Comp. Gen. 275 (1977). 
There is one area in which the performing agency has no discretion. 
Reimbursements may not be credited to an appropriation against which no 
charges have been made in executing the order.179 This would constitute an 
improper augmentation of the credited appropriation(s). As noted in 
section E.4 of this chapter, this also applies to appropriations available in 
different time periods. See B-288142, Sept. 6, 2001. Such reimbursements 
must therefore be deposited into the General Fund as miscellaneous 
receipts. An example would be crediting reimbursement for depreciation 

177 See section B.1 of Chapter 15 for a more detailed discussion of the Economy Act. 
Chapter 15 also discusses a variety of other interagency ordering authorities including 
working capital funds, special revolving funds, franchise funds, and program-specific funds. 

178 Temporary credits among appropriations are authorized by 31 U.S.C. § 1534, which 
generally provides for common service charges to more than one appropriation. See 
Chapter 2, section B.3.a. 

179 Compare 10 U.S.C. § 2205(a), which provides that reimbursements to Defense 
Department appropriations under the Economy Act and similar authorities may be credited 
to authorized accounts and are available for obligation for the same period as the funds in 
the account so credited.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

to an appropriation that did not bear any costs of the transaction. If the 
appropriation that bore the costs is no longer available, the reimbursement 
for depreciation must be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts. 57 Comp. Gen. at 685–86. An agency must deobligate funds at the 
end of their availability period to the extent that obligations for Economy 
Act work exceed costs incurred for that work. 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d). See 
B-286929, Apr. 25, 2001; 39 Comp. Gen. 317, 319 (1959); 34 Comp. Gen. 418, 
421–22 (1955). Likewise, where performance of an Economy Act order 
extends beyond a fiscal year and is funded by more than one fiscal year 
appropriation, the reimbursement must be split between the two 
appropriations based on the work actually performed by each. B-301561, 
June 14, 2004 (nondecision letter). 

Reimbursement under the Economy Act is to be made on the basis of 
“actual cost” as determined by the performing agency. 31 U.S.C. § 1535(b). 
Advance payments based on estimated costs are authorized, but the final 
payment amount must be adjusted to account for actual costs. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1535(b), (d); B-282601, Sept. 27, 1999; B-260993, June 26, 1996. See also 
GAO, DFOH Financial Management, GAO/AIMD-96-167R (Washington, 
D.C.: Sept. 30, 1996). While agencies have some flexibility in determining 
costs, their determinations must be reasonable in order to avoid an 
augmentation. B-257823, Jan. 22, 1998; B-250377, Jan. 28, 1993.180 In 
reviewing cost issues under the Economy Act, GAO’s role is to assess the 
general accuracy and reasonableness of a performing agency’s charges, not 
to “recompute” those charges. B-257823, Jan. 22, 1998. 

Failure to obtain reimbursement for all required costs in a reimbursable 
Economy Act transaction improperly augments the appropriations of the 
ordering agency. 57 Comp. Gen. 674, 682 (1978). Thus, an ordering agency 
must reimburse all appropriate costs incurred by the performing agency 
even if they exceed those agreed upon so long as the ordering agency 
received the benefit of the added costs. B-260993, June 26, 1996. The 
ordering agency’s obligation to reimburse such additional costs remains 

180 The cited decisions note, for example, that agencies can use standard costs for items 
provided from inventory as well as standard costs for transportation and labor. While the 
standard cost for inventory items may be based on the latest cost to acquire the item 
provided, it may not be the cost to acquire a more technologically advanced item. Also, 
reimbursement must include reasonable amounts for both direct and indirect costs. Of 
course, agencies may have more latitude to set rates under other, more specific statutes. 
See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. § 2205(b); Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation 
7000.14-R, vol. 11A, ch. 3, Economy Act Orders (April 2000), available at 
www.defenselink.mil/comptroller/fmr/11A/index.html (last visited September 15, 2005).

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

even if those costs are not identified until years later and after the 
appropriation of the ordering agency originally charged for the transaction 
has closed. In this event, the additional costs are payable from the ordering 
agency’s current appropriations for the same general purpose. B-260993, 
June 26, 1996. By the same token, the performing agency must return to 
the ordering agency advance payments that exceeded actual costs. 

72 Comp. Gen. 120 (1993). 

On occasion, the costs may be so out of proportion as to undercut the 
legitimacy of a purported Economy Act transaction altogether. In 70 Comp. 
Gen. 592 (1991), the Labor Department cited the Economy Act as authority 
to combine funds from a number of different departmental appropriation 
accounts for component agencies in order to purchase computer 
equipment for a department-wide network. However, the value of 
equipment provided to the various components under this arrangement did 
not match their contributions. For example, one component paid about 
four times more than the value of the equipment it received. Accordingly, 
the Comptroller General held that this arrangement was not a legitimate 
Economy Act transaction or reprogramming. Rather, it constituted an 
unauthorized transfer of appropriations that resulted in a subsidy to, and 
thus an improper augmentation of, the department’s central management 
account. 70 Comp. Gen. at 594–96. 

Finally, the general authority of the Economy Act cannot be used to 
overcome 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) if the transaction in question is governed by a 
more specific statutory authority. In B-241269, Feb. 28, 1991, the Treasury 
Department’s Financial Management Service asked whether it could invoke 
the Economy Act to retain reimbursements for training it provided to 
employees of other federal and state agencies as well as a few 
nongovernmental participants. GAO responded that the reimbursements 
were governed not by the Economy Act but by other statutory authorities 
dealing specifically with federal training programs. These statutory 
authorities allowed the agency that provided training to credit its 
appropriations for reimbursements on behalf of federal and other 
governmental participants. However, since the statutes did not cover 
nongovernmental trainees, they could not provide an exception from 
section 3302 that applied to them. Thus, the fees paid by nongovernmental 
participants must be deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts.181 

181 This and related decisions are also discussed in section E.2.d of this chapter.

The Comptroller General has applied Economy Act cost-reimbursement 
principles by analogy to interagency transactions conducted under other 
statutory authority requiring reimbursement where that authority does not 
otherwise specify the basis for reimbursement. See 72 Comp. Gen. 159 
(1993). Cf. B-276509, Aug. 28, 1998 (implicitly following Economy Act 
principles). However, rules that are unique to the Economy Act, such as 
the deobligation requirement of 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d), do not apply to 
interagency transactions carried out under other statutory authorities. 

B-302760, May 17, 2004. 

f. Setoff Collections by setoff may be factually distinguishable from direct 
collections, but the effect on the appropriation is the same. If crediting an 
agency appropriation with a direct collection in a particular instance would 
result in an improper augmentation, then retaining an amount collected by 
setoff would equally constitute an improper augmentation. Thus, setoffs 
must be treated the same as direct collections. If an agency could retain a 
direct collection in a given situation, it can retain the setoff. However, if a 
direct collection would have to go to miscellaneous receipts, the setoff also 
has to go to miscellaneous receipts. In this latter situation, the agency must 
take the amount of the setoff from its own appropriation and transfer it to 
the General Fund of the Treasury. E.g., 2 Comp. Gen. 599 (1923); 20 Comp. 
Dec. 349 (1913). 
A hypothetical situation will illustrate. Suppose a contractor negligently 
damages a piece of government equipment and becomes liable to the 
government in the amount of $500. Suppose further that an employee of 
the contracting agency, in a separate transaction, negligently damages 
property of the contractor. The contractor files a claim under the Federal 
Tort Claims Act and the agency settles the claim for $600. Neither party 
disputes the validity or amount of either claim. The agency sets the 
contract debt off against the tort claim and makes a net payment to the 
contractor of $100. However, if the agency stops here and if it lacks 
specific statutory authority to retain offsets, it has augmented its 
appropriation to the tune of $500. If the tort claim had never occurred and 
the agency collected the $500 from the contractor, the $500 would have to 
go to miscellaneous receipts (see “Contract Matters,” above). Conversely, 
if the contract claim did not exist, the agency would end up paying $600 on 
the tort claim. Now, combining both claims, if both were paid without 
setoff, the net result would be that the agency is out $600. The setoff 
cannot operate to put the agency’s appropriation in a better position than it 
would have been in had the agency and contractor simply exchanged 
checks. Thus, in addition to paying the contractor $100, the agency must

Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

deposit $500 from its own appropriation into the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts. 

A different type of “setoff” occurs under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. § 5596. 
When an agency pays an employee back pay under the Back Pay Act, it 
must deduct amounts the employee earned through other employment 
during the time period in question. The agency simply pays the net amount. 
There is no requirement to transfer the amount of the deduction for outside 
earnings to miscellaneous receipts. 31 Comp. Gen. 318 (1952). The 
deduction for outside earnings is not really a collection; it is merely part of 
the statutory formula for determining the amount of the payment. 

A major exception to the requirements of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) is the 
revolving fund.182 For most revolving funds, receipts are credited directly 
to the fund and are available, without further appropriation by Congress, 
for expenditures to carry out the purposes of the fund. An agency must 
have statutory authority to establish a revolving fund. The enabling statute 
will specify the receipts that may be credited to the fund and the purposes 
for which they may be expended. An example is the General Services 
Administration’s “General Supply Fund,” noted above under “Damage to 
Government Property.” Receipts that are properly for deposit to a 
revolving fund are, obviously, exempt from the miscellaneous receipts 
requirement of section 3302(b). E.g., B-271894, July 24, 1997 (explaining 
when a revolving fund may retain receipts and when it must deposit 
receipts into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts). 

However, the existence of a revolving fund does not automatically signal 
that 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) will never apply. Thus, where the statute 
establishing the fund does not authorize the crediting of receipts of a given 
type into the fund, those receipts must be deposited in the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts. To credit those receipts to the revolving fund 
would augment the revolving fund. See, e.g., B-302825, Dec. 22, 2004 (the 
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight had authority to collect and 
deposit into its Oversight Fund annual assessments from the Federal 
National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation; its authority to conduct administrative and enforcement 
actions did not permit it to retain copying fees charged for document 
discovery). See also 69 Comp. Gen. 260 (1990); 40 Comp. Gen. 356 (1960); 
23 Comp. Gen. 986 (1944); 20 Comp. Gen. 280 (1940). 

182 See section C of Chapter 15 for a much more detailed discussion of revolving funds.

Augmentation of a revolving fund may occur in other ways, depending on 
the nature of the fund and the terms of the governing legislation: 

• While the Bureau of Land Management has authority to retain funds 
collected as a result of coal trespasses on federal lands, to use those 
funds to repair damage to the specific lands involved in the trespass, 
and, within the Bureau’s discretion, to refund any excess, the Bureau 
may not retain an excess of collections over repair costs which the 
Bureau determines is inappropriate to refund. To retain such amounts 
in the revolving fund to be used for other purposes would augment the 
revolving fund. The Bureau must deposit this amount in the Treasury 
as miscellaneous receipts. B-204874, July 28, 1982. 
• The Corps of Engineers provides construction contract supervision and 
administrative services to other agencies and has a revolving fund (the 
supervision and administration, or S&A, revolving fund) that it uses to 
cover its S&A costs. The Corps changes its customer agencies a flat 
rate for this service so that, over time, its S&A revolving fund will break 
even. Where the Air Force (a customer agency) received an amount 
from an Air Force contractor for additional expenses incurred by the 
government as a result of the contractor’s defective workmanship, the 
Corps could cover into its S&A revolving fund only that portion 
representing S&A costs that the Corps had actually charged the Air 
Force, regardless of the amount collected from the contractor. 
65 Comp. Gen. 838 (1986). To avoid augmenting its S&A revolving fund, 
the Corps had to deposit amounts in excess of that portion into 
miscellaneous receipts. Id. See also B-237421, Sept. 11, 1991. 
• Although the Corps of Engineers may choose to offer training to 
nongovernmental personnel on a limited space-available basis, such 
training is not within the scope of the Corps’ revolving fund for 
furnishing facilities and services for other government agencies. 
Therefore, any fees it receives for training nongovernmental personnel 
must be deposited to the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) rather than 
being credited to Corps’ revolving fund. B-271894, July 24, 1997. 
• The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) cannot credit to its revolving 
fund double and treble damages recovered under the False Claims Act. 
Since these damages are in the nature of penalties rather than 
compensation for actual losses, TVA must deposit them to the Treasury 
as miscellaneous receipts. TVA has no authority to augment its 
revolving fund with proceeds that exceed costs it has incurred and that

are unrelated to its commercial and proprietary activities. B-281064, 

Feb. 14, 2000. 

Legislation that merely authorizes, or even requires, that certain 
expenditures be reimbursed is not sufficient to create a revolving fund. 
Reimbursements must be deposited as miscellaneous receipts unless the 
statute specifically authorizes retention by the agency. 67 Comp. Gen. 443 
(1988); 22 Comp. Dec. 60 (1915); 1 Comp. Dec. 568 (1895). 

Moneys properly received by a federal agency in a trust capacity are not 
subject to 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) and thus do not have to be deposited in the 
Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, unless otherwise required.183 B-303413, 
Nov. 8, 2004; 60 Comp. Gen. 15, 26 (1980); 27 Comp. Gen. 641 (1948). Other 
authorities supporting this general proposition are Emery v. United States, 
186 F.2d 900, 902 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 925 (1951) (money paid to 
the United States under court order as refund of overcharges by persons 
who had violated rent control legislation was held in trust for tenants and 
could be disbursed to them without need for appropriation); Varney v. 
Warehime, 147 F.2d 238, 245 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 325 U.S. 882 (1945) 
(assessments levied against milk handlers to defray certain wartime 
expenses were trust funds and did not have to be covered into the 
Treasury); 62 Comp. Gen. 245, 251–52 (1983) (proceeds from sale of certain 
excess stockpile materials where federal agency was acting on behalf of 
foreign government); B-223146, Oct. 7, 1986 (moneys received by Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation when acting in its trustee capacity); B-23647, 
Feb. 16, 1942 (taxes and fines collected in foreign territories occupied by 
American armed forces). 

In addition, receipts generated by activities financed with trust funds are 
generally credited to the trust fund and not deposited as miscellaneous 
receipts. United States v. Sinnott, 26 F. 84 (D. Ore. 1886) (proceeds from 
sale of lumber made at Indian sawmill were to be applied for benefit of 
Indians and were not subject to 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b)); B-166059, July 10, 
1969 (recovery for damage to property purchased with trust funds). See 
also 50 Comp. Gen. 545, 547 (1971). In 51 Comp. Gen. 506 (1972), GAO 
advised the Smithsonian Institution that receipts generated by various 
activities at the National Zoo need not be deposited as miscellaneous

receipts. The Smithsonian is financed in part by trust funds and in part by 
appropriated funds. 

In a 1991 case, an agency had discovered a $10,000 bank account belonging 
to an employee morale club which had become defunct. No 
documentation of the club’s creation or dissolution could be located. Thus, 
if the club had ever provided for the disposition of its funds, it could no 
longer be established. Clearly, the money was not received for the use of 
the government for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). It was equally clear 
that the money could not be credited to the agency’s appropriations. GAO 
advised that the money could be turned over to a successor employee 
morale organization to be used for its intended purposes. If no successor 
organization stepped forward, the funds would have to be deposited in a 
Treasury trust account in accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 1322. B-241744, 
May 31, 1991 (nondecision letter). 

There are limits on the extent to which trust funds can legitimately avoid 
the application of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). The Justice Department’s Office of 
Legal Counsel has cautioned against carrying the trust theory too far in the 
case of trusts created by executive action rather than statute. For example, 
the United States and the Commonwealth of Virginia sued a transportation 
company for causing an oil spill in the Chesapeake Bay. A settlement was 
proposed under which the defendant would donate money to a private 
waterfowl preservation organization. The Justice Department’s Office of 
Legal Counsel found that the proposal would contravene 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3302(b). 4B Op. Off. Legal Counsel 684 (1980). The opinion did not 
question that section 3302(b) could be overcome by a statutorily created 
trust or in other circumstances where money is “given to the government 
which is not available to the United States for disposition on its own 
behalf.” Id. at 687. However, it listed the following weaknesses in a 
nonstatutory trust argument: 

“(1) that trusts created by nonstatutory executive action 
could indeed be used to circumvent legislative prerogatives 
in the appropriations area; (2) that to some extent all money 
held in the Treasury . . . is received ‘in trust’ for the citizenry 
and (3) that Congress has created or recognized trust funds 
explicitly in numerous cases and implicitly in others, but it 
has neglected to do so in this context.” 

Id. at 687–68 (footnotes omitted). 

Page 6-209 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

The opinion also noted that the applicability of section 3302(b) was not 
affected simply because the government did not physically receive any 
funds. Rather, “constructive receipt” of funds is sufficient to trigger the 
statute: 

“In our view, the fact that no cash actually touches the palm 
of a federal official is irrelevant for purposes of § [3302(b)], 
if a federal agency could have accepted possession and 
retains discretion to direct the use of the money. The 
doctrine of constructive receipt will ignore the form of a 
transaction in order to get to its substance. . . . Since we 
believe that money available to the United States and 
directed to another recipient is constructively ‘received’ for 
purposes of § [3302(b)], we conclude that the proposed 
settlement is barred by that statute.” 

Id. at 688. 

There was a solution in that case, however. Since the United States had not 
suffered any monetary loss, it was not required to seek damages. The 
proposed contribution by the defendant could be attributed to the coplaintiff, 
Virginia, which of course was not subject to 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). 

Id.184 

Along the lines of the Office of Legal Counsel opinion discussed above, the 
court in Motor Coach Industries, Inc. v. Dole, 725 F.2d 958 (4th Cir. 1984), 
rejected a nonstatutory trust arrangement developed by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) in order to finance increased surface 
transportation to Dulles International Airport. FAA agreed to waive 
landing fees it charged airlines using Dulles if they agreed to establish and 
contribute to an “Air Carriers Trust Fund,” which would be used to 
purchase additional ground transport buses to serve Dulles. The court 
observed: 

“[T]he trust arrangement both undermined the integrity of 
the congressional appropriation process and ignored 
substantive duties under the procurement statutes. Viewed 
realistically, the Trust was an attempt by the FAA to divert

amendments to the governing legislation.

funds from their intended destination—the United States 
Treasury. Although the purpose for which the FAA sought 
the funds was laudable, its methods certainly cannot be 
praised. Were the contract between the Trust and [the 
transport company] left intact, the agency’s end-run around 
the normal appropriation channels would have been 
successful, enabling it effectively to supplement its budget 
by $3 million without congressional action.” 

725 F.2d at 968 (footnote omitted). 

Generally speaking, moneys collected as a fine or penalty must be 
deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3302(b). E.g., B-281064, Feb. 14, 2000 (double or treble damages under 
the False Claims Act, which constitute “exemplary” or punitive rather than 
compensatory damages); 70 Comp. Gen. 17 (1990) (civil penalties assessed 
against Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensees); 69 Comp. Gen. 260 
(1990) (penalties—as opposed to the recovery of actual losses—under the 
False Claims Act); 47 Comp. Gen. 674 (1968) (dishonored checks); 
B-235577.2-O.M., Nov. 9, 1989 (civil penalties under Food Stamp Act). 

In B-210210, Sept. 14, 1983, the Comptroller General held that the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission lacked authority to enter into a 
settlement agreement under which a party charged with violation of the 
Commodity Exchange Act would donate funds to an educational institution 
with no relationship to the violation. The decision pointed out that 
monetary penalties imposed by the Commission were subject to deposit 
into the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) and rejected the Commission’s 
characterization of the donation as a “voluntary contribution” as opposed 
to a “penalty”: 

“Despite the statement that the donations would not 
supplant the Commission’s regular practice of imposing 
monetary penalties as part of a settlement, it is difficult to 
distinguish the proposed donations from money penalties. 
The money would be donated as a result of an enforcement 
action and in consideration of not imposing some further 
sanction or penalty. It is difficult for us to conceive of a 
situation under the proposed plan where one making the 
payment would not consider the payment a penalty.”

j. Miscellaneous Cases: 
Money to Treasury 
Another case concluded that, without statutory authority, permitting a 
party who owes a penalty to contribute to a research project in lieu of 
paying the penalty amounts to a circumvention of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) and 
improperly augments the agency’s research appropriations. 70 Comp. 
Gen. 17 (1990). A case saying essentially the same thing in the context of 
Clean Air Act violations is B-247155, July 7, 1992, aff’d on reconsideration, 
B-247155.2, Mar. 1, 1993. 

GAO considered similar issues in several cases involving consent orders 
between the Department of Energy and oil companies charged with 
violation of federal oil price and allocation regulations. The Department 
has limited authority to use recovered overcharge funds for restitution 
purposes, and in fact has a duty to attempt restitution. However, to the 
extent this cannot reasonably be accomplished or funds remain after 
restitution efforts have been exhausted, the funds may not be used for 
energy-related programs with no restitution nexus but must be deposited in 
the Treasury pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). 62 Comp. Gen. 379 (1983); 
60 Comp. Gen. 15 (1980). It is equally unauthorized to give the funds to 
charity or to use them to augment appropriations for administering the 
overcharge refund program. B-200170, Apr. 1, 1981. 

To the same effect is United States v. Smithfield Foods, Inc., 982 F. Supp. 
373 (E.D. Va. 1997). Smithfield was assessed a civil penalty of over 
$12 million for violating the Clean Water Act. The trial judge initially 
ordered the government to submit a proposal for “allocation” of the penalty 
with an emphasis on directing all or part of the penalty toward restoration 
of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The Government responded 
that, since the Clean Water Act did not specify an alternative disposition, 
the penalty must be paid into the Treasury pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). 
The court “regretfully agree[d]” that the penalty proceeds could not be 
directed toward local environmental projects. Smithfield Foods, 
982 F. Supp. at 375. 

In addition to the categories discussed above, there have been numerous 
other decisions involving the disposition of receipts in various contexts. 
Some cases in which the Comptroller General held that receipts of a 
particular type must be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts 
under 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) or related statutes are set forth below. 

• Costs awarded to the United States by a court under 28 U.S.C. § 2412.

• Interest improperly earned on federal grant funds by various agencies

• Reimbursements received for child care services provided by federal 
agencies for their employees under authority of 40 U.S.C. § 590.

• Receipts generated by undercover operations by law enforcement 
agencies. 67 Comp. Gen. 353 (1988); 4B Op. Off. Legal Counsel 684, 686 
(1980). In GAO’s opinion, however, short-term operations (a card game 
or dice game, for example) may be treated as single transactions. 
67 Comp. Gen. 353, clarifying B-201751, Feb. 17, 1981. Thus, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3302(b) need not be read as requiring an undercover agent 
participating in a card game to leave the table to make a miscellaneous 
receipts deposit after every winning hand. If, however, the agent ends 
up with winnings at the end of the game, the money cannot be used to 
offset expenses of the operation.185 Related cases are 5 Comp. Gen. 289

evidence for use in criminal prosecutions and recovered when no 
longer needed for that purpose must be deposited as miscellaneous

k. Miscellaneous Cases: Most cases in which an agency may credit receipts to its own appropriation 
Money Retained by Agency or fund involve the areas previously discussed: authorized repayments, 
Economy Act transactions, revolving funds, or the other specific situations 
noted. There is another group of cases, not susceptible to further 
generalization, in which an agency simply has specific statutory authority 
to retain certain receipts. Examples are: 

• Forest Service may retain moneys paid by permittees on national forest 
lands representing their pro rata share under cooperative agreements 
for the operation and maintenance of waste disposal systems under the 
Granger-Thye Act, 16 U.S.C. § 572 (1970). 55 Comp. Gen. 1142 (1976). 
• Customs Service may, under 19 U.S.C. § 1524, retain charges collected 
from airlines for preclearance of passengers and baggage at airports in 
Canada, for credit to the appropriation originally charged with 
providing the service. 48 Comp. Gen. 24 (1968). 
• Overseas Private Investment Corporation may retain interest on loans 
of excess foreign currencies made under the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. § 2196. 52 Comp. Gen. 54 (1972). 
• The African Development Foundation, by virtue of its statutory giftacceptance 
authority, may retain funds it receives from certain African 
governments in order to supplement its grants. B-300218, Mar. 17, 2003. 
• Payroll deductions for government-furnished quarters under 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5911 are retained in the appropriation(s) or fund(s) from which the 
employee’s salary is paid. 59 Comp. Gen. 235 (1980), as modified by 
60 Comp. Gen. 659 (1981). However, if the employee pays directly 
rather than by payroll deduction, the direct payments must go to

miscellaneous receipts unless the agency has specific statutory 

authority to retain them. 59 Comp. Gen. at 236.186 

• Under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. § 191, receipts 
from the sale or lease of public lands are distributed in the manner 
specified in the statute. This was held to include the proceeds of bid 
deposits forfeited by successful mineral lease bidders who fail to 
execute the lease. 65 Comp. Gen. 570 (1986). 
• By virtue of provisions in the Job Training Partnership Act187 and annual 
appropriation acts, certain receipts generated by Job Corps Centers 
may be retained for credit to the Labor Department appropriation from 
which the Centers are funded. 65 Comp. Gen. 666 (1986). 
• Legislation establishing the Commission on the Bicentennial of the 
United States Constitution authorized the Commission to retain 
revenues derived from its licensing activities but did not address sales 
revenues. Sales revenues, therefore, had to be deposited as 
miscellaneous receipts. B-228777, Aug. 26, 1988. 
In the occasional case, the authority may be less than specific. In B-114860, 
Mar. 20, 1975, for example, based on the broad authority of the National 
Housing Act, GAO advised that the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development could require security deposits from tenants in HUD-owned 
multifamily projects. Consistent with practice in the private sector, the 
deposit would be considered the property of the tenant and held in an 
escrow account, to be either returned to the tenant upon completion of the 
lease or forfeited to the government in cases of breach. 

A final case we will note is 24 Comp. Gen. 514 (1945), an exception 
stemming from the particular funding arrangement involved rather than a 
specific statute. The case dealt with certain government corporations that 
did not receive annual appropriations but instead received annual 
authorizations for expenditures from their capital funds for administrative 
expenses. An appropriation act had imposed a limit on certain 

186 For agencies funded under the annual Interior Department and Related Agencies 
appropriation acts, the rentals, whether collected by payroll deduction or otherwise, go into

Receipts 
communication expenditures and provided that savings resulting from the 
limit “shall not be diverted to other use but shall be covered into the 
Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.” The Comptroller General construed 
this as meaning returned to the source from which made available. In the 
case of the corporations in question, this meant that the savings could be 
returned to their capital funds. 

The various accounts that comprise the heading “miscellaneous receipts” 
are just that—they are receipt accounts, not expenditure or appropriation 
accounts. As noted earlier, by virtue of the Constitution, once money is 
deposited into miscellaneous receipts, it takes an appropriation to get it 
back out. What, therefore, can be done if an agency deposits some money 
into miscellaneous receipts by mistake? 

This question really involves two separate situations. In the first situation, 
an agency receives funds which it is authorized, under the principles 
discussed above, to credit to its own appropriation or fund, but erroneously 
deposits them as miscellaneous receipts. The decisions have always 
recognized that the agency can make an appropriate adjustment to correct 
the error. In an early case, the Interior Department sold some property and 
deposited the proceeds as miscellaneous receipts when in fact it was 
statutorily authorized to credit the proceeds to its reclamation fund. The 
Interior Department then requested a transfer of the funds back to the 
reclamation fund, and the Secretary of the Treasury asked the Comptroller 
of the Treasury if it was authorized. Of course it was, replied the 
Comptroller: 

“This is not taking money out of the Treasury in violation of 
paragraph 7, section 9, Article I of the Constitution . . . . 

“The proceeds of the sale . . . have been appropriated by law. 
Taking it from the Treasury and placing it to the credit in the 
Treasury of the appropriation to which it belongs violates 
neither the Constitution nor any other law, but simply 
corrects an error by which it was placed to the 
unappropriated surplus instead of to the appropriation to 
which it belongs.”

This concept has consistently been followed. See 45 Comp. Gen. 724

Dec. 5, 1996.188 The concept also has been applied to permit correction of 
some errors in accounts that had been closed and their balances canceled 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §§ 1552 or 1555. See 72 Comp. Gen. 343 (1993). This 
decision held that, while canceled balances cannot be restored for 
purposes of recording obligations or making disbursements, bookkeeping 
records of closed accounts can be adjusted to correct obvious accounting 
errors. The decision was prompted by the Defense Department’s request 
that the Treasury Department reopen some of its accounts in order to 
record disbursements against those accounts for payments that, according 
to Defense, had been made from those accounts before cancellation but 
had not been properly charged against the accounts. The decision 
emphasized that— 

“Treasury’s authority to correct the accounts relates only to 
obvious clerical errors such as misplaced decimals, 
transposed digits, or transcribing errors that result in 
inadvertent cancellations of budget authority, and is not 
meant to serve as a palliative for deficiencies in DOD’s 
accounting systems.” 

72 Comp. Gen. at 346. 

A subsequent decision again stressed that while patently erroneous 
appropriation transactions can and often must be corrected, the authority 
to make corrections “extends only to clerical and administrative errors, not 
all misjudgments and miscalculations by government officials.” B-286661, 
Jan. 19, 2001, at fn. 5. 

In the second situation, a private party pays money to a federal agency, the 
agency deposits it as miscellaneous receipts, and it is subsequently 
determined that the party is entitled to a refund. Here, in contrast to the 
first situation, an appropriation is necessary to get the money out. E.g., 

3 Comp. Gen. 296 (1923). 

188 The reverse adjustment is made when funds which should have been deposited as 
miscellaneous receipts are erroneously credited to an appropriation. The remedy is a 
transfer from the appropriation to the appropriate miscellaneous receipts account. E.g., 

B-48722, Apr. 16, 1945.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

There is a permanent indefinite appropriation for refunding collections 
“erroneously received and covered” that are not properly chargeable to any 
other appropriation. 31 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(2). The availability of this 
appropriation depends on exactly where the receipts were deposited. If 
the amount subject to refund was credited to some specific appropriation 
account, the refund is chargeable to the same account. If, however, the 
receipt was deposited in the general fund as miscellaneous receipts, then 
the appropriation made by 31 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(2) is available for the refund, 
provided that the amount in question was “erroneously received and 
covered.” B-257131, May 30, 1995; 71 Comp. Gen. 464 (1992); 61 Comp. 
Gen. 224 (1982); 55 Comp. Gen. 625 (1976); 17 Comp. Gen. 859 (1938). Also, 
the 31 U.S.C. § 1322(b) appropriation is not available as a source for 
adjusting an erroneous intra-governmental transfer between two 
appropriation accounts since such an adjustment does not involve a 
“refund” of funds “erroneously received” by the government. B-286661, 
Jan. 19, 2001, at fn. 6. 

Examples of cases in which use of the “Moneys Erroneously Received and 
Covered” appropriation was found authorized are 71 Comp. Gen. 464 
(1992) (refund to investment company of late filing fee upon issuance of 
order by Securities and Exchange Commission exempting company from 
filing deadline for fiscal year in question); 63 Comp. Gen. 189 (1984) 
(Department of Energy deposited overcharge recoveries from oil 
companies into general fund instead of first attempting to use them to 
make restitution refunds); B-217595, Apr. 2, 1986 (interest collections 
subsequently determined to have been erroneous). 

One case, 53 Comp. Gen. 580 (1974), combined elements of both situations. 
The Army Corps of Engineers had been authorized to issue discharge 
permits under the Refuse Act Permit Program. The program was 
statutorily transferred in 1972 to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Under the user charge statute, 31 U.S.C. § 9701, both the Corps and EPA 
had charged applicants a fee. In some cases, the fees had been deposited 
as miscellaneous receipts before the applications were processed. The 
legislation that transferred the program to EPA also provided that EPA 
could authorize states to issue the permits. However, there was no 
provision that authorized EPA to transfer to the states any fees already 
paid. Thus, some applicants found that they had paid a fee to the Corps or 
EPA, received nothing for it, and were now being charged a second fee by 
the state for the same application. EPA felt that the original fees should be 
refunded. So did the applicants. 

Page 6-218 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

GAO noted that the user charge statute contemplates that the federal 
agency will furnish something in exchange for the fee. Since this had not 
been done, the fees could be viewed as having been erroneously deposited 
in the general fund. However, the fees had not been erroneously 
received—the Corps and EPA had been entirely correct in charging the fees 
in the first place—so the appropriation made by 31 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(2) 
could not be used. There was a way out, but the refunds would require a 
two-step process. The Corps and EPA should have deposited the fees in a 
trust account189 and kept them there until the applications were processed, 
at which time depositing as miscellaneous receipts would have been 
proper. Thus, EPA could first transfer the funds from the general fund to its 
suspense account as the correction of an error, and then make the refunds 
directly from the suspense account. 

In cases where the “Moneys Erroneously Received and Covered” 
appropriation is otherwise available, it is available without regard to 
whether the original payment was made under protest. 55 Comp. Gen. 243 
(1975). 

The appropriation made by 31 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(2) for Refund of Moneys 
Erroneously Received and Covered is available only to refund amounts 
actually received and deposited. If a given refund bears interest, for 
example, a refund claim approved by a contracting officer under the 
Contract Disputes Act, the interest portion must be charged to the 
contracting agency’s operating appropriations for the fiscal year in which 
the award is made. B-217595, Apr. 2, 1986. 

If an agency collects money from someone to whom it owes a refund from 
a prior transaction, it should not simply deposit the net amount. The 
correct procedure is to deposit the new receipt into the general fund 
(assuming that is the proper receptacle), and then make the refund using 
the “Moneys Erroneously Received and Covered” appropriation. B-19882, 
Oct. 28, 1941; A-96279, Sept. 15, 1938. However, GAO has approved 
offsetting a refund against future amounts due from the same party in cases 
where there is a continuing relationship, but suggested that the party be 
given the choice. B-217595, Apr. 2, 1986, at 4. 

189 See also B-3596, A-51615, Nov. 30, 1939. Use of a deposit fund suspense account is equally 
acceptable. B-158381, June 21, 1968.

Clearly, if the receipt cannot be regarded as erroneous, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1322(b)(2) is not available. E.g., Lee v. United States, 33 Fed. Cl. 374 
(1995); 53 Comp. Gen. 580 (1974); B-146111, July 6, 1961. Citing several of 
the Comptroller General decisions discussed previously, the court in Lee 
held that a filing fee appropriately paid by a litigant and deposited into the 
Treasury was not subject to refund under section 1322(b)(2). Lee, 33 Fed. 
Cl. at 381–84. Also, the “Moneys Erroneously Received and Covered” 
appropriation is available only where the amount to be refunded was 
deposited into the general fund. E.g., 11 Comp. Dec. 300 (1904). If a refund 
is due of moneys deposited somewhere other than the general fund, some 
other basis must be sought. 

Republic National Bank of Miami v. United States, 506 U.S. 80 (1992), and 
the varied opinions of the Justices it spawned, illustrate how perplexing the 
issues can be when it comes to retrieving from the Treasury funds that 
should not have been deposited there. Republic National Bank was an “in 
rem” forfeiture action against property (a house) that the government 
alleged had been purchased with income from illegal drug trafficking. The 
bank intervened, claiming to be an innocent owner of the property by 
virtue of its mortgage interest. With the consent of the bank, the property 
was sold and the proceeds were held by the U.S. marshal pending the 
outcome of the litigation. The trial court rejected the bank’s claim and 
ordered the sale proceeds forfeited to the United States. The bank 
appealed; however, when it did not seek to stay execution of the judgment 
the government had the marshal deposit the sales proceeds into the Assets 
Forfeiture Fund of the Treasury. Once this occurred, the government 
sought to dismiss the appeal as moot. The government argued that since 
the proceeds were now in the Treasury, they could not be withdrawn 
without an appropriation and, thus, the courts could provide no remedy to 
the bank. 

When the case reached the Supreme Court, all of the Justices rejected the 
government’s argument and agreed that the bank could be paid if it 
prevailed on the merits. However, they were deeply split as to the 
rationale. Justice Blackmun, author of most of the Court’s opinion in 
Republic National Bank, characterized the government’s position as being 
that, by virtue of the Constitution’s Appropriations Clause, “absent an 
appropriation, any funds that find their way into a Treasury account must 
remain there, regardless of their ownership.” 506 U.S. at 89. Rejecting this 
position as producing “bizarre” and “absur[d]” results, Justice Blackmun 
concluded that an appropriation was not necessary. He reasoned that 
money involved in a pending in rem forfeiture proceeding could not be 

Page 6-220 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6

regarded as “public funds” within the scope of the Appropriations Clause 
where the very purpose of the proceeding was to sort out their proper 
ownership. Furthermore, he observed: 

“Contrary to the Government’s broad submission here, the 
Comptroller General has long assumed that, in certain 
situations, an erroneous deposit of funds into a Treasury 
account can be corrected without a specific appropriation. 
See 53 Comp. Gen. 580 (1974); 45 Comp. Gen. 724 (1966); 
3 Comp. Gen. 762 (1924); 12 Comp. Dec. 733, 735 (1906); 
Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, at 5-79 to 5-81. 
Most of these cases have arisen where money intended for 
one account was accidentally deposited in another. It 
would be unrealistic, for example, to require congressional 
authorization before a data processor who misplaces a 
decimal point can ‘undo’ an inaccurate transfer of Treasury 
funds. The Government’s absolutist view of the scope of the 
Appropriations Clause is inconsistent with these 
commonsense understandings.” 

Republic National Bank, 506 U.S. at 92. 

However, Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by four other Justices, wrote the 
opinion of the Court on this point. The Chief Justice expressed “difficulty 
accepting the proposition that funds which have been deposited into the 
Treasury are not public money, regardless of whether the Government’s 
ownership of those funds is disputed.” Id. at 93. He added, “even if there 
are circumstances in which funds that have been deposited into the 
Treasury may be returned absent an appropriation, I believe it unnecessary 
to plow that uncharted ground here.” Id. at 95. Instead, he concluded that 
the judgment fund appropriation under 31 U.S.C. § 1304 would be available 
to provide a source of payment if the bank prevailed in the case. 

Justice Blackmun had rejected the Chief Justice’s judgment fund rationale 
for two reasons. First, he viewed the judgment fund as being limited to the 
payment of money judgments. Second, he pointed out that the proceeds 
from the in rem action were not in the judgment fund. Rather, they were in

the Treasury Assets Forfeiture Fund. See Republic National Bank, 506 U.S. 
at 91, fn. 6.190 

Finally, in their separate opinions, Justice White and Justice Stevens both 
expressed displeasure over the need to address the Appropriations Clause 
issue, indicating surprise that the Government would advance “such a 
transparently fallacious position.” See 506 U.S. at 97–99. 

3. Gifts and Donations to 
the Government 
a. Donations to the 
Government 
It has long been recognized that the United States (as opposed to a 
particular agency) may receive and accept gifts. No particular statutory 
authority is necessary. As the Supreme Court has said: “Uninterrupted 
usage from the foundation of the Government has sanctioned it.” 
United States v. Burnison, 339 U.S. 87, 90 (1950). The gifts may be of real 
property or personal property, and they may be testamentary (made by 
will) or inter vivos (made by persons who are not dead yet). Monetary 
gifts to the United States go to the general fund of the Treasury and present 
no augmentation problem since there is no appropriation to augment. 

However, as the Supreme Court held in the Burnison case, a state may 
prohibit testamentary gifts by its domiciliaries to the United States. Also, a 
state may impose an inheritance tax on property bequeathed to the United 
States. United States v. Perkins, 163 U.S. 625 (1896). The tax is not 
regarded as a constitutionally impermissible tax on federal property “since 
the tax is imposed upon the legacy before it reaches the hands of the 
government. The legacy becomes the property of the United States only 
after it has suffered a diminution to the amount of the tax . . . .” Id. at 630. 

While gifts to the United States do not require statutory authority, gifts to 
an individual federal agency stand on a different footing. The rule is that a 
government agency may not accept for its own use (i.e., for retention by 
the agency or credit to its own appropriations) gifts of money or other 

190 In B-259065, Dec. 21, 1995, the Comptroller General sided with Justice Blackmun on this 
point, holding that awards against the United States for the return of forfeited cash or cash 
proceeds of forfeited property that had been deposited in the Justice Department’s Assets 
Forfeiture Fund should be satisfied from that fund. 

Page 6-222 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

property in the absence of specific statutory authority. 16 Comp. Gen. 911 
(1937). As the Comptroller General said in that decision, “[w]hen the 
Congress has considered desirable the receipt of donations . . . it has 
generally made specific provision therefor . . . .” Id. at 912. See also 
B-286182, Jan. 11, 2001; B-289903, Mar. 4, 2002 (nondecision letter). 

Thus, acceptance of a gift of money or other property by an agency lacking 
statutory authority to do so is an improper augmentation. E.g., B-286182, 
Jan. 11, 2001 (District of Columbia Courts statutory gift-acceptance 
authority permitted receipt of a private company’s contribution of 
telecommunications services and equipment). If an agency does not have 
statutory authority to accept donations of money, it must turn the money in 
to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. E.g., B-139992, Aug. 31, 1959 
(proceeds of life insurance policy designating federal agency as 
beneficiary). Under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act 
of 1949, as amended, agencies without gift retention authority must report 
gifts of property to the General Services Administration (GSA) and the 
property is treated in accordance with its regulations. See 40 U.S.C. § 121; 
41 C.F.R. §§ 102-36.410 and 102-36.415 (2005). Gifts from foreign 
governments or entities must also be reported to GSA and treated in 
accordance with 41 C.F.R. § 102-36.420 and part 101-49. 

For purposes of this discussion, the term “gifts” may be defined as 
“gratuitous conveyances or transfers of ownership in property without any 
consideration.” B-286182, Jan. 11, 2001; 25 Comp. Gen. 637, 639 (1946); 
B-217909, Sept. 22, 1986. A receipt that does not meet this definition does 
not become a gift merely because the agency characterizes it as one. For 
example, a fee paid for the privilege of filming a motion picture in a 
national park is not a gift and must be deposited as miscellaneous receipts 
rather than in the agency’s trust fund. 25 Comp. Gen. 637. See also B-89294, 
Aug. 6, 1963. Similarly, a reduction of accrued liability in fulfillment of a 
contractual obligation is not a donation for purposes of a statute 
authorizing appropriations to match “donations.” B-183442, Oct. 21, 1975 
(statute indicated that only gifts may be matched and payment in 
satisfaction of a contractual debt is not a gift). On the other hand, some 
payments that are not wholly voluntary or gratuitous may occasionally 
qualify for acceptance as gifts or contributions. See B-286182, Jan. 11, 2001 
(District of Columbia Court System may accept and use a contribution of 
telecommunication services and equipment from a telecommunication 
company as part of a settlement agreement in a rate case); B-232482, 
June 4, 1990 (payments of fees by nongovernment participants for services 
provided as part of Department of Commerce-sponsored international 

Page 6-223 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6

trade shows are considered “contributions” under specific language in 
Commerce’s appropriation act). 

A number of departments and agencies have statutory authority to accept 
gifts. A partial listing is contained in B-149711, Aug. 20, 1963 (although 
dated, B-149711 is still useful since there is no more recent comprehensive 
compilation of these authorities). The statutory authorizations contain 
varying degrees of specificity as to precisely what may be accepted (money, 
property, services, etc.). For example, the State Department’s general gift 
statute, 22 U.S.C. § 2697, authorizes the State Department to accept gifts of 
money or property, real or personal, and, in the Secretary’s discretion, 
conditional gifts. A case discussing this statute is 67 Comp. Gen. 90 (1987) 
(United States Information Agency may accept donations of radio 
programs prepared by private syndicators for broadcast over Voice of 
America facilities). Another is 70 Comp. Gen. 413 (1991) (United States 
Information Agency may accept donations of foreign debt). Authority to 
accept voluntary services does not include donations of cash. A-86115, 
July 15, 1937; A-51627, Mar. 15, 1937. For a further discussion of voluntary 
services, see section C.3 of this chapter. 

The authority of the Defense Department to accept gifts is found in several 
statutes. First, the Defense Department may accept contributions of 
money or real or personal property “for use by the Department of Defense” 
from any person, foreign government, or international organization. The 
money and proceeds from the sale of property are credited to the Defense 
Cooperation Account in the Treasury. The money is not automatically 
available to Defense, but is available for obligation or expenditure only in 
the manner and to the extent provided in appropriation acts. 10 U.S.C. 
§ 2608. Second, the Department may accept services, supplies, real 
property, or the use of real property under a mutual defense or similar 
agreement or as reciprocal courtesies, from a foreign government for the 
support of any element of United States armed forces in that country. 
10 U.S.C. § 2350g. These authorities formed the basis for the United States 
to accept contributions from foreign governments and others to defray the 
costs of the 1991 military operations in the Persian Gulf. See GAO, 
Operations Desert Shield/Storm: Foreign Government and Individual 
Contributions to the Department of Defense, GAO/NSIAD-92-144 
(Washington, D.C.: May 11, 1992). Other limited-purpose authorities 
available to the military are found in 10 U.S.C. §§ 2601–2607. 

We also should note a statute tailor-made for the philanthropist desiring to 
make a donation for the express purpose of reducing the national debt. 

Page 6-224 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

(Some people mistakenly think they already do this in April of each year.) 
The Secretary of the Treasury may accept gifts of money, obligations of the 
United States, or other intangible personal property made for the express 
purpose of reducing the public debt. Gifts of other real or personal 
property for the same purpose may be made to the Administrator of the 
General Services Administration. 31 U.S.C. § 3113. 

Assuming the existence of the requisite statutory authority, it is quite easy 
to make a gift to the government. The essential elements of a gift are 
donative intent, delivery, and acceptance. There are no particular forms 
required. A simple letter to the appropriate agency head transmitting the 
funds for the stated purpose will suffice. See B-274855, Jan. 23, 1997; 
B-157469, July 24, 1974 (nondecision letter). 

A 1980 GAO study found that, during fiscal year 1979, 41 government 
agencies received a total of $21.6 million classified as gift revenue. See 
GAO, Review of Federal Agencies’ Gift Funds, FGMSD-80-77 (Washington, 
D.C.: Sept. 24, 1980). The report pointed out that the use of gift funds 
dilutes congressional oversight because the funds do not go through the 
appropriation process. The report recommended that agencies be required 
to more fully disclose gift fund operations in their budget submissions. 

The issue raised in most gift cases is the purpose for which gift funds may 
be used. This ultimately depends on the scope of the agency’s statutory 
authority and the terms of the gift. Gift funds are accounted for as trust 
funds. They generally must be deposited in the Treasury as trust funds 
under 31 U.S.C. § 1321(b), to be disbursed in accordance with the terms of 
the trust. In 16 Comp. Gen. 650, 655 (1937), the Comptroller General stated: 

“Where the Congress authorizes Federal officers to accept 
private gifts or bequests for a specific purpose, often subject 
to certain prescribed conditions as to administration, 
authority must of necessity be reposed in the custodians of 
the trust fund to make expenditures for administration in 
such a manner as to carry out the purposes of the trust and 
to comply with the prescribed conditions thereof without 
reference to general regulatory and prohibitory statutes 
applicable to public funds.” 

While this passage correctly states the trust fund concept, agencies have 
sometimes misconstrued it to mean that they have free and unrestricted 
use of donated funds. This is not the case. On the one hand, donated funds 

Page 6-225 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

may not be subject to all of the restrictions applicable to direct 
appropriations. Yet on the other hand, gift funds constitute appropriated 
funds unless Congress provides otherwise191 and they are still “public 
funds” in a very real sense. As GAO stated in B-274855, Jan. 23, 1997: 

“[F]unds available to agencies are considered appropriated, 
regardless of their source, if they are made available for 
collection and expenditure pursuant to specific statutory 
authority. See B-215042, April 12, 1985. This means that 
although donated funds may not be subject to all the 
restrictions applicable to direct appropriations, they are still 
public funds. See B-197565, May 13, 1980.” 

Id. at 3. See also B-275669.2, July 30, 1997. Consequently, gift funds can be 
used only in furtherance of authorized agency purposes and incident to the 
terms of the trust. See B-300218, Mar. 17, 2003; B-195492, Mar. 18, 1980. 

An interesting illustration of this point occurred in B-16406, May 17, 1941. 
A citizen had bequeathed money in her will to a hospital. When the will 
was made, the hospital belonged to the state of Louisiana. By the time the 
will was probated, however, it had been acquired by the United States. 
Louisiana was concerned that the bequest might, if deposited in the United 
States Treasury, be diverted from the decedent’s intent. There was no need 
for concern, the Comptroller General advised. The money would have to 
be deposited as trust funds and would be available for expenditure only for 
the purposes specified in the trust, that is, for the hospital. 

In evaluating the propriety of a proposed use of gift funds, it is first 
necessary to examine the precise terms of the statute authorizing the 
agency to accept the gift. Limitations imposed by that statute must be 
followed. Thus, under a statute which authorized the Forest Service to 
accept donations “for the purpose of establishing or operating any forest 
research facility,” the Forest Service could not turn over unconditional gift 
funds to a private foundation under a cooperative agreement, with the 
foundation to invest the funds and use the proceeds for purposes other 
than establishing or operating forest research facilities. 55 Comp. 
Gen. 1059 (1976). See also B-198730, Dec. 10, 1986 (funds donated to 

191 See, e.g., 36 U.S.C. § 2307 (specifically provides that funds donated to the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum are not to be regarded as appropriated funds and are not 
subject to requirements or restrictions applicable to appropriated funds).

Library of Congress to further purposes of Library’s Center for the Book 
could not be used for unrelated Library programs); 40 Op. Att’y Gen. 66 
(1941) (Library of Congress could not, without statutory authority, share 
income from donated property with Smithsonian Institution). 

Under a statute authorizing the Federal Board for Vocational Education to 
accept donations to be used “in connection with the appropriations hereby 
made or hereafter to be made, to defray the expenses of providing and 
maintaining courses of vocational rehabilitation,” the funds could be used 
only to supplement the Board’s regular appropriations and could not be 
used for any expense not legally payable from the regular appropriation. 
The statute here conferred no discretion. 27 Comp. Dec. 1068 (1921). 

If an agency is authorized to accept gifts, the funds may be used to augment 
a “not to exceed” earmark applicable to that purpose. B-52501, Nov. 9, 
1945. (Although the statute involved in B-52501, the predecessor of 
10 U.S.C. § 2608 noted above, no longer exists, the point of the decision is 
still valid.) 

Once it is determined that the proposed use will not contravene the terms 
of the agency’s authorizing statute, the agency will have some discretion 
under the trust fund concept. For example, donated funds may be used for 
entertainment only if the entertainment will further a valid function of the 
agency for which the donated funds were provided, if the government 
could not accomplish the function as effectively without the expenditure, 
and if the expenditure does not violate any restrictions imposed by the 
donor on the use of the funds. 46 Comp. Gen. 379 (1966); B-195492, Mar. 18, 
1980; B-170938, Oct. 30, 1972; B-142538, Feb. 8, 1961. See also B-152331, 
Nov. 19, 1975 (involving a trust fund which included both gift and non-gift 
funds). It follows that donated funds may not be used for entertainment 
which does not bear a legitimate relationship to official agency purposes. 
61 Comp. Gen. 260 (1982), aff’d upon reconsideration, B-206173, Aug. 3, 
1982 (donated funds improperly used for breakfast for Cabinet wives and 
Secretary’s holiday party). 

The trust fund concept was also applied in 36 Comp. Gen. 771 (1957). The 
Alexander Hamilton Bicentennial Commission had been given statutory 
authority to accept gifts and wanted to use the donations to award 
Alexander Hamilton Commemorative Scholarships. The Commission was 
to have a brief existence and would not have sufficient time to administer 
the scholarship awards. The Comptroller General held that the 
Commission could, prior to the date of its expiration, transfer the funds to a

responsible private organization for the purpose of enabling proper 
administration of the scholarship awards. The distinction between this 
case and 55 Comp. Gen. 1059, mentioned above, is that in 36 Comp. 
Gen. 771, the objective of transferring the funds to a private organization 
was to better carry out an authorized purpose. In 55 Comp. Gen. 1059, the 
objective was to enable the funds to be used for unauthorized purposes. 

Another case illustrating permissible administrative discretion under the 
trust fund concept is B-131278, Sept. 9, 1957. A number of persons had 
made donations to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital to enable it to buy an organ for 
its chapel. The donors (organ donors?) had made the gifts on the condition 
that the Hospital purchase a high-quality (expensive) organ. When the 
Hospital issued its invitation for bids on the organ, the specifications were 
sufficiently restrictive so as to preclude offers on lower quality organs. The 
decision found this to be entirely within the Hospital’s discretion in using 
the gift funds in accordance with their terms. 

As noted above, however, the agency’s discretion in administering its gift 
funds is not unlimited. Thus, for example, an agency may not use gift funds 
for purely personal items such as greeting cards that do not further agency 
purposes for which the gift funds were donated. 47 Comp. Gen. 314 (1967). 
See also B-195492, Mar. 18, 1980 (when an agency uses trust funds for what 
appear to be personal purposes, it has the burden of showing that this use 
furthers the trust purposes). 

The particular statutory scheme will determine the extent to which 
donated funds are subject to other laws governing the expenditure of 
public funds. In two cases, for example, where a designated activity was to 
be carried out solely or primarily with donated funds, GAO found that the 
recipient agency could invest the gift funds in non-Treasury interestbearing 
accounts and was not required to comply with the Federal Property 
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPASA), 41 U.S.C. § 251–266, or 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R. §§ 1.104 and 12.101. 
68 Comp. Gen. 237 (1989) (Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee 
Commission); B-211149, Dec. 12, 1985 (Holocaust Memorial Council). 
However, these cases were distinguished in B-275669.2, July 30, 1997, in 
which GAO determined that the American Battle Monuments Commission 
charged with establishing the World War II memorial must use donated 
funds for contracts in accordance with the FPASA and FAR since neither 
the authorizing legislation nor the legislative history indicated an intention 
to exempt the Commission from such requirements.

Gifts that would require the government to incur significant expenses in 
future years present special issues. Although there are no recent cases, 
indications are that the agency needs specific statutory authority—not 
merely general authority to accept gifts—since the agency’s appropriations 
would not otherwise be available to make the future expenditures. For 
example, an individual made a testamentary gift to a United States naval 
hospital. The will provided that the money was to be invested in the form 
of a memorial fund, with the income to be used for specified purposes. The 
Comptroller General objected to this, finding that the gift appeared to be 
conditional and that “the United States would become, in effect, a trustee 
for charitable uses, would never gain a legal title to the money, but would 
have the burden and obligation of administering in perpetuity a trust 
fund . . . .” 11 Comp. Gen. 355, 366 (1932). Also, absent specific 
authorization by Congress, appropriations would not be available for the 
expenses of administering the trust. Therefore, absent congressional 
authorization to accept the donation “as made,” it could not be accepted 
either by the naval hospital, id., or by the Treasury Department, A-40707, 
Dec. 15, 1936. See Story v. Snyder, 184 F.2d 454, 456 (D.C. Cir.), cert. 
denied, 340 U.S. 866 ((1950) (“gifts to the United States which involve any 
duty, burden, or condition, or are made dependent upon some future 
performance by the United States, are not accepted by the Government 
unless by the express authority of Congress”). See also 10 Comp. Gen. 395 
(1931); 22 Comp. Dec. 465 (1916);192 30 Op. Att’y Gen. 527 (1916). A few of 
the cases (e.g., 10 Comp. Gen. 395 and 30 Op. Att’y Gen. 527) have tied the 
result to the Antideficiency Act prohibition against incurring obligations in 
advance of appropriations, reasoning that acceptance would, in effect, 
create an unauthorized and unfunded contractual commitment to incur 
future expenses. See 10 Comp. Gen. at 398. 

A question that received little attention in the past is whether an agency 
with statutory authority to accept gifts may use either appropriated funds 
or donated funds to solicit the gifts. GAO found that the Holocaust 
Memorial Council may use either appropriated or donated funds to hire a 
fund-raiser, but the cases have little precedential value since the legislation 
involved included specific authority to solicit as well as accept donations. 
See B-211149, Dec. 12, 1985; B-211149, June 22, 1983.

An interesting, and hopefully unique, situation presented itself in B-230727, 
Aug. 1, 1988. Congress had enacted legislation to establish a Commission 
on Improving the Effectiveness of the United Nations, to be funded solely 
from private contributions. Pub. L. No. 100-204, title VII, pt. B, § 727, 
101 Stat. 1331, 1394 (Dec. 22, 1987). The effective date of the legislation 
was March 1, 1989. Unfortunately, the legislation failed to provide a 
mechanism for anyone (Treasury Department or General Services 
Administration, for example) to accept and account for donations prior to 
the effective date, and the Commission itself could not do so since it had no 
legal existence. Thus, unless the statute were amended to authorize some 
other agency to act on the Commission’s behalf, potential donors could not 
make contributions prior to the effective date since there was no one 
authorized to accept them. 

In 1995, GAO was asked whether, under the Public Health Service’s gift 
acceptance statute, 42 U.S.C. § 238(a), the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), a component of the Public Health Service, may use its appropriated 
funds to apply for grants from nongovernmental sources, a kind of 
solicitation of funds. GAO determined that, since NIH had the authority to 
accept grants as conditional gifts under the statute, it could use its 
appropriated funds to cover the costs incurred in applying for such grants. 

B-255474, Apr. 3, 1995. 

Finally, if an agency is authorized to accept gifts, it may also accept a loan 
of equipment by a private party without charge to be used in connection 
with particular government work. The agency’s appropriations for the 
work will be available for repairs to the equipment, but only to the extent 
necessary for the continued use of the equipment on the government work, 
and not after the government’s use has terminated. 20 Comp. Gen. 617 
(1941). In one case, GAO approved the loan of private property to a federal 
agency by one of its employees, without charge and apparently without 
statutory authority, where the agency administratively determined that the 
equipment was necessary to the discharge of agency functions and the loan 
was in the interest of the United States. 22 Comp. Gen. 153 (1942). The 
decision stressed, however, that the practice of borrowing property should 
not be encouraged since it might give rise to claims against the government 
or questions about favors received or expected by the persons loaning the 
property. The decision seems to have been based in part on wartime needs 
and its precedent value would therefore seem minimal. See, e.g., B-168717, 
Feb. 18, 1970.

b. Donations to Individual (1) Contributions to salary or expenses 
Employees 
As a general proposition, unless authorized by statute, private 
contributions to the salary or expenses of a federal employee are improper. 
First, they may in some circumstances violate 18 U.S.C. § 209, which 
prohibits the supplementation of a government employee’s salary from 
private sources. “The evils of such, were it permitted, are obvious.” 
Exchange National Bank v. Abramson, 295 F. Supp. 87, 90 (D. Minn. 1969). 
For purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 209, the proverb that it is better to give than to 
receive does not work. Both the giving and the receiving are criminal 
offenses under the statute. The employee would presumably violate the 
law by receiving more than he or she is entitled to receive under applicable 
statutes and regulations. 33 Op. Att’y Gen. 273, 275 (1922) (object of the 
predecessor to 18 U.S.C. § 209 was that “no Government official or 
employee should serve two masters to the prejudice of his unbiased 
devotion to the interests of the United States”). For further discussion of 
section 209, see the Memorandum Opinion for the General Counsel, 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Applicability of 18 U.S.C. § 209 to 
Acceptance by FBI Employees of Benefits under the “Make a Dream Come 
True” Program, OLC Opinion, Oct. 28, 1997. See also the Office of 
Government Ethics, Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the 
Executive Branch, 5 C.F.R. part 2635 (2005) (implementing 18 U.S.C. 
§ 201), which prohibit an employee from accepting gifts from persons 
whose interests may be substantially affected by the employee. 
Second, they are improper as unauthorized augmentations. To the extent 
the private contribution replaces the employee’s government salary, it is a 
direct augmentation of the employing agency’s appropriations. To the 
extent the contribution supplements the government salary, it is an 
augmentation in an indirect sense, the theory being that when Congress 
appropriates money for an activity, all expenses of that activity must be 
borne by that appropriation unless Congress specifically provides 
otherwise. 
An early case in point is 2 Comp. Gen. 775 (1923). The American Jewelers’ 
Protective Association offered to pay the salary and expenses of a customs 
agent for one year on the condition that the agent be assigned exclusively 
for that year to investigate jewelry smuggling. The Comptroller General 
found the arrangement improper, for the two reasons noted above. 
Whether the payments were to be made directly to the employee or to the 
agency by way of reimbursement was immaterial.

Most questions in this area involve schemes for private entities to pay 
official travel expenses. From the sheer number of cases GAO has 
considered, one cannot help feeling that the bureaucrat must indeed be a 
beloved creature. A long series of decisions established the proposition 
that donations from private sources for official travel to conduct 
government business constituted an unlawful augmentation unless the 
employing agency had statutory authority to accept gifts. If the agency had 
such authority, the donation could be made to the agency, not the 
individual employee, and the agency would then reimburse the employee in 
accordance with applicable travel laws and regulations, with the 
allowances reduced as appropriate in the case of contributions in kind.193 

One problem with this system was the lack of uniformity in treatment, 
varying with the agency’s statutory authority. Congress addressed the 
situation in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-194, § 302, 
103 Stat. 1716, 1745 (Nov. 30, 1989), codified at 31 U.S.C. § 1353. 
Subsection (a) provides as follows: 

“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the 
Director of the Office of Government Ethics, shall prescribe 
by regulation the conditions under which an agency in the 
executive branch (including an independent agency) may 
accept payment, or authorize an employee of such agency to 
accept payment on the agency’s behalf, from non-Federal 
sources for travel, subsistence, and related expenses with 
respect to attendance of the employee (or the spouse of 
such employee) at any meeting or similar function relating 
to the official duties of the employee. Any cash payment so 
accepted shall be credited to the appropriation applicable to 
such expenses. In the case of a payment in kind so 
accepted, a pro rata reduction shall be made in any 
entitlement of the employee to payment from the 
Government for such expenses.” 

GSA’s implementing regulations are found at 41 C.F.R. chapter 304 (2005). 
Thus, as long as acceptance complies with the statute and regulations, 

193 Some cases from this series are 59 Comp. Gen. 415 (1980); 55 Comp. Gen. 1293 (1976); 
49 Comp. Gen. 572 (1970); 46 Comp. Gen. 689 (1967); 36 Comp. Gen. 268 (1956); 26 Comp. 
Dec. 43 (1919).

there is no longer an augmentation problem. The existence or lack of 
separate statutory authority to accept gifts is immaterial. 

Another relevant statute, which seemingly overlaps 31 U.S.C. § 1353 to 
some extent but was left untouched by it, is 5 U.S.C. § 4111, enacted as part 
of the Government Employees Training Act, Pub. L. No. 85-507, 72 Stat. 327 
(July 7, 1958). Under this provision, an employee may accept 

(1) contributions and awards incident to training in nongovernment 
facilities, and (2) payment of travel, subsistence, and other expenses 
incident to attendance at meetings, but only if the donor is a tax-exempt 
nonprofit organization. If an employee receives a contribution in cash or in 
kind under this section, travel and subsistence allowances are subject to an 
“appropriate reduction.” 
Section 4111 authorizes the employee to accept the donation. It does not 
authorize the agency to accept the donation, credit it to its appropriations, 
and then reimburse the employee. 55 Comp. Gen. 1293 (1976). An 
employee who receives an authorized donation after the government has 
already paid the travel expenses cannot keep everything. The employee 
must refund to the government the amount by which his or her allowances 
would have been reduced had the donation been received before the 
allowances were paid. The agency may then credit this refund to its travel 
appropriation as an authorized repayment. Id. at 1294–95. See also 
41 C.F.R. § 304-9.5. 

The statute requires an “appropriate reduction” in travel payments in order 
to preclude the agency from paying for something that has already been 
reimbursed by an authorized private organization. An employee being 
reimbursed on an “actual expense” basis should not be claiming items 
which would duplicate private reimbursements. Thus, the agency is not 
required to reduce the actual expense entitlement by the value of provided 
meals. 64 Comp. Gen. 185 (1985). However, the value of subsistence items 
furnished in kind must be deducted where the employee is being 
reimbursed on a per diem basis. Id. at 188; 49 Comp. Gen. 572, 576 (1970). 

The authority conferred by 5 U.S.C. § 4111 is expressly limited to 
organizations exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) (religious, charitable, scientific, 
educational, etc.). It does not extend to organizations which may be taxexempt 
under other portions of section 501. B-225986, Mar. 2, 1987. Also, it 
does not apply to an organization whose application for exemption under 
section 501(c)(3) has not yet been approved; subsequent approval is not

retroactive for purposes of 5 U.S.C. § 4111. B-225264, Nov. 24, 1987 
(nondecision letter). 

Donations made under the express condition that they be used for some 
unauthorized purpose should be returned to the donor. 47 Comp. Gen. 319 
(1967). 

(2) Travel-related promotional items 
Over the years, commercial airlines and others have devised a variety of 
programs to reward frequent customers. Promotional materials awarded 
to customers may take various forms—bonus trips, reduced-fare coupons, 
cash, merchandise, credits toward future goods or services, etc. 
Government employees traveling on government business are eligible for 
these promotional items the same as anyone else. Historically, statutes, 
regulations, and case law had maintained that the government employee, 
with certain exceptions, could not keep such promotional items. The 
fundamental principle underlying the prior decisions and regulations in this 
area was that any benefit, cash payment or otherwise, received by a 
government employee from private sources incident to or resulting from 
the performance of official duty was regarded as having been received on 
behalf of the government and was the property of the government.194 

On December 28, 2001, the President signed into law a provision that 
federal employees may retain travel-related promotional items for personal 
use. Pub. L. No. 107-107, div. A, title XI, subtitle B, § 1116, 115 Stat. 1012, 
1241 (Dec. 28, 2001), 5 U.S.C. § 5702 note. The law specifically provides 
that a federal traveler who receives a promotional item (such as frequent 
flyer miles, upgrades, or access to carrier clubs or facilities) as a result of 
using travel or transportation services obtained at federal government 

194 GAO’s decisions involving promotional items obtained as a result of governmentsponsored 
travel were decided under its claims settlement authority and predate the 
transfer of this authority to the executive branch in 1995. For details of this transfer see 
B-275605, Mar. 17, 1997. GAO has not issued decisions on such promotional items 
subsequent to that transfer. In testimony before the House of Representative’s 
Subcommittee on Technology and Procurement Policy of the Committee on Government 
Reform, the Comptroller General spoke in favor of proposals that would allow employees 
who travel on government business to keep their frequent flyer miles, describing it as a 
“small benefit but one that private sector employers commonly provide their people as part 
of a mosaic of competitive employee benefits.” GAO, Human Capital: Building the 
Information Technology Workforce to Achieve Results, GAO-01-1007T (Washington, D.C.: 
July 31, 2001), at 23.

Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

expense may retain those items for personal use if the item is obtained 
under the same terms as those offered to the general public and at no 
additional cost to the government. The Federal Travel Regulation 
addresses promotional items in 41 C.F.R. part 301-53 (2005). 

4. Other Augmentation 
Principles and Cases 
As pointed out earlier in our introductory comments, the augmentation 
theory is relevant in a wide variety of contexts. The most common 
applications are the areas previously discussed—the spectrum of situations 
involving the miscellaneous receipts statute and the acceptance of gifts. 
This portion of the discussion will present a sampling of cases to illustrate 
other applications of the theory. 

Another way of stating the augmentation rule is that when Congress 
appropriates funds for an activity, the appropriation represents a limitation 
Congress has fixed for that activity, and all expenditures for that activity 
must come from that appropriation absent express authority to the 
contrary. Thus, a federal institution is normally not eligible to receive grant 
funds from another federal institution. It is not necessary for the grant 
statute to expressly exclude federal institutions as eligible grantees; the 
rule will apply based on the augmentation theory unless the grant statute 
expressly includes federal institutions. 57 Comp. Gen. 662, 664 (1978); 
23 Comp. Gen. 694 (1944); B-114868, Apr. 11, 1975.195 

The improper treatment of reimbursable transactions may result in an 
augmentation. An example of this type of transaction is an order under the 
Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535.196 Thus, if a given reimbursement must be 
credited to the appropriation that “earned” it (i.e., that financed the 
transaction), and that appropriation has expired, crediting the 
reimbursement to current funds is an improper augmentation. E.g., 
72 Comp. Gen. 109, 110 (1993); B-242274, Aug. 27, 1991. However, a de 
minimis exception to this rule was recognized in 72 Comp. Gen. 63 (1992). 
This decision held that a refund of $100 or less that related to an expired 
account could be treated as a credit against a future invoice to the party 
owing the refund, and thus applied to a current account since the cost of 

195 GAO has no decisions addressing whether a federal agency with gift acceptance authority 
may receive a gift of money transferred to it from another federal agency. 

196 Economy Act transactions are described in more detail in section E.2.e of this chapter, 
above, and in section B.1 of Chapter 15. 

Page 6-235 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 6 
Availability of Appropriations: Amount 

processing a separate refund check would exceed the amount of the 
refund. The decision reasoned that this approach would save the 
government money and have an insignificant impact on the agency’s 
account integrity. Id. at 64. The decision in 72 Comp. Gen. 109 (1993), 
which was issued shortly thereafter, underscored that this exception 
applied to de minimis amounts of $100 or less and did not apply to refunds 
that regularly exceeded $1,000. 72 Comp. Gen. at 110. 

Some statutes give an agency the option of crediting reimbursements either 
to current funds or to the appropriation that financed the transaction. E.g., 
10 U.S.C. §§ 2205 and 2210; 22 U.S.C. § 2392(c) and (d).197 Even here, 
however, crediting a reimbursement to an appropriation that bears no 
relationship to the transaction would be an unauthorized augmentation. 

B-132900-O.M., Nov. 1, 1977. 

Likewise, treating a transaction which should be reimbursed as 
nonreimbursable may result in an improper augmentation. For example, 
an agency receives appropriations to do its own work, not that of another 
agency. Accordingly, as a general proposition, interdepartmental loans of 
personnel on a nonreimbursable basis improperly augment the 
appropriations of the receiving agency. 65 Comp. Gen. 635 (1986); 
64 Comp. Gen. 370 (1985). Such nonreimbursable loans also constitute a 
misuse of the detailing agency’s appropriation under 31 U.S.C. § 1301. 

B-247348, June 22, 1992. 

Reimbursement by one agency to another in situations which are not the 
proper subject of an Economy Act agreement or where reimbursement is 
not otherwise statutorily authorized is improper for several reasons: It is 
an unauthorized transfer of appropriations; it violates 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) 
by using the reimbursing agency’s appropriations for other than their 
intended purpose; and it is an improper augmentation of the appropriations 
of the agency receiving the reimbursement. (The cases do not always cite 
all of these theories; they again illustrate the close interrelationship of the 
various concepts discussed throughout this publication.) The situation 
arises, for example, when agencies attempt to use the Economy Act for a 
“service” that is a normal part of the providing agency’s mission and for 
which it receives appropriations. 

197 For a discussion of some of these statutes as well as related and predecessor provisions, 
see B-179708-O.M., Dec. 1, 1975, and B-179708-O.M., July 21, 1975.

To illustrate, an agency acquiring land cannot reimburse the Justice 
Department for the legal expenses incurred incident to the acquisition 
because these are regular administrative expenses of the Justice 
Department for which it receives appropriations. 16 Comp. Gen. 333 
(1936). Similarly, an agency cannot reimburse the Treasury Department for 
the administrative expenses incurred in making disbursements on its 
account. 17 Comp. Gen. 728 (1938). 

Federal agencies may not reimburse the Patent Office for services 
performed in administering the patent and trademark laws since the Patent 
Office is required by law to furnish these services and receives 
appropriations for them. 33 Comp. Gen. 27 (1953). Nor may they 
reimburse the Library of Congress for recording assignments of copyrights 
to the United States. 31 Comp. Gen. 14 (1951). See also 40 Comp. Gen. 369 
(1960) (Interior Department may not charge other agencies for the cost of 
conducting hearings incident to the validation of unpatented mining claims, 
although it may charge for other services in connection with the validation 
which it is not required to furnish); B-211953, Dec. 7, 1984 (General 
Services Administration may not seek reimbursement for costs of storing 
records which it is required by law to store and for which it receives 
appropriations). 

The Merit Systems Protection Board may not accept reimbursement from 
other federal agencies for travel expenses of hearing officers to hearing 
sites away from the Board’s regular field offices. Holding the hearings is 
not a service to the other agency, but is a Board function for which it 
receives appropriations. The inadequacy of the Board’s appropriations to 
permit sufficient travel is legally irrelevant. 59 Comp. Gen. 415 (1980), aff’d 
upon reconsideration, 61 Comp. Gen. 419 (1982). Where an agency 
provides personnel to act as hearing officers for another agency, it may be 
reimbursed if it is not required to provide the officers (B-192875, Jan. 15, 
1980) but may not be reimbursed if it is required to provide them (32 Comp. 
Gen. 534 (1953)). Likewise, the Export-Import Bank cannot charge its 
customers for travel expenses incurred by Bank employees in transacting 
their business. B-277254, Mar. 5, 1997. 

A client agency must bear from its own appropriations costs it incurs in 
assisting the Justice Department to defend it in litigation. Such support 
costs, which may include substantial temporary services provided by the 
agency’s staff lawyers and paralegals, cannot be billed to Justice. 73 Comp. 
Gen. 90 (1994), citing 39 Comp. Gen. 643 (1960).

The decision in 70 Comp. Gen. 601 (1991) provides a variant on this 
principle. That decision approved the Army Civilian Appellate Review 
Agency’s practice of obtaining reimbursement from other Army 
components for costs it incurred in investigating grievances filed by 
employees of the other components. For one thing, both the Review 
Agency and the other components were funded from the same 
appropriation in most instances; thus, there could be no augmentation. 
However, even when different appropriations were involved, the other 
component’s appropriation could be charged pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 1534. 
Indeed, the decision pointed out that such charges were “precisely the kind 
of situation contemplated by section 1534” since the Review Agency 
assisted the other components in satisfying their obligation to provide a 
grievance resolution process for their employees. 70 Comp. Gen. at 604. 

Augmentation issues also can arise when an agency is trying to decide 
which of its appropriations to use for a given object. In 68 Comp. Gen. 337 
(1989), for example, the Railroad Retirement Board wanted to make 
performance awards to personnel in its Office of Inspector General (IG), 
and was unsure whether to charge its appropriation for the IG’s office or its 
general appropriation. A reasonable argument could be made to support 
either choice. Thus, the Board could make an election as long as it 
remained consistent thereafter. Since there was no indication that the IG 
appropriation was intended to be the exclusive funding source for the 
performance awards, using the general appropriation would not result in 
an improper augmentation of the IG appropriation.198 

A somewhat analogous situation could arise if an agency agrees to reduce 
or forgo receipts to which it is entitled, and the party owing those receipts 
agrees in return to make some expenditure which would otherwise have to 
be borne by a separate appropriation of the same agency. GAO examined 
such a situation in B-77467, Nov. 8, 1950, involving the leasing of lands 
under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act at reduced rentals on 
condition that the lessees in return perform certain improvements to the 
land. There was no augmentation in that case, however, since the statute 
expressly authorized the leasing with or without consideration and on such 

198 No augmentation requiring an election between potential funding sources exists, 
however, where the law clearly authorizes an agency to use both sources interchangeably in 
order to supplement each other. See B-272191, Nov. 4, 1997, distinguishing 68 Comp. 
Gen. 337.

terms as the Secretary of Agriculture determined would best accomplish 
the purposes of the act. 

The following cases illustrate other situations which GAO found would 
result in unauthorized augmentations: 

• The Customs Service may not charge the party-in-interest for travel 
expenses of customs employees incurred incident to official duties 
performed at night or on a Sunday or holiday. 43 Comp. Gen. 101 
(1963); 3 Comp. Gen. 960 (1924). See also 22 Comp. Dec. 253 
(1915).Department of Energy may not use overcharge refunds collected 
from oil companies to pay the administrative expenses of its Office of 
Hearings and Appeals. B-200170, Apr. 1, 1981. 
• Proposal for airlines to reimburse Treasury to permit Customs Service 
to hire additional staff to reduce clearance delays at Miami airport was 
unauthorized in that it would augment appropriations made by 
Congress for that service. 59 Comp. Gen. 294 (1980).

Chapter 7 

Obligation of Appropriations 

A. Introduction: 
Nature of an 
Obligation 
You, as an individual, use a variety of procedures to spend your money. 
Consider the following transactions: 

• You walk into a store, make a purchase, and pay at the counter with 
cash, check, or debit card. 
• You move to another counter and make another purchase with a credit 
card. No money changes hands at the time, but you sign a credit form 
which states that you promise to pay upon being billed. 
• You call the local tree surgeon to remove some ailing limbs from your 
favorite sycamore. He quotes an estimate and you arrange to have the 
work done. The tree doctor arrives while you are not at home, does the 
work, and slips his bill under your front door. 
• You visit your family dentist to relieve a toothache. The work is done 
and you go home. No mention is made of money. Of course, you know 
that the work wasn’t free and that the dentist will bill you. 
• You now visit your family lawyer to sue the dentist and the tree 
surgeon. The lawyer takes your case and you sign a contingent fee 
contract in which you agree that the lawyer’s fee will be one-third of 
any amounts recovered. 
Numerous other variations could be added to the list but these are 
sufficient to make the point. The first example is a simple cash transaction. 
The legal liability to pay and the actual disbursement of money occur 
simultaneously. The rest of the examples all have one essential thing in 
common: You first take some action which creates the legal liability to 
pay—that is, you “obligate” yourself to pay—and the actual disbursement 
of money follows at some later time. The obligation occurs in a variety of 
ways, such as placing an order or signing a contract. 

The government spends money in much the same fashion except that it is 
subject to a variety of statutory restrictions. The simple “cash transaction” 
or “direct outlay” involves a simultaneous obligation and disbursement and 
represents a minor portion of government expenditures. The major portion 
of appropriated funds are first obligated and then expended. The 
subsequent disbursement “liquidates” the obligation. Thus, an agency 
“uses” appropriations in two basic ways—direct expenditures 
(disbursements) and obligations. There is no legal requirement for you as 

Page 7-2 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

an individual to keep track of your “obligations.” For the government, 
there is. 

The concept of “obligation” is central to appropriations law. As will be 
demonstrated in the discussion below, this is because of the principle, one 
of the most fundamental, that an obligation must be charged against the 
relevant appropriation in accordance with the rules relating to purpose, 
time, and amount. The term “available for obligation” is used throughout 
this publication to refer to availability as to purpose, time, and amount. 
This chapter will explore exactly what an obligation is. 

It would be nice to start with an all-inclusive and universally applicable 
definition of “obligation.” However, because of the immense variety of 
transactions in which the government is involved, GAO has defined 
“obligation” only in the most general terms and has instead analyzed on a 
case-by-case basis the nature of the particular transaction at issue to 
determine whether an obligation has been incurred. B-192282, Apr. 18, 
1979; B-116795, June 18, 1954. 

The most one finds in the decisions are general statements referring to an 
obligation in such terms as “a definite commitment which creates a legal 
liability of the Government for the payment of appropriated funds for 
goods and services ordered or received.” B-116795, June 18, 1954. See also 
B-300480.2, June 6, 2003; B-272191, Nov. 4, 1997; B-265901, Oct. 14, 1997; 
21 Comp. Gen. 1162, 1163 (1941) (circular letter); B-222048, Feb. 10, 1987; 
B-82368, July 20, 1954; B-24827, Apr. 3, 1942. From the earliest days, the 
Comptroller General has cautioned that the obligating of appropriations 
must be “definite and certain.” A-5894, Dec. 3, 1924. 

Another definition of an “obligation” that one finds in the decisions takes a 
slightly broader perspective: 

“A legal duty on the part of the United States which 
constitutes a legal liability or which could mature into a 
legal liability by virtue of actions on the part of the other 
party beyond the control of the United States . . .” 

42 Comp. Gen. 733, 734 (1963). 

Thus, in very general and simplified terms, an “obligation” is some action 
that creates a legal liability or definite commitment on the part of the 
government, or creates a legal duty that could mature into a legal liability 

Page 7-3 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

by virtue of an action that is beyond the control of the government. 
Payment may be made immediately or in the future. GAO, A Glossary of 
Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, GAO-05-734SP (Washington, 
D.C.: September 2005), at 70. See also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. 
United States, 37 Fed. Cl. 295, 301, order modified, 39 Fed. Cl. 665 (1997); 
OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the 
Budget, §§ 20.3, 20.5 (June 21, 2005). 

An advance of funds to a working fund1 does not in itself serve to obligate 
the funds. See B-180578-O.M., Sept. 26, 1978. The same result holds for 
funds transferred to a special “holding account” established for 
administrative convenience. B-118638, Nov. 4, 1974 (appropriations for 
District of Columbia Public Defender Service under control of the 
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts are not obligated by transfer to a 
“Judiciary Trust Fund” established by the Administrative Office). 

The typical question on obligations is framed in terms of when the 
obligation may or must be “recorded,” that is, officially charged against the 
spending agency’s appropriations. Restated, what action is necessary or 
sufficient to create an obligation? This is essential in determining what 
fiscal year to charge, with all the consequences that flow from that 
determination. It is also essential to the broader concern of congressional 
control over the public purse. 

Before proceeding with the specifics, two general points should be noted. 
First, an obligation arises when the definite commitment is made, even 
though the actual payment may not take place until a future fiscal year. 

B-300480.2, June 6, 2003; 56 Comp. Gen. 351 (1977); 23 Comp. Gen. 862 
(1944). Second, for appropriations law purposes, the term “obligation” 
includes both matured and unmatured commitments. A matured 
commitment is a legal liability that is currently payable. An unmatured 
commitment is a liability which is not yet payable but for which a definite 
commitment nevertheless exists. For example, a contractual liability to 
pay for goods which have been delivered and accepted has “matured.” The 
liability for monthly rental payments under a lease is largely unmatured 
although the legal liability covers the entire rental period. Both types of 
liability are “obligations.” The fact that an unmatured liability may be 

1 A working fund account is established to receive advance payment from other agencies or 
accounts. 14 Comp. Gen. 25 (1934). For an example, see 10 U.S.C. § 2208, which authorizes 
working capital funds in the Department of Defense.

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

subject to a right of cancellation does not negate the obligation. A-97205, 
Feb. 3, 1944, at 9–10.2 

A recent decision illustrates this point. In B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003, GAO 
determined that the Corporation for National and Community Service 
(Corporation), the parent body of the AmeriCorps national service 
program, incurred a legal liability for the award of AmeriCorps national 
service educational benefits at the time it entered into a grant agreement to 
provide educational benefits to AmeriCorps participants. Participants in 
the AmeriCorps program who successfully completed a required term of 
service earned a national service educational award that could be used to 
pay for post-secondary education. The Corporation awarded grants to 
state service commissions, which awarded subgrants to the nonprofit 
groups—the entities that actually enrolled the AmeriCorps participants. 
When the Corporation awarded a grant to a state service commission, it 
entered into a binding agreement authorizing the state service commissions 
to provide grant awards to a specified number of new participants in the 
AmeriCorps program. The Corporation argued that it did not incur an 
obligation for an education award until the time of enrollment because the 
Corporation could modify the terms and conditions of a grant, including 
suspension of enrollment, prior to the enrollment of all positions initially 
approved in a grant. GAO disagreed and explained that: 

“The fact that the government may have the power to amend 
unilaterally a contract or agreement does not change the 
nature or scope of the obligation incurred at time of award. 
Were it otherwise, every government contract that permits 
the government to terminate the contract for the 
convenience of the government (48 C.F.R. § 49.502), or to 
modify the terms of the contract at will (48 C.F.R. 
§§ 52.243-1, 243-2, 243-3), would not be an obligation of the 
government at time of award. Long-standing practice and 
logic both of the Congress (31 U.S.C. § 1501, 41 U.S.C. § 5) 
and the accounting officers of the government (B-234957, 
July 10, 1989, B-112131, Feb. 1, 1956) have rejected such a 
view.” 

2 An “unmatured liability” as described in this paragraph is different from a “contingent 
liability” as discussed in section C of this chapter. 

Page 7-5 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003. GAO concluded that because the Corporation had 
taken an action that could mature into a legal liability for the education 
benefits by virtue of actions taken by the grantee and participants, not the 
Corporation, the Corporation incurred an obligation at the time of grant 
award. Id. Subsequently, GAO issued a second decision, B-300480.2, 
June 6, 2003, which elaborated upon and affirmed the April decision. 

B. Criteria for 
Recording 
Obligations 
(31 U.S.C. § 1501) 
The overrecording and the underrecording of obligations are equally 
improper. Both practices make it impossible to determine the precise 
status of the appropriation and can lead to other adverse consequences. 
Overrecording (recording as obligations items that are not) is usually done 
to inflate obligated balances and reduce unobligated balances of 
appropriations expiring at the end of a fiscal year. Underrecording (failing 
to record legitimate obligations) may result in violating the Antideficiency 
Act. 31 U.S.C. § 1341.3 A 1953 decision put it this way: 

“In order to determine the status of appropriations, both 
from the viewpoint of management and the Congress, it is 
essential that obligations be recorded in the accounting 
records on a factual and consistent basis throughout the 
Government. Only by the following of sound practices in 
this regard can data on existing obligations serve to indicate 
program accomplishments and be related to the amount of 
additional appropriations required.” 

32 Comp. Gen. 436, 437 (1953). See also GAO, Policy and Procedures 
Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 3.5.A. (Washington, 
D.C.: May 18, 1993) (hereafter GAO-PPM). 

The standards for the proper recording of obligations are found in 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1501(a), originally enacted as section 1311 of the Supplemental 
Appropriation Act, 1955, Pub. L. No. 83-663, 68 Stat. 800, 830 (Aug. 26, 
1954). A Senate committee has described the origin of the statute as 
follows: 

“Section 1311 of the Supplemental Appropriation Act of 
1955 resulted from the difficulty encountered by the House

Obligation of Appropriations 

Appropriations Committee in obtaining reliable figures on 
obligations from the executive agencies in connection with 
the budget review. It was not uncommon for the 
committees to receive two or three different sets of figures 
as of the same date. This situation, together with rather 
vague explanations of certain types of obligations 
particularly in the military department[s], caused the House 
Committee on Appropriations to institute studies of agency 
obligating practices. 

* * * * * 

“The result of these examinations laid the foundation for the 
committee’s conclusion that loose practices had grown up 
in various agencies, particularly in the recording of 
obligations in situations where no real obligation existed, 
and that by reason of these practices the Congress did not 
have reliable information in the form of accurate obligations 
on which to determine an agency’s future requirements. To 
correct this situation, the committee, with the cooperation 
of the General Accounting Office and the Bureau of the 
Budget, developed what has become the statutory criterion 
by which the validity of an obligation is determined. . . .”4 

Thus, the primary purpose of 31 U.S.C. § 1501 is to ensure that agencies 
record only those transactions which meet specified standards for 
legitimate obligations. 71 Comp. Gen. 109 (1991); 54 Comp. Gen. 962, 964 
(1975); 51 Comp. Gen. 631, 633 (1972); B-192036, Sept. 11, 1978.5 

Subsection (a) of 31 U.S.C. § 1501 prescribes specific criteria for recording 
obligations. The subsection begins by stating that “[a]n amount shall be 

4 Senate Committee on Government Operations, Financial Management in the Federal 
Government, S. Doc. No. 87-11, at 85 (1961). 

5 Although 31 U.S.C. § 1501 does not expressly apply to the government of the District of 
Columbia, GAO has expressed the view that the same criteria should be followed. B-180578, 
Sept. 26, 1978. This is because the proper recording of obligations is the only way to assure 
compliance with 31 U.S.C. § 1341, a portion of the Antideficiency Act, which does expressly 
apply to the government of the District of Columbia. District of Columbia Self-Government 
and Governmental Reorganization Act (so-called “Home Rule” Act), Pub. L. No. 93-198, 
§ 603(e), 87 Stat. 774, 815 (Dec. 24, 1973). 

Page 7-7 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

recorded as an obligation of the United States Government only when 
supported by documentary evidence” and then goes on to specify nine 
criteria for recording obligations. Note that the statute requires 
“documentary evidence” to support the recording in each instance. In one 
sense, these nine criteria taken together may be said to comprise the 
“definition” of an obligation.6 

If a given transaction does not meet any of the criteria, then it is not a 
proper obligation and may not be recorded as one. Once one of the criteria 
is met, however, the agency not only may but must at that point record the 
transaction as an obligation. While 31 U.S.C. § 1501 does not explicitly 
state that obligations must be recorded as they arise or are incurred, it 
follows logically from an agency’s responsibility to comply with the 
Antideficiency Act. GAO has made the point in decisions and reports in 
various contexts. E.g., B-302358, Dec. 27, 2004; 72 Comp. Gen. 59 (1992); 
65 Comp. Gen. 4, 6 (1985); B-242974.6, Nov. 26, 1991; B-226801, Mar. 2, 1988; 
B-192036, Sept. 11, 1978; A-97205, Feb. 3, 1944, at 10; GAO, FGMSD-75-20 
(Washington, D.C.: Feb. 13, 1975) (untitled letter report); GAO, Substantial 
Understatement of Obligations for Separation Allowances for Foreign 
National Employees, B-179343, (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 21, 1974), at 6. 

It is important to emphasize the relationship between the existence of an 
obligation and the act of recording. Recording evidences the obligation but 
does not create it. If a given transaction is not sufficient to constitute a 
valid obligation, recording it will not make it one. E.g., B-197274, Feb. 16, 
1982 (“reservation and notification” letter held not to constitute an 
obligation, act of recording notwithstanding, where letter did not impose 
legal liability on government and subsequent formation of contract was 
within agency’s control). Conversely, failing to record a valid obligation in 
no way diminishes its validity or affects the fiscal year to which it is 
properly chargeable. E.g., B-226782, Oct. 20, 1987 (letter of intent, 
executed in fiscal year 1985 and found to constitute a contract, obligated 
fiscal year 1985 funds, notwithstanding agency’s failure to treat it as an 
obligation). See also 63 Comp. Gen. 525 (1984); 38 Comp. Gen. 81, 82–83 
(1958). 

The precise amount of the government’s liability should be recorded as the 
obligation where that amount is known. However, where the precise 
amount is not known at the time the obligation is incurred, an obligation 

6 S. Doc. No. 87-11, at 86. 

Page 7-8 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

amount must still be recorded on a preliminary basis. How to determine 
this amount is discussed in section B.1.f of this chapter. See also OMB 
Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, 
§ 20.5 (June 21, 2005) for guidance on how to record obligation amounts in 
certain situations. As more precise data on the liability becomes available, 
the obligation must be periodically adjusted, that is, the agency must 
deobligate funds or increase the obligational level as the case may be. 
7 GAO-PPM § 3.5.D; B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003. 

Adjustments to recorded obligations, like the initial recordings themselves, 
must be supported by documentary evidence. The use of statistical 
methods to make adjustments “lacks legal foundation if the underlying 
transactions cannot be identified and do not support the calculated totals.” 
B-236940, Oct. 17, 1989; GAO, Financial Management: Defense 
Accounting Adjustments for Stock Fund Obligations Are Illegal, 

GAO/AFMD-87-1 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 11, 1987), at 6. 

A related concept is the allocation of obligations for administrative 
expenses (utility costs, computer services, etc.) between or among 
programs funded under separate appropriations. There is no rule or 
formula for this allocation apart from the general prescription that the 
agency must use a supportable methodology. Merely relying on the 
approved budget is not sufficient. See GAO, Financial Management: 
Improvements Needed in OSMRE’s Method of Allocating Obligations, 

GAO/AFMD-89-89 (Washington, D.C.: July 28, 1989). An agency may 
initially charge common-use items to a single appropriation as long as it 
makes the appropriate adjustments from other benefiting appropriations 
before or as of the end of the fiscal year. 31 U.S.C. § 1534; 70 Comp. 
Gen. 601 (1991). The allocation must be in proportion to the benefit. 
70 Comp. Gen. 592 (1991). 

Further procedural guidance may be found in OMB Circular No. A-11, at 
§ 20.5; the Treasury Financial Manual; and title 7 of GAO’s Policy and 
Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. For the most part, 
the statutory criteria in 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a) reflect standards that had been 
developed in prior decisions of the Comptroller General over the years. 
See, e.g., 18 Comp. Gen. 363 (1938); 16 Comp. Gen. 37 (1936). The 
remainder of this section will explore the nine specific recording criteria.

person (including an agency) that is—

 “(A) in writing, in a way and form, and for a purpose 
authorized by law; and

 “(B) executed before the end of the period of 
availability for obligation of the appropriation or 
fund used for specific goods to be delivered, real 
property to be bought or leased, or work or service to

 be provided.” 

As seen in Chapter 5, the general rule for obligating fiscal year 
appropriations by contract is that the contract imposing the obligation 
must be made within the fiscal year sought to be charged and must meet a 
bona fide need of that fiscal year. E.g., B-272191, Nov. 4, 1997; B-235086, 
Apr. 24, 1991; 37 Comp. Gen. 155 (1957). This discussion will center on the 
timing of the obligation from the perspective of 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1). 

Subsection (a)(1) actually imposes several different requirements— 

• a binding agreement; 
• in writing; 
• for a purpose authorized by law; 
• executed before the expiration of the period of obligational availability; 
and 
• a contract calling for specific goods, real property, work, or services. 
An agreement must be legally binding (offer, acceptance, consideration, 
made by authorized official). As stated in a 1991 decision: 

“The primary purpose of section 1501(a)(1) is to ‘require 
that there be an offer and acceptance imposing liability on 

Page 7-10 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

both parties.’ 39 Comp. Gen. 829, 831 (1960). Hence the 
government may record an obligation under section 1501 
only upon evidence that both parties to the contract 
willfully express the intent to be bound.” 

71 Comp. Gen. 109, 110 (1991) (emphasis in original). To be binding, 
however, an agreement does not have to be the final “definitized” contract. 
The legislative history of subsection (a)(1) makes this clear. The following 
excerpt is taken from the conference report: 

“Section 1311(a)(1) precludes the recording of an obligation 
unless it is supported by documentary evidence of a binding 
agreement between the parties as specified therein. It is not 
necessary, however, that the binding agreement be the final 
formal contract on any specified form. The primary 
purpose is to require that there be an offer and an 
acceptance imposing liability on both parties. For example, 
an authorized order by one agency on another agency of the 
Government, if accepted by the latter and meeting the 
requirement of specificity, etc., is sufficient. Likewise, a 
letter of intent accepted by a contractor, if sufficiently 
specific and definitive to show the purposes and scope of 
the contract finally to be executed, would constitute the 
binding agreement required.”7 

The following passage from 42 Comp. Gen. 733, 734 (1963) remains a useful 
general prescription: 

“The question whether Government funds are obligated at 
any specific time is answerable only in terms of an analysis 
of written arrangements and conditions agreed to by the 
United States and the party with whom it is dealing. If such 
analysis discloses a legal duty on the part of the United 
States which constitutes a legal liability or which could 
mature into a legal liability by virtue of actions on the part of 
the other party beyond the control of the United States, an 
obligation of funds may generally be stated to exist.”

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

In 35 Comp. Gen. 319 (1955), and 59 Comp. Gen. 431 (1980), the 
Comptroller General set forth the factors that must be present in order for 
a binding agreement to exist for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1) with 
respect to contracts awarded under competitive procedures: 

• Each bid must have been in writing. 
• The acceptance of each bid must have been communicated to the 
bidder in the same manner as the bid was made. If the bid was mailed, 
the contract must have been placed in the mails before the close of the 
fiscal year. If the bid was delivered other than by mail, the contract 
must have been delivered in like manner before the end of the fiscal 
year. 
• Each contract must have incorporated the terms and conditions of the 
respective bid without qualification. Otherwise, it must be viewed as a 
counteroffer and there would be no binding agreement until accepted 
by the contractor. 
To illustrate, where the agency notified the successful bidder of the award 
by telephone near the end of fiscal year 1979 but did not mail the contract 
document until fiscal year 1980, there was no valid obligation of fiscal year 
1979 funds. 59 Comp. Gen. 431 (1980). See also Goldberger Foods v. 
United States, 23 Cl. Ct. 295, 302–303, aff’d, 960 F.2d 155 (Fed. Cir. 1992); 

B-159999-O.M., Mar. 16. 1967; B-235086, Apr. 24, 1991; 35 Comp. Gen. 319 
(1955). A document is considered “mailed” when it is placed in the custody 
of the Postal Service (given to postman or dropped in mailbox or letter 
chute in office building); merely delivering the document to an agency 
messenger with instructions to mail it is insufficient. 59 Comp. 
Gen. 431, 433 (1980); B-235086, Apr. 24, 1991. Similarly, there was no 
recordable obligation of fiscal year 1960 funds where the agency 
erroneously mailed the notice of award to the wrong bidder and did not 
notify the successful bidder until the first day of fiscal year 1961. 40 Comp. 
Gen. 147 (1960). It is important to note that, in the above cases, the 
obligation was invalid only with respect to the fiscal year the agency 
wanted to charge. The agency could still proceed to finalize the obligation 
but would have to charge funds current in the subsequent fiscal year. 

A mere request for additional supplies under a purchase order with no 
indication of acceptance of the request does not create a recordable 
obligation. 39 Comp. Gen. 829 (1960). Similarly, a work order or purchase 

Page 7-12 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

order may be recorded as an obligation only where it constitutes a binding 
agreement for specific work or services. 34 Comp. Gen. 459 (1955). 

A “letter of intent” is a preliminary document that may or may not 
constitute an obligation. At one extreme, it may be nothing more than an 
“agreement to agree” with neither party bound until execution of the formal 
contract. E.g., B-201035, Feb. 15, 1984, at 5. At the other extreme, it may 
contain all the elements of a contract, in which event it will create binding 
obligations. The crucial question is whether the parties intended to be 
bound, determinable primarily from the language actually used. Saul 
Bass & Associates v. United States, 505 F.2d 1386 (Ct. Cl. 1974). For a 
good example of a letter of intent creating contractual obligations, see 

B-226782, Oct. 20, 1987. 

A letter of intent which amounts to a contract is also called a “letter 
contract.” In the context of government procurement, it is used most 
commonly when there is insufficient time to prepare and execute the full 
contract before the end of the fiscal year. As indicated in the legislative 
history quoted earlier, a “letter of intent” accepted by the contractor may 
form the basis of an obligation if it is sufficiently specific and definitive to 
show the purpose and scope of the contract. 21 Comp. Gen. 574 (1941); 
B-127518, May 10, 1956. Letters of intent should be used “only under 
conditions of the utmost urgency.” 33 Comp. Gen. 291, 293 (1954). Under 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), letter contracts may be used— 

“when (1) the Government’s interests demand that the 
contractor be given a binding commitment so that work can 
start immediately and (2) negotiating a definitive contract is 
not possible in sufficient time to meet the requirement. 
However, a letter contract should be as complete and 
definite as feasible under the circumstances.” 

48 C.F.R. § 16.603-2(a) (2005). 

The amount to be obligated under a letter contract is the government’s 
maximum liability under the letter contract itself, without regard to 
additional obligations anticipated to be included in the definitive contract 
or, restated, the amount necessary to cover expenses to be incurred by the 
contractor prior to execution of the definitive contract. The obligation is 
recorded against funds available for obligation at the time the letter 
contract is issued. 34 Comp. Gen. 418, 421 (1955); B-197274, Sept. 23, 1983; 

Page 7-13 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


b. Contract “in Writing” 
Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

B-197274, Feb. 16, 1982; B-127518, May 10, 1956. See also FAR, 48 C.F.R. 
§§ 16.603-2(d), 16.603-3(a). 

Once the definitive contract is executed, the government’s liability under 
the letter contract is merged into it. If definitization does not occur until 
the following fiscal year, the definitive contract will obligate funds of the 
latter year, usually in the amount of the total contract price less an 
appropriate deduction relating to the letter contract. B-197274, Sept. 23, 
1983. The cited decision, at page 5, specifies how to calculate the 
deduction as follows: 

“The definitized contract then supports obligating against 
the appropriation current at the time it is entered into since 
it is, in fact, a bona fide need of that year. The amount of the 
definitized contract would ordinarily be the total contract 
cost less either the actual costs incurred under the letter 
contract (when known) or the amount of the maximum 
legal liability permitted by the letter contract (when the 
actual costs cannot be determined).” 

Letter contracts should be definitized within 180 days, or before 
completion of 40 percent of the work to be performed, whichever occurs 
first. FAR, 48 C.F.R. § 16.603-2(c). Also, letter contracts should not be used 
to record excess obligations as this distorts the agency’s funding picture. 
See GAO, Contract Pricing: Obligations Exceed Definitized Prices on 
Unpriced Contracts, GAO/NSIAD-86-128 (Washington, D.C.: May 2, 1986). 

Although the binding agreement under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1) must be “in 
writing,” the “writing” is not necessarily limited to words on a piece of 
paper. The traditional mode of contract execution is to affix original 
handwritten signatures to a document (paper) setting forth the contract 
terms. Change is in the winds, however, and traditional interpretations are 
being reassessed in light of advancing computer technologies. In 1983, 
GAO’s legal staff, in an internal memorandum to one of GAO’s audit 
divisions, took note of modern legal trends and advised that the “in writing” 
requirement could be satisfied by computer-related media which produce 
tangible recordings of information, such as punch cards, magnetic cards, 
tapes, or disks. B-208863(2)-O.M., May 23, 1983. 

Eight years later, the Comptroller General issued his first formal decision 
on the topic, 71 Comp. Gen. 109 (1991). The National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) asked whether federal agencies could use certain 

Page 7-14 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) technologies to create valid contractual 
obligations for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a). Yes, replied the 
Comptroller, as long as there are adequate safeguards and controls to 
provide no less certainty and protection of the government’s interests as 
under a “paper and ink” method. The decision states: 

“We conclude that EDI systems using message 
authentication codes which follow NIST’s Computer Data 
Authentication Standard . . . or digital signatures following 
NIST’s Digital Signature Standard, as currently proposed, 
can produce a form of evidence that is acceptable under 
section 1501.” 

71 Comp. Gen. at 111. In 2000, Congress enacted the Electronic Signatures 
in Global and National Commerce Act,8 which confirmed the legality of 
digital signatures in any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign 
commerce. Section 101(a) of the act provides: 

“In General.—Notwithstanding any statute, regulation, or 
other rule of law . . . with respect to any transaction in or 
affecting interstate or foreign commerce— 

(1)a signature, contract, or other record relating to such 
transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or 
enforceability solely because it is in electronic form; and 
(2) a contract relating to such transaction may not be denied 
legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because an 
electronic signature or electronic record was used in its 
formation.” 
While there may be some room for interpretation as to what constitutes a 
“writing” for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1), the writing, in some 
acceptable form, must exist. Under the plain terms of the statute, an oral 
agreement may not be recorded as an obligation. In United States v. 
American Renaissance Lines, Inc., 494 F.2d 1059, 1062 (D.C. Cir.), 
cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1020 (1974), the court found that 31 U.S.C. 

8 Pub. L. No. 106-229, § 101(a), 114 Stat. 464 (June 30, 2000).

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

§ 1501(a)(1) “establishes virtually a statute of frauds” for the government9 
and held that neither party can judicially enforce an oral contract in 
violation of the statute. 

However, the Court of Claims and its successors, the Claims Court and 
United States Court of Federal Claims, have taken the position that 
31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1) does not bar recovery “outside of the contract” 
where sufficient additional facts exist for the court to infer the necessary 
“meeting of minds” (contract implied-in-fact). Narva Harris Construction 
Corp. v. United States, 574 F.2d 508 (Ct. Cl. 1978); Johns-Manville Corp. v. 
United States, 12 Cl. Ct. 1, 19–20 (1987). Cf. Kinzley v. United States, 
661 F.2d 187 (Ct. Cl. 1981) (documentary evidence of employment of 
persons sufficient to support oral employment contract for purposes of 
31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(7)). In Pacord, Inc. v. United States, 139 F.3d 1320 
(9th Cir. 1998), the court relied on Narva Harris Construction Corp. in 
holding that, even though the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
generally requires contracts to be in writing,10 an oral contract may be 
enforced if the plaintiff “can establish sufficient facts, beyond a mere oral 
agreement, for the court to infer the existence of an implied-in-fact 
contract.” Pacord, 139 F.3d at 1323. 

These would be examples of subsequently imposed liability where the 
agency did not record—and lawfully could not have recorded—an 
obligation when the events giving rise to the liability took place. If a 
contractor received a judgment in this type of situation, the obligational 
impact on the contracting agency would depend on whether the case was 
subject to the Contract Disputes Act. If the Act applies, the judgment 
would be payable initially from the permanent judgment appropriation 
(31 U.S.C. § 1304), to be reimbursed by the agency from currently available 
appropriations. See 41 U.S.C. §§ 612(a)–(c); B-252754, Oct. 6, 1994. If the 
Act does not apply, the judgment would be paid from the judgment 

9 A “statute of frauds” is a law requiring contracts to be in writing in order to be enforceable. 
Most, if not all, states have some version of such a statute. Strictly speaking, as the 
Comptroller General has noted, there is no federal statute of frauds. 39 Comp. Gen. 829, 831 
(1960). See also 55 Comp. Gen. 833 (1976). 

10 The FAR defines “contracts” as including “all types of commitments that obligate the 
Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise 
authorized, are in writing.” This provision also provides that “[i]n writing, writing, or written 
means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later 
communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information.” 48 C.F.R. 
§ 2.101 (2005).

Obligation of Appropriations 

appropriation without reimbursement, and there would thus be no 
obligational impact on the agency. 

In B-118654, Aug. 10, 1965, GAO concluded that a notice of award signed by 
the contracting officer and issued before the close of the fiscal year did not 
satisfy the requirements of 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1) where it incorporated 
modifications of the offer as to price and other terms which had been 
agreed to orally during negotiations. The reason is that there was no 
evidence in writing that the contractor had agreed to the modifications. 
GAO conceded, however, that the agency’s argument that there was 
documentary evidence of a binding agreement for purposes of 
section 1501(a)(1) was not without merit. In view of this and since the 
agency was in the process of changing its contracting procedures to assure 
adequate documentary evidence of both the offer and the acceptance, we 
did not insist on any appropriation adjustments. 

In a 1977 decision, however, GAO concluded that a signed contract that 
included ambiguous terms relating to pricing might not be defeated where 
the ambiguity was resolved by telephone conversations that were 
incorporated by reference into an award letter, even though there was no 
written record of the conversations showing agreement by both parties. 
The Comptroller General concluded that the potential defect in any event 
would not afford a basis for a third party (in this case a protesting 
unsuccessful offeror) to object to the contract’s legality. 56 Comp. 
Gen. 768, 775 (1977). 

The statute requires documentary evidence of a binding agreement for 
specific goods or services. An agreement that fails this test is not a valid 
obligation. 

For example, a State Department contract under the Migration and Refugee 
Assistance Program establishing a contingency fund “to provide funds for 
refugee assistance by any means, organization or other voluntary agency as 
determined by the Supervising Officer” did not meet the requirement of 
specificity and therefore was not a valid obligation. B-147196, Apr. 5, 1965. 

Similarly, a purchase order which lacks a description of the products to be 
provided is not sufficient to create a recordable obligation. B-196109, 
Oct. 23, 1979. In the cited decision, a purchase order for “regulatory, 
warning, and guide signs based on information supplied” on requisitions to 
be issued did not validly obligate fiscal year 1978 funds where the 
requisitions were not sent to the supplier until after the close of fiscal year

d. Invalid 
Award/Unauthorized 
Commitment 
1978. See also 70 Comp. Gen. 481 (1991) (advances to establish an imprest 
fund to finance unspecified future cash payments do not meet the statutory 
requirements for recording obligations). 

Where a contract award is determined to be invalid, the effect is that no 
binding agreement ever existed as required by 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1) and 
therefore there was no valid obligation of funds. 38 Comp. Gen. 190 (1958); 
B-157360, Aug. 11, 1965. As discussed in Chapter 5, section B.6, under more 
recent authorities the original obligation is not extinguished for all 
purposes, and those amounts originally obligated remain available postexpiration 
to fund a valid “replacement contract.” 70 Comp. Gen. 230 
(1991); 68 Comp. Gen. 158 (1988). Where the invalidity is determined under 
a bid protest, which will presumably cover most such instances, the 
extended availability described in the GAO decisions is statutorily defined 
as 100 days after the final ruling on the protest. 31 U.S.C. § 1558(a). Thus, 
cases like 38 Comp. Gen. 190 must be regarded as modified to this extent. 
Of course, amounts originally obligated do not survive post-expiration for 
anything other than a valid replacement contract. B-270723, Apr. 15, 1996. 

Where the Comptroller General awards bid preparation costs to a 
successful protester under authority of 31 U.S.C. § 3554(c), payment should 
be charged to the agency’s procurement appropriations current at the time 
GAO issued its decision. If the agency must verify the amount of bid 
preparation costs to which the protester is entitled prior to payment, the 
agency should record an estimated obligation, using GAO’s decision as the 
obligating document. Upon verification, the obligation is adjusted up or 
down as necessary, on the basis of the documents submitted by the 
protester to substantiate the amount. B-199368.4, Jan. 19, 1983 
(nondecision letter). 

Claims against the government resulting from unauthorized commitments 
raise obligation questions in two general situations. If the circumstances 
surrounding the unauthorized commitment are sufficient to give rise to a 
contract implied-in-fact, it may be possible for the agency to ratify the 
unauthorized act. If the ratification occurs in a subsequent fiscal year, the 
obligation is chargeable to the prior year, that is, the year in which the need 
presumably arose and the claimant performed. B-208730, Jan. 6, 1983. 
However, before an agency chooses to ratify the obligation, it first must 
assure that sufficient prior year unobligated funds remain available to 
cover the ratification. Id.; B-290005, July 1, 2002. If ratification is not 
available for whatever reason, the only remaining possibility for payment is 
a quantum meruit recovery under a theory of contract implied-in-law. The 

Page 7-18 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

e. Variations in Quantity to Be 
Furnished 
quantum meruit theory permits payment in limited circumstances even in 
cases where there was no valid obligation, for example, where the 
contractor has made partial delivery operating under what he believed to 
be a valid contract. B-303906, Dec. 7, 2004; B-251668, May 13, 1993; 
B-118428, Sept. 21, 1954. See also 67 Comp. Gen. 507 (1988). The 
obligational impact is the same as for ratification—payment is chargeable 
to the fiscal year in which the claimant performed. B-210808, May 24, 1984; 
B-207557, July 11, 1983. 

In some types of contracts, the quantity of goods to be furnished or 
services to be performed may vary. The quantity may be indefinite or it 
may be stated in terms of a definite minimum with permissible variation. 
Variations may be at the option of the government or the contractor. The 
obligational treatment of this type of contract depends on the exact nature 
of the contractual liability imposed on the government. 

Before proceeding, it is important to define some terms. A requirements 
contract is one in which the government agrees to purchase all of its needs 
for the particular item or service during the contract period from the 
contractor, and the contractor agrees to fill all such needs. Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R. § 16.503(a) (2005); Modern 
Systems Technology Corp. v. United States, 979 F.2d 200, 206 (Fed. Cir. 
1992); Torncello v. United States, 681 F.2d 756, 761 (Ct. Cl. 1982). An 
indefinite-quantity contract is one in which the contractor agrees to 
supply whatever quantity the government may order, within limits, with the 
government under no obligation to use that contractor for all of its 
requirements. FAR, 48 C.F.R. § 16.504(a); Hemet Valley Flying 
Service Co. v. United States, 7 Cl. Ct. 512, 515–16 (1985); Mason v. 
United States, 615 F.2d 1343, 1346 n.5 (Ct. Cl.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 830 
(1980); B-302358, Dec. 27, 2004. Under either type of contract, the 
government orders specific quantities from time to time by issuing a 
document variously termed a work order, task order, delivery order, etc. 

In a requirements contract, the government must state a realistic estimated 
total quantity. An agency may obtain its estimate from records of previous 
requirements and consumption, or by other means, and should base the 
estimate on the most current information available. FAR, 48 C.F.R. 
§ 16.503(a)(1); B-190855, Mar. 31, 1978; B-188426, Sept. 20, 1977. It is not 
legally necessary that requirements contracts place a minimum or a 
maximum limit upon the estimated requirements. B-256312, June 6, 1994; 
B-226992.2, July 13, 1987. See also Unlimited Enterprises, Export-Import, 
Inc., ASBCA No. 34825, 88-3 BCA ¶ 20,908 (1988). However, the FAR 

Page 7-19 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

provides that “[t]he contract shall state, if feasible, the maximum limit of 
the contractor’s obligation to deliver and the Government’s obligation to 
order.” 48 C.F.R. § 16.503(a)(2). Needs must relate to the contract period. 
21 Comp. Gen. 961, 964 (1942). 

If, in the exercise of good faith, the anticipated requirements simply do not 
materialize, the government is not obligated to purchase the stated 
estimate or indeed, if no requirements arise, to place any orders with the 
contractor beyond any required minimum. 47 Comp. Gen. 365, 370 (1968). 
See also Appeal of Shepard Printing, GPOBCA No. 37-92 (1994); AGS-
Genesys Corp., ASBCA No. 35302, 89-2 BCA ¶ 21,702 (1989); World 
Contractors, Inc., ASBCA No. 20354, 75-2 BCA ¶ 11,536 (1975). The 
contractor assumes the risk that nonguaranteed requirements may fall 
short of expectations, and has no claim for a price adjustment if they do. 
Medart, Inc. v. Austin, 967 F.2d 579 (Fed. Cir. 1992); 37 Comp. Gen. 688 
(1958). If, however, the government attempts to meet its requirements 
elsewhere, including the development of in-house capability, or if failure to 
place orders with the contractor for valid needs is otherwise found to 
evidence lack of good faith, liability will result. E.g., Rumsfeld v. Applied 
Companies, Inc., 325 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 981 (2003); 
Torncello, 681 F.2d at 768–69; Cleek Aviation v. United States, 19 Cl. Ct. 552

An indefinite-quantity contract, under current regulations, must include a 
minimum purchase requirement which must be more than nominal. FAR, 
48 C.F.R. § 16.504(a)(2); B-302358, Dec. 27, 2004. An indefinite-quantity 
contract without a minimum purchase requirement is regarded as illusory 
and unenforceable. It is no contract at all. Torncello, 681 F.2d at 761;

An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract is a form of an 
indefinite-quantity contract. As with other indefinite quantity contracts, an 

Page 7-20 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

IDIQ contract must require the government to order, and the contractor to 
furnish, at least a stated minimum quantity of supplies or services. FAR, 
48 C.F.R. § 16.504(a). While the agency may place orders at any time during 
a fixed period, actual delivery dates during that period are undefined. After 
award of an IDIQ contract, the government places task or delivery orders 
with the contractor (or contractors) as the government’s needs become 
definite. B-302358, Dec. 27, 2004. IDIQs have historically provided a way to 
expeditiously fill certain government needs. See GAO, Contract 
Management: Few Competing Proposals for Large DOD Information 
Technology Orders, NSIAD-00-56 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 20, 2000), at 5. 

What does all this signify from the perspective of obligating 
appropriations? As we noted at the outset, the obligational impact of a 
variable quantity contract depends on exactly what the government has 
bound itself to do. A fairly simple generalization can be deduced from the 
decisions: In a variable quantity contract (requirements or indefinitequantity), 
any required minimum purchase must be obligated when the 
contract is executed; subsequent obligations occur as work orders or 
delivery orders are placed, and are chargeable to the fiscal year in which 
the order is placed. B-302358, Dec. 27, 2004. 

Thus, in a variable quantity contract with no guaranteed minimum—or any 
analogous situation in which there is no liability unless and until an order is 
placed—there would be no recordable obligation at the time of award. 

B-302358, Dec. 27, 2004; B-259274, May 22, 1996; 63 Comp. Gen. 129 (1983); 
60 Comp. Gen. 219 (1981); 34 Comp. Gen. 459, 462 (1955); B-124901, Oct. 26, 
1955 (“call contract”).11 Obligations are recorded as orders are placed. 

The same approach applies to a contract for a fixed quantity in which the 
government reserves an option to purchase an additional quantity. The 
contract price for the fixed quantity is an obligation at the time the contract 
is entered into; the reservation of the option ripens into an obligation only 
if and when the government exercises the option. 19 Comp. Gen. 980 
(1940). See also B-287619, July 5, 2001 (for medical services provided 
through civilian contracted care, DOD’s legal liability for at-risk payment is 
determined by the fixed price established by the contract and should be 
recorded at the time DOD executes the contract, and again when it 
executes any subsequent options). 

11 As cases such as 63 Comp. Gen. 129 illustrate, there can be many variations on the basic 
indefinite-quantity theme. 

Page 7-21 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

An application of these concepts also can be found at B-192036, Sept. 11, 
1978. The National Park Service entered into a construction contract for 
the development of a national historic site. Part of the contract price was a 
“contingent sum” of $25,000 for “Force Account Work,” described in the 
contract as miscellaneous items of a minor nature not included in the bid 
schedule. No “Force Account Work” was to be done except under written 
orders issued by the contracting officer. Since a written order was required 
for the performance of work, no part of the $25,000 could be recorded as an 
obligation unless and until such orders were issued and accepted by the 
contractor. That portion of the master contract itself which provided for 
the Force Account Work was not sufficiently specific to create an 
obligation. 

In a 1955 case, the Army entered into a contract for the procurement of 
lumber. The contract contained a clause permitting a 10 percent 
overshipment or undershipment of the quantity ordered. This type of 
clause was standard in lumber procurement contracts. The Comptroller 
General held that the Army could obligate the amount necessary to pay for 
the maximum quantities deliverable under the contract. 34 Comp. Gen. 596 
(1955). Here, the quantity was definite and the government was required to 
accept the permissible variation. 

In another 1955 case, the General Services Administration had published in 
the Federal Register an offer to purchase chrome ore up to a stated 
maximum quantity. Formal agreements would not be executed until 
producers made actual tenders of the ore. The program published in the 
Federal Register was a mere offer to purchase and GSA could not obligate 
funds to cover the total quantity authorized. Reason: there was no mutual 
assent and therefore no binding agreement in writing until a producer 
responded to the offer and a formal contract was executed. B-125644, 
Nov. 21, 1955. 

So-called “level of effort” contracts are conceptually related to the 
“variation in quantity” cases. In one case, the Environmental Protection 
Agency entered into a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for various services at an 
EPA facility. The contractor’s contractual obligation was expressed as a 
“level of effort” in terms of staff-hours. The contractor was to provide up to 
a stated maximum number of direct staff-hours, to be applied on the basis 
of work orders issued during the course of the contract. Since the 
government was obligated under the contract to order specific tasks, the 
contract was sufficiently definitive to justify recording the full estimated 
contract amount at the time of award. B-183184, May 30, 1975. See also

letter). 

f. Amount to Be Recorded As noted previously, where the precise amount of the government’s liability 
is defined at the time the government enters into the contract that is the 
amount to be recorded. For example, in the simple firm fixed-price 
contract, the contract price is the recordable obligation. The possibility 
that the contractor may not perform up to the level specified in the contract 
does not provide a basis for recording less than the full contract price as 
the obligation. However, for many types of obligations, the precise amount 
of the government’s liability cannot be known at the time the liability is 
incurred. As summarized in our preliminary discussion of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1501(a), some initial amount must still be recorded. The agency should 
then adjust this initial obligation amount up or down periodically as more 
precise information becomes available.12 
GAO decisions, as well as GAO’s Policy and Procedures Manual for 
Guidance of Federal Agencies, 13 indicate that, in general, the agency 
should use its best estimate to record the initial amount where the amount 
of the government’s final liability is undefined. E.g., 56 Comp. Gen. 414, 
418 (1977); 50 Comp. Gen. 589 (1971). Section 3.5.D of the Manual further 
provides that, where an estimate is used, the basis for the estimate and the 
computation must be documented. 

For example, in 50 Comp. Gen. 589, GAO considered the accounting 
procedures used by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts 
(Administrative Office) with respect to paying court-appointed attorneys in 
federal criminal cases. GAO held that at the time of appointment of such 
attorneys a contractual obligation was created on the part of the 
government to pay the reasonable costs of the representation, although the 
exact amount of such obligation remained to be determined. Such 
obligations must, therefore, be charged against the appropriations current 

12 This discussion addresses the amount to be recorded when the amount of the liability is 
undefined, and is not to be confused with a discussion of contingent liabilities. For 
example, for an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract, any liability in excess of the 
government’s minimum commitment, as defined in the contract, is a contingent liability— 
that is, contingent on the government placing future orders with the contractor. For that 
reason, at the time the government enters into the contract, the government has no liability 
above the minimum specified in the contract, and thus incurs no obligation for future 
orders. We discuss contingent liabilities in section C of this chapter. 

13 Title 7, § 3.5.D (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993).

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

at the time of appointment. Id. at 590–91. The proper procedure for 
charging these obligations was described as follows: 

“[U]pon the appointment of an attorney by the court, a copy 
of the order of appointment is sent to [the Administrative 
Office] for the purpose of estimating the obligation to be 
charged against the current appropriation. This estimate 
made by [the Administrative Office] is based on past 
average costs per case and the fact that the [Criminal 
Justice Act] sets dollar limits on the amount of 
compensation a court-appointed attorney may receive.” 

Id. at 589. The appropriation account current at the time of appointment 
was thus charged until the voucher reflecting the actual costs was 
approved (which could occur in a subsequent fiscal year), at which point 
the estimated amounts were adjusted accordingly.14 

Decisions dealing with certain kinds of contract obligations provide more 
specific rules. Under a fixed-price contract with escalation, price 
redetermination, or incentive provisions, the amount to be obligated 
initially is the fixed price stated in the contract or the target price in the 
case, for example, of a contract with an incentive clause. B-255831, July 7, 
1995; 34 Comp. Gen. 418 (1955); B-133170, Jan. 29, 1975; B-206283-O.M., 
Feb. 17, 1983. Thus, in an incentive contract with a target price of 
$85 million and a ceiling price of $100 million, the proper amount to record 
initially as an obligation is the target price of $85 million. 55 Comp. 
Gen. 812, 824 (1976). See also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 
39 Fed. Cl. 665 (1997). The agency must increase or decrease the amount 
recorded (i.e., the target price) to reflect price revisions at the time such 
revisions are made or determined pursuant to the provisions of the 
contract. 34 Comp. Gen. at 420–21. When obligations are recorded based 
on a target price, the agency should establish appropriate safeguards to 
guard against violations of the Antideficiency Act. This usually means the 
administrative reservation of sufficient funds to cover potential liability. 

14 The decision in 50 Comp. Gen. 589 is offered here as an example of a methodology for 
estimating obligations. Beginning with fiscal year 1977 the Judiciary has received no-year 
appropriations to pay court appointed attorneys. See Departments of State, Justice, and 
Commerce, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1977, Pub. L. No. 94-362, 
title IV, 90 Stat. 937, 953 (July 14, 1976); Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, Pub. L. 
No. 108-447, div. B, title III, 118 Stat. 2809, 2892 (Dec. 8, 2004).

B-255831, July 7, 1995; 34 Comp. Gen. at 420–21; B-206283-O.M., Feb. 17, 
1983. 

The two recent decisions involving the Corporation for National and 
Community Service, discussed previously in section A of this chapter, held 
that the Corporation must record the government’s full liability under the 
grant at the time of grant award. B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003, aff’d, B-300480.2, 
June 6, 2003. Under the grant agreements involved, the Corporation agreed 
to fund a specified number of AmeriCorps program participants. This 
number could be converted into a precise dollar amount. Thus, the 
Corporation incurred an obligation to pay the maximum dollar amount if 
the grantee fully performed under the grant agreement and enrolled the 
specified number of participants. While the grantee might ultimately fail to 
enroll the number of participants called for in the grant agreement, the 
extent of the grantee’s performance under the grant was entirely within the 
grantee’s control. The decisions rejected contentions by the Corporation 
and the Office of Management and Budget that the initial grant obligation 
should be recorded on the basis of estimates that reflected past experience. 
As the April 9, 2003 decision observed: 

“For purposes of identifying the amount of the 
Corporation’s obligation at grant award . . . the grantee and 
subgrantee, by their actions in enrolling participants, 
ultimately control the amount of the Corporation’s liability. 
If the amount of liability of the government is under the 
control of the grantee, not the Corporation, the government 
should obligate funds to cover the maximum amount of the 
liability. See, e.g., B-238581, Oct. 31, 1990; B-197274, 
Sept. 23, 1983.”15 

In this regard, the result in the two 2003 decisions is really no different 
from the obligation rule that applies to a simple fixed-price contract. 
There, the government incurs a firm obligation to pay a specified amount 
provided, of course, that the contractor fully performs under the contract. 
The possibility that the contractor may not perform up to the level 

15 Subsequently, Congress passed legislation clarifying the method by which the Corporation 
should record obligations, authorizing the Corporation to record as an obligation an 
estimate based on a formula that takes into consideration historical rates of enrollment in 
the program. Pub. L. No. 108-45, § 2(b), 117 Stat. 844 (July 3, 2003). See also 149 Cong. 
Rec. S8163–64 (2003) (statement of Sen. Bond).

Payment 
specified in the contract does not provide a basis for recording less than 
the full contract price as the obligation. 

In some instances, a liability does not arise until the agency formally 
reviews and approves a payment. In these instances, of course, the agency 
should not record an obligation for payment until it approves the payment. 
(The review and approval here refers to a process in addition to the normal 
review and approval of the voucher by a certifying and disbursing officer 
that is always required.) For example, under Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) regulations, IRS has no financial liability to its informants until it has 
evaluated the worth of the information and assessed and collected any 
underpaid taxes and penalties stemming from that information. It is at this 
point that an appropriate IRS official determines that a reward should be 
paid and its amount, and it is at this point that IRS incurs a recordable 
obligation. B-137762.32, July 11, 1977. 

In 46 Comp. Gen. 895 (1967), GAO approved the then Veterans 
Administration’s (VA) practice of recording obligations for fee-basis 
outpatient treatment of eligible veterans at the time the agency 
administratively approved the vouchers. VA had established a review and 
approval process to determine whether the government should accept 
liability; therefore, no obligation arose until that time. See also B-133944, 
Jan. 31, 1958; B-92679, July 24, 1950. 

GAO followed 46 Comp. Gen. 895 in a decision concerning the Defense 
Department’s TRICARE health care program, B-287619, July 5, 2001. The 
decision concluded that the Defense Department did not incur a liability for 
the costs of medical services provided under the so-called “pass through” 
arrangement of the TRICARE program until the Department processed and 
approved a claim—that is, until the Department determined that the 
beneficiary was eligible to receive treatment, the services provided were 
allowable, and the amount billed was proper. Thus, claims-approval was 
the appropriate time at which to record an obligation. 

By way of contrast, the obligation for the expenses of a court-appointed 
attorney under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 (CJA) arises at the time of 
appointment, not later when the expenses are approved, because of the 
terms of the Act. 50 Comp. Gen. 589 (1971). Under section 2 of the CJA, as 
amended, 18 U.S.C § 3006A, the court’s order of appointment establishes 
contractual liability, even though the exact amount of the obligation is not 
determinable until the attorney’s payment voucher is approved. The court’s 
review of the voucher is intended only to ensure the reasonableness of the

h. Miscellaneous Contractual 
Obligations 
expenses incurred. Thus, GAO held that payment must be charged to the 
funds available for the fiscal year in which the appointment was made. 
Beginning with fiscal year 1977 the Judiciary has received no-year 
appropriations to pay court appointed attorneys. See Departments of State, 
Justice, and Commerce, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation 
Act, 1977, Pub. L. No. 94-362, title IV, 90 Stat. 937, 953 (July 14, 1976); 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-447, div. B, title III, 
118 Stat. 2809, 2892 (Dec. 8, 2004). 

The core issue in many of the previously discussed cases has been when a 
given transaction ripens into a recordable obligation, that is, precisely 
when the “definite commitment” occurs. Many of the cases do not fit 
neatly into categories. Rather, the answer must be derived by analyzing the 
nature of the contractual or statutory commitments in the particular case. 

A 1979 case dealt with a lease arrangement entered into by the Peace Corps 
in Korea. Under a particular type of lease recognized by Korean law, the 
lessee does not make installment rental payments. Instead, the lessee 
makes an initial payment of approximately 50 percent of the assessed 
valuation of the property. At the end of the lease, the lessor is required to 
return the entire initial payment. The lessor makes his profit by investing 
the initial payment at the local interest rate. Since the lease is a binding 
contractual commitment and since the entire amount of the initial payment 
may not be recoverable for a number of reasons, GAO found it improper to 
treat the initial payment as a mere advance or an account receivable (as in 
the case of travel advances) and thus not reflected as an obligation. Rather, 
the amount of the initial payment must be recorded as an obligation 
chargeable to the fiscal year in which the lease is entered into, with 
subsequent returns to be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts. B-192282, Apr. 18, 1979.

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

Several cases deal with court-related obligations. For example, the 
obligation for fees of jurors, including retroactive increases authorized by 
28 U.S.C. § 1871, occurs at the time the jury service is performed. 54 Comp. 
Gen. 472 (1974). See also the discussion of attorney fee payments in 
section B.1.g of this chapter. The recording of obligations for land 
commissioners appointed to determine just compensation in land 
condemnation cases was discussed in B-184782, Feb. 26, 1976, and 
56 Comp. Gen. 414 (1977).16 The rules derived from these decisions are as 
follows: 

• The obligation occurs at the time of appointment and is chargeable to 
the fiscal year of appointment if a specific case is referred to the 
commission in that fiscal year. 
• Pendency of an action will satisfy the bona fide needs rule and will be 
sufficient to support the obligation even though services are not 
actually performed until the following fiscal year. 
• Appointment of a “continuous” land commission creates no obligation 
until a particular action is referred to it. 
• An amended court order increasing the compensation of a particular 
commissioner amounts to a new obligation and the full compensation 
is chargeable to the appropriation current at the time of the amended 
order. 
• A valid obligation occurs under the above principles even though the 
order of appointment does not expressly charge the costs to the United 
States because, under the Constitution, the costs cannot be assessed 
against the condemnee. 
i. Interagency Transactions It is not uncommon for federal agencies to provide goods or services to 
other federal agencies. Section 1501 addresses these interagency 
transactions in two places. Subsection (a)(3) addresses interagency orders 
16 Beginning with fiscal year 1978, the appropriation to compensate land commissioners was 
switched from the Justice Department to the Judiciary and since then has been a no-year 
appropriation. See the appropriation entitled “Fees of Jurors and Commissioners” in the 
Judiciary Appropriation Act, 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-86, title IV, 91 Stat. 419, 434–35 (Aug. 2, 
1977), and in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-447, div. B, title III, 
118 Stat. 2809, 2892–93 (Dec. 8, 2004). We retain the above summary here to illustrate the 
analysis and because it may have use by analogy in similar situations. 

Page 7-28 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

required by law. We discuss these transactions in section B.3 of this 
chapter. Subsection (a)(1) addresses the obligational requirements of all 
other interagency transactions: “a binding agreement between an agency 
and another person (including an agency)” (emphasis added). To 
distinguish these other transactions from those required by law, these 
transactions are often referred to as “voluntary orders.” This section 
discusses voluntary orders. Because voluntary orders are covered by 
section 1501(a)(1), obligations for many voluntary orders are recorded in 
the same manner as for contracts. However, the authority that governs the 
interagency transaction, not contract practices, determines the obligational 
treatment of a voluntary order. 

(1) Economy Act agreements 
A major source of authority for voluntary interagency agreements is the 
Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 1535, 1536. An Economy Act agreement is 
recorded as an obligation of the ordering agency at the time the ordering 
agency enters into the agreement.17 However, Economy Act agreements 
are subject to one additional requirement. Under 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d), if the 
ordering agency obligated a fixed-year appropriation, the ordering agency 
must deobligate the obligation at the end of the fiscal year to the extent that 
the performing agency has not incurred an obligation, that is, (1) has not 
provided the requested item to the ordering agency, (2) has not performed 
the requested service, or (3) has not entered into a valid contract with 
another person to provide the requested item or service to the ordering 
agency. 39 Comp. Gen. 317 (1959); 34 Comp. Gen. 418, 421–22 (1955). It 
was, for example, improper for the Library of Congress to use annual funds 
transferred to it under Economy Act agreements and not obligated by it 
prior to the end of the fiscal year to provide services in the following fiscal 
year. GAO, Financial Audit: First Audit of the Library of Congress 
Discloses Significant Problems, GAO/AFMD-91-13 (Washington, D.C.: 
Aug. 22, 1991). The reason for this requirement is to prevent the Economy 
Act from being used to extend the obligational life of an appropriation 

17 The determination of whether an interagency agreement is “binding” for purposes of 
recording under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1) is made in the same manner as if the contract were 
with a private party—examining precisely what the parties have “committed” themselves to 
do under the terms of the agreement. However, an agreement between two government 
agencies cannot be legally “enforced” against a defaulting agency in the sense of compelling 
performance or obtaining damages. Enforcement against another agency is largely a matter 
of comity and good faith. Thus, the term “binding” in the context of interagency agreements 
reflects the undertakings expressed in the agreement without regard to the legal 
consequences (or lack thereof) of nonperformance. 

Page 7-29 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

beyond that provided by law. 31 Comp. Gen. 83, 85 (1951). The 
deobligation requirement of 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d) does not apply to 
obligations against no-year appropriations. 39 Comp. Gen. 317, 319 (1959). 
For more background information on obligation and deobligation under the 
Economy Act, see Chapter 15, section B.1; B-302760, May 17, 2004; 
B-288142, Sept. 6, 2001; and B-301561, June 14, 2004 (nondecision letter). 

(2) Non-Economy Act agreements 
Where the agreement is based on some statutory authority other than the 
Economy Act, the recording of the obligation is still governed by 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1501(a)(1). However, the deobligation requirement of 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d) 
does not apply. In this situation, the obligation will remain payable in full 
from the appropriation initially charged, regardless of when performance 
occurs, in the same manner as contractual obligations generally, subject, of 
course, to the bona fide needs rule and to any restrictions in the legislation 
authorizing the agreement. E.g., B-302760, May 17, 2004 (interagency 
agreement pursuant to 2 U.S.C. § 141(c) for renovation of loading dock); 
B-289380, July 31, 2002 (interagency agreement pursuant to the 
section 27(g) of the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2076(g)); 
B-286929, Apr. 25, 2001 (interagency agreement pursuant to what is now 
40 U.S.C. § 322 for implementation of a declassification information 
management system); 51 Comp. Gen. 766 (1972) (interagency agreement 
pursuant to section 303(a) of the former Manpower Development and 
Training Act of 1962, 42 U.S.C. § 2613(a) (1964) for training of air traffic 
controllers). Thus, it is necessary to determine the specific statutory 
authority supporting the interagency agreement in order to properly 
obligate a requesting agency’s appropriation. The following examples 
illustrate these principles. 

The National Park Service (NPS) of the Department of Interior entered into 
a series of agreements during fiscal year 1998 with the National Resource 
Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture to obtain soil 
surveys at various NPS locations. Each agreement delineated specific 
tasks organized in two or three phases across several fiscal years, 
culminating in the publication of a final soil survey report for each location. 
GAO concluded that the agreements were entered into primarily under the 
authority of 16 U.S.C. § 460l-1(g) and thus were not subject to the 
deobligation requirement of 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d). However, since NPS 
provided insufficient information for GAO to determine whether the 

Page 7-30 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

agreements were for severable or nonseverable services for purpose of 
complying with the bona fide needs rule,18 GAO returned the case to NPS in 
order to make the requisite determinations and adjust its accounts 
accordingly. B-282601, Sept. 27, 1999.

 The Administrative Office of United States Courts and the General 
Services Administration entered into an agreement during fiscal year 1976 
for design and implementation of an automated payroll system that was 
authorized by 40 U.S.C. § 759 (1976) (a provision of law that has since been 
repealed), rather than the Economy Act. The work was to be performed 
during fiscal years 1976 and 1977. Since the agreement met the 
requirements of 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1), it was properly recordable as a valid 
obligation against fiscal year 1976 funds and was not subject to 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1535(d). 55 Comp. Gen. 1497 (1976). 

The Army Corps of Engineers entered into agreement with Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to perform flood insurance 
studies pursuant to orders placed by HUD. Since the agreement 
presumably required the Corps to perform as HUD placed the orders, a 
recordable obligation would arise when HUD placed an order under the 
agreement. Since the agreement was authorized by the National Flood 
Insurance Act,19 rather than the Economy Act, funds obligated by an order 
would remain obligated even though the Corps did not complete 
performance (or contract out for it) until following the fiscal year. 

B-167790, Sept. 22, 1977. 

(3) “Binding agreement” requirement 
Regardless of whether the Economy Act or other interagency transaction 
authority governs the transaction, a voluntary interagency order is 
recordable under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1) only if it constitutes a binding 
agreement that meets the other criteria of that subsection. If it does, the 
applicability or nonapplicability of 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d) then becomes 
relevant. If it does not, an obligation arises only when the performing 
agency has completed the work or has awarded contracts to have the work 
done. See 59 Comp. Gen. 602 (1980); 39 Comp. Gen. 829 (1960); 34 Comp. 
Gen. 705, 708 (1955); 23 Comp. Gen. 88 (1943); B-193005, Oct. 2, 1978; 

18 See Chapter 5, section B for a discussion of the bona fide needs rule.

B-180578-O.M., Sept. 26, 1978. For example, Military Interdepartmental 
Procurement Requests (MIPR) are viewed as authorized by the Economy 
Act. An MIPR is considered a binding agreement for obligation purposes 
under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1). It is subject to the deobligation requirement 
of 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d) and is thus ultimately chargeable to appropriations 
current when the performing component incurs valid obligations. 
59 Comp. Gen. 563 (1980); 34 Comp. Gen. 418, 422 (1955). 

In B-193005, Oct. 2, 1978, GAO considered the procurement of crude oil for 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 194920 authorized the General Services Administration 
(GSA) to procure materials for other federal agencies as well as to delegate 
such authority. GSA delegated the authority to procure fuel commodities 
to the Secretary of Defense, who redelegated the authority to the Defense 
Fuel Supply Center (DFSC). Thus, the Department of Energy (DOE) could 
procure oil through the DFSC in a non-Economy Act transaction. An order 
placed by DOE with DFSC prior to the expiration of the period of 
availability of the appropriation to be charged could be recorded as an 
obligation against such appropriation under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1) if it 
constituted a “binding agreement.” Further, the appropriation that was 
obligated would remain available to liquidate contracts awarded by DFSC. 
This result would have been precluded by 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d) had the 
transaction been governed by the Economy Act. 

In 59 Comp. Gen. 602 (1980), GAO considered the procedure by which the 
then Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) ordered “strip 
stamps” from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. (These are the excise 
tax stamps one sees pasted across the caps of liquor bottles.) GAO 
reviewed pertinent legislation and concluded that ATF was not “required by 
law” to procure its strip stamps from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. 
Since individual orders were not binding agreements, it was immaterial in 
one important respect whether the order was governed by the Economy 
Act or some other law; in neither event could ATF’s funds remain obligated 
beyond the last day of a fiscal year to the extent an order remained unfilled. 
Funds could be considered obligated at the end of a fiscal year only to the 
extent that stamps were printed or in process or that the Bureau of 
Engraving and Printing had entered into a contract with a third party to 
provide them.

Obligation of Appropriations 

(4) Orders from stock 
The obligational treatment of orders for items to be delivered from stock of 
the requisitioned agency derives from 32 Comp. Gen. 436 (1953). An order 
for items to be delivered from stock is a recordable obligation if (1) it is 
intended to meet a bona fide need of the fiscal year in which the order is 
placed or to replace stock used in that fiscal year21 and (2) the order is firm 
and complete. To be firm and complete, the order must request prompt 
delivery of specific available stock items for a stated consideration and 
must be accepted by the supplying agency in writing. “Available” means on 
hand or routinely on order. However, acceptance is not required for 
common-use stock items which are on hand or on order and will be 
delivered promptly. 

Materials which are specially manufactured or otherwise created for a 
particular purpose in order to satisfy an order are not “stock.” 44 Comp. 
Gen. 695 (1965). Likewise, an order for an item not stocked by the 
requisitioned agency (or, if out of stock, not routinely on order) is not a 
recordable obligation until the requisitioned agency purchases the item or 
executes a contract for it. The reason is that such an order does not mature 
into a binding agreement until the requisitioned agency executes the order 
or purchases the item(s) needed to fill it; before then, it is merely an offer 
subject to acceptance by the requisitioned agency’s performance. 
B-193005, Oct. 2, 1978. The basic rules in this area were established by 
34 Comp. Gen. 705 (1955). 

Although the foregoing rules were developed prior to the enactment of 
31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1), they continue to govern the recording of obligations 
under that statute. 34 Comp. Gen. 705; 34 Comp. Gen. 418, 422 (1955). 

(5) Project orders 
Historically, “project orders” refer to orders authorized by 41 U.S.C. § 23,22 
which provides: 

21 The fact that the replacement stock will not be used until the following year will not defeat 
an otherwise valid obligation. See 73 Comp. Gen. 259 (1994); 44 Comp. Gen. 695 (1965). 

22 The Coast Guard has virtually identical authority in 14 U.S.C. § 151. 

Page 7-33 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

“All orders or contracts for work or material or for the 
manufacture of material pertaining to approved projects 
heretofore or hereafter placed with Government-owned 
establishments shall be considered as obligations in the 
same manner as provided for similar orders or contracts 
placed with commercial manufacturers or private 
contractors, and the appropriations shall remain available 
for the payment of the obligations so created as in the case 
of contracts or orders with commercial manufacturers or 
private contractors.”23 

GAO has interpreted this statute, which was derived from earlier 
appropriation act provisions for the military departments appearing shortly 
after World War I, 24 as applying only to transactions between the military 
departments and establishments owned by the Defense Department for 
work related to military projects. 72 Comp. Gen. 172, 173 (1993); B-95760, 
June 27, 1950. Thus, the decision in 72 Comp. Gen. 172 held that the 
Economy Act, rather than 41 U.S.C. § 23, applies to Defense Department 
transactions with other federal agencies, in this case a Department of 
Defense request for research assistance from the Library of Congress. 

A project order is a valid and recordable obligation when the order is 
issued and accepted, regardless of the fact that performance may not be 
accomplished until after the expiration of the fiscal year. 1 Comp. Gen. 175 
(1921); B-135037-O.M., June 19, 1958. The statute does not, however, 
authorize the use of the appropriations so obligated for the purpose of 
replenishing stock used in connection with the order. A-25603, May 15, 
1929. The requirement of specificity applies to project orders the same as 
any other recordable obligations under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1). B-126405, 
May 21, 1957. 

Since a project order is not an Economy Act transaction, the deobligation 
requirement of 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d) does not apply. 34 Comp. Gen. 418, 422 
(1955). See also 16 Comp. Gen. 752 (1937). Also, unlike the Economy Act, 

23 The term “approved projects,” as used in 41 U.S.C. § 23, has no special meaning. It refers 
simply to “projects that have been approved by officials having legal authority to do so.” 

B-171049-O.M., Feb. 17, 1972. 

24 Thus 41 U.S.C. § 23 predates enactment of § 1311 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act 
of 1955, now codified at 31 U.S.C. § 1501, and, like the Economy Act, provides an early 
statutory authority to obligate an appropriation on the basis of an interagency transaction. 

Page 7-34 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

41 U.S.C. § 23 does not authorize advance payment. Thus, advance 
payment for project orders is not authorized unless permitted by some 
other statute. B-95760, June 27, 1950. 

2. Section 1501(a)(2): 
Loans 

Under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(2), a recordable obligation exists when there is 
documentary evidence of “a loan agreement showing the amount and 
terms of repayment.” 

A loan agreement is essentially contractual in nature. Thus, to have a valid 
obligation, there must be a proposal by one party and an acceptance by 
another. Approval of the loan application must be communicated to the 
applicant within the fiscal year sought to be charged, and there must be 
documentary evidence of that communication. B-159999-O.M., Mar. 16, 
1967. Where a loan application is made in one fiscal year and approval is 
not communicated to the applicant until the following fiscal year, the 
obligation is chargeable to the later year. Id.; B-159999-O.M., Dec. 14, 1966. 

Telegraphic notification of approval of a loan application where the amount 
of the loan and terms of repayment are thereby agreed upon is legally 
acceptable. B-159999-O.M., Dec. 14, 1966. 

To support a recordable obligation under section 1501(a)(2), the agreement 
must be sufficiently definite and specific, just as in the case of 
section 1501(a)(1) obligations. To illustrate, the United States and the 
government of Brazil entered into a loan agreement in 1964. As a condition 
precedent to any disbursement under the agreement, Brazil was to furnish 
a statement covering utilization of the funds. The funds were to be used for 
various economic and social development projects “as may, from time to 
time, be agreed upon in writing” by the governments of the United States 
and Brazil. While the loan agreement constituted a valid binding contract, 
it was not sufficiently definite or specific to validly obligate fiscal year 1964 
funds. The basic agreement was little more than an “agreement to agree,” 
and an obligation of funds could arise only when a particular “utilization 
statement” was submitted and approved. B-155708-O.M., Apr. 26, 1965. 

Prior to fiscal year 1992, the amount to be recorded in the case of a loan 
was quite simple—the face amount of the loan. From the budgetary 
perspective, however, this was undesirable because the obligation was 
indistinguishable from any other cash outlay. By disregarding at the 
obligational stage the fact that loans are supposed to be repaid, this 
treatment did not reflect the true cost to the government of direct loan 

Page 7-35 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

programs. Congress addressed the situation in the Federal Credit Reform 
Act of 1990 (FCRA), Pub. L. No. 101-508, § 13201, 104 Stat. 1388, 1388-609 
(Nov. 5, 1990), codified at 2 U.S.C. §§ 661–661f). The general approach of 
the FCRA is to require the advance provision of budget authority to cover 
the subsidy portion of direct loans (in recognition of the fact that not all 
loans are repaid), with the non-subsidy portion (the portion expected to be 
repaid) financed through borrowings from the Treasury. The Office of 
Management and Budget has issued detailed instructions for implementing 
the FCRA’s requirements that appear in OMB Circular No. A-11, 
Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, part 5 (June 21, 
2005). 25 

The FCRA defines “direct loan” as “a disbursement of funds by the 
Government to a non-Federal borrower under a contract that requires the 
repayment of such funds with or without interest.” 2 U.S.C. § 661a(1). A 
“direct loan obligation” is “a binding agreement by a Federal agency to 
make a direct loan when specified conditions are fulfilled by the borrower.” 
Id. § 661a(2). The “cost” of a direct loan is the estimated long-term cost to 
the government, taking into consideration disbursements and repayments, 
calculated on a net present value basis at the time of disbursement. Id. 
§ 661a(5). 

Unless otherwise provided by statute, new direct loan obligations may be 
incurred only to the extent that budget authority to cover the subsidy costs 
is provided in advance. 2 U.S.C. § 661c(b). Under this provision, the 
typical appropriation will include both an appropriation of budget authority 
for the subsidy costs and a program ceiling (total face amount of loans 
supportable by the cost appropriation). The appropriation is made to a 
“program account.” When a direct loan obligation is incurred, its cost is 
obligated against the program account. See generally OMB Cir. No. A-11, at 
§ 185.10. The actual funding is done through a revolving, nonbudget 
“financing account.” Loan repayments are credited to the financing 
account. See generally OMB Cir. No. A-11, at § 185.11. The overobligation 
or overexpenditure of either the loan subsidy or the credit level 
supportable by the enacted subsidy violates the Antideficiency Act. See 
OMB Cir. No. A-11, at § 145.3. 

25 The FCRA applies to new direct loan obligations incurred on or after October 1, 1991. The 
budgetary and obligational treatment of guaranteed and insured loans is discussed in 
Chapter 11, section B.

3. Section 1501(a)(3): 
Interagency Orders 
Required by Law 

The third standard for recording obligations, 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(3), is “an 
order required by law to be placed with [a federal] agency.” 

Subsection (a)(3) means exactly what it says. An order placed with 
another government agency is recordable under this subsection only if it is 
required by statute or statutory regulation to be placed with the other 
agency. The subsection does not apply to orders that are merely authorized 
rather than required. 34 Comp. Gen. 705 (1955). 

An order required by law to be placed with another agency is not an 
Economy Act transaction. Therefore, the deobligation requirement of 
31 U.S.C. § 1535(d) does not apply. 35 Comp. Gen. 3, 5 (1955). The fact that 
the work will be performed in the next fiscal year does not defeat the 
obligation as long as the bona fide need test is met. B-302760, May 17, 2004; 
59 Comp. Gen. 386 (1980); 35 Comp. Gen. 3. Also, the fact that the work is 
to be accomplished and reimbursement made through use of a revolving 
fund is immaterial. 35 Comp. Gen. 3; 34 Comp. Gen. 705. 

A common example of “orders required by law” is printing and binding to 
be done by the Government Printing Office (GPO). 44 U.S.C. § 501.26 The 
rule is that a requisition for printing services may be recorded as an 
obligation when placed if (1) there is a present need for the printing and 

(2)the requisition is accompanied by copy or specifications sufficient for 
GPO to proceed with the job. 
Thus, a requisition by the Commission on Fine Arts for the printing of 
“Sixteenth Street Architecture, Volume I” placed with GPO in fiscal year 
1977 and accompanied by manuscript and specifications obligated fiscal 
year 1977 funds and was chargeable in its entirety to fiscal year 1977, 
notwithstanding that the printing would be done in the following fiscal 
year. 59 Comp. Gen. 386 (1980). However, a requisition for U.S. Travel 
Service sales promotional literature placed with GPO near the end of fiscal 
year 1964 did not obligate fiscal year 1964 funds where no copy or 
manuscript was furnished to GPO until fiscal year 1965. 44 Comp. Gen. 695 
(1965). For other printing cases illustrating these rules, see 29 Comp. 
Gen. 489 (1950); 23 Comp. Gen. 82 (1943); B-154277, June 5, 1964; B-123964, 

26 See B-300192, Nov. 13, 2002, regarding the constitutionality of this and related statutory 
provisions. 

Page 7-37 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

Aug. 23, 1955; B-114619, Apr. 17, 1953; B-50663, June 30, 1945; B-35807, 
Aug. 10, 1943; B-34888, June 21, 1943. 

After an agency certifies that it requires the services of GPO, the Public 
Printer is required to furnish an estimate of the cost of the services to the 
ordering agency, which then may make a requisition for performance from 
GPO. The estimate is the amount that the ordering agency should obligate 
against its appropriation and establishes a ceiling that GPO may not exceed 
without first providing the ordering agency a new estimate and obtaining a 
requisition from an authorized official of the ordering agency. 44 U.S.C. 
§§ 1102(c), 1103. Thus GPO was not authorized to exceed its estimate of 
$14,000 and incur expenses amounting to $304,334 without first notifying 
and obtaining the approval of an authorized official of the requisitioning 
agency, in this case the Environmental Protection Agency. B-259208, 
Mar. 6, 1996. Further, the printing estimate alone, even if written, is not 
sufficient to create a valid and recordable obligation unless it is 
accompanied by the placement of an order. B-182081, Jan. 26, 1977, aff’d, 
B-182081, Feb. 14, 1979. In the cited decision, there was no valid obligation 
before the ordering commission went out of existence and its 
appropriations ceased to be available for further obligation. Therefore, 
there was no appropriation available to reimburse GPO for work done 
under the invalid purported obligation. 

GPO is required by law to print certain congressional materials such as the 
Congressional Record, and receives a “Printing and Binding” appropriation 
for this purpose. For items such as these where no further request or 
authorization is required, a copy of the basic law authorizing the printing 
and a copy of the appropriation constitute the obligating documents. 

B-123964, Aug. 23, 1955. 

Another common “order required by law” situation is building alteration, 
management, and related services to be performed by the General Services 
Administration. For example, a job order by the Social Security 
Administration for building repairs validly obligated funds of the fiscal year 
in which the order was placed, by virtue of subsection (a)(3), 
notwithstanding that GSA was unable to perform the work until the 
following fiscal year. 35 Comp. Gen. 3 (1955). See also B-158374, Feb. 21, 
1966. However, this result assumes compliance with the bona fide need 
concept. Thus, an agreement for work incident to the relocation of Federal 
Power Commission employees placed in fiscal year 1971 did not validly 
obligate fiscal year 1971 funds where it was clear that the relocation was 
not required to, and would not, take place, nor would the space in question 

Page 7-38 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

be made tenantable, until the following fiscal year. B-95136-O.M., Aug. 11, 
1972. Orders placed with GSA are further discussed in 34 Comp. Gen. 705 
(1955). 

As noted earlier, GAO has expressed the view that the recording criteria of 
31 U.S.C. § 1501(a) should be followed in evaluating obligations of the 
government of the District of Columbia. Thus, orders by a department of 
the District of Columbia government for repairs and improvements which 
are required by statute or statutory regulation to be placed with the District 
of Columbia Department of General Services and performed through use of 
the Repairs and Improvements Working Fund create valid obligations when 
the orders are placed. B-180578-O.M., Sept. 26, 1978. 

4. Section 1501(a)(4): The fourth recording standard in 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(4) is— 
Orders without 
“an order issued under a law authorizing purchases without 

Advertising 

advertising 

(A)when necessary because of a public exigency; 
(B)for perishable subsistence supplies; or 
(C)within specific monetary limits.” 
Subsection (a)(4) is limited to statutorily authorized purchases without 
advertising in the three situations specified. The subsection must be selfexplanatory 
as there appear to be no Comptroller General decisions under 
it. 

5. Section 1501(a)(5): 
Grants and Subsidies 

The fifth recording standard in 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(5) requires that the 
obligation be supported by documentary evidence of a grant or subsidy 
payable: 

“(A) from appropriations made for payment of, or 
contributions to, amounts required to be paid in specific 
amounts fixed by law or under formulas prescribed by law; 

“(B) under an agreement authorized by law; or 

Page 7-39 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

“(C) under plans approved consistent with and authorized 
by law.” 

The recording statute refers to grants and subsidies although federal 
assistance may be characterized in many ways. See Chapters 10 and 11, 
respectively, for a more comprehensive discussion of the concepts of 
federal assistance in the form of grants and cooperative agreements and 
federal assistance in the form of guaranteed and insured loans. 

a. Grants In order to properly obligate an appropriation for an assistance program, 
some action creating a definite liability against the appropriation must 
occur during the period of the obligational availability of the appropriation. 
In some situations, the obligating action under section 1501(a)(5) involves 
a discretionary action by an agency of awarding a grant that is evidenced by 
a grant agreement. The particular document will vary and may be in the 
form of an agency’s approval of a grant application or a letter of 
commitment. See B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002; 39 Comp. Gen. 317 (1959); 
37 Comp. Gen. 861, 863 (1958); 31 Comp. Gen. 608 (1952); B-128190, June 2, 
1958; B-114868.01-O.M., Mar. 17, 1976. 
Generally, in order to properly obligate federal assistance funds, there must 
be some action to establish a firm commitment on the part of the United 
States. This commitment must be unconditional. 50 Comp. Gen. 857, 862 
(1971). There must be documentary evidence of the grant award and this 
requirement is not satisfied by the mere reservation or earmarking of 
amounts in accounting records for the purpose of having them available 
should an application for a grant be submitted and approved. Champaign 
County, Illinois v. United States Law Enforcement Assistance 
Administration, 611 F.2d 1200 (7th Cir. 1979); B-126372, Sept. 18, 1956. 
Finally, the award terms must be communicated to the official grantee, and 
where the grantee is required to comply with certain prerequisites, such as 
putting up matching funds, the prerequisite must also be accepted by the 
grantee during the period of availability of the grant funds. 

An illustration of this latter requirement is B-220527, Dec. 16, 1985. The 
Economic Development Administration made an “offer of grant” to a 
Connecticut municipality that would have required a substantial outlay of 
funds by the municipality. The offer was accepted by a town official who 
had no authority to accept the grant. By its own municipal ordinance, only 
the town council could accept a grant offer. By the time the town 
marshaled the resources to fulfill its obligations under the grant and the 
unauthorized acceptance was ratified by the town council, the federal 

Page 7-40 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

funds had expired for obligational purposes. GAO held that no valid grant 
obligation on the part of the government had ever been made. See also 
B-164990, Jan. 10, 1969, finding an attempted obligation invalid where the 
program legislation required approval of a proposed grant by the state 
governor and he had not yet agreed, even though the award instruments 
had already been executed. 

Applying the above principles, the Comptroller General found that a 
document entitled “Approval and Award of Grant” used by the Economic 
Development Administration was sufficient for recording grant obligations 
under the local public works program because it “reflects the 
Administration’s acceptance of a grant application; specifies the project 
approved and the amount of funding; and imposes a deadline for 
affirmation by the grantee.” B-126652, Aug. 30, 1977. Once the 
appropriation has been properly obligated, performance by the grantee and 
the actual disbursement of funds may extend beyond the period of 
obligational availability. B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003, aff’d, B-300480.2, June 6, 
2003; B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002; 31 Comp. Gen. 608, 610 (1952); 20 Comp. 
Gen. 370 (1941); B-37609, Nov. 15, 1943; B-24827, Apr. 3, 1942; B-124374O.
M., Jan. 26, 1956. 

If the above requirements are not met, then the appropriation is not 
obligated. Thus, the Comptroller General determined that the attempted 
obligation was invalid in B-164990, Sept. 6, 1968, where the grantee 
corporation was not in existence when the obligation was recorded. Also, 
the relevant program legislation must be examined to see if there are any 
additional requirements. 

In other situations, the obligating action for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1501(a)(5)(A) may take place by operation of law under a statutory 
formula grant or by virtue of actions authorized by law to be taken by 
others that are beyond the control of the agency (even when the precise 
amount of the obligation is not determined until a later time). When this 
occurs, the documentary evidence used to support the accounting charge 
against the appropriation is a reflection of, not the creation of, the 
obligation under the particular law and usually is generated subsequent to 
the time that the actual obligation arose. 63 Comp. Gen. 525 (1984); 
B-164031(3).150, Sept. 5, 1979. Thus where an agency is required to 
allocate funds to states on the basis of a statutory formula, the formula 
establishes the obligation to each recipient rather than the agency’s 
allocation since, if the allocation is erroneous, the agency must adjust the

b. Subsidies 
Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

amounts paid each recipient. 41 Comp. Gen. 16 (1961); B-164031(3).150, 
Sept. 5, 1979. 

The rules for deobligation and reobligation of assistance funds are the 
same as for other obligations generally. Program legislation in a given case 
may, of course, provide for different treatment. For example, B-211323, 
Jan. 3, 1984, considered a provision of the Public Works and Economic 
Development Act of 196527 under which funds apportioned to states 
remained available to the state until expended. Under that particular 
provision, funds deobligated as the result of a cost underrun could be 
reobligated by the state, without fiscal year limitation, for purposes within 
the scope of the program statute. For a discussion of obligation and 
deobligation of funds under the now defunct Comprehensive Employment 
and Training Act (the predecessor of the Job Training Partnership Act) in 
the context of the Impoundment Control Act, see B-200685, Apr. 27, 1981. 

There have been relatively few cases dealing with the obligational 
treatment of subsidies, although the principles should parallel those for 
grants since they both derive from 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(5). This may be 
explained by the fact that some courts when confronted with the necessity 
to determine the meaning of “subsidy” (when used in a statute that does not 
define the word) have done so in a manner that is remarkably similar to the 
commonly used definitions of a grant. (See the discussion of grants in 
Chapter 10, section B). Thus a subsidy has been defined as “a grant of 
public funds or property by a government to a private person to assist in 
establishment or support of an enterprise deemed advantageous to 
public…” In re Hooper’s Estate, 359 F.2d 569, 575–76 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied 
sub. nom, 385 U.S. 903 (1966). See also Satellite Broadcasting & 
Communications Ass’n of America v. FCC, 146 F. Supp. 2d 803, 829–30 

(E.D.Va.), aff’d, 275 F.3d 337 (4th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 922 
(2002); Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Commission, 60 F. Supp. 181 
(D.Utah 1944) rev’d, 150 F.2d 905 (10th Cir. 1945), aff’d, 327 U.S. 573 (1946); 
Los Angeles County v. State Department of Public Health, 322 P.2d 968, 
973 (Cal. App. 2nd Dist. 1958). 
The few GAO decisions in this area treat subsidies in a manner similar to 
grants for obligational purposes. In 50 Comp. Gen. 857 (1971) GAO 
considered legislation authorizing the former Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board to make “interest adjustment” payments to member banks. The 

27 42 U.S.C. § 3153 (1976 and Supp. IV 1980). 

Page 7-42 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

payments were designed to adjust the effective rates of interest charged by 
member banks on short- and long-term borrowing, the objective being to 
stimulate residential construction for low- and middle-income families. 
Funds were appropriated to the Board for this purpose on a fiscal year 
basis. GAO concluded that an obligation arose for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1501(a)(5) when a Federal Home Loan Bank made a firm and 
unconditional commitment in writing to a member institution, provided 
that the commitment letter included a reasonable expiration date. The 
funds would have to be deobligated to the extent that a member institution 
failed to execute loans prior to the specified expiration date. 

In 65 Comp. Gen. 4 (1985), GAO advised the Department of Education that 
mandatory interest subsidies under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program 
should be recorded as obligations on a “best estimate” basis as they arise, 
even if the recordings would exceed available budgetary resources. Since 
the subsidies are not discretionary obligations but are imposed by law, 
there would be no Antideficiency Act violation. The decision overruled an 
earlier case (B-126372, Sept. 18, 1956) which had held that the recording of 
obligations for mail rate subsidies to air carriers could be deferred until the 
time of payment. 65 Comp. Gen. at 8 n.3. 

In 64 Comp. Gen. 410 (1985), GAO considered obligations by the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development for operating subsidies to 
state public housing authorities for low-income housing projects. Under 
the governing statute and regulations, the amount of the subsidy was 
determined upon HUD’s approval of the state’s annual operating budget, 
although the basic commitment stemmed from an annual contribution 
contract. HUD’s practice, primarily for states whose fiscal year coincides 
with that of the federal government, was to record the obligation on the 
basis of an estimate, issued in a letter of intent. GAO found this to be 
legally permissible, but cautioned that HUD was required to adjust the 
obligation up or down once it approved the operating budget. 

A 1983 decision, B-212145, Sept. 27, 1983, discusses the use of estimates 
subject to subsequent adjustment for the recording of obligations for 
payments in lieu of taxes under 31 U.S.C. §§ 6901–6906. 

From the perspective of the recording of obligations, these two decisions— 
64 Comp. Gen. 410 and B-212145—are simply applications of the general 
principle, previously noted, that best estimates should be recorded when 
more precise information is not available, subject to later adjustment.

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

For additional discussion see Chapter 5, section B.10, relating to the 
application of the bona fide needs rule to grants and cooperative 
agreements and Chapter 10 relating to the obligation of appropriations for 
grants. 

6. Section 1501(a)(6): 
Pending Litigation 

The sixth standard for recording obligations is “a liability that may result 
from pending litigation.” 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(6). 

Despite its seemingly broad language, subsection (a)(6) has very limited 
application. Most judgments against the United States are paid from a 
permanent indefinite appropriation, 31 U.S.C. § 1304. Accordingly, since 
the expenditure of agency funds is not involved, judgments payable under 
31 U.S.C. § 1304 have no obligational impact on the respondent agency. 

Not all judgments against the United States are paid from the permanent 
judgment appropriation. Several types are payable from agency funds. 
However, the mere fact that a judgment is payable from agency funds does 
not make it subject to subsection (a)(6). Thus far, the Comptroller General 
has applied subsection (a)(6) in only two situations—land condemnation 
(35 Comp. Gen. 185 (1955)) and certain impoundment litigation (54 Comp. 
Gen. 962 (1975)). In land condemnation proceedings, the appropriation is 
obligated when the request is made to the Attorney General to institute the 
proceedings. 34 Comp. Gen. 418, 423 (1955); 34 Comp. Gen. 67 (1954); 
17 Comp. Gen. 664 (1938); 4 Comp. Gen. 206 (1924). In impoundment 
litigation, the Comptroller General has held that when the impounded 
balance is obligated under subsection (a)(6) as a liability which might 
result from the pending litigation, the balance so obligated may be used 
without further appropriation action. 54 Comp. Gen. 962. 

However, with limited exceptions, pending litigation itself does not create 
an obligation against the United States for purposes of section 1501(a)(6). 
Rochester Pure Waters District v. EPA, 960 F.2d 180, 186 (D.C. Cir. 1992) 
(citing 35 Comp. Gen. 185 and 54 Comp. Gen. 962). The plaintiff in 
Rochester sought an injunction to restore appropriated funds that Congress 
had rescinded pending adjudication of a claim the plaintiff was pursuing 
against the Environmental Protection Agency that would have been 
payable from the rescinded funds. The court held that it lacked statutory 
or constitutional authority to grant the requested relief. 

As stated in 35 Comp. Gen. at 187, subsection (a)(6) requires recording an 
obligation in cases where the government is definitely liable for the 

Page 7-44 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

payment of money out of available appropriations and the pending 
litigation is for the purpose of determining the amount of the government’s 
liability. Thus, for judgments payable from agency appropriations in other 
than land condemnation and impoundment cases, the standard of 35 Comp. 
Gen. 185 should be applied to determine whether an obligation must be 
recorded. 

In cases where a judgment will be payable from agency funds but recording 
is not required, 35 Comp. Gen. 185 suggested that the agency should 
nevertheless administratively reserve sufficient funds to cover the 
contingent liability to avoid a possible violation of the Antideficiency Act. 
Id. at 187. While the administrative reservation may still be a good idea for 
other reasons, the majority of more recent cases (cited and summarized in 
Chapter 6, section C.2.f under the heading “Intent/Factors Beyond Agency 
Control”) have taken the position that overobligations resulting from courtordered 
payments do not violate the Antideficiency Act.28 

It should be apparent that the preceding discussion applies to money 
judgments— judgments directing the payment of money. 62 Comp. 
Gen. 527 (1983); 61 Comp. Gen. 509 (1982). In some types of litigation, a 
court may order an agency to take some specific action. While compliance 
will result in the expenditure of agency funds, this type of judgment is not 
within the scope of 35 Comp. Gen. 185. While we have found no cases, it 
seems clear from the application of 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a) in other contexts 
that no recordable obligation would arise while this type of litigation is still 
“pending.” 

7. Section 1501(a)(7): Under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(7), obligations are recordable when supported 
by documentary evidence of “employment or services of persons or
Employment and Travel 

expenses of travel under law,” which covers a variety of loosely related 
obligations. 

28 Apart from the considerations discussed here, pending litigation as well as potential 
litigation and other legal claims, may require disclosure as a contingent liability in an 
agency’s financial statements. See generally Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, 
Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government, SFFAS No. 5, ¶¶ 33, 35–42 (Dec. 20, 
1995), as amended by SFFAS No. 12 (December 1998), available at 
www.fasab.gov/codifica.html (last visited September 15, 2005).

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

a. Wages, Salaries, Annual 
Leave 
Salaries of government employees, as well as related items that flow from 
those salary entitlements such as retirement fund contributions, are 
obligations at the time the salaries are earned, that is, when the services are 
rendered. B-303961, Dec. 6, 2004; B-302911, Sept. 7, 2004; B-287619, July 5, 
2001; 24 Comp. Gen. 676, 678 (1945). For example, in 38 Comp. Gen. 316 
(1958), the Commerce Department wanted to treat the salaries of 
employees performing administrative and engineering services on highway 
construction projects as part of the construction contract costs. Under this 
procedure, the anticipated expenses of the employees, salaries included, 
would be recorded as an obligation at the time a contract was awarded. 
However, the Comptroller General held that this would not constitute a 
valid obligation under 31 U.S.C. § 1501. The employee expenses were not 
part of the contract costs and could not be obligated before the services 
were performed. 

Section 1501(a)(7) is not limited to permanent federal employees. It 
applies as well to persons employed in other capacities, such as temporary 
or intermittent employees or persons employed under a personal services 
contract. In Kinzley v. United States, 661 F.2d 187 (Ct. Cl. 1981), for 
example, the court found various agency correspondence sufficient 
compliance with subsection (a)(7) to permit a claim for compensation for 
services rendered as a project coordinator. Unlike subsection (a)(1), the 
court pointed out, subsection (a)(7) does not require a binding agreement 
in writing between the parties, but only documentary evidence of 
“employment or services of persons.” Id. at 191. 

For persons compensated on an actual expense basis, it may be necessary 
to record the obligation as an estimate, to be adjusted when the services 
are actually performed. Documentation requirements to support the 
obligation or subsequent claims are up to the agency. E.g., B-217475, 
Dec. 24, 1986. 

When a pay increase is granted to wage board employees, the effective date 
of the increase is governed by 5 U.S.C. § 5344. This effective date 
determines the government’s liability to pay the additional compensation. 
Therefore, the increase is chargeable to appropriations currently available 
for payment of the wages for the period to which the increases apply. 
B-287619, July 5, 2001; 39 Comp. Gen. 422 (1959). This is true regardless of 
the fact that appropriations may be insufficient to discharge the obligation 
and the agency may not yet have had time to obtain a supplemental 
appropriation. The obligation in this situation is considered “authorized by 

Page 7-46 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

law” and therefore does not violate the Antideficiency Act. 39 Comp. 
Gen. at 426. 

Annual leave status “is synonymous with a work or duty status.” 25 Comp. 
Gen. 687 (1946). As such, annual leave obligates appropriations current at 
the time the leave is taken. Id.; 50 Comp. Gen. 863, 865 (1971); 17 Comp. 
Gen. 641 (1938). Except for employees paid from revolving funds 
(25 Comp. Gen. 687), or where there is some statutory indication to the 
contrary (B-70247, Jan. 9, 1948), the obligation for terminal leave is 
recorded against appropriations for the fiscal year covering the employee’s 
last day of active service. 25 Comp. Gen. at 688; 24 Comp. Gen. 578, 583 
(1945). 

Bonuses such as performance awards or incentive awards obligate 
appropriations current at the time the awards are made. Thus, for 
example, where performance awards to Senior Executive Service officials 
under 5 U.S.C. § 5384 were made in fiscal year 1982 but actual payment had 
to be split between fiscal year 1982 and fiscal year 1983 to stay within 
statutory compensation ceilings, the entire amount of the awards remained 
chargeable to fiscal year 1982 funds. 64 Comp. Gen. 114, 115 n. 2 (1984). 
The same principle would apply to other types of discretionary payments; 
the administrative determination creates the obligation. E.g., B-80060, 
Sept. 30, 1948. 

Employees terminated by a reduction in force (RIF) are entitled by statute 
to severance pay. 5 U.S.C. § 5595. Severance pay is obligated on a pay 
period by pay period basis. Thus, where a RIF occurs near the end of a 
fiscal year and severance payments will extend into the following fiscal 
year, it is improper to charge the entire amount of severance pay to the 
fiscal year in which the RIF occurs. B-200170, July 28, 1981. 

GAO reached a different result in B-200170, Sept. 24, 1982. The United 
States Metric Board was scheduled to terminate its existence on 
September 30, 1982. Legislative history indicated that the Board’s fiscal 
year 1982 appropriation was intended to include severance pay, and no 
appropriations had been requested for fiscal year 1983. Under these 
circumstances, severance payments to be made in fiscal year 1983 were 
held chargeable to the fiscal year 1982 appropriation. A contrary result 
would have meant that the fiscal year 1982 funds would expire, and 
Congress would have had to appropriate the same funds again for fiscal 
year 1983.

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

b. Compensation Plans in 
Foreign Countries 
By statute, the State Department is required to establish compensation 
plans for foreign national employees of the Foreign Service in foreign 
countries. The plans are to be “based upon prevailing wage rates and 
compensation practices . . . for corresponding types of positions in the 
locality of employment,” to the extent consistent with the public interest. 
22 U.S.C. § 3968(a)(1). 

Under subsection (b) of 22 U.S.C. § 3968, other government agencies are 
authorized to administer foreign national employee compensation 
programs in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Foreign 
Service Act. This provision, for example, authorized the Defense 
Department to establish a pension and life insurance program for foreign 
national employees in Bermuda, provided that it corresponded to 
prevailing local practice. 40 Comp. Gen. 650 (1961). 

Section 3968(c) of title 22, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary of 
State to prescribe regulations for local compensation plans applicable to all 
federal agencies. To the extent this authority is not exercised, however, the 
statute does not otherwise require that a plan established by another 
agency conform to the State Department’s plan. An agency establishing a 
local plan should, to the extent not regulated by State, coordinate with 
other agencies operating in the locality. 40 Comp. Gen. at 652. (As a 
practical matter, two agencies operating in the same locality should not 
develop substantially different plans, assuming both legitimately reflect 
prevailing local practice.) 

To the extent the authority of 22 U.S.C. § 3968 is exercised in a given 
country, the obligational treatment of various elements of compensation 
may vary from what would otherwise be required. For example, 
Colombian law provides for the advance payment of accrued severance pay 
to help the employee purchase or make improvements on a home. Thus, 
under a compensation plan for foreign national employees in Colombia, 
severance pay would be recorded as an obligation against the fiscal year 
appropriation current at the time of accrual. B-192511, Feb. 5, 1979. 

While 22 U.S.C. § 3968 authorizes compensation plans based on local 
practice, it does not permit automatic disregard of all other laws of the 
United States. Thus, under the Colombian severance pay program noted 
above, if the employee subsequently is terminated for cause or otherwise 
loses eligibility, the agency must proceed with collection action under the 
Federal Claims Collection Act, local practice to the contrary 
notwithstanding. B-192511, June 8, 1979. Similarly, accrued severance pay

retains its status as United States funds up to actual disbursement and is 
therefore subject to applicable fiscal and fund control requirements. 
B-199722, Sept. 15, 1981 (severance pay plan in Jordan). 

In several foreign countries, foreign nationals employed by the United 
States are entitled to be paid a “separation allowance” when they resign, 
retire, or are otherwise separated through no fault of their own. The 
allowance is based on length of service, rate of pay at time of separation, 
and type of separation. Unlike severance pay for federal employees, these 
separation allowances represent binding commitments which accrue 
during the period of employment. As such, they should be recorded as 
obligations when they are earned rather than when they are paid. GAO, 
FGMSD-76-25 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 17, 1975); FGMSD-75-20 
(Washington, D.C.: Feb. 13, 1975); Substantial Understatements of 
Obligations for Separation Allowances for Foreign National Employees, 

B-179343, (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 21, 1974). (These three items are GAO 
reports, the first two being untitled letter reports.) See also B-226729,

 May 18, 1987; B-192511, Feb. 5, 1979. 

The obligation for training frequently stems from a contract for services 
and to that extent is recordable under subsection (a)(1) rather than 
subsection (a)(7) of 31 U.S.C. § 1501. The rules for training obligations are 
summarized in Chapter 5, section B.5. 

The Federal Employees Uniform Act, 5 U.S.C. § 5901, authorizes a uniform 
allowance for each employee required by statute or regulation to wear a 
uniform. The agency may furnish the uniform or pay a cash allowance. 
Where an agency elects to pay an allowance, the obligation arises when the 
employee incurs the expense and becomes entitled to reimbursement. 
Thus, the appropriation chargeable is the one currently available at the 
time the employee makes the expenditure or incurs the debt. 38 Comp. 
Gen. 81 (1958). 

The obligation of appropriations for expenses relating to travel was an 
extremely fertile area and generated a large number of decisions before 
31 U.S.C. § 1501 was enacted. The cases seem to involve every conceivable 
permutation of facts involving trips or transactions covering more than one 

29 This section does not apply to travel incident to employee transfers. The rules for 
employee transfers are set forth separately in section B.7.g of this chapter.

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

fiscal year. The enactment of 31 U.S.C. § 1501 logically prompted the 
question of how the new statute affected the prior decisions. It did not, 
replied the Comptroller General. Thus, the starting point is that 
subsection (a)(7) incorporates prior GAO decisions on obligations for 
travel. 35 Comp. Gen. 183 (1955); 34 Comp. Gen. 459 (1955). 

The leading case in this area appears to have been 35 Comp. Gen. 183, 
which states the pertinent rules. The rules for travel may be summarized as 
follows: The issuance of a travel order in itself does not constitute a 
contractual obligation. The travel order is merely an authorization for the 
person specified to incur the obligation. The obligation is not incurred 
until the travel is actually performed or until a ticket is purchased, provided 
in the latter case the travel is to be performed in the same fiscal year the 
ticket is purchased. 35 Comp. Gen. at 185. A 1991 decision, 70 Comp. 
Gen. 469, reaffirmed the principle that the expenses of temporary duty 
travel are chargeable to the fiscal year or years in which they are actually 
incurred. 

Some of the earlier cases in this evolutionary process are as follows: 

• Where tickets are purchased in one fiscal year and the travel is 
performed in the following fiscal year, the obligation is chargeable to 
the year in which the travel is performed, even though early purchase of 
the tickets may have been necessary to assure reservations. 27 Comp. 
Gen. 764 (1948); 26 Comp. Gen. 131 (1946). 
• A “continuous journey” involving more than one segment obligates 
funds of the fiscal year in which the ticket was purchased, as long as 
the trip starts in that same fiscal year. However, procurement of 
transportation en route is a new obligation. Similarly, a round-trip 
ticket obligates funds at the time of purchase as long as the trip starts in 
the same fiscal year. However, if the return portion of the ticket cannot 
be used and a separate return ticket must be purchased, a new 
obligation is created. 26 Comp. Gen. 961 (1947); A-36450, May 27, 1931. 
• Per diem incident to official travel accrues from day to day. Per diem 
allowances are chargeable to appropriations current when the 
allowances accrue (i.e., when the expenditures are made). Thus, 
where travel begins in one fiscal year and extends into the next fiscal 
year, the per diem obligation must be split along fiscal year lines, even 
though the cost of the travel itself may have been chargeable in its 
entirety to the prior fiscal year. 23 Comp. Gen. 197 (1943).

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

f. State Department: Travel 
Outside Continental United 
States 
• Reimbursement on a mileage basis is chargeable to the fiscal year in 
which the major portion of the travel occurred. If travel is begun 
sufficiently prior to the end of a fiscal year to enable the employee to 
complete a continuous journey before the close of the fiscal year, the 
obligation is chargeable entirely to that year. However, if the travel is 
begun so late in the fiscal year that the major portion of it is performed 
in the succeeding fiscal year, it is chargeable to appropriations for the 
succeeding year. 9 Comp. Gen. 458, 460 (1930); 2 Comp. Dec. 14 (1895). 
• Where (1) an employee is authorized to travel by privately owned 
vehicle at not to exceed the constructive cost of similar travel by rail, 
(2)the trip starts in one fiscal year and extends into the following fiscal 
year, and (3) the journey would have been completed in the prior year 
had rail travel been used, the travel expense is chargeable to the fiscal 
year in which the travel began. 30 Comp. Gen. 147 (1950). 
Other cases involving obligations for travel expenses are: 16 Comp. 
Gen. 926 (1937); 16 Comp. Gen. 858 (1937); 5 Comp. Gen. 1 (1925); 
26 Comp. Dec. 86 (1919); B-134099, Dec. 13, 1957; A-30477, Apr. 20, 1939; 
A-75086, July 29, 1936; A-69370, Apr. 10, 1936. 


By virtue of 22 U.S.C. § 2677, appropriations available to the State 
Department for travel and transportation outside the continental United 
States “shall be available for such expenses when any part of such travel or 
transportation begins in one fiscal year pursuant to travel orders issued in 
that year, notwithstanding the fact that such travel or transportation may 
not be completed during that same fiscal year.” This provision appeared in 
appropriation acts starting in 1948 and was subsequently made permanent 
and codified. It has the effect of excluding State Department travel or 
transportation outside the continental United States from some of the 
earlier decisions. The authority is permissive rather than mandatory. 


42 Comp. Gen. 699 (1963). 


Section 2677 of title 22 applies to temporary duty travel as well as travel 
incident to change of duty station. 71 Comp. Gen. 494 (1992). In either 
case, expenses are chargeable to the year in which the travel is ordered as 
long as some travel-related expense is also incurred in that year, even 
though the physical travel may not begin until the following year. Id. 
Travel-related expenses in this context include miscellaneous incidental 
expenses such as inoculations and passports as long as they are not 
incurred at a time so far removed from the actual travel as to question their 
legitimacy as incident to the travel. 30 Comp. Gen. 25 (1950). The statute

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations

Transfer/Relocation Costs 
also permits charging the prior year for expenses incurred under amended 
travel orders issued in the subsequent fiscal year as long as some part of 
the travel or transportation began in the prior fiscal year. 29 Comp. 
Gen. 142 (1949). 

The statute does not permit retroactive charging of an expired 
appropriation. Thus, the Comptroller General found it improper to issue a 
travel authorization in one fiscal year designating the succeeding fiscal year 
as the appropriation to be charged, and then, at the start of the succeeding 
fiscal year, cancel the authorization and replace it with a new authorization 
retroactively designating the prior year. 42 Comp. Gen. 699 (1963). 

A government employee transferred to a new duty station is entitled to 
various allowances, primarily travel expenses of the employee and his or 
her immediate family, and transportation and temporary storage of 
household goods. 5 U.S.C. § 5724. In addition, legislation enacted in 1967, 
now found at 5 U.S.C. § 5724a, authorized several types of relocation 
expenses for transferred employees. Specifically, they are: (1) per diem 
allowance for employee’s immediate family en route between old and new 
duty station; (2) expenses of one house-hunting trip to new duty station; 

(3)temporary quarters allowance incident to relocation; (4) certain 
expenses of real estate transactions incurred as a result of the transfer; and 
(5) a miscellaneous expense allowance. 
The leading case on the obligation of employee transfer expenses is 
64 Comp. Gen. 45 (1984). The rule is that “for all [reimbursable] travel and 
transportation expenses of a transferred employee, the agency should 
record the obligation against the appropriation current when the employee 
is issued travel orders.” Id. at 48. This treatment applies to expenses 
stemming from employee transfers; it does not apply to expenses stemming 
from temporary duty. 70 Comp. Gen. 469 (1991). 

The rule of 64 Comp. Gen. 45 applies to obligations for extensions of 
temporary quarters subsistence expenses—the obligation is chargeable to 
the year in which the transfer order was issued. 64 Comp. Gen. 901 (1985). 
It also applies to dislocation allowances payable to members of the armed 
services incident to a permanent change of station move. 67 Comp. 
Gen. 474 (1988). 

Agencies have discretionary authority under 5 U.S.C. § 5724c to contract 
with private firms for arranging the purchase of a transferred employee’s 
old residence. Since this service is wholly discretionary and in no way an 

Page 7-52 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

“entitlement,” the agency’s obligation to a relocation firm stems from its 
contract with the firm, not from the employee’s transfer. Thus, the 
obligation under one of these arrangements occurs when a purchase order 
under the contract is awarded. 66 Comp. Gen. 554 (1987). Since the 
obligation is evidenced by a written contract, it would be recorded under 
31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1). 

The decision at 64 Comp. Gen. 45 overruled prior inconsistent decisions 
such as 28 Comp. Gen. 337 (1948) (storage) and B-122358, Aug. 4, 1976 
(relocation expenses under 5 U.S.C. § 5724a). In assessing the impact of 
64 Comp. Gen. 45, however, care must be taken to determine precisely 
what has been overruled and what has not. For example, since 64 Comp. 
Gen. 45 dealt with reimbursable expenses, prior decisions addressing the 
transportation of household goods shipped directly by the government 
presumably remain valid.30 

Also, 35 Comp. Gen. 183 (1955) should not be regarded as overruled, 
notwithstanding language to the contrary in 64 Comp. Gen. 45. There are 
two reasons for this. First, 35 Comp. Gen. 183 was not limited to employee 
transfers, but dealt with travel in other contexts as well, situations not 
involved in the 1984 decision. Second, 35 Comp. Gen. 183 states, at 
page 185: 

“It may be stated, however, that we have no objection to 
recording tentatively as obligations the estimated cost of 
transportation to be purchased and reimbursements 
therefor to be earned, including reimbursements for 
transportation of household effects, within the current 
fiscal year at the time the travel orders are actually issued 
where it is administratively determined desirable in order to 
avoid certain additional accounting requirements; but all 
estimated amounts for travel and related expenses so 
recorded should be adjusted to actual obligations 
periodically . . . ” 

This is not very different from the holding of 64 Comp. Gen. 45. 

30 If the government ships the goods, the obligation occurs when a carrier picks up the goods 
pursuant to a government bill of lading. If separate bills of lading are issued covering 
different segments of the shipment, each bill of lading is a separate and distinct obligation. 
E.g., 31 Comp. Gen. 471 (1952).

8. Section 1501(a)(8): 
Public Utilities 

Under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(8), a recordable obligation arises when there is 
documentary evidence of “services provided by public utilities.”31 

Government agencies are not required to enter into contracts with public 
utilities when charges are based on rates that are fixed by regulatory 
bodies. However, contracts may be used if desired by the utility or the 
agency. GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal 
Agencies, title 7, § 6.2.C.5 (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993). 

If there is a contract, monthly estimates of the cost of services to be 
performed, based on past experience, may be recorded as obligations. If 
there is no contract, obligations should be recorded only on the basis of 
services actually performed. 34 Comp. Gen. 459, 462 (1955). See also 
B-287619, July 5, 2001; B-259274, May 22, 1996. 

A statute relating to obligations for public utility services is 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1308. Under this law, in making payments for telephone services and for 
services like gas or electricity where the quantity is based on metered 
readings, the entire payment for a billing period which begins in one fiscal 
year and ends in another is chargeable to appropriations current at the end 
of the billing period. If the charge covers several fiscal years, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1308 does not apply. A charge covering several fiscal years must be 
prorated so that the charge to any one fiscal year appropriation will not 
exceed the cost of service for a 1-year period ending in that fiscal year. 
19 Comp. Gen. 365 (1939). GAO has construed this statute as applicable to 
teletypewriter services as well. 34 Comp. Gen. 414 (1955). 

The General Services Administration is authorized to enter into contracts 
for public utility services for periods not exceeding 10 years. 40 U.S.C. 
§ 501(b)(1)(B).32 A contract for the procurement of telephone equipment 
and related services has been held subject to this provision even where the 
provider was not a “traditional” form of public utility. 62 Comp. Gen. 569 
(1983). Noting that the concept of what constitutes “public utility service” 

31 Prior to the 1982 recodification of title 31, United States Code, section 1501(a)(7) included 
public utilities as well as employment and travel expenses. The recodification logically 
separated public utilities into a new subsection since it is unrelated to the other items. 
Thus, pre-1982 materials refer to eight subsections whereas there are now nine. 

32 The military departments have authority to enter into utility service contracts for up to 
50 years in connection with the conveyance of a utility system from the department to the 
service provider. See 10 U.S.C. § 2688(c)(3). 

Page 7-54 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

is flexible, the decision emphasized that the nature of the product or 
service provided rather than the nature of the provider should govern for 
purposes of 40 U.S.C. § 501(b)(1)(B). 62 Comp. Gen. at 575. The decision 
also concluded that GSA is not required to obligate the total estimated cost 
of a multiyear contract under 40 U.S.C. § 501(b)(1)(B), but is required to 
obligate only its annual costs. 62 Comp. Gen. at 572, 576. 

9. Section 1501(a)(9): 
Other Legal Liabilities 

The final standard for recording obligations, 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(9), is 
documentary evidence of any “other legal liability of the Government 
against an available appropriation or fund.” This is sort of a catch-all 
category designed to pick up valid obligations which are not covered by 
31 U.S.C. §§ 1501(a)(1)–(a)(8). 34 Comp. Gen. 418, 424 (1955). 

Thus far, the decisions provide very little guidance on the types of 
situations that might be covered by subsection (a)(9). The few decisions 
that mention subsection (a)(9) generally cite it in conjunction with one of 
the other subsections and stop short of a definitive statement as to its 
independent applicability. See, e.g., 54 Comp. Gen. 962 (1975) 
(impoundment litigation); B-192511, Feb. 5, 1979 (severance pay plan under 
22 U.S.C. § 3968). 

Another case, although not specifically citing subsection (a)(9), pointed out 
a situation that would seemingly qualify under that subsection: estimates 
of municipal tax liabilities on United States property located in foreign 
countries, based on tax bills received in prior years. 35 Comp. Gen. 319 
(1955). 

Thus, subsection (a)(9) must be applied on a case-by-case basis. If a given 
item is a legal liability of the United States, if appropriations are legally 
available for the item in terms of purpose and time, and if the item does not 
fit under any of the other eight subsections, then subsection (a)(9) should 
be considered. 

Up to this point in Chapter 7, we have discussed obligations: what they are 

C. Contingent 
and how and when to record them. As pointed out in the previous sections 

Liabilities 

of this chapter, the core attribute of an obligation recordable under 
31 U.S.C. § 1501 is that it creates a definite legal liability on the part of the 
federal government. While the precise amount of the liability may be 
undefined initially, an “obligational event,” reflecting a definite liability, 

Page 7-55 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

may occur even though the amount of the liability at that time is undefined. 
A “contingent liability” is fundamentally different. In contrast to a definite 
liability, a contingent liability does not create an obligation unless and until 
the contingency materializes. 

Contingent liabilities take different forms depending on the circumstances. 
However, whatever form it takes, a contingent liability by definition lacks 
the definiteness that is essential to the concept of an obligation. Thus, GAO 
defines a “contingent liability” generically as “[a]n existing condition, 
situation, or set of circumstances that poses the possibility of a loss to an 
agency that will ultimately be resolved when one or more events occur or 
fail to occur.”33 

Contingent liabilities are not recordable as obligations under section 1501 
of title 31.34 Rather, a contingent liability ripens into a recordable 
obligation for purposes of section 1501 only if and when the contingency 
materializes. E.g., 62 Comp. Gen. 143, 145–46 (1983); 37 Comp. Gen. 691– 
92 (1958); GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal 
Agencies, title 7, § 3.5.C (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993) (hereafter GAOPPM). 


The contingent liability poses somewhat of a fiscal dilemma. On the one 
hand, it is by definition (and absent special statutory treatment) not 
sufficiently definite to support the recording of an obligation. Yet on the 
other hand, sound financial management may dictate that it somehow be 
recognized. Indeed, if completely disregarded, a contingent liability could 
mature into an actual liability and result in an Antideficiency Act violation. 
Agencies have a legal obligation to take reasonable steps to avoid 
situations in which contingent liabilities become actual liabilities that 
result in Antideficiency Act violations. This may include the 

33 GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, GAO-05-734SP 
(Washington, D.C.: September 2005), at 35 (emphasis added). 

34 Outside the framework of 31 U.S.C. § 1501, however, Congress has provided special 
treatment for certain contingent liabilities in order to better capture their budgetary impact. 
Most notably, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, 2 U.S.C. §§ 661–661, changed the 
normal budgetary treatment of loans and loan guarantees by establishing that for most 
programs, loan guarantee commitments cannot be made unless the Congress has 
appropriated budget authority in advance to cover their estimated losses (known as “credit 
subsidy costs”). See Chapter 11, section B, for a detailed discussion of the budgetary and 
obligational treatment of loan and loan guarantee programs under the Federal Credit 
Reform Act.

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

“administrative reservation” or “commitment” of funds, as well as taking 
other actions to prevent contingencies from materializing.35 

For example, in B-238201, Apr. 15, 1991, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) was faced with a contingent liability that could 
become an actual liability. GSA was engaged in litigation concerning an 
Illinois statute authorizing the taxation of government property purchased 
under an installment contract. GSA had entered into arrangements to 
purchase buildings in Illinois on an installment basis, so there was a 
potential for tax liability, including back taxes, which would be assessed if 
the Illinois statute was upheld. Since the litigation was extending over 
fiscal years and the outcome was in doubt, GSA accrued amounts from the 
fiscal years involved as loss contingencies for the potential tax liability. 
GAO agreed with GSA’s approach and stated: 

“Because the underlying legal liability of the Government 
has yet to be established, the potential tax liability of the 
[property] is not sufficiently definite to be recorded as an 
obligation. However, GSA has not actually obligated funds 
for this purpose, . . . Instead, in terms of fiscal operations, it 
is possible for GSA officials to have recorded the potential 
liability as a commitment through the budgetary account 
‘Commitments Available for Obligation’ in the Standard 
General Ledger. This accounting procedure reflects 
allotments or other available funds which were earmarked 
in anticipation of a potential obligation and is used for 
purposes of effective financial planning.” 

Id. See also 35 Comp. Gen. 185, 187 (1955) (GAO recommended reserving 
funds as a means to avoid potential Antideficiency Act violations from 
contingent liabilities involving pending litigation in cases where it was 
believed that claims against the government were meritorious). 

In addition to the obligational accounting treatment of contingent 
liabilities, agencies need to be aware of the financial accounting treatment 
of contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities may be sufficiently important 
to warrant recognition in a footnote to pertinent financial statements.

Federal Government, SSFAS No. 5, ¶¶ 35–42 (Dec. 20, 1995), as amended 
by SSFAS No. 12 (December 1998) (provides guidance on the appropriate 
accounting treatment of contingent liabilities in financial statements). 

D. Reporting 
Requirements 
When 31 U.S.C. § 1501 was originally enacted in 1954,36 it required each 
agency to prepare a report each year on the unliquidated obligations and 
unobligated balance for each appropriation or fund under the agency’s 
control. The reports were to be submitted to the Senate and House 
Appropriations Committees, the (then) Bureau of the Budget, and GAO. 
GAO was often asked by the appropriations committees to review these 
reports. 

After several years of reviewing reports, the appropriations committees 
determined that the requirement had served its purpose, and Congress 
amended the law in 1959 to revise and relax the reporting procedures. The 
current reporting requirements are found at 31 U.S.C. §§ 1108(c) and 
1501(b). 

Under 31 U.S.C. § 1108(c), each agency, when submitting requests for 
appropriations to the Office of Management and Budget, must report that 
“the statement of obligations submitted with the request contains 
obligations consistent with section 1501 of this title.” See 39 Comp. 
Gen. 422, 425 (1959). The reports must be certified by officials designated 
by the agency head. OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, 
and Execution of the Budget, § 51.1 (June 21, 2005). The certification must 
be supported by adequate records, and the agency must retain the records 
and certifications in such form as to facilitate audit and reconciliation. 
Officials designated to make the certifications may not redelegate the 
responsibility.37 

The conference report on the original enactment of 31 U.S.C. § 1501 
specified that the officials designated to make the certifications should be 
persons with overall responsibility for the recording of obligations, and “in 

36 See Pub. L. No. 83-663, § 1311(b), 68 Stat. 800, 830 (Aug. 26, 1954). 

37 See GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 3.8.A 
(Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993) (hereafter GAO-PPM).

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

no event should the designation be below the level of the chief accounting 
officer of a major bureau, service, or constituent organizational unit.”38 

The person who makes certifications under 31 U.S.C. § 1108(c) is not a 
“certifying officer” for purposes of personal accountability for the funds in 
question. Although he or she may be coincidentally an “authorized 
certifying officer,” the two functions are legally separate and distinct. 

B-197559-O.M., May 13, 1980. 

The statute does not require 100 percent verification of unliquidated 
obligations prior to certification. Agencies may use statistical sampling. 

B-199967-O.M., Dec. 3, 1980. 

In the case of transfer appropriation accounts under interagency 
agreements, the certification official of the spending agency must make the 
certifications to the head of the advancing agency and not to the head of 
the spending agency. 7 GAO-PPM § 3.8.A. 

Finally, 31 U.S.C. § 1501(b) provides that any statement of obligations 
furnished by any agency to the Congress or to any congressional committee 
“shall include only those amounts that are obligations consistent with 
subsection (a) of this section.” 

The definition of the term “deobligation” is an agency’s cancellation or 

E. Deobligation 
downward adjustment of previously incurred obligations. Deobligated 
funds may be reobligated within the period of availability of the 
appropriation. For example, annual appropriations may be reobligated in 
the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated, while multiyear or 
no-year appropriated funds may be reobligated in the same or subsequent 
fiscal years.39 Deobligations occur for a variety of reasons. Examples are: 

• Liquidation in amount less than amount of original obligation. E.g., 
B-207433, Sept. 16, 1983 (cost underrun); B-183184, May 30, 1975 
38 H.R. Rep. No. 83-2663, 18 (1954), quoted in Financial Management in the Federal 
Government, S. Doc. No. 87-11, 88 (1961), and in 50 Comp. Gen. 857, 862 (1971). 

39 See GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, GAO-05-734SP 
(Washington, D.C.: September 2005), at 44 and 85.

Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

(agency called for less work than maximum provided under level-of


effort contract). See also B-286929, Apr. 25, 2001. 

• Cancellation of project or contract. 
• Initial obligation determined to be invalid. 
• Reduction of previously recorded estimate. 
• Correction of bookkeeping errors or duplicate obligations. 
In addition, deobligation may be statutorily required in some instances. An 
example is 31 U.S.C. § 1535(d), requiring deobligation of appropriations 
obligated under an Economy Act agreement to the extent the performing 
agency has not incurred valid obligations under the agreement by the end 
of the fiscal year. See section B.1.i of this chapter for a further discussion 
of recording obligations in Economy Act transactions. 

For the most part, there are no special rules relating to deobligation. 
Rather, the treatment of deobligations follows logically from the principles 
previously discussed in this and preceding chapters. Thus funds 
deobligated within the original period of obligational availability are once 
again available for new obligations just as if they had never been obligated 
in the first place. Naturally, any new obligations are subject to the purpose, 
time, and amount restrictions governing the source appropriation. Funds 
deobligated after the expiration of the original period of obligational 
availability are not available for new obligations. B-286929, Apr. 25, 2001; 
64 Comp. Gen. 410 (1985); 52 Comp. Gen. 179 (1972). They may be retained 
as unobligated balances in the expired account until the account is closed, 
however, and are available for adjustments in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1553(a). 

A proper and unliquidated obligation should not be deobligated unless 
there is some valid reason for doing so. Absent a valid reason, it is 
improper to deobligate funds solely to “free them up” for new obligations. 
To do so risks violating the Antideficiency Act. For example, where a 
government check issued in payment of some valid obligation cannot be 
promptly negotiated (if, for example, it is returned as undeliverable), it is 
improper to deobligate the funds and use them for new obligations. 
15 Comp. Gen. 489 (1935); A-44024, Sept. 21, 1942. (The two cited decisions 
deal with provisions of law which have since changed, but the thrust of the 
decisions remains the same.) The Antideficiency Act violation would occur 

Page 7-60 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 7 
Obligation of Appropriations 

if the payee of the original check subsequently shows up and demands 
payment but the funds are no longer available because they have been 
reobligated and the account contains insufficient funds. This does not 
preclude an agency from exercising flexibility in the use of its 
appropriations so long as the agency does not risk an Antideficiency Act 
violation. B-272191, Nov. 4, 1997. 

Under some programs, an agency provides funds to an intermediary which 
in turn distributes the funds to members of a class of beneficiaries. The 
agency records the obligation when it provides, or legally commits itself to 
provide, the funds to the intermediary. It is undesirable for many reasons 
to permit the intermediary to hold the funds indefinitely prior to 
reallocation. Unless the program legislation provides otherwise, the 
agency may establish a reasonable cutoff date at which time unused funds 
in the hands of the intermediary are “recaptured” by the agency and 
deobligated. GAO recommended such a course of action in 50 Comp. 
Gen. 857 (1971). If recapture occurs during the period of availability, the 
funds may be reobligated for program purposes; if it occurs after the period 
of availability has ended, the funds expire absent some contrary direction 
in the governing legislation. Id.; Dabney v. Reagan, No. 82 Civ. 2231-CSH 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 1985). 

Congress may occasionally by statute authorize an agency to reobligate 
deobligated funds after expiration of the original period of availability. 
This is called “deobligation-reobligation” (or “deob-reob”) authority. Such 
authority exists only when expressly granted by statute. Deobligationreobligation 
authority generally contemplates that funds will be 
deobligated only when the original obligation ceases to exist and not as a 
device to effectively augment the appropriation. See B-173240-O.M., 
Jan. 23, 1973. Also, absent statutory authority to the contrary, “deob-reob” 
authority applies only to obligations and not to expenditures. Thus, 
repayments to an appropriation after expiration of the original period of 
obligational availability are not available for reobligation. B-121836, 
Apr. 22, 1955.

Continuing Resolutions 


A. Introduction 
1. Definition and General 
Description 
The term “continuing resolution” may be defined as follows: 

“An appropriation act that provides budget authority for 
federal agencies, specific activities, or both to continue in 
operation when Congress and the President have not 
completed action on the regular appropriation acts by the 
beginning of the fiscal year.”1 

For the most part, continuing resolutions are temporary appropriation acts. 
With a few exceptions to be noted later, they are intended by Congress to 
be stop-gap measures enacted to keep existing federal programs 
functioning after the expiration of previous budget authority and until 
regular appropriation acts can be enacted. B-300673, July 3, 2003. 
Congress resorts to the continuing resolution when there is no regular 
appropriation for a program or agency, perhaps because the two houses of 
Congress have not yet agreed on common language, because authorizing 
legislation has not yet been enacted, or because the President has vetoed 
an appropriation act passed by Congress. 58 Comp. Gen. 530, 532 (1979). 
Also, given the size and complexity of today’s government, the consequent 
complexity of the budget and appropriations process, and the occasionally 
differing policy objectives of the executive and legislative branches, it 
sometimes becomes difficult for Congress to enact all of the regular 
appropriation acts before the fiscal year ends. 

Continuing resolutions are nothing new. GAO has found administrative 
decisions discussing them as far back as the 1880s.2 At one time, they were 
called “temporary resolutions.” The term “continuing resolution” came 
into widespread use in the early 1960s.3

Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

In the 20 years from fiscal years 1962 to 1981, 85 percent of the 
appropriation bills for federal agencies were enacted after the start of the 
fiscal year and thus necessitated continuing resolutions. GAO has 
discussed the problems inherent in this situation in several reports. See, 
e.g., GAO, Updated Information Regarding Funding Gaps and 
Continuing Resolutions, GAO/PAD-83-13 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 17, 
1982); Funding Gaps Jeopardize Federal Government Operations, 
PAD-81-31 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 3, 1981). In 24 of the fiscal years 
between fiscal years 1977 and 2004, Congress and the President did not 
complete action on a majority of the 13 regular appropriations by the start 
of the fiscal year. In eight of those years, they did not finish any of the bills 
by the start of the new fiscal year.4 Twenty-one continuing resolutions 
were enacted for fiscal year 2001. 

The periodic experience of government “shutdowns,” or partial shutdowns, 
when appropriations bills have not been enacted has led to proposals for an 
automatic continuing resolution. The automatic continuing resolution, 
however, is an idea for which the details are critically important. 
Depending on the detailed structure of such a continuing resolution, the 
incentive for policymakers—some in the Congress and the President—to 
negotiate seriously and reach agreement may be lessened. If the goal of the 
automatic continuing resolution is to provide a little more time for 
resolving issues, it could be designed to permit the incurrence of 
obligations to avoid a funding gap, but not the outlay of funds to liquidate 
the new obligations. This would allow agencies to continue operations for 
a period while the Congress completes appropriations actions. GAO, 

Budget Process: Considerations for Updating the Budget Enforcement 
Act, GAO-01-991T (July 19, 2001). Funding gaps and the legal problems 
they present are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 6, section C.6. 

Continuing resolutions are enacted as joint resolutions making continuing 
appropriations for a certain fiscal year or portion of the fiscal year. 
Although enacted in this form rather than as an “act,” once passed by both 
houses of Congress and approved by the President, a continuing resolution 
becomes a public law and has the same force and effect as any other 
statute. Oklahoma v. Weinberger, 360 F. Supp. 724, 726 (W.D. Okla. 1973);

Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

B-152554, Dec. 15, 1970. Since a continuing resolution is a form of 
appropriation act, it often will include the same types of restrictions and 
conditions that are commonly found in regular appropriation acts. See, 
e.g., B-210603, Feb. 25, 1983 (ship construction appropriation in continuing 
resolution making funds available “only under a firm, fixed price type 
contract”). Indeed, continuing resolutions typically incorporate by 
reference restrictions and conditions from regular appropriations acts. 
See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 108-309, § 102, 118 Stat. 1137, 1138 (Sept. 30, 2004). 
Having said this, however, it is necessary to note that continuing 
resolutions, at least those in what GAO considers the “traditional form,” 
differ considerably from regular appropriation acts. 

Continuing resolutions may take different forms. The “traditional” form, 
used consistently except for a few years in the 1980s, employs essentially 
standard language and is clearly a temporary measure. An example of this 
form is Public Law 108-309, the first continuing resolution for fiscal year 
2005, which provided funding authority from October 1 through 
November 20, 2004. Section 101 appropriates: 

“Such amounts as may be necessary under the authority and 
conditions provided in the applicable appropriations Act for 
fiscal year 2004 for continuing projects or activities 
including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees (not 
otherwise specifically provided for in this joint resolution) 
which were conducted in fiscal year 2004, at a rate for 
operations not exceeding the current rate, and for which 
appropriations, funds, or other authority was made 
available in the following appropriations Acts . . .” 

Section 101 then references most of the regular appropriation acts for fiscal 
year 2004. 

Public Law 108-309 also contains a number of additional typical provisions, 
including the following: 

“SEC. 102. Appropriations made by section 101 shall be 
available to the extent and in the manner which would be 
provided by the pertinent appropriations Act.” 

“SEC. 104. No appropriation or funds made available or 
authority granted pursuant to section 101 shall be used to 
initiate or resume any project or activity for which 

Page 8-4 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

appropriations, funds, or other authority were not available 
during fiscal year 2004.” 

“SEC. 107. Unless otherwise provided for in this joint 
resolution or in the applicable appropriations Act, 
appropriations and funds made available and authority 
granted pursuant to this joint resolution shall be available 
until (a) enactment into law of an appropriation for any 
project or activity provided for in this joint resolution, or 

(b)the enactment into law of the applicable appropriations 
Act by both Houses without any provision for such project 
or activity, or (c) November 20, 2004, whichever first 
occurs.” 
When enacting continuing resolutions in this form, there is clear indication 
that Congress intends and expects that the normal authorization and 
appropriation process will eventually produce appropriation acts which 
will replace or terminate the budget authority contained in the resolution. 
Thus, a continuing resolution of this type generally provides that funds 
appropriated for an activity by the resolution will no longer be available for 
obligation if the activity is later funded by a regular appropriation act, or 
Congress indicates its intent to end the activity by enacting an applicable 
appropriation act without providing for the activity. 58 Comp. Gen. at 532. 
See also section 107 of Public Law 108-309, quoted above. Obligations 
already incurred under the resolution, however, may be liquidated. 

GAO’s decision in B-300673, July 3, 2003, illustrates the interplay between 
funding under a continuing resolution and a later-enacted regular 
appropriation. The fiscal year 2003 appropriation act for the legislative 
branch authorized the House of Representatives Chief Administrative 
Officer to use that Office’s salaries and expenses appropriation to pay 
certain expenses of the House Child Care Center for “fiscal year 2003 and 
each succeeding fiscal year.” Pub. L. No. 108-7, § 108, 117 Stat. 11, 355 
(Feb. 20, 2003). Previously, a revolving fund paid those expenses. 
However, since Public Law 108-7 was not enacted until February 20, 2003, 
fiscal year 2003 expenses for the Child Care Center were initially charged 
to the revolving fund under continuing resolutions. With enactment of 
Public Law 108-7, GAO held that the Chief Administrative Officer’s salaries 
and expenses appropriation should fund the Child Care Center expenses 
retroactive to the beginning of fiscal year 2003 and that this appropriation 
should reimburse the revolving fund for the fiscal year 2003 expenses 
initially charged to it under the continuing resolutions. The decision stated 

Page 8-5 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

that the fact that payments were initially made during a period covered by a 
continuing resolution was not significant since the regular appropriation, 
once enacted, supersedes the continuing resolution and governs the 
amount and period of availability. 

Unlike regular appropriation acts, continuing resolutions in their 
traditional form do not usually appropriate specified sums of money. 
Rather, they usually appropriate “such amounts as may be necessary” for 
continuing projects or activities at a certain “rate for operations.” The rate 
for operations may be the amount provided for the activity in an 
appropriation act that has passed both houses of Congress but has not 
become law; the lower of the amounts provided when each house has 
passed a different act; the lower of the amounts provided either in an act 
which has passed only one house or in the administration’s budget 
estimate; the amount specified in a particular conference report; the lower 
of either the amount provided in the budget estimate or the “current rate”; 
or simply the current rate. Therefore, in order to determine the sum of 
money appropriated for any given activity by this type of continuing 
resolution, it is necessary to examine documents other than the resolution 
itself. Some continuing resolutions have used a combination of “formula 
appropriations” of the types described in this paragraph and appropriations 
of specific dollar amounts. An example is the fiscal year 1996 continuing 
resolution, Pub. L. No. 104-69, 109 Stat. 767 (Dec. 22, 1995). 

There are times when Congress acknowledges at the outset that it is not 
likely to enact one or more regular appropriation acts during the current 
fiscal year.5 See, for example, the 1980 continuing resolution, Pub. L. 
No. 96-86, 93 Stat. 656 (Oct. 12, 1979), which provided budget authority for 
the legislative branch for the entire fiscal year. 

For a few years in the 1980s, Congress used a very different form of 
continuing resolution, simply stringing together the complete texts of 
appropriation bills not yet enacted and enacting them together in a single 
“omnibus” package. This approach reached its extreme in the 1988 
continuing resolution, Pub. L. No. 100-202, 101 Stat. 1329 (Dec. 22, 1987), 
which included the complete texts of all 13 of the regular appropriation 

5 In November 1995, perhaps anticipating numerous continuing resolutions for fiscal year 
1996, for example, Congress suspended for the remainder of that session the requirement in 
1 U.S.C. § 107 that the resolutions be printed on parchment for presentation to the 
President. Pub. L. No. 104-56, title II, § 201, 109 Stat. 548, 553 (Nov. 20, 1995).

Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

bills. This form of continuing resolution differs from the traditional form in 
two key respects: 

• Unlike the traditional continuing resolution, the “full text” version 
amounts to an acknowledgement that no further action on the 
unenacted bills will be forthcoming, and consequently provides funding 
for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
• When the entire text of an appropriation bill is incorporated into a 
continuing resolution, the appropriations are in the form of specified 
dollar amounts, the same as if the individual bill had been enacted. 
The “full text” format generally does not raise the same issues of statutory 
interpretation that arise under the traditional format. However, it produces 
new ones. For example, in a continuing resolution which consolidates the 
full texts of what would otherwise have been several separate 
appropriation acts, GAO has construed the term “this act” as referring only 
to the individual “appropriation act” in which it appears rather than to the 
entire continuing resolution. B-230110, Apr. 11, 1988. 

While the omnibus approach of the 1988 resolution may appear convenient, 
it generated considerable controversy because, among other reasons, it is 
virtually “veto-proof”—the President has little choice but to sign the bill or 
bring the entire government to an abrupt halt. See Presidential Remarks 
on the Signing of the Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1988 
and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 Into Law, 23 Weekly 
Comp. Pres. Doc. 1546, 1547 (Dec. 22, 1987). 

There was no continuing resolution for fiscal year 1989. All 13 of the 
appropriation bills were enacted on time, for what was reported to be the 
first time in 12 years.6 For fiscal year 1990, Congress reverted to the 
traditional type of continuing resolution. See Pub. L. No. 101-100, 103 Stat. 
638 (Sept. 29, 1989). Nor were there any continuing resolutions for fiscal 
years 1995 and 1997. The start of the 1997 fiscal year was met with an 
omnibus appropriations act which added five regular appropriations bills 
to a sixth regular appropriations bill. Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 
(Sept. 30, 1996). The remaining seven bills were enacted separately.

Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

Questions arising under continuing resolutions can be grouped loosely into 
two broad categories. First are questions in which the fact that a 
continuing resolution is involved is purely incidental, in other words, 
questions which could have arisen just as easily under a regular 
appropriation act. For example, one of the issues considered in B-230110, 
Apr. 11, 1988, was whether certain provisions in the 1988 resolution 
constituted permanent legislation. Cases in this category are included with 
their respective topics throughout this publication and are not repeated in 
this chapter. 

Second are issues that are unique to continuing resolutions, and these are 
the focus of the remainder of this chapter. For the most part, the material 
deals with the traditional form of continuing resolution as it is this form 
that uses concepts and language found only in continuing resolutions. 

One point that should emerge from the GAO decisions and opinions is the 
central role of legislative intent. To be sure, legislative intent cannot 
change the plain meaning of a statute; Congress must enact what it intends 
in order to make it law. However, there are many cases in which the 
statutory language alone does not provide a clear answer, and indications 
of congressional intent expressed in well-established methods, viewed in 
light of the purpose of the continuing resolution, will tip the balance. 

In one case, for example, a continuing resolution provided a lump-sum 
appropriation for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s 
research and facilities account, and provided further for the transfer of 
$1.8 million from the Fisheries Loan Fund. The first continuing resolution 
for 1987 included the transfer provision and was signed into law on 
October 1, 1986. The Fisheries Loan Fund was scheduled to expire at “the 
close of September 30, 1986.” Under a strictly technical reading, the 
$1.8 million ceased to be available once the clock struck midnight on 
September 30. However, the Comptroller General found the transfer 
provision effective, noting that a contrary result would “frustrate the 
obvious intent of Congress.” B-227658, Aug. 7, 1987. 

Similarly, appropriations for the United States Commission on Civil Rights 
contained in a fiscal year 1992 continuing resolution were found to have 
extended the existence of the Commission beyond its termination on 
September 30, 1991. “When viewed in their entirety, legislative actions on 
the Commission’s reauthorization and appropriation bills, together with 
their legislative history, clearly manifest an intent by Congress for the 

Page 8-8 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

Commission to continue to operate after September 30, 1991.” 71 Comp. 
Gen. 378, 381 (1992). 

While many of the continuing resolution provisions to be discussed will 
appear highly technical (because they are highly technical), there is an 
essential logic to them, evolved over many years, which is more readily 
seen from the perspective not of a specific case or problem, but of the 
overall goals and objectives of continuing resolutions and their relationship 
to the rest of the budget and appropriations process. 

2. Use of Appropriation 
Warrants 
Funds, including funds appropriated under a continuing resolution, are 
drawn from the Treasury by means of an appropriation warrant (FMS 
Form 6200).7 A warrant is the official document issued pursuant to law by 
the Secretary of the Treasury upon enactment of an appropriation that 
establishes the amount of money authorized to be withdrawn from the 
Treasury.8 Under 31 U.S.C. § 3323(a), warrants authorized by law are to be 
signed by the Secretary of the Treasury and countersigned by the 
Comptroller General. However, under the authority of section 3326(a) of 
title 31, United States Code, the Secretary of the Treasury and the 
Comptroller General have issued several joint regulations phasing out the 
countersignature requirement. 9 First, Department of the Treasury-General 
Accounting Office Joint Regulation No. 5 (Oct. 18, 1974) waived the 
requirement for all appropriations except continuing resolutions. Next, 
Treasury-GAO Joint Regulation No. 6 (Oct. 1, 1983) further simplified the 
process by requiring issuance of a warrant and countersignature under a 
continuing resolution only once, for the total amount appropriated, unless 
a subsequent resolution changed the annual amount. Finally, Treasury-
GAO Joint Regulation No. 7, effective January 1, 1991, eliminated the 
countersignature requirement completely.

and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies (Washington, D.C.: May 18,

earlier ones, but not those noted in the text, were published in the annual “Comp. Gen.”

Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

B. Rate for Operations 
1. Current Rate The current rate, as that term is used in continuing resolutions, is 
equivalent to the total amount of money which was available for obligation 
for an activity during the fiscal year immediately prior to the one for which 
the continuing resolution is enacted. 
The term “current rate” is used in continuing resolutions to indicate the 
level of spending which Congress desires for a program. For example, a 
resolution may appropriate sufficient funds to enable a program to operate 
at a rate for operations “not in excess of the current rate,” or at a rate “not 
in excess of the lower of the current rate” or the rate provided in a certain 
bill. It is possible to read the term “current rate” as referring to either the 
amount of money available for the program in the preceding year, or an 
amount of money sufficient to enable continuation of the program at the 
level of the preceding year. The two can be very different. 

As a general proposition, GAO regards the term “current rate” as referring 
to a sum of money rather than a program level. See, e.g., 58 Comp. 
Gen. 530, 533 (1979); B-194362, May 1, 1979. Thus, when a continuing 
resolution appropriates in terms of the current rate, the amount of money 
available under the resolution will be limited by that rate, even though an 
increase in the minimum wage may force a reduction in the number of 
people participating in an employment program (B-194063, May 4, 1979), or 
an increase in the mandatory level of assistance will reduce the number of 
meals provided under a meals for the elderly program (B-194362, May 1, 
1979). 

The term “current rate” refers to the rate of operations carried on within 
the appropriation for the prior fiscal year. B-152554, Dec. 6, 1963. The 
current rate is equivalent to the total appropriation, or the total funds 
which were available for obligation, for an activity during the previous 
fiscal year. Edwards v. Bowen, 785 F.2d 1440 (9th Cir. 1986); B-300167, 
Nov. 15, 2002; B-255529, Jan. 10, 1994; 64 Comp. Gen. 21 (1984); 58 Comp. 
Gen. 530, 533 (1979); B-194063, May 4, 1979; B-194362, May 1, 1979. Funds 
administratively transferred from the account during the fiscal year, under 
authority contained in substantive legislation, should not be deducted in 
determining the current rate. B-197881, Apr. 8, 1980; B-152554, Nov. 4, 1974. 

Page 8-10 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

It follows that funds transferred into the account during the fiscal year 
pursuant to statutory authority should be excluded. B-197881, Apr. 8, 1980. 

In those instances in which the program in question has been funded by 
1-year appropriations in prior years, the current rate is equal to the total 
funds appropriated for the program for the previous fiscal year. See, e.g., 
B-271304, Mar. 19, 1996; 64 Comp. Gen. at 22; 58 Comp. Gen. 530; B-194362, 
May 1, 1979. In those instances in which the program has been funded by 
multiple year or no-year appropriations in prior years, the current rate is 
equal to the total funds appropriated for the previous fiscal year plus the 
total of unobligated budget authority carried over into that year from prior 
years. 58 Comp. Gen. 530; B-152554, Oct. 9, 1970. 

One apparent deviation from this calculation of current rate occurred in 
58 Comp. Gen. 530, a case involving the now obsolete Comprehensive 
Employment and Training Act program. In that decision, the Comptroller 
General, in calculating the current rate under the 1979 continuing 
resolution, included funds appropriated in a 1977 appropriation act and 
obligated during 1977. Ordinarily, only funds appropriated by the fiscal 
year 1978 appropriation act, and carry-over funds unobligated at the 
beginning of fiscal year 1979, would have been included in the current rate. 
However, Congress did not appropriate funds for this activity in the fiscal 
year 1978 appropriation act. In this instance the funds appropriated in 1977 
were included because it was clear from the legislative history of the 
appropriation act that Congress intended these funds to be an advance of 
appropriations for fiscal year 1978. Thus, in order to ascertain the actual 
amount available for the activity for fiscal year 1978, it was necessary to 
include the advance funding provided by the 1977 appropriation act. The 
rationale used in this decision would apply only when it is clear that 
Congress was providing advance funding for the reference fiscal year in an 
earlier year’s appropriation act. 

Where funding for the preceding fiscal year covered only a part of that year, 
it may be appropriate to “annualize” the previous year’s appropriation in 
order to determine the current rate. This was the result in 61 Comp. 
Gen. 473 (1982), in which the fiscal year 1981 appropriation for a particular 
program had been contained in a supplemental appropriation act and was 
intended to cover only the last quarter of the fiscal year. The current rate 
for purposes of the fiscal year 1982 continuing resolution was four times 
the fiscal year 1981 figure. 

Page 8-11 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

Prior year supplemental appropriations also count in calculating the 
current rate. In this regard, section 103 of Public Law 108-309, 118 Stat. 
1137, 1138 (Sept. 30, 2004), discussed above, provides: “The appropriations 
Acts listed in section 101 shall be deemed to include miscellaneous and 
supplemental appropriation laws enacted during fiscal year 2004.” 

There are exceptions to the rule that current rate means a sum of money 
rather than a program level. For example, GAO construed the fiscal year 
1980 continuing resolution as appropriating sufficient funds to support an 
increased number of Indochinese refugees in view of explicit statements by 
both the Appropriations and the Budget Committees that the resolution 
was intended to fund the higher program level. B-197636, Feb. 25, 1980. 
Also, the legislative history of the fiscal year 1981 continuing resolution 
(Pub. L. No. 96-369, 94 Stat. 1351 (Oct. 1, 1980)) indicated that in some 
instances current rate must be interpreted so as to avoid reducing existing 
program levels. 

It is always preferable for the exception to be specified in the resolution 
itself. Starting with the first continuing resolution for fiscal year 1983 
(Pub. L. No. 97-276, 96 Stat. 1186 (Oct. 2, 1982)), Congress began 
appropriating for the continuation of certain programs “at a rate to 
maintain current operating levels.” GAO has construed this language as 
meaning sufficient funds to maintain the program in question at the same 
operating level as at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. 
B-209676, Apr. 14, 1983; B-200923, Nov. 16, 1982 (nondecision letter). 
Recent continuing resolutions have included similar language for 
entitlement and other mandatory payments: “activities shall be continued 
at the rate to maintain program levels under current law.”10 

2. Rate Not Exceeding 
Current Rate 
When a resolution appropriates funds to continue an activity at a rate for 
operations “not in excess of the current rate,” the amount of funds 
appropriated by the resolution is equal to the current rate less any 
unobligated balance carried over into the present year. 

As discussed in the preceding section, the current rate is equivalent to the 
total amount of funds that was available for obligation for a project or 

10 Pub. L. No. 108-309, § 126 (first continuing resolution for fiscal year 2005). See also 
Pub. L. No. 108-84, § 112, 117 Stat. 1042, 1044 (Sept. 30, 2003) (first continuing resolution for 
fiscal year 2004).

Continuing Resolutions 

activity in the preceding fiscal year. When the continuing resolution 
appropriates funds to continue an activity at a rate for operations “not in 
excess of the current rate,” it is the intent of Congress that the activity have 
available for obligation in the present fiscal year no more funds than it had 
available for obligation in the preceding fiscal year. Therefore, if there is a 
balance of unobligated funds which can be carried over into the present 
fiscal year because the funds are multiple year or no-year funds, this 
balance must be deducted from the current rate in determining the amount 
of funds appropriated by the continuing resolution. If this were not done, 
the program would be funded at a higher level in the present year than it 
was in the preceding year, which is not permitted by the language of the 
resolution. See 58 Comp. Gen. 530, 535 (1979). 

For example, suppose a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2006 were to 
appropriate sufficient funds to continue an activity at a rate not exceeding 
the current rate, and the current rate, or the total amount which was 
available for obligation in fiscal year 2005, is $1,000,000. Of this amount, 
suppose $100,000 of multiple year funds remains unobligated at the end of 
fiscal year 2005, and is available for obligation in fiscal year 2006. If the 
activity is to operate at a rate not to exceed the current rate, $1,000,000, 
then the resolution appropriates no more than the difference between the 
current rate and the carryover from 2005 to 2006, or $900,000. If the 
resolution were interpreted as appropriating the full current rate, then a 
total of $1,100,000 would be available for fiscal year 2006, and the activity 
would be able to operate at a rate in excess of the current rate, a result 
prohibited by the language of the resolution. 

An unobligated balance which does not carry over into the present fiscal 
year (the more common situation) does not have to be deducted. B-152554, 
Nov. 4, 1974. 

A commonly encountered form of continuing resolution formula 
appropriation is an amount not in excess of the current rate or the rate 
provided in some reference item, whichever is lower. The reference item 
may be an unenacted bill, a conference report, the President’s budget 
estimate, etc. When the current rate produces the lower figure—the 
situation encountered in 58 Comp. Gen. 530—the above rule applies and an 
unobligated carryover balance must be deducted to determine the amount 
appropriated by the continuing resolution. However, when the current rate 
is not the lower of the two referenced items, the rule does not necessarily 
apply. 

Page 8-13 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

To illustrate, a continuing resolution appropriated funds for the Office of 
Refugee Resettlement at a rate for operations not in excess of the lower of 
the current rate or the rate authorized by a bill as passed by the House of 
Representatives. The rate under the House-passed bill was $50 million. 
The current rate was $77.5 million, of which $39 million remained 
unobligated at the end of the preceding fiscal year and was authorized to be 
carried over into the current fiscal year. If the continuing resolution had 
simply specified a rate not in excess of the current rate, or if the rate in the 
House-passed bill had been greater than the current rate, it would have 
been necessary to deduct the $39 million carryover balance from the 
$77.5 million current rate to determine the maximum funding level for the 
current year. Here, however, the rate in the House-passed bill was the 
lower of the two. 

Reasoning that the current rate already includes an unobligated carryover 
balance, if any, whereas the rate in the House-passed bill did not include a 
prior year’s balance, and supported by the legislative history of the 
continuing resolution, the Comptroller General concluded that the amount 
available for the current year was the amount appropriated by the 
resolution, $50 million, plus the unobligated carryover balance of 
$39 million, for a total of $89 million. 64 Comp. Gen. 649 (1985). The 
decision distinguished 58 Comp. Gen. 530, stating that “the rule with 
respect to deduction of unobligated balances in 58 Comp. Gen. 530 is not 
applicable where the lower of two referenced rates is not the current rate.” 
Id. at 652–53. The case went to court, and the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals reached the same result. Edwards v. Bowen, 785 F.2d 1440 
(9th Cir. 1986). 

In sum, if a continuing resolution appropriates the lower of the current rate 
or the rate in some reference item, you compare the two numbers to 
determine which is lower before taking any unobligated carryover balance 
into account. If the current rate is lower, you then deduct the carryover 
balance to determine the funding level under the continuing resolution. If 
the rate in the reference item is lower, the funding level is the reference 
rate plus the carryover balance unless it is clear that this is not what was 
intended.

3. Spending Pattern under 
Continuing Resolution 
a. Pattern of Obligations 
Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

An agency may determine the pattern of its obligations under a continuing 
resolution so long as it operates under a plan which will keep it within the 
rate for operations limit set by the resolution. If an agency usually 
obligates most of its annual budget in the first month or first quarter of the 
fiscal year, it may continue that pattern under the resolution. If an agency 
usually obligates funds uniformly over the entire year, it will be limited to 
that pattern under the resolution, unless it presents convincing reasons 
why its pattern must be changed in the current fiscal year. 

Continuing resolutions are often enacted to cover a limited period of time, 
such as a month or a calendar quarter. The time limit stated in the 
resolution is the maximum period of time during which funds appropriated 
by the resolution are available for obligation. 

However, this limited period of availability does not affect the amount of 
money appropriated by the resolution. The rate for operations specified in 
the resolution, whether in terms of an appropriation act which has not yet 
become law, a budget estimate, or the current rate, is an annual amount. 
The continuing resolution, in general, regardless of its period of duration, 
appropriates this full annual amount. See B-271304, Mar. 19, 1996; 
B-152554, Nov. 4, 1974. 

Because the appropriation under a continuing resolution is the full annual 
amount, an agency may generally follow any pattern of obligating funds, so 
long as it is operating under a plan which will enable continuation of 
activities throughout the fiscal year within the limits of the annual amount 
appropriated. Thus, under a resolution with a duration of one month, and 
which appropriates funds at a rate for operations not in excess of the 
current rate, the agency is not necessarily limited to incurring obligations 
at the same rate it incurred them in the corresponding month of the 
preceding year if the agency can establish that it is operating under a 
flexible plan that would enable continuation of activities throughout the 
fiscal year. B-152554, Dec. 6, 1963. The same principle applies when the 
resolution appropriates funds at a rate to maintain current operating levels. 

B-209676, Apr. 14, 1983. 

However, the pattern of obligations in prior years does provide a 
framework for determining the proper pattern of obligations under the 

Page 8-15 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

continuing resolution. For example, if the activity is a formula grant 
program in which nearly all appropriated funds are normally obligated at 
the beginning of the fiscal year, then the full annual amount should be made 
available to the agency under the resolution, even though the resolution 
may be in effect for only 1 month. However, if the activity is salaries and 
expenses, in which funds are normally obligated uniformly throughout the 
year, then the amount made available to the agency should be only onetwelfth 
of the annual amount under a 1-month resolution or one-fourth of 
the annual amount under a calendar quarter resolution. B-152554, Feb. 17, 
1972. 

For example, GAO determined that OMB properly apportioned, and the 
State Department properly obligated, 75 percent of funds appropriated by a 
fiscal year 1994 continuing resolution (Pub. L. No. 103-88, 107 Stat. 977 
(Sept. 30, 1993)) for payments to the United Nations. It was State 
Department policy to defer payment of the United States’ general 
assessment of United Nations contributions to the fourth quarter of the 
calendar year, which is the first quarter of the fiscal year. As a matter of 
normal practice, the State Department also made peacekeeping payments 
when bills were received to the extent funds were available. We found that 
the advance apportionment and obligation for the United Nations 
assessment and peacekeeping payments with funds appropriated by the 
fiscal year 1994 continuing resolution did not violate either the continuing 
resolution or the provisions of title 31, United States Code, controlling 
apportionment of funds. B-255529, Jan. 10, 1994. 

Congress can, of course, alter the pattern of obligations by the language of 
the resolution. For example, if the resolution limits obligations in any 
calendar quarter to one-fourth of the annual rate, the agency is limited to 
that one-fourth rate regardless of its normal pattern of obligations. 
B-152554, Oct. 16, 1973. Further, even if the resolution itself does not have 
such limitations, but the legislative history clearly shows the intent of 
Congress that only one-fourth of the annual rate be obligated each calendar 
quarter, only this amount should be made available unless the agency can 
demonstrate a real need to exceed that rate. B-152554, Nov. 4, 1974. 

Beginning with fiscal year 1996, Congress to date has included the 
following two provisions in continuing resolutions: 

“. . . for those programs that had high initial rates of 
operation or complete distribution of funding at the 
beginning of the fiscal year in fiscal year [1995] because of 

Page 8-16 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

distributions of funding to States, foreign countries, 
grantees, or others, similar distributions of funds for fiscal 
year [1996] shall not be made and no grants shall be 
awarded for such programs funded by this resolution that 
would impinge on final funding prerogatives.” 

“This joint resolution shall be implemented so that only the 
most limited funding action of that permitted in the 
resolution shall be taken in order to provide for 
continuation of projects and activities.” 

Pub. L. No. 104-31, §§ 113, 114, 109 Stat. 278, 281 (Sept. 30, 1995).11 

GAO considered these provisions in B-300167, Nov. 15, 2002. That decision 
involved the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) distribution of 
federal aid to highways funds to the states under a continuing resolution 
for fiscal year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-229, 116 Stat. 1465 (Sept. 30, 2002). 

FHWA had determined its distributions to the states at 4/365ths of the 
current rate of $31.8 billion since that was the previous fiscal year’s 
obligation limitation under the 2002 Department of Transportation 
appropriations act referenced by the continuing resolution. FHWA’s 
consistent historical practice was to allocate funds to the states on a prorata 
basis by multiplying the percentage of the year covered by the 
continuing resolution by the rate for the continuing resolution (at the time 
the anticipated length of the continuing resolution was 4 days, hence 
FHWA’s 4/365ths distribution). 

OMB, however, apportioned a total amount of $27.7 billion to FHWA during 
the term of the continuing resolution to refrain from “impinging on final 
funding prerogatives” per the first provision quoted above, thereby 
reducing the amount FHWA had available for allocation to the states from 
4/365ths of $31.8 billion to 4/365ths of $27.7 billion. OMB reasoned that 
because the program traditionally makes available all of the budgetary 
resources subject to limitation for allocation to the states at the beginning 
of the fiscal year, had OMB apportioned the full amount of the fiscal year 

11 See also Pub. L. No. 108-309, §§ 110, 111, 118 Stat. 1137, 1138–39 (Sept. 30, 2004). Our 
review did not reveal any relevant legislative history concerning the intent of Congress in 
adopting these provisions.

Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

2002 level, then any subsequent effort by Congress to enact an obligation 
limitation of less than $31.8 billion could have been compromised. 

GAO found that OMB had no basis to further reduce the level of highway 
spending below the current rate established in fiscal year 2002. Based on 
the plain language of the first provision above, it only applies to programs 
that (1) had “high initial rates of operation or a complete distribution” of 
funds at the beginning of the prior fiscal year (assuming the normal 
appropriations process), and where (2) a “similar distribution of funds” 
under the continuing resolution would impinge on Congress’s final funding 
prerogatives. In other words, the provision can only be applied to reduce 
or limit the distribution of the current rate for a program (as defined in the 
continuing resolution) if both prongs of the two-part test are met. Since 
FHWA’s long-standing practice of distributing highway funds under a 
continuing resolution on a pro-rata basis fully protects congressional 
funding prerogatives, and does so in a manner that is consistent with the 
second provision (and is far more restrictive than would be true under the 
first provision), GAO concluded that OMB was not justified under the two 
provisions to set the level of highway spending at $27.7 billion. 

Congress subsequently resolved the dispute between OMB and FHWA by 
including a specific provision in its second amendment to the continuing 
resolution establishing an annual rate of operations of $31.8 billion for 
FHWA provided that total obligations for the program not exceed 
$27.7 billion while operating under the resolution, Pub. L. No. 107-240, 
§ 137, 116 Stat. 1492, 1495 (Oct. 11, 2002). 

The requirement that appropriations be apportioned by the Office of 
Management and Budget, imposed by the Antideficiency Act, applies to 
funds appropriated by continuing resolution as well as regular 
appropriations.12 See generally OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, 
Submission, and Execution of the Budget, pt. 4, § 120.1 (June 21, 2005). 

Typically, OMB has permitted some continuing resolution funds to be 
apportioned automatically. OMB Cir. No. A-11, § 123.5. For example, if a 
given continuing resolution covers 10 percent of a fiscal year, OMB may 
permit 10 percent of the appropriation to be apportioned automatically, 
meaning that the agency can obligate this amount without seeking a 
specific apportionment. Under such an arrangement, if program 

12 For a more general discussion of apportionment, see Chapter 6, section C.4. 

Page 8-18 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

requirements produced a need for additional funds, the agency would have 
to seek an apportionment from OMB for the larger amount. 

Apportionment requirements may vary from year to year because of 
differences in duration and other aspects of applicable continuing 
resolutions. A device OMB has commonly used to announce its 
apportionment requirements for a given fiscal year is an OMB Bulletin 
reflecting the particular continuing resolution for that year.13 

4. Liquidation of Contract 
Authority 
When in the preceding fiscal year Congress has provided an agency with 
contract authority, the continuing resolution must be interpreted as 
appropriating sufficient funds to liquidate that authority to the extent it 
becomes due during the period covered by the continuing resolution. 

When an activity operates on the basis that in one year Congress provides 
contract authority to the agency and in the next year appropriates funds to 
liquidate that authority, then a continuing resolution in the second year 
must be interpreted as appropriating sufficient funds to liquidate the 
outstanding contract authority. The term “contract authority” means 
express statutory authority to incur contractual obligations in advance of 
appropriations.14 Thus, there is no “rate for operations” limitation in 
connection with the liquidation of due debts based on validly executed 
contracts entered into under statutory contract authority. In this context, 
rate for operations limitations apply only to new contract authority for the 
current fiscal year. B-114833, Nov. 12, 1974. 

5. Rate for Operations If an agency operating under a continuing resolution incurs obligations 
within the rate for operations limit, but Congress subsequently 
Exceeds Final 

appropriates a total annual amount less than the amount of these 

Appropriation 

obligations, the obligations remain valid. B-152554, Feb. 17, 1972. 

13 See, e.g., OMB Bulletin No. 04-05, Apportionment of the Continuing Resolution(s) for 
Fiscal Year 2005 (Sept. 30, 2004). For a detailed review of apportionment of funds 
appropriated or authority granted by the fiscal year 2003 continuing resolution, see 

B-300373, Dec. 20, 2002. 

14 GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, GAO-05-734SP 
(Washington, D.C.: September 2005), at 21. 

Page 8-19 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

For example, a continuing resolution for a period of 1 month may have a 
rate for operations limitation of the current rate. The activity being funded 
is a grant program and the agency obligates the full annual amount during 
the period of the resolution. Congress then enacts a regular appropriation 
act which appropriates for the activity an amount less than the obligations 
already incurred by the agency. Under these circumstances, the obligations 
incurred by the agency remain valid obligations of the United States. 

Having established that the “excess” obligations remain valid, the next 
question is how they are to be paid. At one time, GAO took the position 
that an agency finding itself in this situation must not incur any further 
obligations and must attempt to negotiate its obligations downward to 
come within the amount of the final appropriation. B-152554, Feb. 17, 1972. 
If this is not possible, the agency would have to seek a supplemental or 
deficiency appropriation. This position was based on a provision 
commonly appearing in continuing resolutions along the following lines: 

“Expenditures made pursuant to this joint resolution shall 
be charged to the applicable appropriation, fund, or 
authorization whenever a bill in which such applicable 
appropriation, fund, or authorization is contained is enacted 
into law.”15 

However, the 1972 opinion failed to take into consideration another 
provision commonly included in continuing resolutions: 

“Appropriations made and authority granted pursuant to 
this joint resolution shall cover all obligations or 
expenditures incurred for any program, project, or activity 
during the period for which funds or authority for such 
project or activity are available under this joint resolution.”16 

When these two provisions are considered together, it becomes apparent 
that the purpose of the first provision is merely to emphasize that the funds 

15 E.g., Pub. L. No. 108-309, § 108, 118 Stat. 1137, 1138 (Sept. 30, 2004). Comparable 
provisions have been included in continuing resolutions for over a century. See, for 
example, the fiscal year 1883 continuing resolution ( Pub. L. No. 38, 22 Stat. 384 (June 30, 
1882)) discussed in 3 Lawrence, First Comp. Dec. 213 (1882). 

16 E.g., Pub. L. No. 108-309, § 105. 

Page 8-20 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

appropriated by the continuing resolution are not in addition to the funds 
later provided when the applicable regular appropriation act is enacted. 
Accordingly, GAO modified the 1972 opinion and held that funds made 
available by a continuing resolution remain available to pay validly 
incurred obligations which exceed the amount of the final appropriation. 
62 Comp. Gen. 9 (1982). See also 67 Comp. Gen. 474 (1988); B-207281, 
Oct. 19, 1982. 

Thus, obligations under a continuing resolution are treated as follows: 

“When an annual appropriation act provides sufficient 
funding for an appropriation account to cover obligations 
previously incurred under the authority of a continuing 
resolution, any unpaid obligations are to be charged to and 
paid from the applicable account established under the 
annual appropriation act. Similarly, to the extent the annual 
act provides sufficient funding, those obligations which 
were incurred and paid during the period of the continuing 
resolution must be charged to the account created by the 
annual appropriation act. On the other hand, to the extent 
the annual appropriation act does not provide sufficient 
funding for the appropriation account to cover obligations 
validly incurred under a continuing resolution, the 
obligations in excess of the amount provided by the annual 
act should be charged to and paid from the appropriation 
account established under authority of the continuing 
resolution. [Footnote omitted.] Thus the funds made 
available by the resolution must remain available to pay 
these obligations.” 

62 Comp. Gen. 9, 11–12 (1982). Thus, as GAO had advised in 1972, agencies 
are still required to make their best efforts to remain within the amount of 
the final appropriation. The change recognized in 62 Comp. Gen. 9 is that, 
to the extent an agency is unable to do so, the appropriation made by the 
continuing resolution remains available to liquidate the “excess” 
obligations. 

“Projects or activities” as used in continuing resolutions may have two

C. Projects or 
meanings. When determining which government programs are covered by 

Activities 

the resolution, and the rate for operations limit, the term “project or 

Page 8-21 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

activity” refers to the total appropriation rather than to specific activities. 
When determining whether an activity was authorized or carried out in the 
preceding year, the term “project or activity” may refer to the specific 
activity. The following paragraphs will elaborate. 

The term “projects or activities” is sometimes used in continuing 
resolutions to indicate which government programs are to be funded and at 
what rate. Thus a resolution might appropriate sufficient funds to continue 
“projects or activities provided for” in a certain appropriation bill “to the 
extent and in the manner” provided in the bill or as provided for in prior 
year appropriation acts. See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 108-309, §§ 101, 102, 118 Stat. 
1137–38 (Sept. 30, 2004). 

Occasionally Congress will use only the term “activities” by appropriating 
sufficient funds “for continuing the following activities, but at a rate for 
operations not in excess of the current rate.” See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 97-51, 
§ 101(d), 95 Stat. 958, 961 (Oct. 1, 1981). When used in this context, 
“projects or activities” or simply “activities” does not refer to specific items 
contained as activities in the administration’s budget submission or in a 
committee report. Rather, the term refers to the appropriation for the 
preceding fiscal year. B-204449, Nov. 18, 1981.17 Thus, if a resolution 
appropriates funds to continue projects or activities under a certain 
appropriation at a rate for operations not exceeding the current rate, the 
agency is operating within the limits of the resolution so long as the total of 
obligations under the appropriation does not exceed the current rate. 
Within the appropriation, an agency may fund a particular activity at a 
higher rate than that activity was funded in the previous year and still not 
violate the current rate limitation, assuming of course that the resolution 
itself does not provide to the contrary. 

An exception to the interpretation that projects or activities refers to the 
appropriation in existence in the preceding fiscal year occurred in 
58 Comp. Gen. 530 (1979). In prior years, Comprehensive Employment and 

17 This position also follows from decisions such as B-162447, Mar. 8, 1971, read in 
conjunction with decisions on the availability of lump-sum appropriations. Of course, if the 
appropriation for the preceding fiscal year was a line-item appropriation, then the scope of 
“project or activity” will be defined accordingly. See 66 Comp. Gen. 484 (1987) (Special 
Defense Acquisition Fund, a revolving fund made available by annual “limitation on 
obligations” provisions, held a “project or activity” for purposes of appropriating language in 
a continuing resolution). 

Page 8-22 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

Training Act (CETA)18 programs had been funded in two separate 
appropriations, Employment and Training Assistance and Temporary 
Employment Assistance. The individual programs under the two 
appropriations differed only in that the number of jobs provided under 
Temporary Employment Assistance depended on the condition of the 
national economy. 

Concurrently with the enactment of the 1979 continuing resolution, 
Congress amended the CETA authorizing legislation so that certain 
programs previously operating under the Temporary Employment 
Assistance appropriation were to operate in fiscal year 1980 under the 
Employment and Training Assistance appropriation. Under these 
circumstances, if the phrase “activities under the Comprehensive 
Employment and Training Act” in the continuing resolution had been 
interpreted as referring to the two separate appropriations made in the 
preceding year, and the current rates calculated accordingly, there would 
have been insufficient funds available for the now increased programs 
under the Employment and Training Assistance appropriation, and a 
surplus of funds available for the decreased programs under the Temporary 
Employment Assistance appropriation. To avoid this result, the 
Comptroller General interpreted the 1979 continuing resolution as 
appropriating a single lump-sum amount for all CETA programs, based on 
the combined current rates of the two appropriation accounts for the 
previous year. See 58 Comp. Gen. at 535–36. 

Of course, as we noted earlier, continuing resolutions are really just short 
term appropriations that bridge the gaps that occasionally arise between 
the end of appropriations for one fiscal year and the start of appropriations 
for the next.19 For this reason, continuing resolutions usually refer only to 
those projects and activities for which annual funding has expired—on 
account of which funding is being provided. It should be remembered that 
most, but not all, of the government is funded under annual appropriations. 
Those projects and activities which are funded by multiple year and noyear 
appropriations are not usually directly affected by continuing 
resolutions. Thus, it would be a mistake to read the failure of a continuing 
resolution to address funding for the rest of the government as an implicit 

18 Pub. L. No. 93-203, 87 Stat. 839 (Dec. 28, 1973).

(Washington, D.C.: September 2005) at 35–36 (definition of “Continuing 
Appropriation/Continuing Resolution”).

Continuing Resolutions 

prohibition on undertaking other projects or activities that are, in fact, 
funded from other appropriations not covered by the continuing 
resolution.20 

The term “projects or activities” has also been used in continuing 
resolutions to prohibit the use of funds to start new programs. Thus, many 
resolutions have contained a section stating that no funds made available 
under the resolution shall be available to initiate or resume any project or 
activity which was not conducted during the preceding fiscal year. When 
used in this context, the term “projects or activities” refers to the individual 
program rather than the total appropriation. See 52 Comp. Gen. 270 (1972); 
35 Comp. Gen. 156 (1955). 

One exception to this interpretation occurred in B-178131, Mar. 8, 1973. In 
that instance, in the previous fiscal year funds were available generally for 
construction of buildings, including plans and specifications. However, a 
specific construction project was not actually under way during the 
previous year. Nonetheless it was decided that, because funds were 
available generally for construction in the previous year, this specific 
project was not a new project or activity and thus could be funded under 
the continuing resolution.21 

In more recent years, Congress has resolved the differing interpretations of 
“project or activity” by altering the language of the new program limitation. 
Rather than limiting funds to programs which were actually conducted in 
the preceding year, the more recent resolutions prohibit use of funds 
appropriated by the resolution for “any project or activity for which 
appropriations, funds, or other authority were not available” during the 

20 See 19 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 278 (1995) (requester was proceeding from the mistaken 
belief that a continuing resolution implicitly prohibits all obligations or expenditures except 
those expressly provided for in the resolution itself; activity at issue was funded by a 
no-year appropriation). 

21 For this exception to work, however, the previous appropriation must have afforded 
adequate authority to undertake the construction. See 4 Lawrence, First Comp. Dec. 116 
(1883), which concluded that Howard University violated the Antideficiency Act while 
operating under a continuing resolution. The University undertook building repairs that 
were not authorized by the outgoing appropriation or the continuing resolution, and could 
not defend its violation by pointing to new authority pending (and eventually enacted) 
during the continuing resolution that would have authorized the repairs.

Continuing Resolutions 

preceding fiscal year.22 Thus, if an agency had authority and sufficient 
funds to carry out a particular program in the preceding year, that program 
is not a new project or activity regardless of whether it was actually 
operating in the preceding year. 

A variation occurred in 60 Comp. Gen. 263 (1981). A provision of the 
Higher Education Act23 authorized loans to institutions of higher education 
from a revolving fund, not to exceed limitations specified in appropriation 
acts. Congress had not released money from the loan fund since 1978. The 
fiscal year 1981 continuing resolution provided funds to the Department of 
Education based on its regular fiscal year 1981 appropriation bill as passed 
by the House of Representatives. The House-passed version included 
$25 million for the higher education loans. Since the continuing resolution 
did not include a general prohibition against using funds for projects not 
funded during the preceding fiscal year, the $25 million from the loan fund 
was available under the continuing resolution, notwithstanding that the 
program had not been funded in the preceding year. 

Another variation can be seen in In re Uncle Bud’s, Inc., 206 B.R. 889 
(Bankr. M.D. Tenn., 1997). In a fiscal year 1997 continuing resolution, 
Pub. L. No. 104-99, title II, § 211, 110 Stat. 26, 37–38 (Jan. 26, 1996), 
Congress amended the Bankruptcy Code to require the U.S. Trustee to 
impose and collect a new quarterly fee as part of the bankruptcy process. 
Uncle Bud’s, 206 B.R. at 897. Some debtors argued that the new fee was 
barred because it constituted a “new activity.” The bankruptcy court 
disagreed, noting that, while the fee itself was new, the U.S. Trustee had 
long been required to collect other fees imposed by law. The court 
reasoned that the continuing resolution language was intended to limit 
spending to previous year levels. The new fee did not require the 
expenditure of additional funds—rather, it brought in more revenues. 
Accordingly, the bankruptcy court concluded that collection of the new fee 
represented, not a new project or activity, but the continuation of activities 
undertaken in the previous year. Id. On appeal, while other parts of the 
bankruptcy court’s ruling were reversed, this part was upheld and even 
expanded when the district court gave retroactive effect to the provision 

22 See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 108-309, § 104 (first continuing resolution for fiscal year 2005, 
discussed above). 

23 Pub. L. No. 96-374, § 731, 94 Stat. 1367, 1475 (Oct. 3, 1980).

Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

imposing the new fees. See Vergos v. Uncle Bud’s, Inc., No. 3-97-0296 
(M.D. Tenn., Aug. 17, 1998). 

Under the right set of circumstances, the projects or activities limitation 
can also have the effect of blocking existing programs. For example, in 
Environmental Defense Center v. Babbitt, 73 F.3d 867 (9th Cir. 1995), the 
Secretary of the Interior was sued for failing to determine whether to list 
the California red-legged frog under the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 
§ 1533(b)(6)(A). The Secretary acknowledged that the only actions that 
remained to be taken before the frog’s status could be settled were the 
agency’s in-house review and its final decision-making. Babbitt, 73 F.3d 
at 871–72. However, the Secretary argued he could not take those steps 
because, in 1995, Congress had enacted an appropriations rider which 
rescinded some of that fiscal year’s funds and barred the remaining funds 
for that year from being used to make any determination that a species was 
threatened or endangered. 24 See Emergency Supplemental Appropriations 
and Rescissions for the Department of Defense to Preserve and Enhance 
Military Readiness Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-6, 109 Stat. 73, 86 (Apr. 10, 
1995). Although the supplemental rider applied only to fiscal year 1995 
funds, the ban was effectively continued into fiscal year 1996 by the 
projects or activities limitation in the continuing resolution under which 
the government was being funded when the lawsuit was brought. Babbitt, 
73 F.3d at 870. 

Continuing Resolutions can carry over restrictions on projects and 
activities that applied under prior year appropriations riders. The court 
held that neither the appropriations rider nor the projects or activities 
limitation repealed the Secretary’s duty to determine whether the 
California red-legged frog is endangered, but they did bar the Secretary 
from complying with that duty by denying him funding for that purpose. Id. 
at 871–72. As the court explained: 

“[E]ven though completion of the process may require only 
a slight expenditure of funds, . . . taking final action on the 
California red-legged frog listing proposal would necessarily 
require the use of appropriated funds. The use of any 

24 For a further discussion of the effect of appropriations riders, see Chapter 1, section B, 
and the update of that section in GAO, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law: Annual 
Update of the Third Edition, GAO-05-354SP (Washington, D.C.: March 2005), available at

Continuing Resolutions 

government resources—whether salaries, employees, paper, 
or buildings—to accomplish a final listing would entail 
government expenditure. The government cannot make 
expenditures, and therefore cannot act, other than by 
appropriation.” 

Id. 

D. Relationship to 
other Legislation 
1. Not Otherwise 
Provided For 
Continuing resolutions often appropriate funds to continue projects “not 
otherwise provided for.” This language limits funding to those programs 
which are not funded by any other appropriation act. Programs which 
received funds under another appropriation act are not covered by the 
resolution even though the authorizing legislation which created the 
program is mentioned specifically in the continuing resolution. See 
B-183433, Mar. 28, 1979. For example, if a resolution appropriates funds to 
continue activities under the Social Security Act, and a specific program 
under the Social Security Act has already been funded in a regular 
appropriation act, the resolution does not appropriate any additional funds 
for that program. 

2. Status of Bill or Budget 
Estimate Used as 
Reference 
When a continuing resolution appropriates funds at a rate for operations 
specified in a certain bill or in the administration’s budget estimate, the 
status of the bill or estimate on the date the resolution passes is controlling, 
unless the resolution specifies some other reference date. 

A continuing resolution will often provide funds to continue activities at a 
rate provided in a certain bill that has passed one or both houses of 
Congress, or at the rate provided in the administration’s budget estimate. 
In such instances, the resolution is referring to the status of the bill or 
budget estimate on the date the resolution became law. B-164031(2).17, 
Dec. 5, 1975; B-152098, Jan. 30, 1970. 

For example, the resolution may provide that activities are to be continued 
at the current rate or at the rate provided in the budget estimate, whichever 

Page 8-27 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

is lower. The budget estimate referred to is the one in existence at the time 
the resolution is enacted, and the rate for operations cannot be increased 
by a subsequent upward revision of the budget estimate. B-164031(2).17, 
Dec. 5, 1975. 

Similarly, if a resolution provides that activities are to continue at the rate 
provided in a certain appropriation bill, the resolution is referring to the 
status of the bill on the date the resolution is enacted. A later veto of the 
bill by the President would not affect the continuation of programs under 
the resolution. B-152098, Jan. 15, 1973. 

Where a continuing resolution provides funds based on a reference bill, this 
includes restrictions or limitations contained in the reference bill, as well 
as the amounts appropriated, unless the continuing resolution provides 
otherwise. 33 Comp. Gen. 20 (B-116069, July 10, 1953);25 B-199966, Sept. 10, 
1980. In National Treasury Employees Union v. Devine, 733 F.2d 114 

(D.C.Cir. 1984), the court construed a provision in a reference bill 
prohibiting the implementation of certain regulations, accepting without 
question the restriction as having been “enacted into law” by a continuing 
resolution which provided funds “to the extent and in the manner provided 
for” in the reference bill. See also Environmental Defense Center v. 
Babbitt, 73 F.3d 867 (9th Cir. 1995); Connecticut v. Schweiker, 684 F.2d 979 
(D.C.Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1207 (1983). Obviously, the same 
result applies under a “full text” continuing resolution, that is, a continuing 
resolution that enacts the full text of a reference bill “to be effective as if” 
the reference bill “had been enacted into law as the regular appropriation 
Act.” B-221694, Apr. 8, 1986. 
A provision in a continuing resolution using a reference bill may 
incorporate legislative history, in which event the specified item of 
legislative history will determine the controlling version of the reference 
bill. For example, an issue in American Federation of Government 
Employees v. Devine, 525 F. Supp. 250 (D.D.C. 1981), was whether the 1982 
continuing resolution prohibited the Office of Personnel Management from 
funding coverage of therapeutic abortions in government health plans. The 
resolution funded employee health benefits “under the authority and 
conditions set forth in H.R. 4121 as reported to the Senate on September 22, 
1981.” An earlier version of H.R. 4121 had included a provision barring the 
funding of therapeutic abortions. However, the bill as reported to the full 

25 Two decisions begin on the same page, hence the variation in citation format. 

Page 8-28 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

Senate by the Appropriations Committee on September 22, 1981, dropped 
the provision. Accordingly, the court held that the continuing resolution 
could not form the basis for refusing to fund therapeutic abortions in the 
plaintiff’s 1982 health plan. Devine, 525 F. Supp. at 254. 

In previous years, it was also not uncommon for a continuing resolution to 
appropriate funds as provided in a particular reference bill at a rate for 
operations provided for in the conference report on the reference bill. See, 
e.g., Pub. L. No. 99-103, § 101(c), 99 Stat. 471, 472 (Sept. 30, 1985). At a 
minimum, this will include items on which the House and Senate conferees 
agreed, as reflected in the conference report. If the resolution also 
incorporates the “joint explanatory statement” portion of the conference 
report, then it will enact those amendments reported in “technical 
disagreement” as well. See B-221694, Apr. 8, 1986; B-205523, Nov. 18, 1981; 
B-204449, Nov. 18, 1981. 

3. More Restrictive 
Authority 
The “more restrictive authority,” as that term is used in continuing 
resolutions, is the version of a bill which gives an agency less discretion in 
obligating and disbursing funds under a certain program. 

Continuing resolutions will often appropriate funds to continue projects or 
activities at the rate provided in either the version of an appropriation act 
that has passed the House or the version that has passed the Senate, 
whichever is lower, “or under the more restrictive authority.” Under this 
language, the version of the bill which appropriates the lesser amount of 
money for an activity will be controlling. If both versions of the bill 
appropriate the same amount, the version which gives the agency less 
discretion in obligating and disbursing funds under a program is the more 
restrictive authority and will be the reference for continuing the program 
under the resolution. B-210922, Mar. 30, 1984; B-152098, Mar. 26, 1973; 
B-152554, Dec. 15, 1970. 

However, this provision may not be used to amend or nullify a mandatory 
provision of prior permanent law. To illustrate, the Federal Housing 
Administration was required by a provision of permanent law to appoint an 
Assistant Commissioner to perform certain functions. The position 
subsequently became controversial. For the first month of fiscal year 1954, 
the agency operated under a continuing resolution which included the 
“more restrictive authority” provision. Language abolishing the position 
had been contained in one version of the reference bill, but not both. The 
bill, when subsequently enacted, abolished the position. 

Page 8-29 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

Under a strict application of the “more restrictive authority” provision, it 
could be argued that there was no authority to continue the employment of 
the Assistant Commissioner during the month covered by the continuing 
resolution. Noting that “laws are to be given a sensible construction where 
a literal application thereof would lead to unjust or absurd consequences, 
which should be avoided if a reasonable application is consistent with the 
legislative purpose,” the Comptroller General held that the Assistant 
Commissioner could be paid his salary for the month in question. 
B-116566, Sept. 14, 1953. The decision concluded: 

“[M]anifestly the [more restrictive authority] language . . . 
was not designed to amend or nullify prior permanent law 
which theretofore required, or might thereafter require, the 
continuance of a specific project or activity during July 
1953. . . . 

* * * * * 

“. . . Accordingly, it is concluded that the words ‘the lesser 
amount or the more restrictive authority’ as used in [the 
continuing resolution] had reference to such funds and 
authority as theretofore were provided in appropriations for 
[the preceding fiscal year], and which might be changed, 
enlarged or restricted from year to year.” 

In addition, continuing resolutions frequently provide that a provision 
“which by its terms is applicable to more than one appropriation” and 
which was not included in the applicable appropriation act for the 
preceding fiscal year, will not be applicable to funds or authority under the 
resolution unless it was included in identical form in the relevant 
appropriation bill as passed by both the House and the Senate. Thus, in 
52 Comp. Gen. 71 (1972), a provision in the House version of the 1973 Labor 
Department appropriation act prohibited the use of “funds appropriated by 
this Act” for Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)26 inspections of 
firms employing 25 persons or less. The Senate version contained the 
identical version except that “15” was substituted for “25.” The continuing 
resolution for that year contained both the “more restrictive authority” and 
the “applicable to more than one appropriation” provisions. The 

26 Pub. L. No. 91-596, 84 Stat. 1590 (Dec. 29, 1970). 

Page 8-30 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

Comptroller General concluded that, even though the House provision was 
more restrictive, the OSHA provision did not apply to funds under the 
continuing resolution since it had not been contained in the 1972 
appropriation act and by its terms it was applicable to more than one 
appropriation (i.e., it applied to the entire appropriation act). See also 

B-210922, Mar. 30, 1984; B-142011, Aug. 6, 1969. 

For purposes of the “applicable to more than one appropriation” provision, 
GAO has construed the “applicable appropriation act for the preceding 
fiscal year” as meaning the regular appropriation act for the preceding year 
and not a supplemental. B-210922, Mar. 30, 1984. (The cited decision also 
illustrates some of the complexities encountered when the appropriation 
act for the preceding year was itself a continuing resolution.) 

4. Lack of Authorizing 
Legislation 
In order for a government agency to carry out a program, the program must 
first be authorized by law and then funded, usually by means of regular 
appropriations. This section deals with the relationship of continuing 
resolutions to programs whose authorization has expired or is about to 
expire. The common issue is the extent to which a continuing resolution 
provides authority to continue the program after expiration of the 
underlying authorization. 

As the following discussion will reveal, there are no easy answers. The 
cases frequently involve a complex interrelationship of various legislative 
actions (or inactions) and are not susceptible to any meaningful 
formulation of simple rules. For the most part, the answer is primarily a 
question of intent, circumscribed of course by statutory language and aided 
by various rules of statutory construction. 

We start with a fairly straightforward case. Toward the end of fiscal year 
1984, Congress was considering legislation (S. 2456) to establish a 
commission to study the Ukrainian famine of 1932–33. The bill passed the 
Senate but was not enacted into law before the end of the fiscal year. The 
fiscal year 1985 continuing resolution provided that “[t]here are hereby 
appropriated $400,000 to carry out the provisions of S. 2456, as passed by 
the Senate on September 21, 1984.”27 If this provision were not construed 
as authorizing the establishment and operation of the commission as well 

27 Pub. L. No. 98-473, § 136, 98 Stat. 1837, 1973 (Oct. 12, 1984). 

Page 8-31 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

as the appropriation of funds, it would have been absolutely meaningless. 
Accordingly, GAO concluded that the appropriation incorporated the 
substantive authority of S. 2456. B-219727, July 30, 1985. The result was 
supported by clear and explicit legislative history. 

In a 1975 case, GAO held that the specific inclusion of a program in a 
continuing resolution will provide both authorization and funding to 
continue the program despite the expiration of the appropriation 
authorization legislation. Thus, for example, if the continuing resolution 
specifically states that the School Breakfast Program is to be continued 
under the resolution, the program may be continued although funding 
authorization legislation for the program expires prior to or during the 
period the resolution is in effect. 55 Comp. Gen. 289 (1975). The same 
result would follow if the intent to continue the program was made 
particularly clear in legislative history. 65 Comp. Gen. 318, 320–21 (1986). 

The result in 55 Comp. Gen. 289 flows from two concepts. First, the 
continuing resolution, as the later enactment, is the more recent expression 
of congressional intent. Second, if Congress can appropriate funds in 
excess of a specific ceiling in authorizing legislation, which it can, then it 
should be able to appropriate funds to continue a program whose funding 
authorization is about to expire, at least where the authorization of 
appropriations is not a legal prerequisite to the appropriation itself. 

However, the “rule” of 55 Comp. Gen. 289 is not an absolute and the result 
in any given case will depend on several variables. Although not spelled 
out as such in any of the decisions, the variables may include: the degree of 
specificity in the continuing resolution; the apparent intent of Congress 
with respect to the expired program; whether what has expired is an 
authorization of appropriations or the underlying program authority itself; 

Page 8-32 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

and the duration of the continuing resolution (short-term versus full fiscal 
year).28 

In one case, for example, “all authority” under the Manpower Development 
and Training Act (MDTA)29 terminated on June 30, 1973. The program was 
not specifically provided for in the 1974 continuing resolution, and the 
authority in fact was not reestablished until enactment of the 
Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA)30 six months later. 
Under these circumstances, the Claims Court held that, in the absence of 
express language in the continuing resolution or elsewhere, contracts 
entered into during the gap between expiration of the MDTA and 
enactment of CETA were without legal authority and did not bind the 
government. Consortium Venture Corp. v. United States, 5 Cl. Ct. 47 
(1984), aff’d mem., 765 F.2d 163 (Fed. Cir. 1985). 

In another case, recent Defense Department authorization acts, including 
the one for fiscal year 1985, had authorized a test program involving 
payment of a price differential to “labor surplus area” contractors. The test 
program amounted to an exemption from permanent legislation prohibiting 
the payment of such differentials. The 1985 provision expired, of course, at 
the end of fiscal year 1985. The 1986 continuing resolution made no 
specific provision for the test program nor was there any evidence of 
congressional intent to continue the test program under the resolution. 
(This lack of intent was confirmed when the 1986 authorization act was 
subsequently enacted without the test program provision.) GAO found that 
the Defense Logistics Agency’s failure to apply the price differential in 
evaluating bids on a contract awarded under the continuing resolution 

28 See also 71 Comp. Gen. 378, 380–81 (1992): 

“While the outcome in these cases varies, they are all grounded in the same 
principle. The Congress may revive or extend an act by any form of words 
which makes clear its intention to do so. Kersten v. United States, 161 F.2d 
337 (10th Cir. 1947), cert. denied, 331 U.S. 851. Furthermore, when the 
Congress desires to extend, amend, suspend or repeal a statute, it can 
accomplish its purpose by including the requisite language in an 
appropriations or other act of Congress. The whole matter depends on the 
intention of Congress as expressed in statute. United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 
200, 221–222 (1980) and United States v. Burton, 888 F.2d 682, 685 (l0th Cir. 
1989).”

Continuing Resolutions 

(even though the differential had been included in the solicitation issued 
prior to the close of fiscal year 1985) was not legally objectionable. 

65 Comp. Gen. 318 (1986). 

A more difficult case was presented in B-207186, Feb. 10, 1989. Congress 
enacted two pieces of legislation on December 22, 1987. One was a 
temporary extension of the Solar Bank, which had been scheduled to go 
out of existence on September 30, 1987. Congress had enacted several 
temporary extensions while it was considering reauthorization, the one in 
question extending the Bank’s life to March 15, 1988. The second piece of 
legislation was the final continuing resolution for 1988 which funded the 
government for the remainder of the fiscal year. The resolution included a 
specific appropriation of $1.5 million for the Solar Bank, with a 2-year 
period of availability. 

If the concept of 55 Comp. Gen. 289 were applied, the result would have 
been that the specific appropriation in the continuing resolution, in effect, 
reauthorized the Solar Bank as well. However, the “later enactment of 
Congress” concept has little relevance when both laws are enacted on the 
same day. In addition, in contrast to 55 Comp. Gen. 289, there was no 
indication of congressional intent to continue the Solar Bank beyond the 
March 1988 expiration date. Therefore, GAO distinguished prior cases,31 
found that the two pieces of legislation could be reconciled, and concluded 
that the resolution merely appropriated funds for the Bank to use during 
the remainder of its existence. 

Another case involving a sunset provision is 71 Comp. Gen. 378 (1992). The 
legislation establishing the United States Commission on Civil Rights 
provided for the Commission to terminate on September 30, 1991. During 
fiscal year 1991, Congress was working on the Commission’s 
reauthorization and its regular fiscal year 1992 appropriation. Although 
both bills passed both houses of Congress, neither was enacted into law by 
September 30. The first continuing resolution for fiscal year 1992, with a 
cutoff date of October 29, 1991, expressly provided funds for activities 
included in the Commission’s yet-unenacted 1992 appropriations bill. It 
was clear from all of this that Congress intended the Commission to 

31 GAO had also applied the concept of 55 Comp. Gen. 289 in 65 Comp. Gen. 524 (1986), 
holding that a specific provision in a regular appropriation act permitted the continuation of 
an activity whose organic authority had expired at the end of the preceding fiscal year. 
See also B-164031(3), Jan. 3, 1973. 

Page 8-34 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

continue operating beyond September 30. Thus, the continuing resolution 
effectively suspended the sunset date and authorized the Commission to 
operate until October 28, 1991, when the regular 1992 appropriation act 
was enacted, at which time the regular appropriation provided similar 
authority until November 26, when the reauthorization was enacted. 

Appropriation bills sometimes contain provisions making the availability of 
the appropriations contingent upon the enactment of additional authorizing 
legislation. If a continuing resolution used a bill with such a provision as a 
reference, and if the authorizing legislation was not enacted, the amount 
contained in the appropriation bill, and therefore the amount appropriated 
by the continuing resolution, would be zero. To avoid this possibility, a 
continuing resolution may contain a provision suspending the effectiveness 
of such “contingency” provisions for the life of the resolution.32 Such a 
suspension provision will be applicable only until the referenced 
appropriation bill is enacted into law. 55 Comp. Gen. at 294. 

E. Duration 
1. Duration of Continuing 
Resolution 
Continuing resolutions generally provide that the budget authority 
provided for an activity by the resolution shall remain available until 

(a) enactment into law of a regular appropriation for the activity, 
(b) enactment of the applicable appropriation by both houses of Congress 
without provision for the activity, or (c) a fixed cutoff date, whichever 
occurs first.33 Once either of the first two conditions occurs, or the cutoff 
date passes, funds appropriated by the resolution are no longer available 
for obligation and new obligations may be incurred only if a regular 
appropriation is made or if the termination date of the resolution is 
extended. 
The period of availability of funds under a continuing resolution can be 
extended by Congress by amending the fixed cutoff date stated in the 
resolution. B-165731(1), Nov. 10, 1971; B-152098, Jan. 30, 1970. The

extension may run beyond the session of Congress in which it is enacted. 

B-152554, Dec. 15, 1970. 

Thus, some fiscal years have seen a series of continuing resolutions, 
informally designated “first,” “second,” etc., up to “final.” This happens as 
Congress extends the fixed cutoff date for short time periods until either all 
the regular appropriation acts are enacted or Congress determines that 
some or all of the remaining bills will not be enacted individually, in which 
event relevant portions of the resolution will continue in effect for the 
remainder of the fiscal year. 

The second condition of the standard duration provision—enactment of 
the appropriation by both houses of Congress without provision for the 
activity—will be considered to have occurred only when it is clear that 
Congress intended to terminate the activity. Thus, in B-164031(1), Mar. 14, 
1974, although regular and supplemental appropriation acts had been 
enacted without provision for a program, the Comptroller General decided 
that funds for the program were still available under the continuing 
resolution. In this case, the legislative history indicated that in enacting the 
regular appropriation act, Congress was providing funding for only some of 
the programs normally funded by this act and was deferring consideration 
of other programs, including the one in question. Therefore, the second 
condition was not applicable. Moreover, because supplemental 
appropriations are intended to provide funding only for new or additional 
needs, omission of the program from the supplemental did not trigger the 
second cutoff provision. 

As discussed previously, once the applicable appropriation is enacted into 
law, expenditures made under the continuing resolution are charged to that 
appropriation, except that valid obligations incurred under the continuing 
resolution in excess of the amount finally appropriated are charged to the 
account established under the continuing resolution. 

2. Duration of 
Appropriations 
For the most part, the duration (period of obligational availability) of an 
appropriation under a short-term continuing resolution does not present 
problems. If you have, say, only 1 month to incur obligations under a 
continuing resolution, it matters little that the corresponding appropriation 
in a regular appropriation act might be a multiple year or no-year 
appropriation. Also, once the regular appropriation is enacted, it 
supersedes the continuing resolution and governs the period of availability.

Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

B-300673, July 3, 2003. Questions may arise, however, under continuing 
resolutions whose duration is the balance of the fiscal year. 

For example, the continuing resolution for fiscal year 1979 included the 
standard duration provision described above, with a cutoff date of 
September 30, 1979, the last day of the fiscal year. However, a provision in 
the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), 29 U.S.C. 
§ 802(B) (1976), stated that “notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
unless enacted in specific limitation of the provisions of this subsection,” 
appropriations to carry out the CETA program shall remain available for 
2 years. Applying the principle that a specific provision governs over a 
more general one, it was held that funds appropriated for CETA under the 
continuing resolution were available for obligation for 2 years in 
accordance with the CETA provision. B-194063, May 4, 1979; B-115398.33, 
Mar. 20, 1979. 

A few years earlier, the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia had reached the same result in a case involving grants to states 
under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Pennsylvania v. 
Weinberger, 367 F. Supp. 1378, 1384–85 (D.D.C. 1973). The court stated, 
“[i]t is a basic premise of statutory construction that in such circumstances 
the more specific measure . . . is to be held controlling over the general 
measure where inconsistencies arise in their application.” Id. at 1385. 

Application of the same principle produced a similar result in B-199966, 
Sept. 10, 1980. The 1980 continuing resolution appropriated funds for 
foreign economic assistance loans by referencing the regular 1980 
appropriation bill which had passed the House but not the Senate. For that 
type of situation, the resolution provided for continuation of projects or 
activities “under the appropriation, fund, or authority granted by the one 
House [which had passed the bill].” The House-passed bill gave the 
economic assistance loan funds a 2-year period of availability. The 
continuing resolution also included the standard duration provision with a 
cutoff date of September 30, 1980. Since the duration provision applied to 
the entire resolution whereas the provision applicable to the loan funds had 
a narrower scope, the latter provision was the more specific one and the 
loan funds were therefore held to be available for 2 years. See also 
60 Comp. Gen. 263 (1981) for further discussion of similar continuing 
resolution language. 

In some instances, an extended period of availability is produced by a 
specific exemption from the standard duration provision. For example, the 

Page 8-37 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 8 
Continuing Resolutions 

1983 continuing resolution provided foreign assistance funds “under the 
terms and conditions” set forth in the Foreign Assistance Appropriation Act 
of 1982, and further exempted that appropriation from the duration 
provision. Since under the 1982 act, appropriations for the African 
Development Fund were to remain available until expended, 
appropriations to the Fund under the continuing resolution were also noyear 
funds. B-212876, Sept. 21, 1983. In view of the express exemption 
from the duration provision, there was no need to apply the “specific 
versus general” rule because there was no conflict. See also B-210922, 
Mar. 30, 1984. 

3. Impoundment The duration of a continuing resolution is relevant in determining the 
application of the Impoundment Control Act. Impoundment in the context 
of continuing resolutions was discussed in a letter to the Chairman of the 
House Budget Committee, B-205053, Dec. 31, 1981. Generally, a 
withholding from obligation of funds provided under a continuing 
resolution would constitute an impoundment. Where the continuing 
resolution runs for only part of the fiscal year, the withholding, even if 
proposed for the duration of the continuing resolution, should be classified 
as a deferral rather than a rescission. Withholding funds during a 
temporary continuing resolution is different from withholding them for the 
life of a regular annual appropriation in that, in the former situation, 
Congress is still deliberating over the regular funding levels. Also, deferred 
funds are not permanently lost when a continuing resolution expires if a 
subsequent funding measure is passed. 
Under this interpretation, classification as a rescission would presumably 
still be appropriate where a regular appropriation is never passed, the 
agency is operating under continuing resolution authority for the entire 
fiscal year, and the timing of a withholding is such that insufficient 
opportunity would remain to utilize the funds. See B-115398, May 9, 1975. 

Impoundment issues under continuing resolutions may arise in other 
contexts as well. See, e.g., 64 Comp. Gen. 649 (1985) (failure to make funds 
available based on good faith disagreement over treatment of carryover 
balances in calculating rate for operations held not to constitute an illegal 
rescission); B-209676, Apr. 14, 1983 (no improper impoundment where 
funds were apportioned on basis of budget request although continuing 
resolution appropriated funds at rate to maintain program level, as long as 
apportionment was sufficient to maintain requisite program level).

Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 


The concept that a person should be held accountable for funds in his or 

A. Introduction 
her care is not peculiar to the government. If you get a job as a cashier at 
your local supermarket and come up short at the end of the day, you will 
probably be forced to make up the shortage from your own pocket. The 
store manager does not have to prove the loss was your fault. The very fact 
that the money is not there is sufficient to make you liable. Of course, if 
your cash register is emptied by an armed robber and you are in no way 
implicated, you will be off the hook. 

Just like a private business enterprise, the government can lose money in 
many ways. For example, it can be physically lost, stolen, paid out 
improperly, or embezzled. Sometimes the money is recovered; often it is 
not. If government funds are lost because of some employee’s misconduct 
or carelessness, and if the responsible employee is not required to make up 
the loss, the result is that the taxpayer ends up paying twice for the same 
thing, or paying for nothing. 

When you accept the job at the supermarket, you do so knowing perfectly 
well that you will be potentially liable for losses. There is no reason why 
the government should operate any differently. If anything, there is a 
stronger case for the liability of government employees since they are, in 
effect, trustees for the taxpayers (themselves included). As the 
Comptroller General once stated, “A special trust responsibility exists with 
regard to public monies and with this special trust goes personal financial 
responsibility.” B-161457, Oct. 30, 1969. This chapter will explore these 
concepts—the liability and relief of government officers and employees 
who are entrusted with public funds or who have certain specific 
responsibilities in their disbursement. In government language, they are 
called “accountable officers.”1 

1 This chapter deals solely with accountability for funds by those classified as accountable 
officers. Other types of accountability—accountability by employees who are not 
accountable officers or accountability for property other than funds—are covered in 
Chapter 13 in volume III of the second edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations Law.

B. General Principles 
1. The Concepts of 
Liability and Relief 
a. Liability The concept of accountability for public funds in the form of strict personal 
liability evolved during the nineteenth century. Its origins can be traced to 
a number of congressional enactments, some dating back to the Nation’s 
infancy. The legislation establishing the Department of the Treasury in 
1789 included a provision requiring the Comptroller of the Treasury to 
“direct prosecutions for all delinquencies of officers of the revenue.”2 A 
few years later, in 1795, Congress authorized the Comptroller to require 
“any person who has received monies for which he is accountable to the 
United States” to render “all his accounts and vouchers, for the expenditure 
of the said monies,” and to commence suit against anyone failing to do so.3 
In 1846, Congress mandated that all government officials safeguard public 
funds in their custody. The statute provided that— 
“all public officers of whatsoever character, be, and they are 
hereby, required to keep safely, without loaning, using, 
depositing in banks, or exchanging for other funds than as 
allowed by this act, all the public money collected by them, 
or otherwise at any time placed in their possession and 
custody, till the same is ordered, by the proper department 
or officer of the government, to be transferred or paid 
out . . . .” 
Act of August 6, 1846, ch. 90, § 6, 9 Stat. 59, 60. This statute still exists, in 
modernized form, at 31 U.S.C. § 3302(a). 
These are civil provisions. Congress also addressed fiscal accountability in 
a variety of criminal statutes. An important one is the Act of June 14, 1866, 
ch. 122, 14 Stat. 64, which declared it to be the duty of disbursing officers to

use public funds entrusted to them “only as . . . required for payments to be 
made . . . in pursuance of law,” and made it a felony for a disbursing officer 
to, among other things, “apply any portion of the public money intrusted to 
him” for his own use or for any purpose not prescribed by law.4 

The strict liability of accountable officers became firmly established in a 
series of early Supreme Court decisions. In 1845, the Court upheld liability 
in a case where money had been stolen with no fault or negligence on the 
part of the accountable officer. In an often-quoted passage, the Court said: 

“Public policy requires that every depositary of the public 
money should be held to a strict accountability. Not only 
that he should exercise the highest degree of vigilance, but 
that ‘he should keep safely’ the moneys which come to his 
hands. Any relaxation of this condition would open a door 
to frauds, which might be practiced with impunity. A 
depositary would have nothing more to do than to lay his 
plans and arrange his proofs, so as to establish his loss, 
without laches on his part. Let such a principle be applied 
to our postmasters, collectors of the customs, receivers of 
public moneys, and others who receive more or less of the 
public funds, and what losses might not be anticipated by 
the public?” 

United States v. Prescott, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 578, 588–89 (1845). While some 
might view this passage as unduly cynical of human nature, it makes the 
important point that the laws relating to the liability and relief of 
accountable officers are intended not only to give the officers incentive to 
guard against theft by others, but also to protect against dishonesty by the 
officers themselves. 

An 1872 case, United States v. Thomas, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 337, recognized 
that the liability announced in Prescott, while strict, was not absolute. In 
that case, the Court refused to hold a customs official liable for funds 
which had been forcibly taken by Confederate forces during the Civil War. 

4 This statute also still exists and is found at 18 U.S.C. § 653. Other criminal provisions 
relevant to accountable officers include 18 U.S.C. § 643 (failure to render accounts), 
18 U.S.C. § 648 (misuse of public funds), and 18 U.S.C. § 649 (failure to deposit). The four 
provisions of title 18 of the United States Code cited in this note apply to “all persons 
charged with the safe-keeping, transfer, or disbursement of the public money.” 18 U.S.C. 
§ 649(b).

Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

In formulating its conclusion, the Court recognized two exceptions to the 
strict liability rule: 

“[N]o rule of public policy requires an officer to account for 
moneys which have been destroyed by an overruling 
necessity, or taken from him by a public enemy, without any 
fault or neglect on his part.” 

Id. at 352. The exceptions, however, are limited. In Smythe v. United 
States, 188 U.S. 156 (1903), the Court reviewed its precedents, including 
Prescott and Thomas, and upheld the liability of a Mint official for funds 
that had been destroyed by fire, finding the loss attributable neither to 
“overruling necessity” nor to a public enemy. 

The standard that has evolved from the cases and statutes noted is one of 
strict liability. It is often said that an accountable officer is, in effect, an 
“insurer” of the funds in his or her charge. E.g., B-258357, Jan. 3, 1996; 
64 Comp. Gen. 303, 304 (1985); 54 Comp. Gen. 112, 114 (1974); 48 Comp. 
Gen. 566, 567 (1969); 6 Comp. Gen. 404, 406 (1926). See also United 
States v. Heller, 1 F. Supp. 1, 6 (D. Md. 1932). The liability is automatic and 
arises by operation of law at the moment a physical loss occurs or an 
erroneous payment is made. E.g., B-291001, Dec. 23, 2002; 70 Comp. 
Gen. 12, 14 (1990); 54 Comp. Gen. at 114. 

In addition to the applicable statutory provisions, courts have sometimes 
cited public policy considerations as a basis for an accountable officer’s 
strict liability. E.g., Prescott, 44 U.S. at 587–88 (“The liability of the 
defendant . . . arises out of . . . principles which are founded upon public 
policy”); Heller, 1 F. Supp. at 6 (strict liability “is imposed as a matter of 
public policy”). 

As discussed in section B.2 of this chapter, accountable officer liability 
does not attach to individuals who are not accountable officers even if they 
played a part—even a crucial part—in causing an improper payment. By 
the same token, an accountable officer’s liability is not diminished because 
other individuals induced—or even ordered—the improper payment. For 
example, in B-271021, Sept. 18, 1996, an official of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) submitted a memorandum to the 
director of an EEOC district office asking the district director to provide a 
travel advance in order to enable a nongovernment witness to appear in an 
agency proceeding. The official concluded his request as follows: “If there 
is a subsequent determination that the funds should not have been 

Page 9-7 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


b. Surety Bonding 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

disbursed for the aforementioned purpose, I will assume liability for 
repayment of the funds.” The district director ordered the travel advance 
to be made; his order was passed on to an accountable officer, Mr. Guthrie, 
who complied with it and issued the travel advance. EEOC headquarters 
later determined that the payment was unauthorized and disallowed it. 
GAO affirmed the disallowance, stating: 

“The fact that Mr. Guthrie may have received instructions 
from superiors to make the improper payment does not 
relieve him of responsibility for the deficiency in his 
account resulting from the improper payment. See 
55 Comp. Gen. 297 (1975); 49 Comp. Gen. 38 (1969).” 

B-271021 at 4. The other EEOC official’s statement offering to assume 
liability if the payment proved to be erroneous was equally unavailing to 
Mr. Guthrie. The decision observed: 

“This statement . . . has no effect on the liability of 
Mr. Guthrie for the deficiency in his account, which is fixed 
by statute and regulation. The government, accordingly, 
need look no further than Mr. Guthrie for restitution of the 
deficiency.” 

Id. at 5. 

Similarly, a long line of GAO decisions holds that an accountable officer is 
liable even where his or her subordinates actually made the improper 
payment. See, e.g., B-274364, B-276306, Apr. 23, 1997; B-260369, June 5, 
1995; B-241019.2, Feb. 7, 1992; B-246418, Feb. 7, 1992, and decisions cited.5 
As these decisions point out, however, relief from liability is appropriate 
where the supervising accountable officer maintained and ensured 
effective implementation of an adequate system of procedures and controls 
to avoid errors. 

The early cases also based liability on the accountable officer’s bond. Prior 
to 1972, the fidelity bonding of accountable officers was required by law. 

5 As discussed in section B.2.b of this chapter, where more than one accountable officer is 
involved—for example, a subordinate cashier who actually made an improper payment and 
a supervising accountable officer in whose name the account is held—both are liable. 

Page 9-8 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


c. Relief 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

See, e.g., 22 Comp. Gen. 48 (1942); 21 Comp. Gen. 976 (1942). As an 
examination of the statement of the case in decisions such as United 
States v. Prescott, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 578 (1845), United States v. Thomas, 
82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 337 (1872), and Smythe v. United States, 188 U.S. 156 
(1903), demonstrates, the terms of the bond were very similar to, and in 
fact were derived from, the 1846 “keep safely” legislation quoted above. 
Thus, while the bond gave the government a more certain means of 
recovery, it did not impose upon accountable officers any duties that were 
not already required by statute.6 

In a 1962 report, GAO concluded that bonding was not cost-effective,7 and 
recommended legislation to repeal the bonding requirement. GAO, Review 
of the Bonding Program for Employees of the Federal Government, B-8201 
(Washington, D.C.: Mar. 29, 1962). Congress repealed the requirement in 
1972, and accountable officers are no longer bonded. Indeed, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 9302 generally prohibits federal agencies from requiring or obtaining 
surety bonds to cover their officers and employees in carrying out official 
duties. The last sentence of 31 U.S.C. § 9302 specifically states that the 
prohibition against surety bonds “does not affect the personal financial 
liability” of individual officers or employees. Thus elimination of the 
bonding requirement has no effect on the legal liability of accountable 
officers. 54 Comp. Gen. 112 (1974); B-191440, May 25, 1979. 

The early cases and statutes previously noted made no mention of relief 
from liability.8 “Relief” in this context means an action, taken by someone 
with the legal authority to do so, which absolves an accountable officer 
from liability for a loss. Prior to the World War II period, with limited 
exceptions for certain accountable officers of the armed forces, an 
accountable officer had but two relief options available. First, a disbursing 

6 The bonding requirement had been for the protection of the government, not the 
accountable officer. Under the bonding system, if the United States was compensated for a 
loss by the bonding company, the company succeeded to the rights of the United States and 
could seek reimbursement from the accountable officer. 68 Comp. Gen. 470, 471 (1989); 
B-186922, Apr. 8, 1977. 

7 Originally, accountable officers had to pay for their own bonds. 33 Comp. Gen. 7 (1953). 
Legislation effective January 1, 1956, authorized the government to pay. Pub. L. No. 84-323, 
ch. 683, 69 Stat. 618 (Aug. 9, 1955). 

8 The “public enemy” situation dealt with in United States v. Thomas, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 337 
(1872), discussed in section B.1.a of this chapter, is not an example of relief. It is an 
example of a situation in which liability did not attach to begin with. 

Page 9-9 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

officer could bring an action in what was then the Court of Claims (now the 
United States Court of Federal Claims) under 28 U.S.C. § 2512.9 Of course, 
the officer would probably need legal representation and would incur other 
expenses, none of which were reimbursable. Second, and this became the 
most common approach, was private relief legislation, a burdensome 
process for amounts which were often relatively small. There was no 
mechanism for providing relief at the administrative level, however 
meritorious the case. 4 Comp. Gen. 409 (1924); 27 Comp. Dec. 328 (1920). 

Starting in 1941, Congress enacted a series of relief statutes, and there is 
now a comprehensive statutory scheme for the administrative relief of 
accountable officers who are found to be without fault. The major portion 
of this chapter deals with the application of this legislation. 

It is important to distinguish between liability and relief. It is not the denial 
of relief that makes an accountable officer liable. As noted previously, the 
basic legal liability of an accountable officer arises automatically by virtue 
of the loss and is not affected by any lack of fault or negligence on the 
officer’s part. Relief is a separate process and may take lack of fault into 
consideration to the extent authorized by the governing statute.10 
B-291001, Dec. 23, 2002; 54 Comp. Gen. 112 (1974); B-167126, Aug. 28, 1978. 

9 Section 2512, which had its origins in the early 1900s, provides: 

“Whenever the United States Court of Federal Claims finds that any loss by a 
disbursing officer of the United States was without his fault or negligence, it 
shall render a judgment setting forth the amount thereof, and the 
[Government Accountability Office] shall allow the officer such amount as a 
credit in the settlement of his accounts.” 

28 U.S.C. § 2512. While the statute is still on the books, it has not been applied in over 
50 years. 

10 The passage of time, however, can eliminate the government’s ability to enforce liability in 
improper payment cases, even without relief. See, for example, section D.5 of this chapter, 
discussing the 3-year statute of limitations that generally applies to holding accountable 
officers liable for erroneous payments, and B-287043, May 29, 2001. Therefore, in order to 
protect the government’s position, agencies should move promptly to address an 
accountable officer’s liability. Implications in a few cases such as 70 Comp. Gen. 616, 622– 
23 (1991), that an agency can never enforce an accountable officer’s liability for an improper 
payment unless it has first submitted the matter to GAO are misleading. See GAO, Policy 
and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, ch. 8 (Washington, D.C.: 
May 18, 1993), which describes agencies’ specific responsibilities in this area. 

Page 9-10 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

2. Who Is an Accountable 
Officer? 
An accountable officer is any government officer or employee who by 
reason of his or her employment is responsible for or has custody of 
government funds. B-288163, June 4, 2002; 62 Comp. Gen. 476, 479 (1983); 
59 Comp. Gen. 113, 114 (1979); B-257068, Oct. 22, 1994; B-188894, Sept. 29, 
1977. Accountable officers encompass such officials as certifying officers, 
disbursing officers, collecting officers, and other employees who by virtue 
of their employment have custody of government funds. 

Clearly, the relevant statutory provisions are the first place one looks for 
the source of authority conferring the status of “accountable officer” and 
establishing the responsibilities and liabilities that go with it. Does this 
leave any room for agencies to create “accountable officers” by 
administrative action? Until recently, GAO decisions indicated that 
agencies could impose accountable officer status and liability so long as 
they did so by specific regulation. See B-247563.3, Apr. 5, 1996; B-260369, 
June 15, 1995; 72 Comp. Gen. 49, 52 (1992); B-241856, Sept. 23, 1992, and 
decisions cited. These decisions reasoned that such liability, duly imposed 
by regulation, could be regarded as part of the employee’s “employment 
contract.” However, in B-280764, May 4, 2000, GAO reconsidered its 
position and held that accountable officer status and liability can only be 
created by statute. The 2000 decision overruled prior inconsistent 
decisions.11 

The decision in B-280764 concerned a Defense Department regulation that 
authorized the Department’s certifying officers to designate as 
“accountable officials” certain employees engaged in developing, verifying, 
approving, and processing salary payments. Specifically, the regulation 
defined “accountable officials” as “DOD military and civilian personnel, 
who are designated in writing and not otherwise accountable under 
applicable law, who provide source information, data or service . . . to a 
certifying or disbursing officer in support of the payment process.” Id. at 3. 
The regulation further provided that these employees would be pecuniarily 
liable for erroneous payments resulting from negligence in performing their 
duties. Id. 

In analyzing the validity of the regulation in B-280764, GAO invoked the 
“unassailable proposition” that the federal employment relationship is 

11 Among the prior inconsistent decisions specifically mentioned were 72 Comp. Gen. 49 
(1992) and B-241856, Sept. 23, 1992.

Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

primarily governed by statute rather than contract or common law 
concepts, and that this is equally true when it comes to disciplining or 
penalizing employees. Id. at 3. In this regard, the decision cited a number 
of judicial opinions, including Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367 (1983); United 
States v. Gilman, 347 U.S. 507 (1954); and United States v. Standard Oil 
Co., 332 U.S. 301 (1947). Applying these principles, GAO concluded that 
the Defense Department regulation could not stand since it lacked the 
necessary statutory authorization: 

“Here, as in the cases noted above, Congress has not spoken 
to the issue of the liability of government employees who 
provide information to certifying officers that they rely on 
when performing their statutory function. . . . Yet Congress 
has clearly legislated in detail on many features of the 
certifying and disbursing function as well as the 
government’s employer-employee relationship. With 
respect to the certifying and disbursing function, Congress 
has specifically provided for the personal pecuniary liability 
of certifying and disbursing officers, but, significantly, has 
not extended liability beyond these officers to those 
governmental employees whose work supports these 
functions. . . . Pecuniary liability for negligent conduct, 
administratively imposed, is no less a penalty than would be 
an employee’s judicially created obligation to indemnify the 
government for losses resulting from his negligent conduct. 
As noted above, the Supreme Court counseled in Gilman, 
Standard Oil Co. and Bush v. Lucas that these issues are 
for Congress to resolve. We think the same holds true for 
administrative extensions of personal liability beyond the 
existing statutory parameters.” 

B-280764, May 4, 2000, at 5–6 (footnotes omitted). 

In B-280764, GAO did not question the merits of extending accountability 
and potential pecuniary liability to more Defense Department employees, 
only the means of accomplishing that objective. In 2002, Congress added a 

Page 9-12 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


a. Certifying Officers 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

new section 2773a to title 10, United States Code, which supplied the 
Department with the requisite statutory authority to designate additional 
accountable officials.12 

Certifying officers play a significant role in the accountability for public 
funds. A certifying officer is a government officer or employee whose job 
is or includes certifying vouchers (including voucher schedules or invoices 
used as vouchers) for payment. B-280764, May 4, 2000. A certifying officer 
differs from other accountable officers in one key respect: the certifying 
officer has no public funds in his or her physical custody. Rather, 
accountability is statutorily prescribed because of the nature of the 
certifying function. A certifying officer’s liability, discussed in detail later in 
this chapter, is established by 31 U.S.C. § 3528. In brief, certifying officers 
are responsible for the legality of proposed payments and are liable for the 
amount of illegal or improper payments resulting from their certifications. 

Prior to enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186 (Feb. 10, 1996), the military 
departments were subject to a different system of accountability. The 
certifying officer provisions in section 3528 of title 31 of the United States 
Code did not apply to them. See 31 U.S.C. § 3528(d) (1994). Instead, the 
military departments operated under a system of subordinate and 
supervisory disbursing officers. Supervisory disbursing officers (often 
called “finance and accounting officers”) had responsibility and liability for 
the correctness of payments similar to that of a certifying officer in a 
civilian agency. See B-266001, May 1, 1996, for a general description of this 
system. Section 913 of Public Law 104-106 amended various provisions of 
titles 10, 31, and 37 of the United States Code to change the system of 
accountability of the military departments. Among other things, 
section 913 authorized the designation and appointment of certifying 
officers within the military departments. The purpose of this authorization 
was to strengthen internal controls within the military departments by 
providing a separation of duties between officials who authorized 
payments (certifying officers) and those who made payments (disbursing 
officers), thereby placing the military departments more in line with 
financial procedures in the civilian agencies. S. Rep. No. 104-112, at 279 
(1995). 

12 This provision was enacted by section 1005 of the Bob Stump National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, 116 Stat. 2458, 2631–32 (Dec. 2, 
2002). 

Page 9-13 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


b. Disbursing Officers 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

A great many government officials make official “certifications” of one type 
or another, but this does not make them certifying officers for purposes of 
accountability and liability. E.g., B-247563.4, Dec. 11, 1996 (voucher 
auditors who “certified” invoices for payment by accountable officers did 
not thereby become authorized certifying officers themselves). As 
discussed above, this status can only be conferred by statute. Thus, the 
concepts of accountability and relief discussed in this chapter apply only to 
“authorized certifying officers” who certify vouchers upon which moneys 
are to be paid out by disbursing officers in discharging a debt or obligation 
of the government. 23 Comp. Gen. 953 (1944). This may in appropriate 
circumstances include the head of a department or agency. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3325(a)(1); 21 Comp. Gen. 976, 979 (1942). An authorized certifying 
officer must be so designated in writing. 31 U.S.C. § 3325(a)(1); I TFM 
§ 4-1140 (Aug. 18, 1997). 

Thus, an employee who “certified” overtime assignments in the sense of a 
timekeeper verifying that employees worked the hours of overtime claimed 
could not be held liable for resulting overpayments under an accountable 
officer theory. B-197109, Mar. 24, 1980. The same approach applies to 
various post-certification administrative actions, the rule being that once a 
voucher has been duly certified by an authorized official, subsequent 
administrative processing does not constitute certification for purposes of 
31 U.S.C. § 3528. 55 Comp. Gen. 388, 390 (1975). For example, the 
Comptroller General has held that 31 U.S.C. § 3528 does not apply to an 
“approving officer” who approves vouchers after they have been duly 
certified. 21 Comp. Gen. 841 (1942). 

A disbursing officer is an officer or employee of a federal department or 
agency, civilian or military, designated to disburse moneys and render 
accounts in accordance with laws and regulations governing the 
disbursement of public funds. The term is essentially self-defining. As one 
court has stated: 

“We do not find the term ‘disbursing officer’ statutorily 
defined, probably because it is self-definitive. It can mean 
nothing except an officer who is authorized to disburse 
funds of the United States.” 

Romney v. United States, 167 F.2d 521, 526 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 
334 U.S. 847 (1948).

c. Cashiers 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Whether an employee is a disbursing officer depends more on the nature of 
the person’s duties than on the title of his or her position. In some cases, 
the job title will be “disbursing officer.” This is the title for the disbursing 
officers of the Treasury Department who disburse funds for most civilian 
agencies under 31 U.S.C. § 3321. For the military departments, which 
generally do their own disbursing, the title may be “finance and accounting 
officer.” As a general proposition, any employee to whom public funds are 
entrusted for the purpose of making payments from those funds will be 
regarded as a disbursing officer. See B-151156, Dec. 30, 1963. 

There may be more than one disbursing officer for a given transaction. 
Military disbursing operations, at least as they existed prior to enactment 
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996,13 provide an 
example. The account was often held in the name of a supervisory official 
such as a Finance and Accounting Officer, with the actual payment made 
by some subordinate (agent, cashier, deputy, etc.). Both were regarded as 
disbursing officers for purposes of liability and relief although, as we will 
discuss later, the standards for relief differ. E.g., B-261312, Feb. 5, 1995; 
62 Comp. Gen. 476, 479–80 (1983); B-248532, Oct. 26, 1992; B-245127, 
Sept. 18, 1991; B-240280, May 22, 1991. The principle of joint liability in the 
case of multiple disbursing officers applies outside the military 
departments as well. See B-288163, June 4, 2002 (clerk and deputy clerk of 
a bankruptcy court). 

A cashier is a federal officer or employee who has been designated as a 
cashier by an official delegated authority to make such designations and 
who is thereby authorized to perform limited cash disbursing functions or 
other cash operations. Department of the Treasury Financial Management 
Service, Manual of Procedures and Instructions for Cashiers (hereafter 
Cashier’s Manual), § IV (April 2001), at 4. Cashiers are designated in 
writing. Id. § III, at 3 (cashier is appointed by completing a specified form). 

13 Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186 (Feb. 10, 1996); see discussion of this statute in 
section B.2.a of this chapter.

d. Collecting Officers 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Cashiers who are authorized to make payments from funds advanced to 
them are regarded as a category of disbursing officer. They deal primarily 
with petty cash funds known as “imprest funds.”14 Cashiers outside the 
military departments exercise disbursing functions pursuant to a 
delegation of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3321(b). Cashier’s Manual, § II, at 2. With respect to disbursing 
functions under 31 U.S.C. § 3321, cashiers are divided into five categories: 

(1) Class A Cashier (may not advance imprest funds to another cashier 
except to an alternate); (2) Class B Cashier (may advance imprest funds to 
alternate or subcashier); (3) Class D Cashier (receives funds solely for 
change-making purposes); (4) Subcashier (may receive imprest funds from 
a Class B or D cashier); and (5) Alternate to a Cashier or Subcashier 
(functions during short absences of the cashier but may act simultaneously 
if required by workload). Cashier’s Manual, § IV, at 4; § V, at 12–13; App. 1, 
at 16–17. 
Cashiers are personally liable for any loss or shortage of funds in their 
custody unless relieved by proper authority. Like other accountable 
officers, they are regarded as “insurers” and are subject to strict liability. 
B-258357, Jan. 3, 1996. Further discussion of the role and responsibilities of 
cashiers may be found in sections IV and V of the Cashier’s Manual. 

For the most part, a cashier will be operating with funds advanced by his or 
her own employing agency. In some situations, however, such as an 
authorized interagency agreement, the funds may be advanced by another 
agency. Liability and relief are the same in either case. 65 Comp. Gen. 666, 
675–77 (1986). 

Collecting officers are those who receive or collect money for the 
government, such as Internal Revenue collectors or Customs collectors. 
Collecting officers are accountable for all money collected. E.g., 59 Comp. 
Gen. 113, 114 (1979); 3 Comp. Gen. 403 (1924); 1 Comp. Dec. 191 (1895); 
B-201673 et al., Sept. 23, 1982. For example, an Internal Revenue collector 
is responsible for the physical safety of taxes collected, must pay over to 
the government all taxes collected, and must make good any money lost or 
stolen while in his or her custody unless relieved. E.g., 60 Comp. Gen. 674 
(1981). However, under a lockbox arrangement whereby tax payments are 
mailed to a financial institution at a post office box and then wired to a 
Treasury account, Internal Revenue Service officials are not accountable

for funds in the possession of the financial institution since they do not gain 
custody or control over those funds. B-223911, Feb. 24, 1987. 

The clerk of a bankruptcy court, if one has been appointed under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 156(b), is the accountable officer with respect to fees paid to the court, as 
prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 1930, by parties commencing a case under the 
Bankruptcy Code. 28 U.S.C. § 156(f). This provision, added in 1986, 
essentially codified the result of two GAO decisions issued the previous 
year, 64 Comp. Gen. 535 (1985) and B-217236, May 22, 1985. See also 
B-288163, June 4, 2002, for a more recent decision following the same 
approach. 

In some situations, certain types of receipts may be collected by a 
contractor. Since the contractor is not a government officer or employee, 
the various accountable officer statutes discussed throughout this chapter 
do not apply, and the contractor’s liability is governed by the terms of the 
contract. For example, a parking service contract with the General 
Services Administration required the contractor to collect parking fees at 
certain government buildings and to remit those fees to GSA on a daily 
basis. One day, instead of remitting the receipts, an official of the 
contractor took the money home in a paper bag and claimed to have been 
robbed in a parking lot near her residence. When GSA withheld the amount 
of the loss from contract payments, the contractor tried to argue that the 
risk of loss should fall upon the government. The Claims Court disagreed. 
Since the contract terms were clear and the contractor failed to comply, the 
contractor was held responsible for the loss. Miracle Contractors, Inc. v. 
United States, 5 Cl. Ct. 466 (1984). 

The Department of Agriculture has statutory authority to use volunteers to 
collect user fees in national forests. The volunteers, private individuals, are 
to be bonded, with the cost of the bonds paid by the Department. 16 U.S.C. 
§ 460l-6a(k). In 68 Comp. Gen. 470 (1989), GAO concurred with the 
Department that the volunteers could be regarded as agents of the Forest 
Service and, as such, eligible for relief for non-negligent losses. The 
practical significance of this decision is that it would be difficult to recruit 
volunteers if they faced potential liability for non-negligent losses, a 
possibility that would exist even under a surety bond. Id. at 471. 

Officers and employees who do not fit into any of the preceding categories, 
and who may not even be directly involved in government fiscal operations, 
are occasionally given custody of federal funds and thereby become 
accountable officers for the funds placed in their charge. Note in this

connection that the “safekeeping” mandate of 31 U.S.C. § 3302(a) (made 
unmistakably clear by reference to the original 1846 language quoted in 
section B.1.a of this chapter) applies to any government employee, 
regardless of job description, to whom public funds are entrusted in 
connection with the performance of government business. See, e.g., 

B-170012, Feb. 3, 1972. 

Examples of employees in this general custodial category include: a 
messenger sent to the bank to cash checks, B-226695, May 26, 1987; a 
Department of Energy special counsel with control over petroleum 
overcharge refunds, B-200170, Apr. 1, 1981; State Department employees 
responsible for packaging and shipping funds to an overseas embassy, 
B-193830, Oct. 1, 1979; a special messenger delivering cash to another 
location, B-188413, June 30, 1977; and an officer in charge of a laundry 
operation on an Army base who had been advanced public funds to be held 
as a change fund, B-155149, Oct. 21, 1964. 

As with disbursing officers, there may be more than one accountable 
officer in a given case, and the concept of accountability is not limited to 
the person in whose name the account is officially held nor is it limited to 
the person or persons for whom relief is officially requested. For example, 
accounts in the regional offices of the U.S. Customs Service are typically 
held in the name of the Regional Commissioner. While the Regional 
Commissioner is therefore an accountable officer with respect to that 
account, subordinate employees who actually handle the funds are also 
accountable officers. B-197324, Mar. 7, 1980; B-193673, May 25, 1979. The 
same principle applies to the various service centers of the Internal 
Revenue Service. E.g., 60 Comp. Gen. 674 (1981). 

As demonstrated by the Customs and Internal Revenue Service situations, 
as well as the many cases involving military finance and accounting 
officers, a supervisory official will be an accountable officer if that official 
has actual custody of public funds, or if the account is held in the official’s 
name, regardless of who has physical custody. B-271017, Aug. 12, 1996. 
Absent these factors, however, a supervisor is not an accountable officer 

Page 9-18 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

and does not become one merely because he or she supervises one. E.g., 
B-266245, Oct. 24, 1996; 72 Comp. Gen. 49, 51–52 (1992); B-214286, July 20, 
1984; B-194782, Aug. 13, 1979.15 

In each case, it is necessary to examine the particular facts and 
circumstances to determine who had responsibility for or custody of the 
funds during the relevant stages of the occurrence or transaction. In 
B-193830, Oct. 1, 1979, money shipped from the State Department to the 
American Embassy in Paraguay never reached its destination. While the 
funds were chargeable to the account of the Class B cashier at the 
Embassy, the State Department employees responsible for packaging and 
shipping the funds were also accountable officers with respect to that 
transaction. In another case, a new Class B cashier had been 
recommended at a Peace Corps office in Western Samoa, and had in fact 
been doing the job, but his official designation was not made until after the 
loss in question. Since the new cashier, even though not yet formally 
designated, had possession of the funds at the time of the loss, he was an 
accountable officer. However, since the former cashier retained 
responsibility for the imprest fund until formally replaced, he too was an 
accountable officer. B-188881, May 8, 1978. 

In sum, any government officer or employee who physically handles 
government funds, even if only occasionally, is accountable for those funds 
while in his or her custody. 

It may be impossible, in rare cases, to specify exactly who the proper 
accountable officer is. For example, the Drug Enforcement Administration 
used a flash roll of 650 $100 bills and discovered that 15 bills had been 
replaced by counterfeits scattered throughout the roll. (The “roll” was 
actually a number of stacks.) The roll had been used in a number of 
investigations and in each instance, the transactions (transfers from 
cashier to investigators, returns to cashier, transfers between different 
groups of investigators) were recorded on receipts and the money was 
counted. While it was thus possible to determine precisely who had the roll 
on any given day, there was no way to determine when the substitution 
took place and hence to establish to whom the loss should be attributed. 
B-191891, June 16, 1980. See also B-288284.2, Mar. 7, 2003 (“The lack of a 

15 Note that, in light of B-280764, May 4, 2000, discussed previously, 72 Comp. Gen. 49 and 
B-266245 are no longer controlling to the extent they suggest that an agency can impose 
liability on supervisors solely by regulation, without specific statutory authority.

paper trail makes assignment of responsibility for the improper payment 
impossible. In situations like this, where there is no basis for attributing a 
loss or improper payment to one particular individual, we have determined 
that no one can be held liable.”); B-235368, Apr. 19, 1991 (“[F]ailure to 
follow . . . procedures for transferring the fund to the alternate cashier 
makes assignment of responsibility for the loss impossible; there is no 
audit trail permitting placement of accountability, and no individual had 
exclusive control over the fund.”). 

3. Funds to Which 
Accountability Attaches 
When we talk about the liability of accountable officers, we deliberately 
use the broad term “public funds.” As a general proposition, for purposes 
of accountability, “public funds” consist of three categories: appropriated 
funds, funds received by the government from nongovernmental sources, 
and funds held in trust. It is important to emphasize that when we refer to 
certain funds as “nonaccountable” in the course of this discussion, all we 
mean is that the funds are not subject to the laws governing the liability and 
relief of accountable officers. Liability for losses may still attach on some 
other basis. 
a. Appropriated Funds Appropriated funds are accountable funds. The funds may be in the 
Treasury, which is where most appropriated funds remain pending 
disbursement, or they may be in the form of cash advanced to a 
government officer or employee for some authorized purpose. 
(1) Imprest funds 
As noted previously, the definitions of the various types of cashier refer 
primarily to the use of “imprest funds.” An imprest fund is essentially a 
petty cash fund. More specifically, it is a fixed-cash fund (i.e., a fixed dollar 
amount) advanced to a cashier for cash disbursements or other cash 
requirement purposes as specifically authorized. An imprest fund may be 
either a stationary fund, such as a change-making fund, or a revolving fund. 
Department of the Treasury Financial Management Service, Manual of 
Procedures and Instructions for Cashiers (hereafter Cashier’s Manual), 
App. 1 (April 2001), at 17 (definition of “imprest fund”). 

Page 9-20 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Historically, imprest funds were commonly used for such things as small 
purchases, travel advances, and authorized emergency salary payments. 
On November 9, 1999, however, the Treasury Department’s Financial 
Management Service issued a policy directive that required federal 
agencies to eliminate imprest funds by October 1, 2001, except for certain 
waived payments.16 According to the directive’s preamble, the main 
impetus for eliminating imprest funds was the strong preference for 
making payments by electronic funds transfer (EFT). Specifically, the 
National Performance Review had issued a report recommending the 
elimination of imprest funds in favor of using EFT transactions.17 
Furthermore, the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 generally 
mandated the use of EFT payments as of January 1, 1999, subject to waiver 
by the Secretary of the Treasury under certain circumstances.18 

Under the Treasury policy directive, two conditions must be met in order 
for imprest funds to be used after October 1, 2001. First, the use of funds 
must qualify for waiver of the statutory prohibition against non-EFT 
payments under standards prescribed in 31 C.F.R. § 208.4. Second, the 
payment must meet additional standards for waiver specified in the policy 
directive. Given the waiver authorities, imprest funds have not been 
completely eliminated. Thus, the discussion that follows retains some 
relevance. 

Current guidance on the use of imprest funds is contained primarily in the 
Cashier’s Manual and in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 
48 C.F.R. §§ 13.305-1–13.305-4. Agencies using imprest funds are required 
to issue their own implementing regulations as well. FAR, 48 C.F.R. 
§ 13.305-2(c). Except to the extent specified in an agency’s own regulations 
(e.g., B-220466 et al., Dec. 9, 1986), there are no special subject matter 
limitations on the kinds of services payable from imprest funds. 65 Comp. 
Gen. 806 (1986); B-242412, July 22, 1991. Of course, like any other 
appropriated funds, imprest funds may not be used for a purpose that is not

authorized under the applicable appropriation. B-243411, July 30, 1991 
(imprest fund not available for purchase of electric shoe polisher). 

Imprest funds of the revolving type are replenished to the fixed amount as 
spent or used. As replenishments are needed, replenishment vouchers are 
submitted through the certifying officer to the disbursing officer. 
Replenishment vouchers must be supported by receipts or other evidence 
of the expenditures. 

At any given time, an imprest fund may consist of cash, uncashed 
government checks, and other documents such as unpaid reimbursement 
vouchers, sales slips, invoices, or other receipts for cash payments. An 
imprest fund cashier must at all times be able to account for the full 
amount of the fund. Cashier’s Manual, § IV at 8. For example, if a cash 
box containing a $1,000 imprest fund disappears, and at the time of 
disappearance the box contained $500 in cash and $500 in receipts for 
which reimbursement vouchers had not yet been issued, the loss to the 
government is the full $1,000 and the cashier is accountable for that full 
amount. A cashier’s failure to keep adequate records, thus making proper 
reconciliation impossible, is negligence. B-189084, Jan. 15, 1980. 

Loss of a replenishment check before it reaches the cashier is not a 
situation requiring relief of the cashier. The proper procedure in such a 
situation is to report the loss to the disbursing office that issued the check 
to obtain a replacement. B-203025, Oct. 30, 1981. 

If it is in the government’s interests, a checking account may be set up in a 
private bank for imprest fund disbursements as long as adequate control 
procedures are developed. B-117566, Apr. 29, 1959. Use of depositary 
accounts must be approved by the agency head or designee and is 
authorized only for cash withdrawal transactions. Cashier’s Manual, § IV 
at 10–11. The account may be interest-bearing, in which event any interest 
earned must be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Id. 
at 11. 

The method of imprest fund accountability changed starting with fiscal 
year 1985. Prior to that time, funds advanced to cashiers by Treasury 
disbursing officers were not “charged” to the agency’s appropriations at the 
time of the advance but were carried on the disbursing officers’ records of 
accountability. The cashiers were regarded as agents of the disbursing 
officers. In fact, it was common to refer to cashiers as “agent cashiers.” 
E.g., A-89775, Mar. 21, 1945. Charges were made to the applicable 

Page 9-22 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

appropriation or fund accounts only when replenishment checks were 
issued. Relief requests had to be submitted through the Treasury’s Chief 
Disbursing Officer. 

In 1983, the Treasury Department proposed removing imprest fund 
advances from the disbursing officers’ accountability inasmuch as the 
transactions were beyond the disbursing officers’ control. GAO concurred. 
B-212819-O.M., May 25, 1984. The current procedures are discussed in 
70 Comp. Gen. 481 (1991). In brief, the charge to the agency’s 
appropriation is now made at the time of the initial advance. However, 
since the advance does not qualify as an obligation under 31 U.S.C. § 1501, 
the charge must be in the form of a “commitment” or “reservation.” In 
general, the actual obligation occurs when the advance is used and the 
cashier seeks replenishment. The preliminary charge is necessary to 
protect against violating the Antideficiency Act. Except for certain 
procedural matters (relief requests are no longer processed through the 
applicable disbursing officer), the changes have no effect on the cashier’s 
liability as an accountable officer. 

An alternative approach to managing imprest funds is the “third-party 
draft” procedure described in I TFM § 4-3000 (Aug. 3, 2000). In brief, an 
agency may retain a contractor to provide the agency with payment 
instruments, not to exceed certain amounts, drawn on the contractor’s 
account. The face value of an individual third-party draft generally may not 
exceed $10,000, and third-party drafts for routine imprest payments are 
limited to $2,500. Id. § 4-3020.10. The agency then uses these drafts for its 
imprest fund transactions and reimburses the contractor for properly 
payable drafts that the contractor has paid. Since the funds being 
disbursed from the imprest fund under the third-party draft system are not 
government funds, personal liability does not attach to the cashier who 
issues the draft. Id. § 4-3020; GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for 
Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 6.8.B (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 
1993); B-247563.4, Dec. 11, 1996; B-247563.3, Apr. 5, 1996. However, this 
obviously does not mean that third-party drafts can or should be used to 
circumvent restrictions on the use of appropriated funds. 

(2) Flash rolls 
Law enforcement officers on undercover assignments frequently need a 
supply of cash to support their operations, for example, to purchase 
contraband or to use as a gambling stake. This money, often advanced 

Page 9-23 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

from an imprest fund, is called a “flash roll.” By the very nature of the 
activities involved, flash roll money is at high risk to begin with. 

It is clear that a flash roll in the hands of a law enforcement agent retains 
its status as government funds. Garcia v. United States, 469 U.S. 70 (1984) 
(flash roll held to be money of the United States for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2114, which makes it a criminal offense to assault a custodian of 
government money). However, flash roll money will be accountable in 
some situations and nonaccountable in others, depending on the nature of 
the loss. If the loss is within the risk inherent in the operation, such as the 
suspect absconding with the money, it is not viewed as an “accountable 
officer” loss but may be handled internally by the agency. If the agency, 
under its internal investigation procedures, finds the agent with custody of 
the funds to have been negligent, it should hold the agent liable to the 
extent provided in its regulations. Otherwise, it may simply record the loss 
as a necessary expense against the appropriation which financed the 
operation. If, on the other hand, the loss occurs in the course of the 
operation but is unrelated to carrying out its purpose, the accountable 
officer laws apply. The decision first recognizing this distinction is 
61 Comp. Gen. 313 (1982), applying it in the context of Drug Enforcement 
Administration undercover operations.19 

The fact pattern in the Garcia case illustrates the nonaccountable 
situation. A Secret Service agent had been given a flash roll to buy 
counterfeit currency from suspects in Miami. The agent met the suspects 
in a park. One of the suspects pulled a semi-automatic pistol and 
demanded the money. Other Secret Service agents rushed to the scene and 
apprehended the suspects, one of whom was trying to run off with the 
money. Of course there was no loss since the money was recovered. If the 
second suspect had gotten away with the money, however, the loss could 
have been treated as an expense of the operation, without the need to seek 
relief for anyone. GAO decisions finding flash roll losses “nonaccountable” 
under the standards of 61 Comp. Gen. 313 are B-238222, Feb. 21, 1990 
(suspect stole flash roll during drug arrest); B-232253, Aug. 12, 1988 
(informant stole money provided to rent undercover apartment); and 
B-205426, Sept. 16, 1982 (federal agent robbed at gunpoint while trying to 
purchase illegal firearms). 

19 Prior decisions, such as B-192010, Aug. 14, 1978, which had treated all flash roll losses as 
accountable officer losses, were modified accordingly. 61 Comp. Gen. at 316. 

Page 9-24 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

An example of a case which remains subject to the accountable officer 
laws is B-218858, July 24, 1985. A federal agent, posing as a narcotics 
trafficker, stopped at a telephone booth to make a call. Two women 
approached the booth, which did not have a door. One diverted the agent’s 
attention while the other picked his pocket. The loss, while certainly 
incident to the undercover operation, was unrelated to its central purpose. 
Relief was granted. Other cases are: 

• Agent set shoulder bag containing flash money on airport counter and 
left it unattended for several minutes while making ticket 
arrangements; relief denied. 64 Comp. Gen. 140 (1984). 
• Briefcase containing funds stolen when agent set it down in coffee shop 
for 15–20 seconds to remove jacket; relief granted. B-210507, Apr. 4, 
1983. 
• Agent left funds in glove compartment while making phone call in high 
crime area; agent found negligent. B-220492, Dec. 10, 1985. 
As 64 Comp. Gen. 140 and B-210507 point out, losses which occur while 
flash money is being transported to the location where it is intended to be 
used are at best incidental to the operation and are thus governed by the 
accountable officer laws. 

The conspicuous display of a flash roll is not in and of itself negligence 
where necessary to the agent’s undercover role. B-194919, Nov. 26, 1980. 

(3) Travel advances 
Travel advances are authorized by 5 U.S.C. § 5705. The statute expressly 
directs the recovery, from the traveler or from his or her estate, of advances 
not used for allowable travel expenses. Like imprest funds, travel advances 
can still be used but their use is now the exception rather than the common 
practice. Section 2 of the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998, 
Pub. L. No. 105-264, 112 Stat. 2350 (Oct. 19, 1998), 5 U.S.C. § 5701 note, 
generally mandates the use of government contractor-issued travel charge 
cards for payment of official government travel. Under the General 
Services Administration regulations implementing this statute, travel 
advances are authorized only if an exemption from use of a travel charge 
card has been granted. 41 C.F.R. §§ 301-51.1, 301-51.5. 

Page 9-25 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

A travel advance is “based upon the employee’s prospective entitlement to 
reimbursement” (B-178595, June 27, 1973) and is essentially for the 
convenience of the traveler. Travel advances in the hands of the traveler 
are regarded as nonaccountable and hence not governed by the 
accountable officer laws. Rather, they are treated as loans for the personal 
benefit of the traveler. As such, if the funds are lost or stolen while in the 
traveler’s custody, regardless of the presence or absence of fault 
attributable to the traveler, the funds must be recovered as provided by 
5 U.S.C. § 5705, and the accountable officer relief statutes do not apply. 

54 Comp. Gen. 190 (1974); B-206245, Apr. 26, 1982; B-183489, June 30, 1975; 
B-254089, Sept. 10, 1993 (nondecision letter). The same principle applies to 
traveler’s checks. 64 Comp. Gen. 456, 460 (1985). 

In many cases, a messenger or some other clerical employee picks up the 
funds for the traveler. If the funds are lost or stolen while in the 
intermediary’s custody, and use of the intermediary was the traveler’s 
choice, the intermediary is the agent of the traveler and the traveler, having 
constructively received the funds, remains liable. B-204387, Feb. 24, 1982; 
B-200867, Mar. 30, 1981. However, if use of the intermediary is required by 
agency or local policy, then the intermediary is the agent of the government 
and the traveler is not liable. 67 Comp. Gen. 402 (1988). 

Even though the accountable officer relief statutes do not apply, it may be 
possible to effectively “relieve” the non-negligent traveler by considering a 
claim under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees’ Claims Act of 
1964, 31 U.S.C. § 3721, to the extent permissible under the agency’s 
implementing regulations. B-208639, Oct. 5, 1982; B-197927, Sept. 12, 1980. 

Travel advances returned to government custody for reasons such as 
postponement of the travel regain their status as accountable funds, and an 
employee receiving custody of these funds is governed by the laws relating 
to the liability and relief of accountable officers. B-200404, Feb. 12, 1981; 
B-170012, Mar. 14, 1972; B-170012, May 3, 1971. Also, where an advance 
greatly exceeds the employee’s legitimate travel expense needs and it is 
clear that the excess is intended to be used for operational purposes, the 
excess over reasonable needs may be treated as accountable funds and not 
part of the “loan.” B-196804, July 1, 1980. 

b. Receipts In our definitions of governmental receipts and offsetting collections in 
Chapter 2, we noted that the government receives funds from 
nongovernment sources (a) from the exercise of its sovereign powers (e.g., 
tax collections, customs duties, court fines), and (b) from a variety of 
Page 9-26 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


c. Funds Held in Trust 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

business-type activities (e.g., sale of publications). These collections, 
whether they are to be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts 
or credited to some agency appropriation or fund, are accountable funds 
from the moment of receipt. Some examples are: B-288163, June 4, 2002, 
and 64 Comp. Gen. 535 (1985) (both cases involved registry funds and fees 
paid to bankruptcy court); 60 Comp. Gen. 674 (1981) (tax collections); 
B-200170, Apr. 1, 1981 (petroleum overcharge refunds); and B-194782, 
Aug. 25, 1980 (recreational fee collections). 

When the government holds private funds in a trust capacity, it is obligated, 
by virtue of its fiduciary duty, to pay over those funds to the rightful owners 
at the proper time. Thus, although the funds are not appropriated funds, 
they are nevertheless accountable funds. The principle has been stated as 
follows: 

“[T]he same relationship between an accountable officer 
and the United States is required with respect to trust funds 
of a private character obtained and held for some particular 
purpose sanctioned by law as is required with respect to 
public funds.” 

6 Comp. Gen. 515, 517 (1927). See also Woog v. United States, 48 Ct. Cl. 80 
(1913). 

A common example is the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) “Personal 
Funds of Patients” (PFOP) account. Patients, upon admission to a VA 
hospital, may deposit personal funds in this account for safekeeping and 
use as needed. Upon release, the balance is returned to the patient. Patient 
funds in the PFOP account have been consistently treated as accountable 
funds. 68 Comp. Gen. 600 (1989); 68 Comp. Gen. 371 (1989); B-226911, 
Oct. 19, 1987; B-221447, Apr. 2, 1986; B-215477, Nov. 5, 1984; B-208888, 
Sept. 28, 1984. 

Another example is private funds of litigants deposited in a registry 
account of a court of the United States, to be held pending distribution by 
order of the court in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §§ 2041 and 2042. These 
are also accountable funds under the trust capacity concept. B-288163, 
June 4, 2002; 64 Comp. Gen. 535 (1985); 6 Comp. Gen. 515 (1927); B-200108, 
B-198558, Jan. 23, 1981. See also Osborn v. United States, 91 U.S. 474 
(1875) (court can summarily compel restitution of funds improperly 
withdrawn from registry account by former officers).

d. Items Which Are the 
Equivalent of Cash 
Other situations applying the trust capacity concept are B-288284.2, Mar. 7, 
2003, and B-288284, May 29, 2002 (embassy employees’ funds held on their 
behalf in a Suspense Deposit Abroad account administered by the State 
Department); B-238955, Apr. 3, 1991 (Overseas Consular Service fund from 
which embassy consular officers authorize payment for funerals and other 
expenses); 67 Comp. Gen. 342 (1988) (Indian trust accounts administered 
by Bureau of Indian Affairs); 17 Comp. Gen. 786 (1938) (United States 
Naval Academy laundry fund); B-190205, Nov. 14, 1977 (foreign currencies 
accepted in connection with accommodation exchanges authorized by 
31 U.S.C. § 3342); and A-22805, Nov. 30, 1929 (funds taken from prisoners at 
the time of their confinement, to be held in their behalf). See also 
B-239955, June 18, 1991 (Treasury Department personnel are held 
accountable for loss of damaged currency held in Treasury mailroom 
pending replacement); 69 Comp. Gen. 314 (1990) (BIA may contract with 
private bank for ministerial aspects of trust fund disbursements, but 
government disbursing officer must retain responsibility for managerial 
and judgmental aspects). 

Not all nongovernment funds in the custody of a government official are 
held in a trust capacity. For example, in B-164419-O.M., May 20, 1969, GAO 
distinguished between funds of a foreign government held by the United 
States incident to a cooperative agreement (trust capacity funds), and 
funds of a private contractor held by a government official for safekeeping 
as a favor to the contractor. The latter situation was a mere bailment for 
the benefit of the contractor, and the official was not an accountable officer 
with respect to those funds. 

The concepts of accountability and liability discussed in this chapter apply 
primarily to money. However, for reasons which should be apparent, 
accountability also attaches to certain noncash items which are negotiable 
by the bearer or are otherwise the equivalent of cash. Examples are: 

• Food stamps. B-221580, Oct. 24, 1986 (nondecision letter). 
• Government Transportation Requests. B-239387, Apr. 24, 1991. 
• Military payment certificates. B-127937-O.M., Aug. 2, 1956. 
• Receipts signed by employees acknowledging that they were advanced 
funds to make small purchases. B-288014, May 17, 2002. 
Page 9-28 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

• Traveler’s checks in the custody of an accountable officer. 64 Comp. 
Gen. 456 (1985); B-235147.2, Aug. 14, 1991. 
• Treasury bonds with interest coupons attached. B-190506, Nov. 28, 
1977, aff’d on reconsideration, B-190506, Dec. 20, 1979. 
In the reconsideration of B-190506, Dec. 20, 1979, it was contended that 
loss of the bonds did not really result in a loss to the government because 
neither the bonds nor the coupons had been cashed and a “stop notice” had 
been placed with the Federal Reserve Bank. GAO could not agree, 
however, since the bonds were bearer bonds and the stop notice does not 
completely extinguish the government’s liability to pay on them. (The 
Treasury Department no longer issues coupon bonds, although many older 
ones are still outstanding.) 

4. What Kinds of Events 
Produce Liability? 
The generic term for losses which trigger an accountable officer’s liability 
is “fiscal irregularity.” See GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for 
Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 8.2 (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 
1993). Fiscal irregularities are divided into two broad categories: 

(1)physical loss or deficiency, and (2) illegal or improper payment. Since, 
as we will see, the relief statutes are expressly tied to these categories, the 
proper classification of a fiscal irregularity is the essential first step in 
determining which statute to apply. 
A working definition of “physical loss or deficiency” may be found in 

B-202074, July 21, 1983: 

“In sum, ‘physical loss or deficiency’ includes such things as 
loss by theft or burglary, loss in shipment, and loss or 
destruction by fire, accident, or natural disaster. It also 
includes the totally unexplained loss, that is, a shortage or 
deficiency with absolutely no evidence to explain the 
disappearance. . . . Finally, . . . losses resulting from fraud or 
embezzlement by subordinate finance personnel may . . . be 
treated as physical losses.” 

This definition has been repeated in several subsequent decisions such as 
70 Comp. Gen. 616, 621 (1991) and 65 Comp. Gen. 881, 883 (1986). A loss 
resulting from a bank failure would also be treated as a physical loss. See 

18 Comp. Gen. 639 (1939). 

Page 9-29 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

The second type of fiscal irregularity is the “illegal, improper, or incorrect 
payment.” 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527(c), 3528(a)(4). The key word here is 
“payment”—“the disbursement of public funds by a disbursing officer or 
his subordinate.” B-202074, July 21, 1983. Improper payments include such 
things as payments obtained by fraud, whether by nongovernment persons 
or by government employees other than subordinate finance personnel; 
erroneous payments or overpayments resulting from human or mechanical 
error attributable to the government; payments prohibited by statute; and 
disbursements for unauthorized purposes. The legislative history of 
31 U.S.C. § 3527(c), the improper payment relief statute for disbursing 
officers, describes an improper payment as a payment “which the 
Comptroller General finds is not in strict technical conformity” with the 
law. Excerpts from the pertinent committee reports are quoted in 
49 Comp. Gen. 38, 40 (1969) and in B-202074, cited above. 

A loss resulting from an uncollectible personal check may be an improper 
payment or a physical loss, depending on the circumstances. If the loss 
results from an authorized check-cashing transaction, it is an improper 
payment because government funds were disbursed to the bearer. 
70 Comp. Gen. 616 (1991). However, if the check is tendered to pay an 
obligation owed to the United States or to purchase something from the 
government, the loss, to the extent an accountable loss exists, would be a 
physical loss. In this connection, Treasury regulations provide: 

“Government officers accept checks received subject to 
collection. If a check cannot be collected in full or is lost or 
destroyed before collection, the agency making the deposit 
must obtain the proper payment. Payment by check is not 
effective until the full proceeds are received.” 

I TFM § 5-2010 (Oct. 4, 2001). If a personal check is accepted subject to 
collection, and if the government does not exchange value for the check, 
any resulting loss is not a loss within the scope of the accountable officer 
laws and may be adjusted administratively by the agency. If, however, an 
accountable officer purports to accept a personal check in satisfaction of 
an obligation due the United States (rather than for collection only), or if 
the government parts with something of value in exchange for the check 
(e.g., sale of government property), a resulting loss is treated as a physical 
loss. B-201673 et al., Sept. 23, 1982. See also 3 Comp. Gen. 403 (1924); 
A-44019, Mar. 15, 1934; A-24693, Oct. 30, 1929. The distinction is 
summarized in the following passage from B-201673: 

Page 9-30 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

“If a check tendered in payment of a fine, duty, or penalty 
becomes uncollectible, it may be argued that the 
Government incurs a loss in the sense that it does not have 
money to which it was legally entitled, but it has not lost 
anything that it already had. When the check is in exchange 
for property, the Government has lost the property, the 
value of which is measured by the agreed-upon sales price. 
Of course, recovery of the property will remove or mitigate 
the loss.” 

The concept of B-201673 has also been applied to a check seized as 
forfeiture under 31 U.S.C. §§ 5316 and 5317(b), and subsequently returned 
as uncollectible. B-208398, Sept. 29, 1983. 

A conceptually similar case is B-216279, Oct. 9, 1984. A teller at a Customs 
Service auction gave a receipt to a customer and negligently failed to 
collect the tendered funds. It was suggested that there was no loss because 
the teller never had physical possession of the funds. However, the 
applicable relief statute (31 U.S.C. § 3527) uses the terms “physical loss or 
deficiency” in the disjunctive, and there was clearly a deficiency in the 
teller’s account to the extent of the property turned over in exchange for 
the lost payment. 

While every fiscal irregularity by definition involves a loss or deficiency for 
which someone is accountable, not every loss or deficiency is a fiscal 
irregularity which triggers accountability. For example, an accountable 
officer is not liable for interest lost on collections which should have been 
deposited promptly but were not. 64 Comp. Gen. 303 (1985) (failure to 
deposit collections in designated depositary); B-190290, Nov. 28, 1977 
(increased interest charges on funds borrowed from Treasury, no net loss 
to United States). 

Also, losses resulting from the imperfect exercise of judgment in routine 
business operations, where no law has been violated, do not create 
accountable officer liability. 65 Comp. Gen. 881 (1986) (loss to Internal 
Revenue Service Tax Lien Revolving Fund caused by sale of property for 
substantially less than amount for which it had been redeemed). 

5. Amount of Liability As a general proposition, the amount for which an accountable officer is 
liable is easy to determine: It is the amount of the physical loss or improper 
payment, reduced by any amounts recovered from the recipient (thief, 
Page 9-31 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

improper payee, etc.). E.g., 65 Comp. Gen. 858 (1986); B-194727, Oct. 30, 
1979. 

There is an exception, discussed in 65 Comp. Gen. at 863–64, in which 
amounts recovered from the recipient should not be used to reduce the 
amount of the accountable officer’s liability. A loss may result from a series 
of transactions spanning several years, each transaction giving rise to a 
separate debt. By the time the loss is discovered, recovery from the 
accountable officer may be partially barred by the 3-year statute of 
limitations found in 31 U.S.C. § 3526(c). This, however, does not affect the 
indebtedness of the recipient which, in this situation, will exceed the 
liability of the accountable officer. Under the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards,20 a debtor owing multiple debts may specify the allocation of a 
voluntary partial payment. If the recipient/debtor fails to so specify, or if 
payment is involuntary, the collecting agency may allocate the money 
among the various debts in accordance with the best interests of the United 
States. 31 C.F.R. § 901.3(c)(4). Generally, “the best interests of the United 
States are clearly served by applying payments made by the recipients to 
the class of debt for which only the recipients are liable” (65 Comp. Gen. 
at 864), that is, those for which recovery from the accountable officer is 
time-barred. Thus, in this type of situation, partial recoveries from the 
recipient should first be applied to the time-barred debt of the accountable 
officer until any such amounts have been recouped, and only thereafter 
used to reduce the accountable officer’s remaining liability. 

A judgment obtained against some third party (improper payee, thief, etc.) 
is only “potential unrealized value” and does not reduce the accountable 
officer’s liability until it is actually collected. B-147747, Dec. 28, 1961; 
B-194727, Oct. 30, 1979 (nondecision letter). 

The liability of an accountable officer does not include interest and 
penalties assessed against the recipient. 64 Comp. Gen. 303 (1985); 
B-235037, Sept. 18, 1989. 

The liability of an accountable officer resulting from the payment of 
fraudulent travel claims is the amount of the fraudulent payment and does 
not include nonfraudulent amounts paid for the same day(s). 70 Comp. 
Gen. 463 (1991). Previously GAO had included both, under the so-called 

20 Current Federal Claims Collection Standards, issued jointly by the Departments of Justice 
and Treasury, are in 31 C.F.R. parts 900–904 (2005). 

Page 9-32 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

“tainted day” rule.21 The 1991 decision distinguishes fraudulent payees 
from fraudulent claimants, concluding that the tainted day rule does not 
apply to paid claims. That decision was modified in 72 Comp. Gen. 154 
(1993) to make clear that rejected use of the tainted day rule was to be 
applied prospectively only from the date of the prior decision, May 6, 1991. 

When determining the amount of a loss for which an accountable officer is 
to be held liable, the government does not “net” overages against shortages. 
In GAO’s view, such “netting” would weaken internal controls over the 
accounting for cash balances. B-212370, Nov. 15, 1983; B-199447, Mar. 17, 
1981.22 As noted in B-199447, overages must generally be deposited in the 
Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. 

In almost all cases, the amount of an accountable officer’s liability is 
precisely determinable at the outset. It may be reduced by recoveries, but 
it will not increase. One exception is illustrated in B-239387, Apr. 24, 1991, 
in which an agency held an employee accountable for a booklet of missing 
or stolen Government Transportation Requests. Because the amount of the 
government’s loss could not be known until the GTRs were actually used 
and the government forced to honor them, additional liability accrued as 
each GTR was used over time. 

6. Effect of Criminal 
Prosecution 
As we noted previously, the body of law governing the liability and relief of 
accountable officers is designed not only to induce proper care but also to 
protect against dishonesty by the officers themselves. This section 
summarizes the relationship between criminal prosecution and civil 
liability. 
a. Acquittal Acquittal in a criminal proceeding does not extinguish civil liability and 
does not bar subsequent civil actions to enforce that liability as long as they 
are remedial rather than punitive. Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391 

21 Under the tainted day rule, a fraudulent claim for reimbursement for any part of a single 
day’s subsistence expenses “taints” the entire day’s claim with fraud and thus precludes 
reimbursement for nonfraudulent items as well. 70 Comp. Gen. at 465. This rule carries a 
punitive element that is appropriate for those who defraud the government but not for 
accountable officers who are victims of the fraud. See 72 Comp. Gen. 154, 156 (1993). 

22 A statutorily authorized instance of “netting” gains and deficiencies in an account is 
31 U.S.C. § 3342(c)(2) (certain check-cashing and exchange transactions), discussed later in 
this chapter in section D.4. 

Page 9-33 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

(1938). The reason is the difference in burden of proof. Acquittal means 
only that the government was unable to prove guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt, a standard higher than that for civil liability. “That acquittal on a 
criminal charge is not a bar to a civil action by the Government, remedial in 
its nature, arising out of the same facts on which the criminal proceeding 
was based has long been settled.” Id. at 397. See also B-239134, Apr. 22, 
1991 (nondecision letter) (conviction on only a portion of the loss). 

The rules are the same for acquittal (or reversal of a conviction) by a 
military court-martial. B-235048, Apr. 4, 1991. See also Serrano v. United 
States, 612 F.2d 525 (Ct. Cl. 1979) (acquittal held not to bar agency from 
imposing civil liability and withholding pay of accountable officer). 

It follows that an accountable officer’s civil liability will be unaffected by 
the fact that a grand jury has refused to return an indictment. B-186922, 
Apr. 8, 1977. 

b. Order of Restitution A court may order a defendant to make monetary restitution to the victim, 
either as part of the sentence (18 U.S.C. § 3556) or as a condition of 
probation (18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(2)). In either case, the relevant terms and 
procedures are governed by 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663 and 3664. Restitution may be 
ordered in a lump sum or in installments. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(f)(3). These are 
general criminal statutes and would apply fully where the defendant is an 
accountable officer and the United States is the victim as well as the 
prosecutor. 
The statutory scheme clearly recognizes the possibility of subsequent civil 
proceedings by the United States as victim against the accountable officer. 
Any amounts paid to a victim under a restitution order must be set off 
against amounts recovered in a subsequent civil action. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3664(j)(2). In such an action, the previously convicted defendant cannot 
deny the “essential allegations” of the offense. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(k)(1). 

Where restitution is ordered in full, payable in installments, it has been held 
that the victim may nevertheless obtain a civil judgment for the unpaid 
balance, even though there has been no default in the installment 
payments. Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association v. Green, 636 F. 
Supp. 415 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). “Future payments that do not fully compensate 
a victim in present value terms cannot be a bar to a civil judgment.” Id. 
at 418. See also B-128437-O.M., Aug. 3, 1956. 

Page 9-34 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Where restitution is ordered in an amount less than the full amount of the 
loss, civil liability for the balance would remain, subject to the statutory 
setoff requirement. See 64 Comp. Gen. 303 (1985), reaching this result 
under a prior version of the legislation. The decision further suggests that, 
if the record indicates that the court thought it was ordering restitution in 
full, it might be desirable to seek amendment of the restitution order. 
Obviously, the fact of conviction precludes any consideration of 
administrative relief. Id. at 304. 

The preceding paragraphs are presented from the perspective of restitution 
by the accountable officer. Similar principles would apply with respect to 
restitution by a responsible party other than the accountable officer. See, 
e.g., B-193673, May 25, 1979, modified on other grounds by B-201673 et al., 
Sept. 23, 1982 (partial restitution by thief reduces amount of accountable 
officer’s liability). See also B-270863, June 17, 1996. For example, where 
the Department of Justice enters into a settlement with a culpable third 
party compromising a claim of the government, the liability of the 
accountable officer is terminated for any amounts of the claim in excess of 
the settlement. See B-235048, Apr. 4, 1991. 

C. Physical Loss or 
Deficiency 
1. Statutory Provisions The two principal statutes authorizing administrative relief from liability 
for the physical loss or deficiency of public funds are 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527(a) 
and 3527(b). Subsection (a) applies to the civilian agencies and 
subsection (b) applies to accountable officers of the armed forces. 
a. Civilian Agencies The physical loss or deficiency relief statute applicable to accountable 
officers generally, 31 U.S.C. § 3527(a), was originally enacted in 1947. 
Pub. L. No. 321, ch. 441, 61 Stat. 720 (Aug. 1, 1947). Its justification, similar 
to that for all relief statutes, was summarized by the Senate Committee on 
Expenditures in the Executive Departments as follows: 
“The justification . . . is that, at the present time, relief of the 
kind with which this bill is concerned is required to be 
granted either through passage of a special relief bill by the 
Congress or by the filing of suit by the responsible person in 
Page 9-35 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

the United States Court of Claims, the latter to be done at 
the personal expense of the responsible person. Both 
methods are costly and time consuming.” 

S. Rep. No. 80-379, at 1 (1947). 

Before the actual relief mechanism is triggered, two threshold conditions 
must be satisfied. First, the loss must be a physical loss or deficiency and 
not an improper payment. 31 U.S.C. § 3527(a)(2). Second, the person for 
whom relief is desired must be an “accountable officer.”23 The legislative 
history confirms that this includes the general custodial category: 

“There are many agents of the Government who do not 
disburse but who, nevertheless, are fully responsible for 
funds . . . entrusted to their charge and, for that reason, the 
committee bill has been broadened to include that class of 
personnel.” 

S. Rep. No. 80-379, at 2. 
Once it has been determined that there has been a physical loss or 
deficiency of “public money, vouchers, checks, securities, or records” for 
which an accountable officer is liable, the statute authorizes the 
Comptroller General to grant relief from that liability if the head of the 
agency involved makes two administrative determinations (31 U.S.C. 
§ 3527(a)(1)), and if the Comptroller General agrees with those 
determinations (31 U.S.C. § 3527(a)(3)). E.g., B-288014, May 17, 2002. 

First, the agency head must determine that the accountable officer was 
carrying out official duties at the time of the loss, or that the loss was 
attributable to the act or omission of a subordinate of the accountable 
officer. B-241820, Jan. 2, 1991. Note that this is stated in the disjunctive. 
The second part, loss attributable to a subordinate, is designed to cover the 
situation, found in several agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service 
and the Customs Service, in which the account is in the name of a 
supervisory official who does not actually handle the funds. In this 

23 This statute will not apply to certifying officers since they do not have actual custody of 
funds. However, a certifying officer could conceivably have other duties or supervisory 
responsibilities and thus be accountable, and eligible for relief under 31 U.S.C. § 3527(a), in 
that capacity. 

Page 9-36 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

situation, both persons are accountable, and relief of one does not 
necessarily mean relief of the other. See B-270863, June 17, 1996; B-265853, 
Jan. 23, 1996. 

Second, the agency head must determine that the loss was not attributable 
to fault or negligence on the part of the accountable officer. This 
determination is necessary regardless of which part of the first 
determination applies. Thus, while lack of fault does not affect the 
automatic imposition of liability, it does provide the basis for relief. See, 
e.g., B-288166, Mar. 11, 2003; B-258357, Jan. 3, 1996. 

Generally, the requirement that the accountable officer must have been 
acting in the discharge of official duties does not present problems. Thus, 
in the typical case, the central question becomes whether GAO is able to 
concur with the administrative determination that the loss occurred 
without fault or negligence on the part of the accountable officer. In 
reviewing relief cases over the years, GAO has developed a number of 
standards, the application of which to a given case requires a careful 
analysis of the particular facts. Many factors may bear on the conclusion in 
any given case, and the result will be determined by the interrelationship of 
these factors. 

Section 3527(a) applies to accountable officers of “an agency,” defined in 
31 U.S.C. § 101 as any “department, agency, or instrumentality of the United 
States Government.” Thus, section 3527(a) has been construed as 
applicable to the judicial branch (B-200108, B-198558, Jan. 23, 1981; 
B-197021, May 9, 1980; B-191440, May 25, 1979; B-185486, Feb. 5, 1976), and 
to agencies of the legislative branch (B-192503-O.M., Jan. 8, 1979, denying 
relief to a GAO employee). GAO has not specifically considered whether it 
applies to the Senate or House of Representatives. Section 3527(a) has also 
been construed as applicable to those government corporations which are 
subject to GAO’s accounts settlement authority. B-88578, Aug. 21, 1951; 
B-88578-O.M., Aug. 21, 1951.

b. Military Disbursing Officers The need for physical loss relief authority for military disbursing officers 
became highlighted during World War I when several ships were sunk with 
funds and records on board. The first permanent administrative relief 
statute was enacted in 1919 and applied only to the Navy.24 The Army 
received similar statutory authority in 1944.25 The two were combined in 
1955 and expanded to cover all of the military departments.26 The 
legislation was later codified at 31 U.S.C. § 3527(b). The origins of the 1919 
law are described in 7 Comp. Gen. 374, 377–78 (1927); the statutory 
evolution is detailed in B-202074, July 21, 1983. The statute applies to both 
civilian and military personnel of the various military departments. 
B-151156, Dec. 30, 1963. As discussed later, section 3527(b) was further 
amended in 1996 to expand the coverage of the section to all military 
accountable officials and to include erroneous payments. However, since 
the requirements and procedures regarding physical loss or deficiency 
were not altered, we retain the discussion of the earlier version of 
section 3527(b) to give context to our decisions predating the 1996 
amendments. 
As with section 3527(a), two threshold conditions had to be satisfied before 
the relief mechanism came into play. First, like section 3527(a), the pre1996 
section 3527(b) applied only to physical losses or deficiencies and not 
to improper payments. 31 U.S.C. § 3527(b)(1)(B); 7 Comp. Gen. 374 (1927); 
2 Comp. Gen. 277 (1922); B-202074, July 21, 1983. The statute was intended 
to authorize relief in appropriate cases for losses “such as losses by fire, 
ship sinkings, thefts or physical losses resulting from enemy action or 
otherwise.” B-75978, June 1, 1948. Thus, a loss in shipment was cognizable 
under section 3527(b). B-200437, Oct. 21, 1980. However, the making of a 
travel advance to an employee who terminated his employment without 
accounting for the advance was not a physical loss but rather “a payment 
voluntarily made by the disbursing officer in the course of his duties.” 

B-75978, June 1, 1948. 

Second—and here the two statutes differ—section 3527(b) applied only to 
disbursing officers and not to nondisbursing accountable officers. 

B-194782, Aug. 13, 1979; B-194780, Aug. 8, 1979; B-151156, Dec. 30, 1963; 
B-144467, Dec. 19, 1960 (“while all disbursing officers are accountable

Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

officers, all accountable officers are not disbursing officers”). As each of 
the cited cases points out, physical loss relief for nondisbursing 
accountable officers of the military departments had to be sought under 
31 U.S.C. § 3527(a). 

Section 3527(b) was also similar to section 3527(a) in that, once it had been 
determined that a loss is properly cognizable under the statute, the 
applicable agency head must determine that (1) the disbursing officer was 
carrying out official duties at the time of the loss or deficiency (prior 
versions of the statute, and hence many GAO decisions, use the military 
term “line of duty status”), and (2) the loss occurred without fault or 
negligence on the part of the disbursing officer. The first determination, 
31 U.S.C. § 3527(b)(1)(A), did not expressly include the “loss attributable to 
subordinate” clause found in section 3527(a). However, it was applied in 
the same manner. See B-155149, Oct. 21, 1964; B-151156, Dec. 30, 1963. 

The administrative determinations under section 3527(b)(2) were 
conclusive on GAO. 31 U.S.C. § 3527(b)(2). Thus, once the determinations 
were made, the granting of relief was mandatory, and GAO had no 
discretion in the matter. Under section 3527(a), agency determinations on 
the threshold issues—what is a physical loss and who is a disbursing 
officer—were not conclusive. B-151156, Dec. 30, 1963. 

As noted above and in sections B.2 and C.2.b of this chapter, the statutory 
scheme for military accountable officers was changed by section 913 of 
Public Law No. 104-106, div. A, title IX, subtitle B, 110 Stat. 186, 410–12 
(Feb. 10, 1996). Section 913 amended a number of provisions in titles 10, 
31, and 37 of the United States Code to authorize the designation and 
appointment of certifying and disbursing officials within the Department of 
Defense (including military departments, defense agencies, and field 
activities) to clearly delineate a separation of duties and accountabilities 
between personnel who authorize payments (certifying officers) and 
personnel who make payments (disbursing officers). In doing so, 
section 913 also amended 31 U.S.C. § 3527(b) to apply to all accountable

Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

officials of the armed forces, not just disbursing officers,27 and included a 
new section 3527(b)(1)(B) to provide relief for erroneous payments. 

2. Who Can Grant Relief? 
a. 31 U.S.C. § 3527(a) The statute confers the authority to grant relief on the Comptroller 
General.28 At one time, every case, no matter how small the amount, 
involved an exchange of correspondence—a letter from the agency to GAO 
requesting relief, and a letter from GAO back to the agency granting or 
denying it. By 1969, after 20 years of experience under the statute, a set of 
standards had developed, and it became apparent that there was no need 
for GAO to actually review every case. In that year, GAO inaugurated the 
practice of setting a dollar amount, initially $150, below which GAO 
delegated its authority to the agencies to apply the standards and to grant 
or deny relief accordingly without the need to obtain formal concurrence 
from GAO. 
GAO has raised the amount several times over the years and has used 
various formats to announce the increase.29 The current ceiling is $3,000. 
See B-243749, Oct. 22, 1991. The authorization applies to all physical losses 
or deficiencies; however, with a few exceptions to be noted later, it does 

27 As discussed earlier in section B.2 of this chapter, the Department of Defense has been 
given the authority to hold other “departmental accountable officers,” besides certifying and 
disbursing officers, liable financially for illegal or erroneous payments resulting from their 
negligence. 10 U.S.C. § 2773a. This would include employees whose duty it was to provide 
information, data, or services that are directly relied upon by a certifying official in the 
certification of vouchers for payment. 

28 The Department of Justice has opined that the provisions of 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527 and 3528 are 
unconstitutional insofar as they authorize the Comptroller General, an officer of the 
legislative branch, to relieve executive branch officials from liability. See, e.g., Comptroller 
General’s Authority to Relieve Disbursing and Certifying Officials from Liability, 15 Op. 
Off. Legal Counsel 80 (1991). We are aware of no judicial opinion addressing the 
constitutionality of 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527 and 3528. Other than sections 3527 and 3528, there are 
no statutes granting federal administrative officers the authority to relieve accountable 
officers. 

29 The $150 authorization was established by B-161457, Aug. 1, 1969 (circular letter). It was 
raised to $500 in 1974. B-161457, Aug. 14, 1974 (circular letter); 54 Comp. Gen. 112 (1974). A 
1983 revision to title 7 of GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal 
Agencies (hereafter referred to as GAO-PPM), § 8.9.C (Washington, D.C.: July 14, 1983) 
raised it to $750, and another revision on February 12, 1990, raised it to $1,000. The Manual 
was last revised on May 18, 1993.

Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

not extend to improper payments.30 61 Comp. Gen. 646 (1982); 59 Comp. 
Gen. 113 (1979). As stated in 61 Comp. Gen. at 647: 

“For the most part, the law governing the physical loss or 
deficiency of Government funds is clear, and most cases 
center around the determination of whether there was any 
contributing negligence on the part of the accountable 
officer. Our numerous decisions in this area should provide 
adequate guidance to agencies in resolving most smaller 
losses.” 

The $3,000 limitation applies to “single incidents or the total of similar 
incidents which occur about the same time and involve the same 
accountable officer.” 7 GAO-PPM § 8.9.C. Thus, two losses arising from 
the same theft, one under the limit and one over, should be combined for 
purposes of relief. B-189795, Sept. 23, 1977. In B-193380, Sept. 25, 1979, an 
imprest fund cashier discovered a $300 shortage while reconciling her cash 
and subvouchers. A few days later, her supervisor, upon returning from 
vacation, found an additional $500 missing. Since the losses occurred 
under very similar circumstances, GAO agreed with the agency that they 
should be treated together for purposes of seeking relief. Another case, 
B-187139, Oct. 25, 1978, involved losses of $1,500, $60, and $50. Since there 
was no indication that the losses were related, the agency was advised to 
separately resolve the $60 and $50 losses administratively. (The ceiling was 
$500 at the time of B-193380 and B-187139.) Likewise, in B-260862, June 6, 
1995, GAO granted relief to an imprest fund cashier from liability for the 
loss of $3,939 missing from a safe, apparently due to theft, but did not grant 
relief for an $820 shortage allegedly due to a bookkeeping error discovered 
the day prior to the theft. The $820 shortage was referred back to the 
agency for resolution since it was under the $3,000 limit. 

Thus, in cases of physical loss or deficiency, it is necessary to request relief 
from GAO only if the amount involved is $3,000 or more. For below-ceiling 
losses, GAO’s concurrence is, in effect, granted categorically provided the 
matter is properly cognizable under the statute, the agency makes the 
required determinations, and the administrative resolution is accomplished 
in accordance with the standards set forth in the GAO decisions. E.g., 

B-252809, Apr. 7, 1993; B-206817, Feb. 10, 1983; B-204740, Nov. 25, 1981. 

30 For example, losses resulting from mechanical or clerical errors during the check 
issuance process were included in the authorization. B-245586, Nov. 12, 1991. 

Page 9-41 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Each agency should maintain a central control record of its below-ceiling 
resolutions, should document the basis for its decisions, and should retain 
that documentation for subsequent internal or external audit or review. 
7 GAO-PPM § 8.9.C. Also, agencies should ensure the independence of the 
official or entity making the relief decisions. B-243749, Oct. 22, 1991. 

If an agency inadvertently submits a relief request to GAO for a belowceiling 
loss, GAO’s policy is simply to return the case with a brief 
explanation. E.g., B-214086, Feb. 2, 1984. GAO will also provide any 
further guidance that may appear helpful. See, e.g., B-249796, Feb. 9, 1993. 

As a practical matter, GAO’s authorization for below-ceiling administrative 
resolution is relevant only where the agency believes relief should be 
granted. In these cases, the need for an exchange of correspondence is 
eliminated, and the relief process is quicker, more streamlined, and less 
costly. If the agency believes relief should not be granted, its refusal to 
support relief effectively ends the matter regardless of the amount. GAO 
will not review an agency’s refusal to grant relief in a below-ceiling case. 
B-247581, June 4, 1992; 59 Comp. Gen. 113, 114 (1979). 

b. 31 U.S.C. § 3527(b) Like 31 U.S.C. § 3527(a), section 3527(b) also specifies the Comptroller 
General as the relieving authority. However, by virtue of the mandatory 
nature of section 3527(b), the monetary ceiling concept used in civilian 
relief cases has much less relevance to military disbursing officer losses. 
By circular letter B-198451, Feb. 5, 1981, GAO notified the military 
departments of a change in procedures under the pre-1996 version of 
31 U.S.C. § 3527(b) pertaining to relief for physical loss or deficiency of 
funds. Since GAO has no discretion with respect to the agency 
determinations and relief is mandatory as long as the determinations are 
made, there is no need for GAO to review any of those determinations on a 
case-by-case basis. Thus, there is no need for the agency to submit a formal 
request for relief regardless of the amount involved. As long as the case is 
properly cognizable under 31 U.S.C. § 3527(b) (i.e., it involves a disbursing 
officer and a physical loss or deficiency), it is sufficient for purposes of 
compliance with the statute for the agency to make the required 
determinations and to retain the documentation on file for audit purposes. 
See B-303671, Dec. 3, 2004. Of course, should there be a question as to 
whether a particular case is properly cognizable under the statute, GAO is 
available to provide guidance.

Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

c. Role of Administrative 
Determinations 
As noted above and in sections B.2 and C.1.b of this chapter, the statutory 
scheme for military accountable officers was changed by section 913 of 
Public Law No. 104-106, div. A, title IX, subtitle B, 110 Stat. 186, 410–12 
(Feb. 10, 1996). Section 913 amended a number of provisions in titles 10, 
31, and 37 of the United States Code to authorize the designation and 
appointment of certifying and disbursing officials within the Department of 
Defense (including military departments, defense agencies, and field 
activities) to clearly delineate a separation of duties and accountabilities 
between personnel who authorize payments (certifying officers) and 
personnel who make payments (disbursing officers). In doing so, 
section 913 also amended 31 U.S.C. § 3527(b) to apply to all accountable 
officials of the armed forces, not just disbursing officers,31 and included a 
new section 3527(b)(1)(B) to provide relief for erroneous payments made 
by military accountable officials. As in the case of a physical loss or 
deficiency, the finding of the Secretary involved regarding whether the 
circumstances warrant relief is conclusive on the Comptroller General. 
GAO has not yet addressed relief of military accountable officials for 
erroneous payments under the revised section 3527(b). 

Both of the relief statutes described above require two essentially identical 
administrative determinations as prerequisites to granting relief. It is the 
making of those determinations that triggers the ability to grant relief. If 
the agency cannot in good faith make those determinations, the legal 
authority to grant administrative relief simply does not exist, regardless of 
the amount involved and regardless of who is actually granting relief in any 
given case. GAO will not review an agency’s refusal to make the 
determinations under either statute, and has no authority to “direct” an 
agency to make them. In this sense, an agency’s refusal to make the 
required determinations is final. The best discussion of this point is found 
in 59 Comp. Gen. 113 (1979) (case arose under section 3527(a) but point 
applies equally to both statutes). 

While GAO’s role under section 3527(a) is somewhat broader than under 
section 3527(b), that role is still limited to concurring with determinations 
made by the agency. GAO cannot make those determinations for the 

31 As discussed earlier in section B.2 of this chapter, the Department of Defense has been 
given the authority to hold other “departmental accountable officers,” besides certifying and 
disbursing officers, liable financially for illegal or erroneous payments resulting from their 
negligence. 10 U.S.C. § 2773a. This would include employees whose duty it was to provide 
information, data, or services that are directly relied upon by a certifying official in the 
certification of vouchers for payment.

Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

agency. If they are absent, whatever the reason, relief cannot be granted 
regardless of the apparent merits of the case. There are numerous 
decisions to this effect. A few of them are B-248804.2, July 5, 1994; 
B-217209, Dec. 11, 1984; B-204464, Jan. 19, 1982;32 and B-197616, Mar. 24, 
1980. The determinations are as much required in below-ceiling cases as 
they are in cases submitted to GAO. 72 Comp. Gen. 49 (1992); 59 Comp. 
Gen. 113 (1979); B-247581, June 4, 1992. 

On occasion GAO has been willing to infer a determination that the loss 
occurred while the accountable officer was carrying out official duties 
where that determination was not expressly stated but the facts make it 
clear and there is no question that relief would be granted. E.g., B-244723, 
Oct. 29, 1991; B-235180, May 11, 1989; B-199020, Aug. 18, 1980; B-195435, 
Sept. 12, 1979. However, the determination of no contributing fault or 
negligence will not be inferred but must be expressly stated. B-241478, 
Apr. 5, 1991. It is not sufficient to state that the investigative report did not 
produce affirmative evidence of fault or negligence. B-167126, Aug. 9, 1976. 
Nor is it sufficient to state that there is “no evidence of willful misconduct.” 
B-217724, Mar. 25, 1985. See also 70 Comp. Gen. 389, 390 (1991) (“The mere 
administrative determination that there is no evidence of fault or 
negligence will not adequately rebut the presumption of negligence.”). 

As a practical matter, it will simplify the relief process if the agency’s 
request explicitly states all required determinations. It is best simply to 
follow the wording of the statute. 

Agency determinations required by a relief statute must be made by an 
agency official authorized to do so. E.g., B-184028, Oct. 24, 1975. 
Section 3527(a) requires determinations by the “head of the agency.” 
Section 3527(b) specifies the “appropriate Secretary.” Of course in most 
cases the authority under either statute will be delegated. It has been held 
that, absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary, the 
authority to make determinations under these statutes may be delegated 
only to officials authorized by law to act in place of the agency head, or to 
an Assistant Secretary. 29 Comp. Gen. 151 (1949). Many agency heads 
have separate statutory authority to delegate and redelegate, and this of 
course will be sufficient. See, e.g., 22 U.S.C. § 2651a(a)(4) (Secretary of 
State). As far as GAO is concerned, the form of the delegation is immaterial 

32 In this case relief was later granted when the agency provided GAO with the requisite 
determinations. B-204464, May 12, 1983. 

Page 9-44 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

although it should, of course, be in writing. Documentation of delegations 
need not be furnished to GAO, nor need it be specified in relief requests, 
but should be available if requested. See GAO, Policy and Procedures 
Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 8.9.B (Washington, 
D.C.: May 18, 1993). 

If, under agency procedures, the determinations are made in the first 
instance by someone other than the designated official (e.g., a board of 
inquiry), the relief request must explicitly state the designated official’s 
concurrence. B-207062, July 20, 1982. 

3. Standards for Granting 
Relief 
a. Standard of Negligence Again, it is important to distinguish between liability and relief. The 
presence or absence of negligence has nothing to do with an accountable 
officer’s basic liability. The law is not that an accountable officer is liable 
for negligent losses. The officer is strictly liable for all losses, but may be 
relieved if found to be free from fault or negligence. It has frequently been 
stated that an accountable officer must exercise “the highest degree of care 
in the performance of his duty.” E.g., 48 Comp. Gen. 566, 567–68 (1969); 
B-186922, Aug. 26, 1976. See also 72 Comp. Gen. 49, 53 (1992) (“high 
standard of care”). Statements of this type, however, have little practical 
use in applying the relief statutes. 
In evaluating the facts to determine whether or not an accountable officer 
was negligent, GAO applies the standard of “reasonable care.” 54 Comp. 
Gen. 112 (1974); B-196790, Feb. 7, 1980. This is the standard of simple or 
ordinary negligence, not gross negligence. 54 Comp. Gen. at 115; B-158699, 
Sept. 6, 1968. The standard has been stated as what the reasonably prudent 
and careful person would have done to take care of his or her own property 
of like description under like circumstances. B-288166, Mar. 11, 2003 
(failure to record checks mailed for deposit “not a common practice for 
many reasonably prudent and careful people handling their own 
collections”); B-257120, Dec. 13, 1994 (leaving cash under truck seat not “an 
action that a reasonably prudent and careful person would have taken”). 
This is an objective standard, that is, it does not vary with such factors as 
the age and experience of the particular accountable officer. See, e.g., 
70 Comp. Gen. 389, 390 (1991). Likewise, inadequate training or 
supervision does not affect the standard. B-257120, Dec. 13, 1994. 

Page 9-45 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

b. Presumption of 
Negligence/Burden of Proof 
The doctrine of comparative negligence (allocating the loss based on the 
degree of fault) does not apply under the relief statutes. B-211962, July 20, 
1983; B-190506, Nov. 28, 1977. 

The mere fact that a loss or deficiency has occurred gives rise to a 
presumption of negligence on the part of the accountable officer. The 
presumption may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary, but it is the 
accountable officer’s burden to produce the evidence. The government 
does not have to produce evidence to establish that the accountable officer 
was at fault in order to hold the officer liable. Rather, to be entitled to 
relief, the accountable officer must produce evidence to show that there 
was no contributing fault or negligence on his or her part, that is, that he or 
she exercised the requisite degree of care. 

This rule originated in decisions of the Court of Claims under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 2512, before any of the administrative relief statutes existed, and has been 
consistently followed. An early statement is the following from Boggs v. 
United States, 44 Ct. Cl. 367, 384 (1909): 

“[T]here is at the outset a presumption of liability, and the 
burden of proof must rest upon the officer who has 
sustained the loss.” 

A later case quoting and applying Boggs is O’Neal v. United States, 60 Ct. 
Cl. 413 (1925). More recently, the court said: 

“[T]he Government does not have the burden of proving 
fault or negligence on the part of plaintiff; plaintiff has the 
sole burden of proving that he was without fault or 
negligence in order to qualify for [relief].” 

Serrano v. United States, 612 F.2d 525, 532–33 (Ct. Cl. 1979). 

GAO follows the same rule, stating it in literally dozens of relief cases. E.g., 
B-288014, May 17, 2002; B-271896, Mar. 4, 1997; 72 Comp. Gen. 49, 53 (1992); 

Page 9-46 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

67 Comp. Gen. 6 (1987); 65 Comp. Gen. 876 (1986); 54 Comp. Gen. 112 
(1974); 48 Comp. Gen. 566 (1969).33 

The amount and types of evidence that will suffice to rebut the 
presumption vary with the facts and circumstances of the particular case. 
However, there must be affirmative evidence. It is not enough to rely on 
the absence of implicating evidence, nor is the mere administrative 
determination that there was no fault or negligence, unsupported by 
evidence, sufficient to rebut the presumption. E.g., B-272613, Oct. 16, 1996 
(assertions of “the absence of negligence, or mere administrative 
determinations that there was no fault or negligence on the part of the 
accountable officer are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of 
negligence when unsupported by the evidence.”); B-257120, Dec. 13, 1994 
(accountable officer “must rebut presumption with convincing evidence 
that the loss was not caused by the accountable officer’s negligence or lack 
of reasonable care.”); B-242830, Sept. 24, 1991 (mere absence of evidence 
implicating the accountable officer in the loss is not sufficient to rebut the 
presumption of negligence.). See also 70 Comp. Gen. 12, 14 (1990); 
B-204647, Feb. 8, 1982; B-167126, Aug. 9, 1976. 

If the record clearly establishes that the loss resulted from burglary or 
robbery, the presumption is easily rebutted. See, e.g., B-288014, May 17, 
2002; B-265856, Nov. 9, 1995, and cases cited therein. But the evidence does 
not have to explain the loss with absolute certainty. If the evidence is not 
all that clear, the accountable officer may still be able to rebut the 
presumption by presenting evidence tending to corroborate the likelihood 
of theft or showing that some factor beyond his or her control was the 
proximate cause of the loss. If such evidence exists, and if the record 
shows that the accountable officer complied fully with all applicable 
regulations and procedures, the agency’s determination of no fault or 
negligence will usually be accepted and relief granted. See, e.g., B-260862, 
June 6, 1995; B-242830, Sept. 24, 1991. 

GAO will consider the results of a polygraph (lie detector) test as an 
additional factor in the equation, but does not regard those results, 

33 Many decisions prior to 1970, such as 48 Comp. Gen. 566, dealt with postal employees. 
Since enactment of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, responsibility for the relief of 
postal employees is with the United States Postal Service. 39 U.S.C. § 2601; 50 Comp. 
Gen. 731 (1971); B-164786, Oct. 8, 1970. While the Comptroller General no longer relieves 
postal employees, the principles enunciated in the earlier decisions are nonetheless 
applicable to other accountable officers.

standing alone, as dispositive. This applies whether the results are 
favorable (B-260862, June 6, 1995; B-206745, Aug. 9, 1982, rev’d on 
submission of additional evidence, B-206745, May 11, 1983; B-204647, 
Feb. 8, 1982; B-142326, Mar. 31, 1960; B-182829-O.M., Feb. 3, 1975) or 
unfavorable (B-209569, Apr. 13, 1983. See also B-192567, Aug. 4, 1983, aff’d 
upon reconsideration, B-192567, June 21, 1988). 

Another situation in which the presumption is easily rebutted is where the 
accountable officer does not have control of the funds at the time of the 
loss. An example is losses occurring while the accountable officer is on 
leave or duty absence. As a practical matter, relief will be granted unless 
there is evidence of actual contributing negligence on the part of the 
accountable officer. B-196960, Nov. 18, 1980; B-184028, Mar. 2, 1976; 
B-175756-O.M., June 14, 1972. Of course, where contributing negligence 
exists, relief will be denied and the role of the presumption never comes 
into play. B-182480, Feb. 3, 1975. 

The presumption of negligence may be criticized as unduly harsh. It is, 
however, necessary both in order to preserve the concept of accountability 
and to protect the government against dishonesty as well as negligence. 
See B-191440, May 25, 1979; B-167126, Aug. 28, 1978. As stated in one 
decision, the presumption of negligence— 

“is a reasonable and legal basis for the denial of relief where 
the accountable officers have control of the funds and the 
means available for their safekeeping but the shortage 
nevertheless occurs without evidence of forcible entry or 
other conclusive explanation which would exclude 
negligence as the proximate cause of the loss.” 

B-166519, Oct. 6, 1969. Indeed, if liability is strict and automatic, a legal 
presumption against the accountable officer is virtually necessary as a 
starting point. 

If the facts indicate negligence on the part of the accountable officer, and if 
it appears that the negligence was the proximate cause of the loss, then 
relief must be denied. 

One group of cases involves failure to lock a safe. It is negligence for an 
accountable officer to place money in a safe in an area which is accessible 
to others, and then leave the safe unlocked for a period of time when he or 
she is not physically present. E.g., B-190506, Nov. 28, 1977; B-139886, 

Page 9-48 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

July 2, 1959. It is also negligence to leave a safe unattended in a “day lock” 
position. B-199790, Aug. 26, 1980; B-188733, Mar. 29, 1979, aff’d, B-188733, 
Jan. 17, 1980; B-187708, Apr. 6, 1977. Compare these cases with B-180863, 
Apr. 24, 1975, in which an accountable officer who had left a safe on “day 
lock” was relieved in view of her lack of knowledge or instruction 
regarding the day lock mechanism. Thus, an accountable officer who 
leaves a safe unlocked (either by leaving the door open or closing the door 
but not rotating the combination dial), and then leaves the office for lunch 
or for the night will be denied relief. B-204173, Jan. 11, 1982, aff’d, 
B-204173, Nov. 9, 1982; B-183559, Aug. 28, 1975; B-180957, Apr. 24, 1975; 
B-142597, Apr. 9, 1960; B-181648-O.M., Aug. 21, 1974. 

Merely being physically present may not be enough. A degree of 
attentiveness, dictated by the circumstances and common sense, is also 
required. In B-173710-O.M., Dec. 7, 1971, relief was denied where the 
cashier did not lock the safe while a stranger, posing as a building 
maintenance man, entered the cashier’s cage ostensibly to repair the air 
conditioning system and erected a temporary barrier between the cashier 
and the safe. 

Another group involves the failure to use available security facilities. As 
we will see in our discussion of agency security, a good rule of thumb for 
the accountable officer is: You do the best you can with what is available to 
you. Failure to do so, without compelling justification, does not meet the 
standard of reasonable care. Some examples in which relief was denied 
are: 

• Accountable officer left unlocked cash box in safe to which several 
other persons had access. B-172614-O.M., May 4, 1971; B-167596-O.M., 
Aug. 21, 1969. 
• Cashier left funds overnight in locked desk drawer instead of safe 
provided for that purpose. B-177730-O.M., Feb. 9, 1973. 
• Cashier left funds in unlocked drawer while at lunch instead of locked 
drawer provided for that purpose. B-161229-O.M., Apr. 20, 1967. 
• Funds disappeared from bar-locking file cabinet. Combination safe was 
available but not used. B-192567, June 21, 1988. 
Inattentiveness or simple carelessness which facilitates a loss may 
constitute negligence and thus preclude relief. 64 Comp. Gen. 140 (1984) 

Page 9-49 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

(shoulder bag with money left unattended on airport counter for several 
minutes); B-257120, Dec. 13, 1994 (cash left under a truck seat); B-233937, 
May 8, 1989 (bag with money set on ledge in crowded restaurant); 
B-208888, Sept. 28 1984 (evidence suggested that funds were placed on 
desk and inadvertently knocked into trash can); B-127204, Apr. 13, 1956 
(pay envelopes left on top of desk in cashier’s cage 19 inches from window 
opening on hallway to which many persons had access). 

The best way to know how much cash you have is to count it. Failure to do 
so where reasonable prudence would dictate otherwise is negligence. 
B-247581, June 4, 1992 (alternate cashier failed to count cash upon receipt 
from principal or upon return to principal); B-206820, Sept. 9, 1982 
(accountable officer handed money over to another employee without 
counting it or obtaining receipt); B-193380, Sept. 25, 1979 (cashier cashed 
checks at bank and failed to count the cash received). 

A deficiency in an accountable officer’s account caused by the acceptance 
of a counterfeit note constitutes a physical loss for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3527(a). B-140836, Oct. 3, 1960; B-108452, May 15, 1952; B-101301, July 19, 
1951. Whether accepting counterfeit money is negligence depends on the 
facts of the particular case, primarily whether the counterfeit was readily 
detectable. B-271895, Sept. 3, 1996 (“super-dollars”). See also B-239724, 
Oct. 11, 1990; B-191891, June 16, 1980; B-163627-O.M., Mar. 11, 1968. (Relief 
was granted in these four cases.) If the quality of the counterfeit is such 
that a prudent person in the same situation would question the authenticity 
of the bill, relief should not be granted. B-155287, Sept. 5, 1967. Also, 
failure to check a bill against a posted list of serial numbers will generally 
be viewed as negligence. B-155287, Sept. 5, 1967; B-166514-O.M., July 23, 
1969. Finally, failure without compelling justification to use an available 
counterfeit detection machine is negligence. B-243685, July 1, 1991. 

Other examples of conduct which does or does not constitute negligence 
are scattered throughout this chapter, for example, in the sections on 
compliance with regulations and agency security. In all cases, including 
those which cannot be neatly categorized, the approach is to apply the 
standard of reasonable care to the conduct of the accountable officer in 
light of all surrounding facts and circumstances. For example, in B-196790, 
Feb. 7, 1980, a patient at a then Veterans Administration hospital, 
patient “X,” had obtained a cashier’s check from a bank on May 9, 1978. On 
September 12, 1978, another patient, patient “Y,” presented the check at the 
hospital for deposit to patient X’s personal funds account. On the following 
day, patient X withdrew the money and left. The bank refused to honor the 

Page 9-50 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


d. Proximate Cause 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

check because, unknown to hospital personnel, patient X had gone to the 
bank on May 17, stated that he had never received the check, and the bank 
had refunded its face value. As noted in the decision, patient X had 
“cleverly managed to double his bank account by collecting the same funds 
twice.” The issue was whether it was negligence for the hospital cashier to 
accept the check dated four months earlier or to permit patient X to 
withdraw the funds the day after the check was deposited. GAO 
considered the nature of a cashier’s check, noted the absence of applicable 
regulations, applied the reasonable care standard, and granted relief, but 
recommended that the agency pursue further collection efforts against the 
bank. 

An accountable officer may be found negligent and nevertheless relieved 
from liability if it can be shown that the negligence was not the “proximate 
cause” of the loss or shortage. E.g., B-272613, Oct. 16, 1996, fn. 2; B-235147, 
Aug. 14, 1991. A precise definition of the term “proximate cause” does not 
exist.34 The concept means that, first, there must be a cause-and-effect 
relationship between the negligence and the loss. In other words, the 
negligence must have contributed to the loss. However, as one authority 
notes, the cause of an event can be argued in a philosophical sense to “go 
back to the dawn of human events” and its consequences can “go forward 
to eternity.” Prosser and Keeton, § 41. Obviously a line must be drawn 
someplace. Thus, the concept also means that the cause-and-effect 
relationship must be reasonably foreseeable; that is, a reasonably prudent 
person should have anticipated that a given consequence could reasonably 
follow from a given act. 

Before proceeding, we must refer again to the accountable officer’s burden 
of proof. The Court of Claims said, in Serrano v. United States, 612 F.2d 
525, 531–32 (Ct. Cl. 1979): 

“It is argued that the . . . fault or negligence involved must be 
the proximate cause of the loss. Thus the Secretary . . . 
could not deny relief unless the loss was proximately 
attributable to plaintiff. This argument has no merit. If such 

34 “There is perhaps nothing in the entire field of law which has called forth more 
disagreement, or upon which the opinions are in such a welter of confusion.” Prosser and 
Keeton, The Law of Torts, § 41 (5th ed. 1984). See Fedorczyk v. Caribbean Cruise Lines, 
82 F.3d 69, 73 (3rd Cir. 1996). 

Page 9-51 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

an argument were to be accepted by this court, it would 
shift the burden of proof . . . to the Government. . . . 

“Shifting of the burden of proof, and forcing the 
Government to prove that plaintiff's conduct was a 
proximate cause of the loss, would be intolerable. This shift 
would negate the special responsibility that disbursing 
officers have in handling public funds.” (Emphasis in 
original.) 

Thus, the government does not have to prove causation any more than it 
has to prove negligence. Rather, the accountable officer who has been 
negligent must, in order to be eligible for relief, show that some other 
factor or combination of factors was the proximate cause of the loss, or at 
least that the totality of evidence makes it impossible to fix responsibility. 
B-272613, Oct. 16, 1996 (relief denied when accountable officer failed to 
provide plausible evidence that some factor other than his negligence was 
the proximate cause of the loss). 

In analyzing proximate cause, it may be helpful to ask certain questions. 
First, if the accountable officer had not been negligent, would the loss have 
occurred anyway? If the answer to this question is yes, the negligence is 
not the proximate cause of the loss and relief will probably be granted. 
However, it may not be possible to answer this question with any degree of 
certainty. If not, the next question to ask is whether the negligence was a 
“substantial factor” in bringing about the loss. If this question is answered 
yes, relief will probably be denied. A couple of simple examples will 
illustrate: 

• An accountable officer leaves cash visible and unguarded on a desk top 
while at lunch, during which time the money disappears. There can be 
no question that the negligence was the proximate cause of the loss. 
• As noted previously, failure to count cash received at a bank window is 
negligence. Suppose, however, that the accountable officer is attacked 
and robbed by armed marauders while returning to the office. The 
failure to count the cash, even though negligent, would not be the 
proximate cause of the loss since presumably the robbers would have 
taken the entire amount anyway. 
Another good illustration is B-201173, Aug. 18, 1981. Twelve armed men in 
two Volkswagen minibuses broke into the West African Consolidated 

Page 9-52 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Services Center at the American Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria. They forcibly 
entered the cashier’s office and proceeded to carry the safe down the stairs. 
The burglars dropped the safe while carrying it, the safe opened upon being 
dropped, and the burglars took the money and fled. The reason the safe 
opened when dropped was that the cashier had not locked it, clearly an act 
of negligence. However, even if the safe had been locked, the burglars 
would presumably have continued to carry it away, loaded it onto their 
minibus, and forcibly opened it somewhere else. Thus, the cashier’s failure 
to lock the safe, while negligent, was not the proximate cause of the loss. 

Proximate cause considerations are often relevant in cases involving 
weaknesses in agency security, and the topic is explored further under the 
Agency Security heading in section C.3.j of this chapter. 

The following are a few additional examples of cases in which relief was 
granted even though the accountable officer was or may have been 
negligent, because the negligence was found not to be the proximate cause 
of the loss or deficiency. 

• Accountable officer left safe combination in unlocked desk drawer. 
Burglars found combination and looted safe. Had this been the entire 
story, relief could not be granted. However, burglars also pried open 
locked desk drawers throughout the office. Thus, locking the desk 
drawer would most likely not have prevented the theft. B-229587, 
Jan. 6, 1988. 
• Accountable officer in Afghanistan negligently turned over custody of 
funds to unauthorized person. Money was taken by rioters in severe 
civil disturbance. Relief was granted because negligence was not the 
proximate cause of the loss. (Whether the person holding the funds was 
or was not an authorized custodian was not a matter of particular 
concern to the rioters.) B-144148-O.M., Nov. 1, 1960. 
• Cashier discovered loss upon return from 2-week absence. It could not 
be verified whether she had locked the safe when she left. However, 
time of loss could not be pinpointed, other persons worked out of the 
same safe, and it would have been opened daily for normal business 
during her absence. Thus, even if she had failed to lock the safe 
(negligence), proximate cause chain was much too conjectural. 
B-191942, Sept. 12, 1979.

Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Even if there is a clearly identified intervening cause, relief may still be 
denied depending on the extent to which the accountable officer’s 
negligence facilitated the intervening cause or contributed to the loss. In 
such a case, the negligence will be viewed as the proximate cause 
notwithstanding the intervening cause. The following cases will illustrate. 
• Accountable officer failed to make daily deposits of collections as 
required by regulations. Funds were stolen from locked safe in 
burglary. Relief was denied because officer’s negligence was proximate 
cause of loss in that funds would not have been in the safe to be stolen 
if they had been properly deposited. B-71445, June 20, 1949. See also 
B-203726, July 10, 1981; B-164449, Dec. 8, 1969; B-168672-O.M., June 22, 
1970. 
• Accountable officer negligently left safe on “day lock” position (door 
closed, dial or handle partially turned but not rotated, so that partial 
turning in one direction, without knowledge of combination, will 
permit door to open). Thief broke into premises, opened safe without 
using force, and stole funds. Relief was denied because negligence 
facilitated theft by making it possible for thief to open safe without 
force or knowledge of combination. B-188733, Mar. 29, 1979, aff’d, 
B-188733, Jan. 17, 1980. 
• Although cash was stolen, negligence by the accountable officer in 
placing the cash under the seat of a truck while she went shopping 
enabled the theft to occur and was thus the proximate cause of the loss. 
Accordingly, relief was denied. B-257120, Dec. 13, 1994. 
e. Unexplained Loss or The cases cited under the Actual Negligence heading all contained clear 
Shortage evidence of negligence on the part of the accountable officer. Absent a 
proximate cause issue, these cases are relatively easy to resolve. Such 
evidence, however, is not necessary in order to deny relief in the situation 
we refer to as the “unexplained loss or shortage.” In the typical case, a safe 
is opened at the beginning of a business day and money is found missing, or 
an internal audit reveals a shortage in an account. There is no evidence of 
negligence or misconduct on the part of the accountable officer; there is no 
evidence of burglary or any other reason for the disappearance. All that is 
known with any certainty is that the money is gone. In other words, the 
loss or shortage is totally unexplained. In many cases, a formal 
investigation confirms this conclusion. 

Page 9-54 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

The presumption of negligence has perhaps its clearest impact in the 
unexplained loss situation. If the burden of proof is on the accountable 
officer to establish eligibility for relief, the denial of relief follows 
necessarily. Since there is no evidence to rebut the presumption, there is 
no basis on which to grant relief. See, e.g., B-272613, Oct. 16, 1996; 
70 Comp. Gen. 389 (1991); B-238955, Apr. 3, 1991. The presumption and its 
application to unexplained losses were discussed in 48 Comp. Gen. 566, 
567–68 (1969) as follows: 

“While there is no positive or affirmative evidence of 
negligence on the part of [the accountable officer] in 
connection with this loss, we have repeatedly held that 
positive or affirmative evidence of negligence is not 
necessary, and that the mere fact that an unexplained 
shortage occurred is, in and of itself, sufficient to raise an 
inference or presumption of negligence. A Government 
official charged with the custody and handling of public 
moneys . . . is expected to exercise the highest degree of 
care in the performance of his duty and, when funds . . . 
disappear without explanation or evident reason, the 
presumption naturally arises that the responsible official 
was derelict in some way. Moreover, granting relief to 
Government officials for unexplained losses or shortages of 
this nature might tend to make such officials lax in the 
performance of their duties.”35 

The rationale is fairly simple. Money does not just get up and walk away. If 
it is missing, there is an excellent chance that someone took it. If the 
accountable officer exercised the requisite degree of care and properly 
safeguarded the funds, it is unlikely that anyone else could have taken the 
money without leaving some evidence of forced entry. Therefore, where 
there is no evidence to explain a loss, the leading probabilities are that the 
accountable officer either took the money or was negligent in some way 
that facilitated theft by someone else. Be that as it may, denial of relief in 
an unexplained loss case is not intended to imply dishonesty by the 
particular accountable officer; it means merely that there was insufficient 
evidence to rebut the applicable legal presumption. See B-122688, Sept. 25, 

35 A few additional examples are 70 Comp. Gen. 389 (1991); B-213427, Dec. 13, 1983, aff’d 
upon reconsideration, B-213427, Mar. 14, 1984; B-159987, Sept. 21, 1966.

Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

1956. See also B-258357, Jan. 3, 1996 (loss of receipts creates “unexplained 
loss” from imprest fund for which cashier is liable). 

Despite the strictness of the rule, there are many unexplained loss cases in 
which the presumption can be rebutted and relief granted. See, e.g., 
B-242830, Sept. 24, 1991. By definition, the evidence will not be sufficient 
to “explain” the loss; otherwise there would not be an unexplained loss to 
begin with. There is no simple formula to apply in determining the kinds or 
amount of evidence that will rebut the presumption. It is necessary to 
evaluate the totality of available evidence, including statements by the 
accountable officer and other agency personnel, investigation reports, and 
any relevant circumstantial evidence. Compare B-206745, Aug. 9, 1982 
(denial of relief in “unexplained loss” case), with B-206745, May 11, 1983 
(reversing on submission of additional evidence B-206745, Aug. 9, 1982). 

In some cases, for example, it may be possible to reasonably conclude that 
any negligence that may have occurred was not the proximate cause of the 
loss. These cases tend to involve security weaknesses and are discussed 
under the Agency Security heading, section C.3.j of this chapter. The 
evidence, in conjunction with the lack of any evidence to the contrary and 
the agency’s “no fault or negligence” determination, supports the granting 
of relief. For example, relief from an unexplained loss was granted in 
B-271896, Mar. 4, 1997, when a cashier was forced to operate in a lax 
security environment. In this case, agency management allowed other 
employees access to the cash area of the cashier’s office, failed to fix a safe 
combination lock that had been broken for over a week, and failed to heed 
repeated warnings to correct the security deficiencies. See also 
B-235147.2, Aug. 14, 1991 (proximate cause of loss was “general lack of 
concern and sense of laxity” that pervaded agency). 

Since the burden of proof rests with the accountable officer, the 
accountable officer’s own statements take on a particular relevance in 
establishing due care, and relief should never be denied without obtaining 
and carefully analyzing them. Naturally, the more specific and detailed the 
statement is, and the more closely tied to the time of the loss, the more 
helpful it will be. While the accountable officer’s statement is obviously 
self-serving and may not be enough if there are no other supporting factors, 
it has been enough to tip the balance in favor of granting relief when

f. Compliance with 
Regulations 
combined with other evidence, however slight or circumstantial, which by 
itself would not have been sufficient.36 

If a particular activity of an accountable officer is governed by a regulation, 
failure to follow that regulation will be considered negligence. If that 
failure is the proximate cause of a loss or deficiency, relief must be denied. 
70 Comp. Gen. 12 (1990); 54 Comp. Gen. 112, 116 (1974). The relationship 
of this rule to the standard of reasonable care discussed earlier is the 
premise that the prudent person exercising the requisite degree of care will 
become familiar with, and will follow, applicable regulations. Indeed, it has 
been stated that accountable officers have a duty to familiarize themselves 
with pertinent Treasury Department and agency rules and regulations. 

B-229207, July 11, 1988; B-193380, Sept. 25, 1979. 

Treasury Department regulations on disbursing, applicable to all agencies 
for which Treasury disburses under 31 U.S.C. § 3321, are found in volume I 
of the Treasury Financial Manual, especially part 4, “Disbursing,” and 
part 5, “Deposit Regulations.” The Treasury regulations establish general 
requirements for sound cash control, and failure to comply may result in 
the denial of relief. E.g., 70 Comp. Gen. 12 (1990) (cashier kept copy of 
safe combination taped to underside of desk pull-out panel).37 

The same principle applies with respect to violations of individual agency 
regulations and written instructions. E.g., B-193380, Sept. 25, 1979 (cashier 
violated agency regulations by placing the key to a locked cash box in an 
unlocked cash box and then leaving both in a locked safe to which more 
than one person had the combination). The decision further pointed out 

36 E.g., B-242830, Sept. 24, 1991 (cashier’s statement supported by another employee; safe 
had been opened for only one transaction in early afternoon); B-214080, Mar. 25, 1986 
(cashier made sworn and unrefuted statement to local police and Secret Service); B-210017, 
June 8, 1983 (cashier’s statement corroborated by witness); B-188733, Mar. 29, 1979, aff’d 
Jan 17, 1980 (forcible entry to office but not to safe itself; cashier’s statement that he locked 
safe on day of robbery accepted). 

37 Losses by agency cashiers typically involve “imprest funds.” As discussed above, in 1999, 
Treasury required that federal agencies eliminate agency imprest funds by Oct. 1, 2001. 
Department of the Treasury, “Imprest Fund Policy Directive,” Nov. 9, 1999. (Exceptions may 
be made only for certain payments typically involving national security, law enforcement, 
small payments, overseas payments, or emergencies. See 31 C.F.R. § 208.) Guidance 
regarding those imprest funds for which a waiver has been granted is contained in 
Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service, Manual of Procedures and 
Instructions for Cashiers (Cashier’s Manual) (April 2001). See the further discussion of 
imprest funds and the Cashier’s Manual in section B.3.a of this chapter.

Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

that oral instructions to the cashier to leave the cash box unlocked could 
not be considered to supersede published agency regulations. However, if 
agency regulations are demonstrably ambiguous, relief may be granted. 
B-169848-O.M., Dec. 8, 1971. See also B-288166, Mar. 11, 2003 (accountable 
officer granted relief when he complied with agency regulations). 

Negligence will not be imputed to an accountable officer who fails to 
comply with regulations where full compliance is prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control. This recognizes the fact that 
compliance is sometimes up to the agency and beyond the control of the 
individual. For example, violating a regulation which requires that funds be 
kept in a safe is not negligence where the agency has failed to provide the 
safe. B-78617, June 24, 1949. Note, however, that instructions from 
superiors to disregard regulations do not, in themselves, relieve an 
accountable officer of responsibility to follow those regulations. See, e.g., 
B-271021, Sept. 18, 1986 (improper payment case). 

Also, as with other types of negligence, failure to follow regulations will not 
prevent the granting of relief if the failure was not the proximate cause of 
the loss or deficiency. B-229207, July 11, 1988; B-229587, Jan. 6, 1988; 
B-185666, July 27, 1976. See also Libby v. United States, 81 F. Supp. 722, 
727 (Ct. Cl. 1948). In B-185666, for example, a cashier kept her cash box 
key and safe combination in a sealed envelope in an unlocked desk drawer, 
in violation of the Cashier’s Manual. Relief was nevertheless granted 
because the seal on the envelope had not been broken and the negligence 
could therefore not have contributed to the loss. 

While failure to comply with regulations is generally considered 
negligence, the converse is not always true. To be sure, the fact that an 
accountable officer has complied with all applicable regulations and 
instructions is highly significant in evaluating eligibility for relief. It is not 
conclusive, however, because the accountable officer might have been 
negligent in a matter not covered by the regulations. In a 1979 case, an 
accountable officer accepted a $10,000 personal check at a Customs 
auction sale and turned over the property without attempting to verify the 
existence or adequacy of the purchaser’s account. The check bounced. It 
was not clear whether existing regulations applied to that situation. Even 
without regulations, however, accepting a personal check for a large 
amount without attempting verification was viewed as not meeting the 
standard of reasonable care, and relief was denied. B-193673, May 25, 1979, 
modified on other grounds, B-201673 et al., Sept. 23, 1982.

g. Losses in Shipment 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Government funds are occasionally lost or stolen in shipment. The Postal 
Service or other carrier is the agent of the sender, and funds in shipment 
remain in the “custody” of the accountable officer who shipped them until 
delivered, notwithstanding the fact that they are in the physical possession 
of the carrier. B-185905-O.M., Apr. 23, 1976. Thus, a loss in shipment is a 
physical loss for which an accountable officer is liable. 

For the most part, relief for losses in shipment is the same as relief for 
other losses, and the rules discussed in this chapter with respect to 
negligence and proximate cause apply. For example, relief was denied in 
one case because transmitting cash by ordinary first-class mail rather than 
registered or certified mail was held not to meet the reasonable care 
standard. B-164450-O.M., Sept. 5, 1968. 

However, relief for losses in shipment differs from relief for other losses in 
one important respect. A loss in shipment is not viewed as an “unexplained 
loss” and there is no presumption of negligence. B-164450-O.M., Sept. 5, 
1968. The reason for this distinction is that there is no basis to infer 
negligence when a loss occurs while funds are totally beyond the control of 
the accountable officer. Thus, where funds are lost in shipment, in the 
absence of positive evidence of fault or negligence, an accountable officer 
will be relieved if he or she conformed fully with applicable regulations and 
procedures for the handling and safeguarding of the funds and they were 
nevertheless lost or stolen. B-142058, Mar. 18, 1960; B-126362, Feb. 21, 
1956; B-119567, Jan. 10, 1955; B-95504, June 16, 1950. 

The Government Losses in Shipment Act (GLISA), 40 U.S.C. §§ 17301– 
17309, authorizes agencies to file claims with the Treasury Department for 
funds or other valuables lost or destroyed in shipment. See generally 
B-244473.2, May 13, 1993. The Treasury Department has a revolving fund 
for the payment of these claims and has issued regulations, found at 
31 C.F.R. parts 361 and 362, to implement the statute. The Treasury 
Department will generally disallow a claim unless there has been strict 
compliance with the statute and regulations. See, e.g., B-200437, Oct. 21, 
1980. 

If a loss in shipment occurs, the agency should first consider filing a claim 
under GLISA, and should seek relief only if this fails. 70 Comp. Gen. 9 
(1990). Denial of a GLISA claim should prompt further inquiry since it 
suggests the possibility that someone at the point of shipment may have 
been negligent, but it will not automatically preclude the granting of relief. 
For example, it is possible for a claim to be denied for reasons that do not 

Page 9-59 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


h. Fire, Natural Disaster 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

suggest negligence. In B-126362, Feb. 21, 1956, the accountable officer had 
reimbursed the government from personal funds, and a claim under GLISA 
was denied because there was no longer any loss. GAO nevertheless 
granted relief and the accountable officer was reimbursed. 

Disallowance of a GLISA claim for failure to strictly comply with the 
regulations carries with it an even stronger suggestion of negligence, but it 
is still appropriate to examine the facts and circumstances of the particular 
case to evaluate the relationship of the noncompliance to the loss. For 
example, GAO granted relief in B-191645, Oct. 5, 1979, despite the denial of 
a GLISA claim, because there was no question that the funds had arrived at 
their initial destination although they never reached the intended recipient. 
Even if there had been negligence at the point of shipment, it could not 
have been the proximate cause of the loss. See also B-193830, Oct. 1, 1979, 
and B-193830, Mar. 30, 1979 (both cases arising from the same loss). 

Earlier in this chapter, we noted the Supreme Court’s conclusion in United 
States v. Thomas, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 337, 352 (1872), that strict liability (and 
hence the need for relief) would not attach in two situations: funds 
destroyed by an “overruling necessity” and funds taken by a “public 
enemy,” provided there is no contributing fault or negligence by the 
accountable officer. The Court gave only one example of an “overruling 
necessity”: 

“Suppose an earthquake should swallow up the building and 
safe containing the money, is there no condition implied in 
the law by which to exonerate the receiver from 
responsibility?” 

Id. at 348. We are aware of no subsequent judicial attempts to further 
define “overruling necessity,” although some administrative formulations 
have used the term “acts of God.” E.g., 48 Comp. Gen. 566, 567 (1969). 
Thus, at the very least, assuming no contributing fault or negligence, an 
accountable officer is not liable for funds lost or destroyed in an 
earthquake, and hence there is no need to seek relief. Contributing 
negligence might occur, for example, if an accountable officer failed to 
periodically deposit collections and funds were therefore on hand which 
should not have been. See B-71445, June 20, 1949. 

GAO granted relief in one case involving an earthquake, B-229153, Oct. 29, 
1987, in which most of the funds were recovered. While arguably there was 
no need to seek relief in that case, it makes no difference as a practical 

Page 9-60 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


i. Loss by Theft 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

matter since relief would be granted as a matter of routine unless there is 
contributing negligence, in which event the accountable officer would be 
liable even under Thomas. 

More recently, GAO relieved an accountable officer from liability for the 
loss of the “confidential fund” of the Secret Service field office resulting 
from the destruction of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. B-300677, 
June 19, 2003. See also B-249372, Aug. 13, 1992 (rioting forced evacuation 
of the American embassy in Somalia, resulting in loss of funds in safe). 

Whatever the scope of the “overruling necessity” exception, it is clear that 
it does not extend to destruction by fire, even though money destroyed by 
fire is no longer available to be used by anyone else and can be replaced 
simply by printing new money. In Smythe v. United States, 188 U.S. 156, 
173–74 (1903), the Supreme Court declined to apply Thomas and expressly 
rejected the argument that an accountable officer’s liability for notes 
destroyed by fire should be limited to the cost of printing new notes. See 
also 1 Comp. Dec. 191 (1895), in which the Comptroller of the Treasury 
similarly declined to apply the Thomas exception to a loss by fire. Thus, a 
loss by fire is a physical loss for which the accountable officer is liable, but 
for which relief will be granted under 31 U.S.C. § 3527 if the statutory 
conditions are met. Examples are B-212515, Dec. 21, 1983, and B-203726, 
July 10, 1981. 

If money is taken in a burglary, robbery, or other form of theft, the 
accountable officer will be relieved of liability if the following conditions 
are met: 

• There is sufficient evidence that a theft took place;38 
• There is no evidence implicating, or indicating contributing negligence 
by, the accountable officer; and 
• The agency has made the administrative determinations required by the 
relief statute. 
The fact patterns tend to fall into several well-defined categories. 

38 The mere designation of a loss as a “burglary” without supporting evidence is not enough 
to remove it from the “unexplained loss” category. E.g., B-210358, July 21, 1983. 

Page 9-61 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

(1) Burglary: forced entry 
Forced entry cases tend to be fairly straightforward. In the typical case, a 
government office is broken into while the office is closed for the night or 
over a weekend, and money is stolen. Evidence of the forced entry is clear. 
As long as there is no evidence implicating the accountable officer, no 
other contributing fault or negligence, and the requisite administrative 
determinations are made, relief is granted. A few examples follow:39 

• Burglars broke into the welding shop at a government laboratory, took 
a blowtorch and acetylene tanks to the administrative office and used 
them to cut open the safe. B-242773, Feb. 20, 1991. 
• Cashier’s office was robbed over a weekend. Office had been forcibly 
entered, but there was no evidence of forced entry into the safe. 
Federal Bureau of Investigation found no evidence of negligence or 
breach of security by any government personnel associated with the 
office. B-193174, Nov. 29, 1978. See also B-260862, June 6, 1995. 
• Persons unknown broke front door lock of Bureau of Indian Affairs 
office in Alaska and removed safe on sled. Sled tracks led to an 
abandoned building in which the safe was found with its door removed. 
B-182590, Feb. 3, 1975. 

• Unsecured bolt cutters found on premises used to remove safe padlock. 
No contributing negligence because there was no separate facility in 
which to secure the tools. B-202290, June 5, 1981. 
The same principles apply to theft from a hotel room. 69 Comp. Gen. 586 
(1990); B-229847, Jan. 29, 1988. Note, however, that relief was not granted 
in the case of a theft of cash stashed under the front seat of a locked 
vehicle left in an area where several vehicles had been broken into recently, 
since leaving cash in such a manner was not a prudent way to safeguard the 
funds. B-257120, Dec. 13, 1994. 

39 There are numerous forced entry cases in which GAO granted relief under similar 
circumstances. A few additional examples are B-241820, Jan. 2, 1991; B-239780, June 18, 
1990; B-230607, June 20, 1988; B-205428, Dec. 31, 1981; B-201651, Feb. 9, 1981.

Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

(2) Robbery 
In this situation, one or more individuals, armed or credibly pretending to 
be armed, rob an accountable officer. Again, as long as there is no evidence 
implicating the accountable officer and no contributing negligence, relief is 
granted. The accountable officer is not expected to risk his or her life by 
resisting. Depending on the circumstances, it is not necessary that the thief 
be, or pretend to be, armed. An example is the common purse-snatching 
incident. B-197021, May 9, 1980; B-193866, Mar. 14, 1979. Some illustrative 
robbery cases follow:40 

• Armed robber forced cashier to open the safe at gunpoint, shot the 
cashier, and stole the funds. B-261261, Aug. 31, 1995. 
• Gunman entered cashier’s office, knocked cashier unconscious, and 
robbed safe. B-235458, Aug. 23, 1990. 
• Man entered cashier’s office in a veterans hospital and handed cashier a 
note demanding all of her $20 bills. Although he did not display a 
weapon, he said he was armed. B-191579, May 22, 1978. A very similar 
case is B-237420, Dec. 8, 1989 (man gave cashier note indicating bomb 
threat; upon running off with the money, he left a second note saying 
“no bomb”). 
(3) Riot, public disturbance 
This category includes the popular pastime of ransacking American 
embassies. The Supreme Court’s second exception in United States v. 
Thomas, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 337 (1872) (see Fire, Natural Disaster in 
section C.3.h of this chapter) to an accountable officer’s strict liability is 
funds taken by a “public enemy.” That case concerned the Civil War. As 
with the “overruling necessity” exception, we are aware of no further 
definition of “public enemy” in this context, and the cases cited here have 
consistently been treated as accountable officer losses. In any event, relief 

40 Some other examples are B-260915, Apr. 3, 1995; B-217773, Mar. 18, 1985; B-211945, 
July 18, 1983; and B-201126, Jan. 27, 1981. 

Page 9-63 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

is routinely granted unless there is contributing negligence. Thus, GAO 
granted relief in the following cases:41 

• Armed soldiers forced entry into U.S. Information Agency compound in 
Beirut, Lebanon, and looted safe. B-195435, Sept. 12, 1979. 
• Cash equivalents stolen when embassy in Belgrade, Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, was ransacked. B-288014, May 17, 2002. 
• Funds taken during attack on American Embassy in Tehran, Iran. 
B-229753, Dec. 30, 1987; B-194666, Aug. 6, 1979 (separate attacks, both 
occurring in 1979). 
• Loss of Secret Service confidential funds resulting from terrorist attack 
on World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. B-300677, June 19, 2003. 
• Safes looted by Cuban detainees during prison riot. B-232252, Jan. 5, 
1989; B-230796, Apr. 8, 1988. 
(4) Evidence less than certain 
In all of the cases cited above dealing with forced entry, armed robbery, or 
rioting, the fact that a theft had taken place was beyond question. 
However, there are many cases in which the evidence of theft is not all that 
clear. The losses are unexplained in the sense that what happened cannot 
be determined with any certainty. The problem then becomes whether the 
indications of theft are sufficient to classify the loss as a theft and thereby 
to rebut the presumption of negligence. 

These tend to be the most difficult cases to resolve. The difficulty stems 
from the fact, which we have noted previously, that the accountable officer 
laws are designed to protect the government against dishonesty as well as 
negligence. On the one hand, an accountable officer who did all he or she 
could to safeguard the funds should be relieved of liability. But on the 
other hand, the application of the relief statutes should not provide a 
blueprint for (or absolution from) dishonesty. Recognizing that complete 
certainty is impossible in many if not most cases, the decisions try to 

41 Further examples are B-249372, Aug. 13, 1992 (Somalia); B-230606.2, Sept. 6, 1988 (Iran); 
B-227422, June 18, 1987 (Tripoli); B-207059, July 1, 1982 (Chad); and B-190205, Nov. 14, 1977 
(Zaire). 

Page 9-64 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

achieve a balance between these two considerations. Thus, GAO gives 
weight to the administrative determinations and to statements of the 
individuals concerned, but these factors cannot be conclusive and the 
decision will be based on all of the evidence. Other relevant factors include 
how and where the safe combination was stored, when it was last changed, 
whether the combination dial was susceptible of observation while the safe 
was being opened, access to the safe and to the facility itself, and the 
safeguarding of keys to cash boxes. 

For example, in B-198836, June 26, 1980, funds were kept in the bottom 
drawer of a four-drawer file cabinet. Each drawer had a separate key lock 
and the cabinet itself was secured by a steel bar and padlock. Upon 
arriving at work one morning, the cashier found the bottom drawer slightly 
out of alignment with several pry marks on its edges. A police investigation 
was inconclusive. GAO viewed the evidence as sufficient to support a 
conclusion of burglary and, since the record contained no indication of 
negligence on the part of the cashier, granted relief. 

In another case, a safe was found unlocked with no signs of forcible entry. 
However, there was evidence that a thief had entered the office door by 
breaking a window. The accountable officer stated that he had locked the 
safe before going home the previous evening, and there was no evidence to 
contradict this or to indicate any other negligence. GAO accepted the 
accountable officer’s uncontroverted statement and granted relief. 
B-188733, Mar. 29, 1979. See also B-260862, June 6, 1995; B-242830, Sept. 24, 
1991; B-210017, June 8, 1983. 

In B-170596-O.M., Nov. 16, 1970, the accountable officer stated that she had 
found the padlock on and locked in reverse from the way she always 
locked it. Her statement was corroborated by the agency investigation. In 
addition, the lock did not conform to agency specifications, but this was 
not the cashier’s responsibility. She had used the facilities officially 
provided for her. Relief was granted. 

Relief was also granted in B-170615-O.M., Nov. 23, 1971, reversing upon 
reconsideration B-170615-O.M., Dec. 2, 1970. In that case, there was some 
evidence that the office lock had been pried open but there were no signs 
of forcible entry into the safe. This suggested the possibility of negligence 
either in failing to lock the safe or in not adequately safeguarding the 
combination. However, the accountable officer’s supervisor stated that he 
(the supervisor) had locked the safe at the close of business on the 
preceding workday, and two safe company representatives provided 

Page 9-65 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

statements that the safe was vulnerable and could have been opened by 
anyone with some knowledge of safe combinations. See also B-242830, 
Sept. 24, 1991. 

The occurrence of more than one loss under similar circumstances within a 
relatively short time will tend to corroborate the likelihood of theft. 
B-199021, Sept. 2, 1980; B-193416, Oct. 25, 1979. In B-199021, two losses 
occurred in the same building within several weeks of each other. All 
agency security procedures had been followed and the record indicated 
that the cashier had exercised a very high degree of care in safeguarding 
the funds. In B-193416, the first loss was totally unexplained, and the entire 
cash box disappeared a week later. The safe combination had been kept in 
a sealed envelope in a “working safe” to which other employees had access. 
Although the seal on the envelope was not broken, an investigation showed 
that, while the combination could not be read by holding the envelope up to 
normal light, it could be read by holding it up to stronger light. In neither 
case was there any evidence of forcible entry or of negligence on the part of 
the accountable officer. Balancing the various relevant factors in each 
case, GAO granted relief. 

The disappearance of an entire cash box will also be viewed as an 
indication of theft. However, this factor standing alone will not be 
conclusive since there is nothing to prevent a dishonest employee from 
simply taking the whole box rather than a handful of money from it. Signs 
of forced entry to the safe or file cabinet will naturally reinforce the theft 
conclusion. E.g., B-229136, Jan. 22, 1988; B-186190, May 11, 1976. Far more 
difficult are cases in which a cash box disappears with no signs of forcible 
entry to the container in which it was kept. Note the various additional 
factors viewed as relevant in each of the following cases: 

• Police were able to open file cabinet with a different key, and other 
thefts had occurred around the same time. Relief granted. B-223602, 
Aug. 25, 1986. 
• Safe was not rated for burglary protection and could have been opened 
fairly easily by manipulating the combination dial. Relief granted. 
B-189658, Sept. 20, 1977. 

• Supervisor’s secretary maintained a log of all safe and bar-lock 
combinations, a breach of security which could have resulted in the 
compromise of the combination. Relief granted. B-189896, Nov. 1, 
1977. 
Page 9-66 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

• Cashier locked safe and checked it in the presence of a guard. Several 
other employees had access to the safe combination. Relief granted. 
B-173133-O.M., Dec. 10, 1973. Multiple access also contributed to the 
granting of relief in B-241201.2, Apr. 15, 1992; B-235167, Jan. 8, 1990; 
B-217945, July 23, 1985; and B-212605, Apr. 19, 1984.42 
• Safe was malfunctioning at time of loss. Relief granted. B-183284, 
June 17, 1975. 
• Extensive security violations attributable to agency. Relief granted. 
B-211649, Aug. 2, 1983. See also B-235167, Jan. 8, 1990; B-197799, 
June 18, 1980. 
• Some evidence of forced entry to door of cashier’s office but not to safe 
or safe drawer. Cash box later found in men’s room. Negligence by 
cashier in improperly storing keys and safe combination in unlocked 
desk drawer not proximate cause of loss since seal on envelope was 
found intact. Relief granted. B-185666, July 27, 1976. Compare 
70 Comp. Gen. 12 (1990) (cashier denied relief because she negligently 
stored the cash box key, not in an envelope, in the back of her top 
center desk drawer which did not lock and kept a copy of the safe 
combination taped to the underside of an accessible pull-out panel on 
her desk). 
• Cash box disappeared during 2-week absence of cashier. Even 
assuming cashier negligently failed to lock safe prior to her absence, 
there was no way to establish this as the proximate cause of the loss 
since box had been kept in a “working safe” which would have been 
opened daily in her absence. Relief granted. B-191942, Sept. 12, 1979. 
• Cashier went on leave without properly securing key to file cabinet or 
entrusting it to an alternate. Relief denied. B-182480, Feb. 3, 1975. 
• Cashier had been experiencing difficulty trying to lock the safe and 
stated she might have left it unlocked inadvertently. Relief denied. 
B-184028, Mar. 2, 1976. 

42 A key inquiry in this type of case, and a crucial factor in deciding whether to grant or deny 
relief, is the extent to which the accountable officer is responsible for the nonexclusive 
access to the safe combination. 

Page 9-67 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

To summarize the “cash box” cases, the disappearance of an entire cash 
box suggests theft but is not conclusive. In such cases, even though the 
cause of the loss cannot be definitely attributed, relief will probably be 
granted if there is uncontroverted evidence that the safe was locked, no 
other evidence of contributing fault or negligence on the part of the 
accountable officer, and especially if there are other factors present 
tending to corroborate the likelihood of theft. In no case has relief been 
granted based solely on the fact that a cash box disappeared; without more, 
it is simply another type of unexplained loss for which there is no basis for 
relief. 

(5) Embezzlement 
The term “embezzlement” means the fraudulent misappropriation of 
property by someone to whom it has lawfully been entrusted. Black’s Law 
Dictionary 540 (7th ed. 1999). Losses due to embezzlement or fraudulent 
acts of subordinate finance personnel, acting alone or in collusion with 
others, are treated as physical losses and relief will be granted if the 
statutory conditions are met. B-260563, Mar. 31, 1995; B-244113, Nov. 1, 
1991; B-202074, July 21, 1983, at 6; B-211763, July 8, 1983; B-133862-O.M., 
Nov. 29, 1957; B-101375-O.M., Apr. 16, 1951. 

An illustrative group of cases involves the embezzlement of tax collections, 
under various schemes, by employees of the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). In each case the IRS pursued the perpetrators, and most were 
prosecuted and convicted. The IRS recovered what it could from the (now 
former) employees, and sought relief for the balance for the pertinent 
supervisor in whose name the account was held. In each case, GAO agreed 
with the “no fault or negligence” determination and granted relief. 

B-270863, June 17, 1996; B-265853, Jan. 23, 1996; B-260563, Mar. 31, 1995; 
B-244113, Nov. 1, 1991; B-226214 et al., June 18, 1987; B-215501, Nov. 5, 
1984; B-192567, Nov. 3, 1978; B-191722, Aug. 7, 1978; B-191781, June 30, 
1978. 

The accountable officer in each of the IRS cases was a supervisor who did 
not actually handle the funds. The approach to evaluating the presence or 
absence of negligence when the accountable officer is a supervisor is to 
review the existence and adequacy of internal controls and procedures and 
to ask whether the accountable officer provided reasonable supervision. If 
internal controls and management procedures are reasonable and were 
being followed, relief will be granted. As noted in B-226214 et al., June 18, 
1987, the standard does not expect perfection and recognizes that a clever

criminal scheme can outwit the most carefully established and supervised 
system. See also B-270863, June 17, 1996; B-260563, Mar. 31, 1995. 

Losses resulting from the fraudulent acts of other than subordinate finance 
personnel (e.g., payments on fraudulent vouchers) are not physical losses 
but must be treated as improper payments. See B-287043, May 29, 2001; 
2 Comp. Gen. 277 (1922); B-248517, Oct. 20, 1992; B-202074, July 21, 1983; 
B-76903, July 13, 1948; B-133862-O.M., Nov. 29, 1957. 

In evaluating virtually any physical loss case, physical security—the 
existence, adequacy, and use of safekeeping facilities and procedures—is a 
crucial consideration. The Department of the Treasury Financial 
Management Service’s Manual of Procedures and Instructions for 
Cashiers (hereafter Cashier’s Manual) (April 2001) sets forth many of the 
requirements.43 For example, the Cashier’s Manual provides that safe 
combinations should be changed annually, whenever there is a change of 
cashiers, or when the combination has been compromised, and prescribes 
procedures for safeguarding the combination. It also reflects what is 
perhaps the most fundamental principle of sound cash control—that an 
employee with custody of public funds should have exclusive control over 
those funds. In addition, agencies should have their own specific 
regulations or instructions tailored to individual circumstances. Cashier’s 
Manual, § VI at 14. 

The first step in analyzing the effect of a security violation or deficiency is 
to determine whether the violation or deficiency is attributable to the 
accountable officer or to the agency. Two fundamental premises drive this 
analysis: (1) the accountable officer is responsible for safeguarding the 
funds in his or her custody; and (2) the agency is responsible for providing 
adequate means to do so. Adequate means includes both physical facilities 
and administrative procedures. 

Basically, if the accountable officer fails to use the facilities and procedures 
that have been provided, this failure will be viewed as negligence and, 
unless some other factor appears to be the proximate cause of the loss, will 
preclude the granting of relief. Several examples have been previously 
cited under the Actual Negligence heading, section C.3.c of this chapter. 

43 See also the discussion of the Cashier’s Manual and imprest funds in sections B.2.c and 

B.3.aof this chapter.

Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Another element of the accountable officer’s responsibility is the duty to 
report security weaknesses to appropriate supervisory personnel. E.g., 
63 Comp. Gen. 489, 492 (1984), rev’d on other grounds, 65 Comp. Gen. 876 
(1986). If the agency fails to respond, a loss attributable to the reported 
weakness is not the accountable officer’s fault. E.g., B-235147.2, Aug. 14, 
1991; B-208511, May 9, 1983. 

Ultimately, an accountable officer can do no more than use the best that 
has been made available, and relief will not be denied for failure to follow 
adequate security measures which are beyond the accountable officer’s 
control. E.g., B-226947, July 27, 1987 (U.S. Mint employees stole coins from 
temporarily leased facility which was incapable of adequate security); 
B-207062, May 12, 1983 (agent kept collections in his possession because, 
upon returning to office at 4:30 p.m., he found all storage facilities locked 
and all senior officials had left for the day); B-210245, Feb. 10, 1983 
(lockable gun cabinet was the most secure item available); B-186190, 
May 11, 1976 (funds kept in safe with padlock because combination safe, 
which had been ordered, had not yet arrived); B-78617, June 24, 1949 
(agency failed to provide safe). Of course, the accountable officer is 
expected to act to correct weaknesses that are subject to his or her control. 

B-127204, Apr. 13, 1956. 

The principle that relief will be granted if the agency fails to provide 
adequate security and that failure is viewed as the proximate cause of the 
loss manifests itself in a variety of contexts. One group of cases involves 
multiple violations. In B-182386, Apr. 24, 1975, imprest funds were found 
missing when a safe was opened for audit. The accountable officer was 
found to be negligent for failing to follow approved procedures. However, 
the agency’s investigation disclosed a number of security violations 
attributable to the agency. Two cashiers operated from the same cash box; 
transfers of custody were not documented; the safe combination had not 
been changed despite several changes of cashiers; at least five persons 
knew the safe combination. The agency, in recommending relief, 
concluded that the loss was caused by “pervasive laxity in the protection 
and administration of the funds . . . on all levels.” GAO agreed, noting that 
the lax security “precludes the definite placement of responsibility” for the 
loss, and granted relief. 

In several later unexplained loss cases (no sign of forcible entry, no 
indication of fault or negligence on the part of the accountable officer), 
GAO has regarded overall lax security on the part of the agency, similar to 
that in B-182386, as the proximate cause of the loss and thus granted relief. 

Page 9-70 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

B-271896, Mar. 4, 1997; B-243324, Apr. 17, 1991; B-229778, Sept. 2, 1988; 
B-226847, June 25, 1987; B-217876, Apr. 29, 1986; B-211962, Dec. 10, 1985; 
B-211649, Aug. 2, 1983. All of these cases involved numerous security 
violations beyond the accountable officer’s control, and several adopt the 
“pervasive laxity” characterization of B-182386. 

However, in order for relief to be granted, security weaknesses attributable 
to the agency need not rise to the level of “pervasive laxity” encountered in 
the cases cited in the preceding paragraph. Thus, relief will usually be 
granted where several persons other than the accountable officer have 
access to the funds through knowledge of the safe combination since 
“multiple access” makes it impossible to attribute the loss to the 
accountable officer. B-241201.2, Apr. 15, 1992; B-235368, Apr. 19, 1991; 
B-235072, July 5, 1989; B-228884, Oct. 13, 1987; B-214080, Mar. 25, 1986; 
B-211233, June 28, 1983; B-209569, Apr. 13, 1983; B-196855, Dec. 9, 1981; 

B-199034, Feb. 9, 1981. Additional cases are cited in our earlier discussion 
of missing cash boxes. 

If multiple access to a safe will support the granting of relief for otherwise 
unexplained losses, it follows that multiple access to a cash box or drawer 
will have the same effect. The Cashier’s Manual provides that cashiers 
should never work out of the same cash box or drawer. Cashier’s Manual, 
§ VI at 14. Violation of this requirement, where beyond the control of the 
accountable officer, is a security breach that, in appropriate cases, has 
supported the granting of relief. B-227714, Oct. 20, 1987; B-204647, Feb. 8, 
1982. If it is necessary for more than one cashier to work out of the same 
safe, the safe should preferably have separate built-in locking drawers 
rather than removable cash boxes. B-191942, Sept. 12, 1979. 

The following security deficiencies have also contributed to the granting of 
relief: 

• Cash box could be opened with other keys. B-203646, Nov. 30, 1981; 
B-197270, Mar. 7, 1980. 

• Crimping device used to seal cash bags did not use sequentially 
numbered seals and was accessible to several employees. B-246988, 
Feb. 27, 1992. 
• Failure to change safe combination as required by Treasury regulations. 
B-211233, June 28, 1983; B-196855, Dec. 9, 1981. (Both cases also 
involve multiple access.) 
Page 9-71 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

• Safe combination and key to cash drawer were kept in an unlocked 
desk drawer. B-177963-O.M., Mar. 21, 1973. (The result would most 
likely be different if the violation were the fault of the accountable 
officer or if the accountable officer passively acquiesced in the breach. 
See B-185666, July 27, 1976.) 
• Safe combination could be read through the sealed envelope in which it 
was kept. B-243324, Apr. 17, 1991. 
• Safe malfunctioning, defective, or otherwise not secure. B-271896, 
Mar. 4, 1997; B-221447, June 1, 1987; B-215477, Nov. 5, 1984; B-183284, 
June 17, 1975. 
The preceding cases are mostly unexplained losses. It naturally follows 
that security violations of the type noted will contribute to rebutting the 
presumption of negligence in cases where there is clear evidence of theft. 
In B-184493, Oct. 8, 1975, for example, there was evidence of forced entry 
to the office door but not to the safe. The record showed that, despite the 
accountable officer’s best efforts, it was impossible for him to shield the 
dial from observation while opening the safe. In view of the office layout, 
the position of the safe, and the number of persons allowed access to the 
office, GAO granted relief.44 Other examples are: B-241201.2, Apr. 15, 1992, 
B-243324, Apr. 17, 1991, and B-180664-O.M., Apr. 23, 1974 (multiple access 
to safe); and B-170251-O.M., Oct. 24, 1972 (insecure safe). 

If there is evidence of negligence on the part of the accountable officer in 
conjunction with security deficiencies attributable to the agency, the 
accountable officer’s negligence must be balanced against the agency’s 
negligence. Relief may be granted or denied based largely on the 
proximate cause analysis. As with the unexplained loss cases, relief has 
been granted in a number of cases where the agency’s violations could be 
said to amount to “pervasive laxity.” B-235147.2, Aug. 14, 1991; B-197799, 
June 19, 1980; B-182386, Apr. 24, 1975; B-169756-O.M., July 8, 1970. 

Similarly, agency security violations which do not amount to pervasive 
laxity may support the granting of relief. Such violations must either be the 
proximate cause of the loss or make it impossible to attribute the loss to 
the accountable officer. In a 1971 case, for example, a cashier kept the 
combinations to three safes on an adding machine tape in her wallet. The 

44 An explanation of this type may or may not be sufficient, depending on the particular 
facts. See B-170012, Aug. 11, 1970; B-127204, Apr. 13, 1956. 

Page 9-72 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

agency failed to change the combinations after the wallet was stolen. Also, 
safe company representatives stated that one safe was vulnerable and 
could readily have been opened. The fact that only the vulnerable safe had 
been robbed supported the conclusion that the stolen combinations had 
not been used. B-170615-O.M., Nov. 23, 1971. Other cases in which agency 
security violations were found to override negligence by the accountable 
officer are B-232744, Dec. 9, 1988 (safe combination not changed despite 
several requests by accountable officer following possible compromise); 
B-205985, July 12, 1982 (multiple access, safe combination not changed as 
required); B-199128, Nov. 7, 1980 (multiple access); B-191440, May 25, 1979 
(two cashiers working out of same drawer). 

The result in these cases should not be taken too far. Poor agency security 
does not guarantee relief; it is merely another factor to consider in the 
proximate cause equation. Another relevant factor is the nature and extent 
of the accountable officer’s efforts to improve the situation. 

Where security weaknesses exist, a supervisor will normally be in a better 
position to take or initiate corrective action, and a supervisor who is also 
an accountable officer may be found negligent for failing to do so. 
63 Comp. Gen. 489 (1984), rev’d upon reconsideration, 65 Comp. Gen. 876 
(1986) (new evidence presented); 60 Comp. Gen. 674, 676 (1981). However, 
a new supervisor should not be held immediately responsible for the 
situation he or she inherited. B-209715, Apr. 4, 1983 (supervisor relieved in 
pervasive laxity situation where loss occurred only a week after he became 
accountable). 

A close reading of the numerous security cases reveals the somewhat 
anomalous result that an accountable officer who works in a sloppy 
operation stands a much better chance of being relieved than one who 
works in a well-managed office. True as this may be, it would be wrong to 
hold accountable officers liable for conditions beyond their control. 
Rather, the solution lies in the proper recognition and implementation of 
the responsibility of each agency, mandated by the Federal Managers’ 
Financial Integrity Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. § 3512(c)(1), to safeguard its 
assets against loss and misappropriation. 

k. Extenuating Circumstances Since relief under 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527(a) and (b) is a creature of statute, it 
must be granted or denied solely in accordance with the statutory 
conditions. When Congress desires that “equitable” concerns be taken into 
Page 9-73 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

consideration, it expressly so states. Examples are waiver statutes such as 
5 U.S.C. § 5584 and 10 U.S.C. § 2774.45 In contrast, the physical loss relief 
statutes do not authorize the granting of relief on the basis of equitable 
considerations or extenuating or mitigating circumstances. 

Thus, where an accountable officer has been found negligent, the following 
factors have been held not relevant, nor are they sufficient to rebut the 
presumption of negligence: 

• Acceptance of extra duties by the accountable officer; shortage of 
personnel. B-186127, Sept. 1, 1976. 
• Financial hardship of having to repay loss. B-239387, Apr. 24, 1991; 
B-241478, Apr. 5, 1991; B-216279.2, Dec. 30, 1985. 
• Good work record; long period of loyal and dependable service; 
evidence of accountable officer’s good reputation and character. 
B-241478, Apr. 5, 1991; B-204173, Nov. 9, 1982; B-170012, Aug. 11, 1970; 

B-158699, Sept. 6, 1968. 

• Heavy work load. 67 Comp. Gen. 6 (1987); 48 Comp. Gen. 566 (1969); 
B-241201, Aug. 23, 1991, rev’d on reconsideration, B-241201.2, Apr. 15, 
1992 (reversed on other grounds—new evidence submitted indicating 
multiple access). 
• Inexperience; inadequate training or supervision. 70 Comp. Gen. 389 
(1991); B-257120, Dec. 13, 1994; B-189084, Jan. 3, 1979; B-191051, 
July 31, 1978. 
45 These statutory provisions authorize, in certain circumstances, the waiver of claims 
against federal employees and service members for recovery of erroneous payments of pay 
and allowances “the collection of which would be against equity and good conscience and 
not in the best interests of the United States.”

D. Illegal or Improper 
Payment 
1. Disbursement and 
Accountability 
a. Statutory Framework: 
Disbursement Under 
Executive Order No. 6166 
In order to understand the laws governing liability and relief for improper 
payments, and how the application of those laws evolved over the last 
quarter of the twentieth century, it is helpful to start by summarizing, from 
the accountability perspective, a few points relating to how the federal 
government disburses its money. 

For most of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth 
century, federal disbursement was decentralized. Each agency had its own 
disbursing office(s), and the function was performed by a small army of 
disbursing officers and clerks (who were accountable officers) scattered 
among the various agencies and throughout the country. In part, the reason 
for this was the primitive state of communication and transportation then 
existing. One of the weaknesses of this system was that, in many cases, 
vouchers were prepared, examined, and paid by the same person. 
20 Comp. Dec. 859, 869 (1914). This resulted in the growth of large 
disbursing offices in several agencies, some of which exceeded in size that 
of the Treasury Department. GAO, Annual Report of the Comptroller 
General of the United States for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1939 

(Washington, D.C.: 1939), at 98. 

From the perspective of accountability for improper payments, the modern 
legal structure of federal disbursing evolved in three major steps. First, 
Congress enacted legislation on August 23, 1912,46 the remnants of which 
are found at 31 U.S.C. § 3521(a), to prohibit disbursing officers from 
preparing and auditing their own vouchers. With this newly mandated 
separation of voucher preparation and examination from actual payment, 
payment was accomplished by having some other administrative official 
“certify” the correctness of the voucher to the disbursing officer. The 1912 
legislation was thus the genesis of what would later become a new class of 
accountable officer—the certifying officer. 

Disbursing officers remained accountable for improper payments, the 
standard now reflecting the more limited nature of the function. Since the 

46 Pub. L. No. 299, ch. 350, 37 Stat. 375. 

Page 9-75 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

1912 law was intended to prohibit the disbursing officer from duplicating 
the detailed voucher examination already performed by the certifying 
officer, disbursing officers were held liable only for errors apparent on the 
face of the voucher, as well as, of course, payments prohibited by law or for 
which no appropriation was available. 20 Comp. Dec. 859 (1914). In a 
sense, the 1912 statute operated in part as a relief statute, with credit being 
allowed or disallowed in the disbursing officer’s account based on the 
application of this standard. E.g., 4 Comp. Gen. 991 (1925); 3 Comp. 
Gen. 441 (1924). 

The second major step in the evolution was section 4 of Executive Order 
No. 6166, signed by President Roosevelt on June 10, 1933 (see note at 
5 U.S.C. § 901). The first paragraph of section 4, codified at 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3321(a), consolidated the disbursing function in the Treasury 
Department, eliminating the separate disbursing offices of the other 
executive departments. The second paragraph, codified at 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3321(b), authorizes Treasury to delegate disbursing authority to other 
executive agencies for purposes of efficiency and economy. The third 
paragraph gave new emphasis to the certification function: 

“The Division of Disbursement [Treasury Department] shall 
disburse moneys only upon the certification of persons by 
law duly authorized to incur obligations upon behalf of the 
United States. The function of accountability for improper 
certification shall be transferred to such persons, and no 
disbursing officer shall be held accountable therefor.” 

The following year, Executive Order No. 6728, May 29, 1934 (see note at 
5 U.S.C. § 901), exempted the military departments from the centralization. 
This exemption, an exemption for the United States Marshals Service 
which originated in a 1940 reorganization plan, and an exemption for 
certain expenditures of the Coast Guard47 are codified at 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3321(c). Executive Order No. 6166 provided the framework for the 
disbursing system still in effect today. Apart from the specified 
exemptions, the certifying officer is now an employee of the spending 
agency, and the disbursing officer is an employee of the Treasury 
Department. 

47 The Coast Guard exemption was added by Pub. L. No. 104-201, div. A, title X, § 1009(a)(1), 
110 Stat. 2422, 2633 (Sept. 23, 1996). 

Page 9-76 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Disbursing officers continued to be liable for their own errors, as under the 
1912 legislation. E.g., 13 Comp. Gen. 469 (1934). However, a major 
consequence of Executive Order No. 6166 was to make the certifying 
officer an accountable officer as well. The certifying officer became liable 
for improper payments “caused solely by an improper certification as to 
matters not within the knowledge of or available to the disbursing officer.” 
13 Comp. Gen. 326, 329 (1934). See also 15 Comp. Gen. 986 (1936); 
15 Comp. Gen. 362 (1935). 

Over the next few years, confusion and disagreement developed as to the 
precise relationship of certifying officers and disbursing officers with 
respect to liability for improper payments. In the Annual Report of the 
Comptroller General of the United States for the Fiscal Year Ended 
June 30, 1940 (Washington, D.C.: 1941) at pages 63–66, GAO summarized 
the problem and recommended legislation to specify the allocation of 
responsibilities “to provide the closest possible relationship between 
liability and fault” (id. at 64). 

The third major evolutionary step was the enactment of Public Law No. 77389, 
ch. 641, 55 Stat. 875 (Dec. 29, 1941) to implement GAO’s 
recommendation. Section 1, 31 U.S.C. § 3325(a), reflects the substance of 
the third paragraph of Executive Order No. 6166, § 4, quoted above. It 
requires that a disbursing officer disburse money only in accordance with a 
voucher certified by the head of the spending agency or an authorized 
certifying officer who, except for some interagency transactions, will also 
be an employee of the spending agency. As with the amended Executive 
Order No. 6166 itself, section 3325(a) does not apply to disbursements of 
the military departments or certain expenses of the Coast Guard. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3325(b). The rest of the statute, which we will discuss in detail later, 
delineates the responsibilities of certifying and disbursing officers and 
provides a mechanism for the administrative relief of certifying officers. 
(Comparable authority to relieve disbursing officers from liability for 
improper payments was not to come about until 1955.) Further detail on 
the federal disbursement system may be found in the Treasury Financial 
Manual, volume I, part 4 (2004), and GAO’s Policy and Procedures Manual 
for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, chapter 6 (Washington, D.C.: 
May 18, 1993). 

It should be apparent that control of the public treasury must repose in the 
hands of federal officials. However, this does not mean that every task in 
the disbursement process must be performed by a government employee. 
For example, GAO has advised that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is 

Page 9-77 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

b. Automated Payment 
Systems 
authorized as a matter of law to contract with a private bank to perform 
certain ministerial or operational aspects of disbursing Indian trust fund 
money, such as printing checks, delivering checks to payees, and debiting 
amounts from accounts. However, in order to comply with 31 U.S.C. 
§§ 3321 and 3325, a federal disbursing officer must retain managerial and 
judgmental responsibility. 69 Comp. Gen. 314 (1990). The decision 
concluded: 

“[W]e see no reason to object to a contractual arrangement 
whereby a private contractor provides disbursement 
services, so long as a government disbursing officer remains 
responsible for reviewing and overseeing the disbursement 
operations through agency installed controls designed to 
assure accurate and proper disbursements.” 

Id. at 319. To intrude further into this responsibility would require clear 
statutory authority. E.g., B-210545-O.M., June 6, 1983 (Indian Health 
Service would need statutory authority to use fiscal intermediaries to pay 
claims by providers; memorandum cites examples of such authority in 
Medicare legislation). 

The statutory framework we have just described came into existence at a 
time when all disbursing was done manually. The certifying officer and his 
or her staff would review the supporting documentation for each payment 
voucher. The certifying officer would then sign the voucher, certifying to 
its legality and accuracy, and send it on to the disbursing officer. The 
increased use of automated payment systems has changed the way 
certifying officers must operate. Perhaps the clearest example is payroll 
certification. A certifying officer may be asked to certify a grand total 
accompanied by computer tapes containing payrolls involving millions of 
dollars. There is no way the certifying officer can verify that each payment 
is accurate and legal. Even if it were reasonably possible, the cost of doing 
it would be prohibitive. 

With the onslaught of the computer age, it was natural and inevitable to ask 
how accountability would function in a computerized environment. Since 
many of the assumptions of a manual system were unrealistic under an 
automated system, something had to change. GAO reviewed the impact of 
computerization in a report entitled New Methods Needed for Checking 
Payments Made by Computers, FGMSD-76-82 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 7, 
1977). The report recognized that, while the certifying officer’s basic legal 
liability remains, the conditions in which a certifying officer may be 

Page 9-78 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

relieved under an automated payment system must be different to reflect 
the new realities. The approach to relief in this context stems from the 
following premises discussed in the report: 

• In automated systems, evidence that the payments are accurate and 
legal must relate to the system rather than to individual transactions. 
• Certifying and disbursing officers should be provided with information 
showing that the system on which they are largely compelled to rely is 
functioning properly. 
• Reviews should be made at least annually, supplemented by interim 
checks of major system changes, to determine that the automated 
systems are operating effectively and can be relied on to produce 
payments that are accurate and legal. 
The report then concluded: 

“In the future, when a certifying or disbursing officer 
requests relief from an illegal, improper, or incorrect 
payment made using an automated system, GAO will 
continue to require the officer to show that he or she was 
not negligent in certifying payments later determined to be 
illegal or inaccurate. However, consideration will be given 
to whether or not the officer possessed evidence at the time 
of the payment approval that the system could be relied on 
to produce accurate and legal payments. In cases in which 
the designated assistant secretary or comparable official 
provides the agency head and GAO with a written statement 
that effective system controls could not be implemented 
prior to voucher preparation and certifies that the payments 
are otherwise proper, GAO will not consider the absence of 
such controls as evidence of negligence in determining 
whether the certifying official should be held liable for any 
erroneous payment prior to receipt of an advance decision. 
Of course, the traditional requirements that due care be 
exercised in making the payments and that diligent effort be 
made to recoup any erroneous payments will still be 
considered in any requests for waiver of liability. Also, 
should the certifying official fail to take reasonable steps to 
establish adequate controls for future payments, the 
reasons for such failure will be taken into account in any

requests for waiver of liability concerning such future 
payments.” 

FGMSD-76-82, at 17–18. 

A few years later, the concepts and premises of the GAO report were 
explored and reported, with implementing recommendations, in a key 
study by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program entitled 

Assuring Accurate and Legal Payments—The Roles of Certifying Officers 
in Federal Government (Washington, D.C.: June 1980).48 Further guidance 
from the internal control perspective may be found in GAO, Public Key 
Infrastructure: Examples of Risks and Internal Control Objectives 
Associated with Certification Authorities, GAO-04-1023R (Washington, 
D.C.: Aug. 10, 2004); GAO, Streamlining the Payment Process While 
Maintaining Effective Internal Control, GAO/AIMD-21.3.2 (Washington, 
D.C.: May 1, 2000); GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of 
Federal Agencies (hereafter GAO-PPM), title 7 (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 
1993); OMB Circular No. A-123, Management Accountability and Control 
(June 21, 1995); and OMB Circular No. A-127, Financial Management 
Systems (July 23, 1993). See also a GAO publication entitled Critical 
Factors in Developing Automated Accounting and Financial 
Management Systems, Document Accession No. 132042 (Washington, D.C.: 
January 1987). 

Thus, in considering requests for relief under an automated payment 
system where verification of individual transactions is impossible as a 
practical matter, the basic question will be the reasonableness of the 
certifying officer’s reliance on the system to continually produce legal and 
accurate payments. B-178564, Jan. 27, 1978 (confirming the conceptual 
feasibility of using automated systems to perform preaudit functions under 
various child nutrition programs). See also B-201965, June 15, 1982. 
Contexts in which system reliance is relevant are discussed in B-291001, 
Dec. 23, 2002 (proposed time and attendance system); 59 Comp. Gen. 85 
(1989) (automated “ZIP plus 4” address correction system); 59 Comp. 

48 The JFMIP was a joint undertaking of GAO, the Office of Management and Budget, the 
Treasury Department, and the Office of Personnel Management, working in cooperation 
with each other and other federal agencies to improve financial management practices in 
the federal government. Leadership and program guidance were provided by the four 
principals of JFMIP—the Comptroller General, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the 
Directors of OMB and OPM. Although JFMIP ceased to exist as a stand-alone organization 
as of December 1, 2004, the JFMIP principals continue to meet at their discretion.

c. Statistical Sampling 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Gen. 597 (1980) (electronic funds transfer program). Regardless of what 
system is used, there is of course no authority to make known 
overpayments. B-205851, June 17, 1982; B-203993-O.M., July 12, 1982. 

Statistical sampling is a procedure whereby a random selection of items 
from a universe is examined, and the results of that examination are then 
projected to the entire universe based on the laws of probability. In 1963, 
the Comptroller General held that reliance on a statistical sampling plan for 
the internal examination of vouchers prior to certification would not 
operate to relieve a certifying officer from liability for improper or 
erroneous payments. 43 Comp. Gen. 36 (1963). GAO recognized in the 
decision that an adequate statistical sampling plan could produce overall 
savings to the government, but was forced to conclude that it was not 
authorized under existing law. 

In response to this, Congress enacted legislation in 1964, now found at 
31 U.S.C. §§ 3521(b)–(d). The statute authorizes agency heads, upon 
determining that economies will result, to prescribe the use of adequate 
and effective statistical sampling procedures in the prepayment 
examination of disbursement vouchers. 

As originally enacted, 31 U.S.C. § 3521(b) was limited to vouchers not 
exceeding $100. A 1975 amendment to the statute removed the $100 limit 
and authorized the Comptroller General to prescribe maximum dollar 
limits. The current limit is $2,500. GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual 
for Guidance of Federal Agencies (hereafter GAO-PPM), title 7, § 7.4.E 
(Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993). For further guidance, see 7 GAO-PPM 
App. III, and GAO, Using Statistical Sampling, GAO/PEMD-10.1.6 
(Washington, D.C.: May 2, 1992). For vouchers over the prescribed limit, 
unless GAO has approved an exception (7 GAO-PPM App. III, § B), 
43 Comp. Gen. 36 would continue to apply. 

The relevance of all this to accountable officers is spelled out in the statute. 
A certifying or disbursing officer acting in good faith and in conformity 
with an authorized statistical sampling procedure will not be held liable for 
any certification or payment on a voucher which was not subject to specific 
examination because of the procedure. However, this does not affect the 
liability of the payee or recipient of the improper payment, and relief may 
be denied if the agency has not diligently pursued collection action against 
the recipient. 31 U.S.C. §§ 3521(c)–(d). See B-254436, Mar. 1, 1994, where 
GAO found that disbursing and certifying officers are not liable for 
payments made on unaudited vouchers under the statistical sampling

Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

d. Provisional Vouchers and 
Related Matters 
procedure provided that the agency carries out diligent collection actions 
on any improper payment. 

GAO has approved the use of statistical sampling to test the reliability of 
accelerated payment or “fast pay” systems. See, e.g., GAO, Streamlining 
the Payment Process While Maintaining Effective Internal Control, 

GAO/AIMD-21.3.2 (Washington, D.C.: May 1, 2000); 60 Comp. Gen. 602, 606 
(1981). In 67 Comp. Gen. 194 (1988), GAO for the first time considered the 
use of statistical sampling for post-payment audit in conjunction with “fast 
pay” procedures. The question arose in connection with a General Services 
Administration proposal to revise its procedures for paying and auditing 
utility invoices. GAO approved the proposal in concept, subject to several 
conditions: (1) the economic benefit to the government must exceed the 
risk of loss; (2) the plan must provide for a meaningful sampling of all 
invoices not subject to 100 percent audit; and (3) the plan must provide a 
reliable and defensible basis for the certification of payments. GAO then 
considered and approved GSA’s specific plan in 68 Comp. Gen. 618 (1989). 
As a general proposition, however, approaching the problem through 
system improvements is preferable to an alternative that involves relaxing 
controls or audit requirements. 7 GAO-PPM § 7.4.F. 

Apart from questions of automation or statistical sampling, proposals arise 
from time to time, prompted by a variety of legitimate concerns, to 
expedite or simplify the payment process. Proposals of this type invariably 
raise the potential for overpayments or erroneous payments. Therefore, 
their consequences in terms of the liability and relief of certifying and 
disbursing officers must always be considered. 

A 1974 case involved a proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency 
for the certification of “provisional vouchers” for periodic payments under 
cost-type contracts. Under the proposal, monthly vouchers certified for 
payment would be essentially unaudited except for basic mathematical and 
cumulative cost checks, subject to adjustment upon audit when the 
contract is completed. Under this system, as with statistical sampling, 
some errors could escape detection. However, certifying officers would 
not have the benefit of the protection afforded by the statistical sampling 
legislation. Since there would be a complete audit upon contract 
completion, the provisional vouchers could be certified upon a somewhat 
lesser standard of prepayment examination, but GAO pointed out that any 
such system should provide, at a minimum, for periodic audit of the 
provisional vouchers. To better protect the certifying officers, GAO 
suggested following a Defense Department procedure under which “batch 

Page 9-82 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

audits” of accumulated vouchers are conducted as frequently as deemed 
necessary based on the reliability of each contractor’s accounting and 
billing procedures, but not less than annually, again subject to final audit 
upon contract completion. B-180264, Mar. 11, 1974. 

In order to meet processing deadlines, time and attendance forms are often 
“certified” by appropriate supervisory personnel before the end of the pay 
period covered, raising the possibility that information for the latter days of 
the pay period may turn out to be erroneous. Since necessary adjustments 
can easily be made in the subsequent pay period and since the risk of loss 
to the government is viewed as remote, the provisional certification of 
payroll vouchers based on these “provisional” time and attendance records 
is acceptable. B-145729, Aug. 17, 1977 (internal memorandum). 

Simplification plans may be prompted by nothing more exotic than 
understaffing of audit resources. In B-201408, Apr. 19, 1982, an agency 
proposed an “audit resources utilization plan” whereby it would (1) attempt 
to identify high risk contractors through preaward questionnaires; (2) for 
low risk contracts below a monetary limit, substitute desk audits for field 
contract audits; and (3) encourage the use of systems audits where 
possible. GAO found no “conceptual objection” to the proposal, noting that 
the final audits discussed in B-180264, Mar. 11, 1974, did not necessarily 
have to be field audits, but emphasized that high risk contractors should be 
subject to contract audits in all cases. The decision also discusses the 
certifying officer’s role. 

Another type of simplification proposal involves lessening the degree of 
scrutiny on small payments. For example, the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) is authorized to reimburse certain low-cost supplies furnished 
to veterans under statutory training and rehabilitation programs. 
Experience taught the VA that participants could reasonably be expected to 
incur at least $35 of reimbursable supply expenses. The VA proposed to 
waive documentation and review requirements on invoices of up to $35 for 
miscellaneous supplies, and to pay essentially unsupported invoices up to 
that amount.49 GAO concurred, but added that the VA should be able to 
demonstrate that prior audits have not revealed a significant number of 
false or inappropriate claims, and that it has internal controls adequate to 

49 Invoices may be used in place of vouchers to support disbursements as long as they 
contain all required information. GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of 
Federal Agencies, title 7, § 6.2.C (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993); I TFM 4-2025.20.

Electronic Certification 
detect multiple claims for the same individual. B-221949, June 30, 1987. An 
unstated consequence of the decision is that a certifying officer who relied 
on the system, assuming it was set up in accordance with the specified 
criteria, would be relieved from liability should any of the payments turn 
out to be erroneous. 

Signature devices other than the traditional pen-and-ink signature are 
called “facsimile signatures.” The term has been defined as “an impression 
of a signature made by a rubber stamp, metal plate, or other mechanical 
contrivance.” B-194970, July 3, 1979. As a general proposition, there is no 
prohibition on the use of facsimile signatures on financial documents as 
long as adequate controls and safeguards are observed. The rule was 
stated as follows in B-48123, Nov. 5, 1965 (nondecision letter): 

“Generally, an acceptable facsimile of a signature may be 
made by a rubber stamp impression or may be reproduced 
on a metal plate or by other mechanical contrivances, the 
validity of which is derived from a signed original. An 
otherwise proper document may be so authenticated 
mechanically with the knowledge and consent or under an 
express delegation of authority from the signer of the 
original provided that appropriate safeguards are observed 
in those respects.” 

The rule has statutory recognition. In any federal statute unless otherwise 
specified, the term “signature” includes “a mark when the person making 
the same intended it as such.” 1 U.S.C. § 1; 71 Comp. Gen. 109 (1991) 
(definition of writing in 1 U.S.C. § 1 encompasses electronic data 
interchange technologies); 65 Comp. Gen. 806, 810 (1986). 

When facsimile signatures are to be used by government officials, the 
safeguards should include: 

• Standards for the authorization of the use of facsimile signatures, 
• An enumeration of the types of documents on which facsimile 
signatures may be used, 
• Physical control of the signature device to prevent unauthorized use, 
and 
Page 9-84 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

• Notification to officials authorized to use facsimile signatures that use 
of a signature device in no way lessens their responsibility or liability. 
B-140697, Oct. 28, 1959 (approving use of facsimile signatures in the 
execution of contracts). Other cases approving the use or acceptance of 
facsimile signatures are 40 Comp. Gen. 5 (1960) (use by Air Force on 
purchase orders for small purchases); 33 Comp. Gen. 297 (1954) 
(certification of invoice bearing only rubber stamp signature of vendor); 
B-194970, July 3, 1979 (certification of voucher/purchase order bearing only 
facsimile signature of contracting officer); B-150395, Dec. 21, 1962 (use by 
Navy on purchase orders); B-126776-O.M., Mar. 5, 1956 (use by Army on 
certificates of availability of government quarters and/or mess in support of 
military travel vouchers); B-104590, Sept. 12, 1951 (use on vouchers in 
federal educational grant programs).50 

A more recent case held that payment could be certified on the basis of a 
contractor’s facsimile (“fax”) invoice, again provided that the agency has 
adequate internal controls to guard against fraud and overpayments and it 
determines that accepting facsimiles is beneficial to and cost-effective for 
the government. See B-242185, Feb. 13, 1991, citing several cases 
authorizing the acceptance of carbon copies. 

One place where facsimile signatures are not permitted is the Standard 
Form 210, the signature/designation card for certifying officers which must 
be filed with the Treasury Department and which must bear the certifying 
officer’s original, manual signature. 1 TFM 4-1125. 

Most of the cases cited thus far have involved relatively primitive devices 
such as rubber stamps or signature machines. When we move into the 
realm of computerized data transmission, the equipment is far more 
sophisticated but the underlying principles are the same—there is no 
prohibition but there must be adequate safeguards. 

In the 1980s, GAO and the Treasury Department began to consider the 
feasibility of electronic certification of payment vouchers. In a 1984 
memorandum to one of GAO’s audit divisions, GAO’s General Counsel 
agreed with the Treasury Department that there is no specific legal 
requirement that a certifying officer’s certification be limited to writing on 

50 An early case, B-36459, Apr. 6, 1944, suggesting that use of facsimile signatures somehow 
required GAO approval has not been followed and should be disregarded.

paper. Then, applying the precedent of the earlier rubber stamp cases, the 
memorandum concluded that electronic certification, with adequate 
safeguards, was not legally objectionable. The “signature” could be an 
appropriate symbol adopted by the certifying officer, which should be 
unique, within the certifying officer’s sole control or custody, and capable 
of verification by the disbursing officer. B-216035-O.M., Sept. 20, 1984. 

Treasury subsequently developed a proposal for a prototype electronic 
certification system, which GAO found to adequately satisfy the statutory 
requirements for voucher certification and payment. B-216035-O.M., 
Sept. 25, 1987.51 In 1998, Congress enacted legislation that required 
executive agencies to implement procedures for the use and acceptance of 
electronic signatures. Government Paperwork Elimination Act, Pub. L. 
No. 105-277, § 1703, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-749 (Oct. 21, 1998), at 44 U.S.C. 
§ 3504 note. The E-Government Act of 2002 contains a provision to ensure 
the compatibility of executive agency methods for use and acceptance of 
electronic signatures.52 Treasury issued guidelines in 1998 for the full 
implementation of an electronic certification system as the required 
method of submission of vouchers and schedule of payments to the 
Financial Management Service. 1 TFM 4-2030.10. The guidelines provide 
that an authorized ECS (electronic certifying system) certifying officer 
“will be held responsible for the correctness of the facts stated on the 
voucher or its supporting documents, and to the effect that payment is 
proper from the appropriations shown on the basic voucher or voucherschedule.” 
1 TFM 4-2040.10. 

“Taking an exception” is a device GAO uses to formally notify an 
accountable officer of a fiscal irregularity which may result in personal 
liability. Today, this device is very rarely used. At one time, accountable 
officers had to submit all of their account documents to GAO, and GAO 
“settled” the accounts (31 U.S.C. § 3526(a)) by physically examining each 
piece of paper. Exceptions were common during that era. The nature of 
the process has evolved in recent decades in recognition of the increased 
responsibility of agencies in establishing their own financial systems and 
controls. Account settlement now is more a matter of systems evaluation 
and the review of administrative surveillance and the effectiveness of 

51 A related issue is the use of electronic technology in creating obligations under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1501. For more information on this topic, see the discussion in Chapter 7. 

52 Pub. L. No. 107-347, § 203, 116 Stat. 2899, 2912 (Dec. 17, 2002), at 44 U.S.C. § 3501 note. 

Page 9-86 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

collection and disbursement procedures. Examination of individual 
transactions by GAO is minimal. See GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual 
for Guidance of Federal Agencies (hereafter GAO-PPM), title 7, § 8.5 
(Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993). However, fiscal irregularities still come 
to GAO’s attention in various ways (through its normal audit activities, 
agency irregularity reports, etc.), and GAO may invoke the exception 
procedure when warranted by the circumstances. The process is 
summarized in 7 GAO-PPM § 8.6. Examples are noted in 65 Comp. 
Gen. 858, 861 (1986), modified by 70 Comp. Gen. 463 (1991) (massive travel 
fraud scheme), and B-194727, Oct. 30, 1979 (fraudulent misappropriation of 
mass transit grant funds by government employee). 

The first step in the exception process is the issuance of a “Notice of 
Exception” to the agency concerned. The issuance of a Notice of 
Exception does not itself constitute a definite determination of liability. It 
has been described as “in the nature of a challenge to the propriety of a 
certifying officer’s action in certifying the voucher for payment.” B-69611, 
Oct. 27, 1947. The certifying or disbursing officer, through his or her 
agency, then has the opportunity to respond to the exception. It is the 
accountable officer’s responsibility to establish the propriety of the 
payment. 13 Comp. Gen. 311 (1934). If the reply to the exception is 
satisfactory, the exception is withdrawn. E.g., B-78091, Nov. 2, 1948. If the 
reply does not provide a satisfactory basis to remove the exception, the 
item is “disallowed” in the account. 

Technically, the term “disallowance” applies only to disbursing officers 
since a certifying officer does not have physical custody of funds and does 
not have an “account” in the same sense that a disbursing officer does. 
Thus, strictly speaking, GAO “disallows an expenditure” in the account of a 
disbursing officer and “raises a charge” against a certifying officer. See 
32 Comp. Gen. 499, 501 (1953); A-48860, Apr. 14, 1950. For account 
settlement purposes, a certifying officer’s “account” consists of the 
certified vouchers and supporting documents on the basis of which 
payments have been made by a disbursing officer and included in the 
disbursing officer’s account for a particular accounting period. B-147293O.
M., Feb. 21, 1962. 

The taking of an exception does not preclude submission of a relief request 
under applicable relief legislation. As a practical matter, if the agency has 
been unable to respond satisfactorily to the Notice of Exception, the 
likelihood of there being adequate basis for relief is diminished 

Page 9-87 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

correspondingly. However, as in 65 Comp. Gen. 858, it can happen, and the 
possibility should therefore not be dismissed. 

2. Certifying Officers 
a. Duties and Liability As we have seen, a certifying officer is the official who certifies a payment 
voucher to a disbursing officer. The responsibility and accountability of 
certifying officers are specified in 31 U.S.C. § 3528(a), part of the previously 
noted 1941 legislation enacted to clarify the roles of accountable officers 
under Executive Order No. 6166, June 10, 1933 (see note at 5 U.S.C. § 901). 
The certifying officer is responsible for (1) the existence and correctness of 
the facts stated in the certificate, voucher, and supporting documentation; 
(2) the correctness of computations on the voucher; and (3) the legality of a 
proposed payment under the appropriation or fund involved. The statute 
further provides that a certifying officer will be accountable for the amount 
of any “illegal, improper, or incorrect” payment resulting from his or her 
false or misleading certification, as well as for any payment prohibited by 
law or which does not represent a legal obligation under the appropriation 
or fund involved. 
There is a recurring appropriation act provision, discussed in section C.4.b 
of Chapter 4 under the heading “Employment of Aliens,” which bars the use 
of appropriated funds to pay the compensation of a government employee 
who is not a United States citizen, subject to certain exceptions. The 
provision applies only to employees whose post of duty is in the 
continental United States. Thus, a certifying officer (or disbursing officer) 
in the continental United States must be a U.S. citizen unless one of the 
exceptions applies. There is no comparable requirement applicable to 
employees outside the continental United States. B-206288-O.M., Aug. 4, 
1982. 
A certifying officer must normally be an employee of the agency whose 
funds are being spent, but may be an employee of another agency under an 
authorized interagency transaction or agreement. 72 Comp. Gen. 279 
(1993); 59 Comp. Gen. 471 (1980); 44 Comp. Gen. 100 (1964). 
A certifying officer is liable the moment an improper payment is made as 
the result of an erroneous or misleading certification. E.g., 54 Comp. 
Gen. 112, 114 (1974). This is true whether the certification involves a 
matter of fact, a question of law, or a mixed question of law and fact. 
Page 9-88 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

55 Comp. Gen. 297, 298 (1975) (citing several other cases). As a general 
proposition, the government looks first to the certifying officer for 
reimbursement even though some other agency employee may be liable to 
the certifying officer under administrative regulations. 32 Comp. Gen. 332 
(1953); 15 Comp. Gen. 962 (1936). The fact that a certifying officer receives 
instructions from superiors to make the improper payment does not relieve 
him from liability. B-271021, Sept. 18, 1996. Also, the certifying officer’s 
liability does not depend on the government’s ability or lack of ability to 
recoup from the recipient of the improper payment. 31 Comp. Gen. 17 
(1951); 28 Comp. Gen. 17, 20 (1948). What this means is that the 
government is not obligated to seek first to recoup from the recipient, 
although it frequently does so, and of course any recovery from the 
recipient will reduce the certifying officer’s liability, at least in most cases. 

Occasionally there may be two certifying officers involved with a given 
payment, so-called “successive certifications.” The rule is that the 
responsibility of the certifying officer certifying the basic voucher is not 
diminished by the subsequent action. GAO stated the principle as follows 
in a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, B-142380, Mar. 30, 1960: 

“Where the certifying officer who certifies the voucher and 
schedule of payments is different from the certifying officer 
who certifies the basic vouchers, . . . the certifying officer 
who certifies the basic vouchers is responsible for the 
correctness of such vouchers and the certifying officer who 
certifies the voucher-schedule is responsible only for errors 
made in the preparation of the voucher-schedule.” 

See also 67 Comp. Gen. 457 (1988). 

An illustration of how this principle may apply is 55 Comp. Gen. 388 (1975), 
involving the liability of General Services Administration certifying officers 
under interagency service and support agreements with certain 
independent agencies. Under the arrangement in question, the agency 
would assume certification responsibility for the basic expenditure 
vouchers, but they would be processed for final payment through GSA, 
with GSA preparing and certifying a master voucher and schedule to be 
accompanied by a master magnetic tape. Again quoting the above passage 
from B-142380, GAO concluded that the legal liability of the GSA certifying 
officer would be limited to errors made in the final processing. See also 
72 Comp. Gen. 279 (1993), where a State Department certifying officer 
could certify an “emergency extraordinary expense voucher,” submitted by 

Page 9-89 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

a Defense Attaché, which was not accompanied by supporting 
documentation because of security considerations. The certifying officer 
was only responsible for errors made on his own processing of the voucher 
and not for the underlying propriety of the certification by the Defense 
Attaché. 

Similarly, the statutory accountability does not apply to an official who 
certifies an “adjustment voucher” used to make adjustments between 
accounts or funds in the Treasury in respect of an obligation already paid 
and which therefore does not involve paying money out of the Treasury to 
discharge an obligation. 23 Comp. Gen. 953 (1944). Although certification 
even in this situation should not be reduced to a “matter of form,” the 
accountability would attach to the certifying officer who certified the basic 
payment voucher. See 23 Comp. Gen. 181, 183–84 (1943). 

The function of certification is not perfunctory, but involves a high degree 
of responsibility. 55 Comp. Gen. 297, 299 (1975); 20 Comp. Gen. 182, 184 
(1940). This responsibility is not alleviated by the press of other work. 
B-147747, Dec. 28, 1961.53 It also involves an element of verification, the 
extent of which depends on the circumstances. For example, a voucher for 
goods or services should be supported by evidence that the goods were 
received or the services performed. 39 Comp. Gen. 548 (1960). Agencies 
are authorized to implement fast pay processes using certain controls to 
pay vendors subject to post-payment verification of the receipt and 
acceptance of goods and services ordered and the accuracy of invoices 
received. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R. pt. 13 (2005); 
GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, 
title 7, § 7.4.D (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993). Generally, an independent 
investigation of the facts is not contemplated. E.g., B-257334, June 30, 
1995; 28 Comp. Gen. 571 (1949). Similarly, where proper administrative 
safeguards exist, certifying officers need not examine time, attendance, 
and leave records in order to certify the correctness of amounts shown on 
payrolls submitted to them. 31 Comp. Gen. 17 (1951).54 A 1982 decision, 
61 Comp. Gen. 477, reviewed the safeguards proposed by a Bonneville 
Power Administration certifying officer for certifying recurring payments 

53 But see B-138601, Jan. 18, 1960, in which the volume of work was taken into consideration 
in a somewhat extreme case. 

54 Many of the cases noted in the text, such as 31 Comp. Gen. 17, arose under manual 
systems. While they would still apply under a manual system, it is important to keep in mind 
the previously discussed differences in approach between manual and automated systems.

to a regional planning body and found them adequate to satisfy 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3528. In the case of a compensatory damages award in settlement of an 
employee discrimination claim, certifying officers needed to ensure that all 
the items covered in the lump sum payment were statutorily permissible, 
that the amount of the payment did not exceed statutory limits, and that 
correct administrative procedures were followed. B-257334, June 30, 1995. 

An example of the role of a certifying officer in verifying a payment is in 
B-301184, Jan. 15, 2004, in which certifying officers twice questioned 
payment for the cost of food at a program that was offered to employees at 
their permanent duty station for which appropriated funds were not 
available. In the decision, it was stated that: 

“In matters such as this, we carefully consider the views of 
certifying officers who request a decision pursuant to 
31 U.S.C. § 3529(a)(2), in addition to those positions 
advanced by the agency’s program officials, because the 
agency’s certifying officers are the agency officials who, 
statutorily, are responsible for the propriety of all 
expenditures. 31 U.S.C. § 3528(a)(3) (‘A certifying official 
certifying a voucher is responsible for . . . the legality of a 
proposed payment under the appropriation or fund 
involved’). Unlike other agency officials, certifying officers 
are personally financially liable for improper payments that 
they certify. 31 U.S.C. § 3528(a)(4) (‘A certifying official 
certifying a voucher is responsible for . . . repaying a 
payment . . . (A) illegal, improper or incorrect because of an 
inaccurate or misleading certificate; (B) prohibited by law; 
or (C) that does not represent a legal obligation under the 
appropriation or fund involved’).” 

Whatever else the certifying officer’s verification burden may or may not 
involve, it certainly involves questioning items on the face of vouchers or 
supporting documents, which simply do not look right. For example, a 
certifying officer who certifies a voucher for payment in the full amount 
claimed, disregarding the fact that the accompanying records indicate an 
outstanding indebtedness to the government against which the sum 
claimed is available for offset, is accountable for any resulting 
overpayment. 28 Comp. Gen. 425 (1949). Similarly, certifying a voucher in 
the full amount within a prompt payment discount period without taking 
the discount will result in liability for the amount of the lost discount. 
However, a certifying officer is not liable for failing, even if negligently, to 

Page 9-91 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

certify a voucher within the time discount period. 45 Comp. Gen. 447 
(1966). 

A clear illustration of a certifying officer’s responsibility and liability 
occurred when a Department of Transportation employee fraudulently 
misappropriated more than $850,000 in 1977. The fraud was discovered by 
virtue of the employee’s ostentatious purchases, including several luxury 
automobiles and a “topless” bar in Washington, D.C. The employee was 
found guilty and sent to jail. However, investigation revealed negligence on 
the part of a Department certifying officer. The employee had perpetrated 
the fraud by inserting his own name on six payment vouchers for Urban 
Mass Transportation Administration grants. Each voucher contained a list 
of approximately ten payees with individual amounts, and the total amount, 
and each had been certified by the certifying officer. The negligence 
occurred in one of two ways. If the employee inserted his own name and 
address on the voucher before presenting it to the certifying officer, the 
certifying officer was negligent in not spotting the name of an individual 
(whose name he should have known) with an address in suburban 
Maryland on a list of payees the rest of which were mass transit agencies. 
If the employee presented a partial voucher and added his own name after 
it was certified, the total as presented to the certifying officer could not 
have agreed with the sum of the individual amounts, and the certifying 
officer was negligent in not verifying the computation. GAO raised 
exceptions to the certifying officer’s account, and advised the Department 
of Transportation that it must proceed with collection action against the 
certifying officer for the full amount of the excepted payments less any 
amounts recovered from the employee or through the sale of assets, like 
the topless bar, which the Justice Department seized. See B-194727, 
Oct. 30, 1979. Apparently in view of the clear negligence, relief was never 
requested. 

At this point, it should be noted that no one involved in the process 
remotely expects that the government will be able to recover several 
hundred thousand dollars from a certifying officer, or from any other 
accountable officer, except perhaps one who has him(her)self stolen the 
money. However, the burden of having to repay even a portion in cases of 
losses of this size sends an important message and reinforces the certain if 
indeterminable deterrent effect of the statute. 

Certifying officers should not certify payment vouchers that are 
unsupported by pertinent documentation indicating that procedural 
safeguards regarding payment have been observed. Vouchers that are 

Page 9-92 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

deficient in this regard should be returned to the appropriate 
administrative officials for proper approvals and supporting documents. 

B-257334, June 30, 1995; B-179916, Mar. 11, 1974. 

An area in which a certifying officer’s duty to question is minimal is 
payments to a contractor determined under a statutory or contractual 
disputes procedure. In the absence of fraud or bad faith by the contractor, 
a payment determination made under a disputes clause procedure is final 
and conclusive and may not be questioned by a certifying officer, GAO, or 
the Justice Department. S&E Contractors, Inc. v. United States, 406 U.S. 1 
(1972); B-201408, Apr. 19, 1982. It does not follow that any administrative 
settlement is entitled to the same effect. In B-239592, Aug. 23, 1991, GAO 
found that an “informal settlement” of a personnel action between an 
agency and one of its employees was without legal authority and found the 
certifying officer liable for the unauthorized payments. (A subsequent 
letter, B-239592.2, Sept. 1, 1992, clarified that this meant the authorized 
certifying officer, not an official who had signed certain documents as 
“approving official” but was not responsible for determining the legality of 
the payment.) 

A different issue involving an administrative settlement arose in 
67 Comp. Gen. 385 (1988). After an investigation by federal and state 
officials, the Forest Service determined that it was responsible for a fire in 
a national forest in Oregon, and reimbursed the state for fire suppression 
expenses incurred under a cooperative agreement. Subsequently, a private 
landowner sued for damages resulting from the same fire, and the court 
made a finding of fact that the Forest Service was not liable. The certifying 
officer was concerned that the court’s finding might have the effect of 
invalidating the prior payment to Oregon and making him liable for an 
erroneous payment. The decision concluded that the payment was proper 
when made, and that the court finding did not impose any duty on the 
certifying officer to reopen and reexamine it. See also B-262110, Mar. 19, 
1997, where the Environmental Protection Agency used a cooperative 
agreement to provide for payment of the costs of travel and related 
expenses by nonfederal attendees of an EPA conference. If EPA had used a 
procurement agreement, as required, these costs would not have been 
allowable. Relief was granted the certifying officer and recipient of the 
funding because both acted in good faith in fulfilling obligations and had no 
basis for questioning the use of the inappropriate agreement. 

A certifying officer has the statutory right to seek and obtain an advance 
decision from the Comptroller General regarding the lawfulness of any 

Page 9-93 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

b. Applicability of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3528 
payment to be certified. 31 U.S.C. § 3529.55 This procedure will insulate the 
certifying officer against liability. Following the advice of agency counsel, 
on the other hand, does not guarantee protection against liability. E.g., 
55 Comp. Gen. 297 (1975). Having said this, we do not wish to imply that 
consulting agency counsel is a pointless gesture. See B-257893, June 1, 
1995 (certifying officer’s good faith was demonstrated, in part, by reliance 
on agency counsel approval of settlement agreement). On the contrary, it is 
to be encouraged. Seeking internal legal advice prior to certification of 
matters on which the certifying officer is unsure will in many cases obviate 
any need for an advance decision. In other cases it may help define those 
situations in which consulting GAO may be desirable. 

As a final note, the Treasury Department has published a supplement to the 
Treasury Financial Manual entitled Now That You’re a Certifying Officer 
(revised March 2005), which can be found at 
www.fms.treas.gov/publications.html (last visited September 15, 2005). 
Written expressly for certifying officers, it provides a good overview of the 
importance of the job and the responsibilities which accompany it. 

There are two major exceptions to 31 U.S.C. § 3528(a). First, it applies only 
to the executive branch. While section 3528(a) is not limited by its terms to 
the executive branch, 31 U.S.C. § 3325(a), the basic requirement that 
disbursing officers disburse only upon duly certified vouchers, is expressly 
limited to the executive branch, and sections 3325(a) and 3528(a) 
originated as sections 1 and 2 of the same 1941 enactment. Thus, GAO has 
concluded that 31 U.S.C. § 3528(a) does not apply to the legislative branch. 
21 Comp. Gen. 987 (1942); B-191036, July 7, 1978; B-236141.2, Feb. 23, 1990 
(internal memorandum). See also B-39695, Mar. 27, 1945. It has also been 
held that 31 U.S.C. § 3325(a) does not apply to the judicial branch. B-6061, 
A-51607, Apr. 27, 1942. It follows that section 3528(a) would be equally 
inapplicable to the judicial branch. B-236141.2, cited above. In 1996, the 

55 The General Accounting Office Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, title II, § 204, 110 Stat. 
3826, 3845–46, (Oct. 19, 1996), amended the Comptroller General’s authority under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3529 and transferred the authority to issue advance decisions with respect to transferred 
settlement functions under the Act to the Director of OMB, who in turn delegated specific 
functions to the Departments of Defense and Treasury, the General Services Administration, 
and the Office of Personnel Management. The Comptroller General retains the authority to 
issue decisions to disbursing or certifying officers and heads of agencies on matters 
involving the use of appropriated funds that do not involve settling a claim or other 
functions transferred to OMB. In addition, the Comptroller General retains the authority 
under 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527 and 3528 to grant relief to disbursing and certifying officers. See 

B-275605, Mar. 17, 1997.

Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

United States Code was amended to authorize the designation and 
appointment of certifying and disbursing officers within the Department of 
Defense. See National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, 
Pub. L. No. 104-106, div. A, title IX, subtitle B, § 913, 110 Stat. 186, 410–12 
(Feb. 10, 1996). Previously, 31 U.S.C. § 3528 specifically exempted military 
departments from its applicability except for departmental pay and 
expenses in the District of Columbia. 

Some legislative branch agencies now have their own legislation patterned 
after 31 U.S.C. § 3528. See statutes listed in section E.1.b of this chapter. 
Until recently, GAO decisions indicated that agencies that do not have their 
own legislation, including legislative branch agencies, nevertheless had the 
authority, within their discretion, to create their own certifying officers and 
to make them accountable by administrative regulation. The 1990 
memorandum cited above, B-236141.2, contains a detailed discussion. See 
also B-247563.3, Apr. 5, 1996; B-260369, June 15, 1995; 21 Comp. Gen. at 989. 
These decisions reasoned that such liability, duly imposed by regulation, 
could be regarded as part of the employee’s “employment contract.” 
However, in B-280764, May 4, 2000, GAO reconsidered its position in a case 
involving the Department of Defense (DOD) and held that accountable 
officer status and liability can only be created by statute. GAO found no 
authority that would permit DOD to impose pecuniary liability by 
regulation on officials whom it refers to as “accountable officials” (but who 
are not certifying or disbursing officers) for erroneous payments resulting 
from information that they “negligently provide” to certifying officers. The 
2000 decision overruled prior inconsistent decisions, which would include 
those applying to legislative branch agencies. There is a further discussion 
of B-280764 in section B.2 of this chapter. 

Informally known as the Certifying Officers’ Relief Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b) 
establishes a mechanism for the administrative relief of certifying officers 
governed by 31 U.S.C. § 3528(a).56 There are two standards for relief. The 
Comptroller General may relieve a certifying officer from liability for an 
illegal, improper, or incorrect payment upon determining that— 

• the certification was based on official records and the certifying officer 
did not know, and by reasonable diligence and inquiry could not have 
discovered, the actual facts; or 
56 For a discussion of military certifying officers as of 1996, see sections B.2, C.1.b, and C.2.b. 

Page 9-95 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

• the obligation was incurred in good faith, the payment was not 
specifically prohibited by statute, and the United States received value 
for the payment. 
Under either standard, relief may be denied if the agency fails to diligently 
pursue collection action against the recipient of the improper payment. 
31 U.S.C. § 3528(b)(2). 

Unlike the physical loss relief statutes previously discussed, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3528(b) does not require administrative determinations by the agency as a 
prerequisite to relief. The determinations under section 3528(b) are made 
by the Comptroller General. Also, the relief standards under 
section 3528(b) are stated in the alternative; relief may be granted if either 
of the two standards can be established. It makes no difference whether 
the improper payment is discovered by GAO or the agency concerned. 
B-137435-O.M., Oct. 14, 1958. Relief is discretionary (the statute says “may 
relieve”), although no case has been discovered in which a certifying 
officer who met either of the standards was not relieved. 

There is no special form of request under 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b). Relief may 
be requested by the agency on behalf of the certifying officer, or directly by 
the certifying officer. See, e.g., 31 Comp. Gen. 653 (1952) (example of the 
latter). Relief requests must present sufficient information to permit GAO 
to make one of the required findings. E.g., B-288284, May 29, 2002; 
B-251994, Sept. 24, 1993; B-191900, July 21, 1978. 

One of the objectives of 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b) was to reduce the volume of 
private relief legislation recommended on behalf of certifying officers. The 
legislative history of the statute indicates that an agency should seek relief 
from GAO before considering relief legislation. As to those “less 
meritorious cases” in which relief may be denied, relief legislation remains 
an available option. 30 Comp. Gen. 298 (1951). 

The first relief standard, 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b)(1)(A), relates essentially to the 
certification of incorrect facts, and permits relief if the certification was 
based on official records and if the certifying officer did not know, and 
could not reasonably have learned, the actual facts. GAO has never 
attempted to formulate a general rule as to what acts may support relief 
from the certification of incorrect facts. Rather, the approach is as stated 
in 55 Comp. Gen. 297, 299–300 (1975): 

Page 9-96 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

“[W]e have sought to apply the relief provisions by 
considering the practical conditions and procedures under 
which certifications of fact are made. Consequently, the 
diligence to be required of a certifying officer before 
requests for relief under the act will be considered favorably 
is a matter of degree dependent upon the practical 
conditions prevailing at the time of certification, the 
sufficiency of the administrative procedures protecting the 
interest of the Government, and the apparency of the error.” 

For example, Social Security Administration certifying officers who certify 
large numbers of awards each month may, apart from obvious errors, rely 
on the award documents presented for certification. B-119248-O.M., 
Apr. 14, 1954. Moreover, in B-247563.3, Apr. 5, 1996, we recognized that 
certifying officers located at automated finance centers at the Department 
of Veterans Affairs rely, necessarily, on the integrity of the automated 
payment system as a whole and do not physically examine hard copy 
documentation (vouchers) in each and every case. The reasonableness of 
the certifying officer’s reliance on an automated payment system must be 
based on a “showing that the system on which they rely is functioning 
properly and reviews should be made at least annually to determine that 
the automated payment system is operating effectively and can be relied 
upon to make accurate and legal payments.” Id. 

In B-237419, Dec. 5, 1989, relief was granted to a Forest Service certifying 
officer who certified the refund of a timber purchaser’s cash bond deposit 
without knowing that the refund had already been made. The certifying 
officer had followed proper procedures by checking to see if the money 
had been refunded, but did not discover the prior payment because it had 
not been properly recorded. Also, the agency was pursuing collection 
efforts against the payee. 

In B-254385, Mar. 22, 1994, relief was granted to a certifying officer at the 
National Science Foundation (NSF) who certified a payment to the wrong 
contractor because an incorrect code had been entered into NSF’s 
automated payment system. We noted that because of the high volume of 
payments, it would be an undue burden to require the certifying officer to 
examine the supporting materials of each payment. GAO’s Policy and 
Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies recognizes the 
impracticality of requiring accountable officers to examine, personally, 
each transaction and advises that accountable officers may rely on the 
adequacy of automated systems and controls and the personnel who 

Page 9-97 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

operate these systems and process individual transactions. GAO, Policy 
and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 7.2(A), 
(Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993). 

Another case in which relief was granted under 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b)(1)(A) is 
B-246415, July 28, 1992. A certifying officer paid a contract invoice to a 
financing institution to which payments had been assigned under the 
Assignment of Claims Act without discovering that the contract file 
contained a prior assignment. The contracting officer had erroneously 
acknowledged the second assignment when he should have either rejected 
it or invalidated the first one. The agency remained liable to the first 
assignee and was unable to recover the improper payment from the 
second. The certifying officer had checked the contract file, and neither 
agency procedures nor reasonable diligence required her to keep looking 
once she found what appeared on its face to be a properly acknowledged 
assignment. The case also illustrates how an agency (the Panama Canal 
Commission in this case) should respond to a loss—by reviewing its 
procedures to determine if they can be improved, within reason, to prevent 
recurrence. In this instance, the agency began requiring that contract files 
include a “milestone” log and that assignments be tabbed in the file and 
reviewed prior to acknowledgment. See also B-287043, May 29, 2001. 

In B-288284.2, Mar. 7, 2003, due to widespread violence in the Republic of 
the Congo, the staff of the American Embassy in Kinshasa was evacuated 
to the Embassy in Brazzaville in June 1993. During this crisis, Air Afrique 
apparently threatened to cut off its transportation services to embassy 
personnel unless a payment was made for evacuating embassy pets during 
a similar crisis in 1991. The certifying officer certified the payment, relying 
on fiscal data provided over the telephone by Kinshasa staff. (This same 
certifying officer had not authorized the 1991 payment, questioning it as 
being personal expenses of embassy staff.) We granted relief to the 
certifying officer under 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b)(1)(A), noting that given the 
circumstances in the Congo at that time and the urgency of the need to 
evacuate government employees and their families from a dangerous 
situation, it would have been an undue burden to require that the certifying 
officer seek further documentation or personally examine supporting 
materials behind the Kinshasa official’s authorization and transmission of 
fiscal data. 

As a general rule, however, a certifying officer may not escape liability for 
losses resulting from improper certification merely by stating either that he 
was not in a position to determine that each item on a voucher was 

Page 9-98 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

correctly stated, or that he must depend on the correctness of the 
computations of his subordinates. A certifying officer who relies upon 
statements and computations of subordinates must assume responsibility 
for the correctness of their statements and computations, unless it can be 
shown that neither the certifying officer nor his or her subordinates, in the 
reasonable exercise of care and diligence, could have known the true facts. 
55 Comp. Gen. 297, 299 (1975); 26 Comp. Gen. 578 (1947); 20 Comp. 
Gen. 182 (1940). 

In 49 Comp. Gen. 486 (1970), a certifying officer asked if he would be held 
accountable where his own agency would not tell him exactly what he was 
being asked to certify. The agency took the position that the expenses in 
question were confidential and could be disclosed only to those with a need 
to know, which did not include the certifying officer. GAO disagreed. The 
situation would be different if the agency were operating under 
“unvouchered expenditure” authority such as 31 U.S.C. § 3526(e)(2). Under 
that type of authority, a certifying officer who is not informed of the object 
or purpose of the expenditure is not accountable for its legality. 24 Comp. 
Gen. 544 (1945). In the case at hand, however, the agency had no such 
authority. Therefore, the certifying officer would not be protected against 
liability if he certified a voucher without knowing what it represented. As 
GAO pointed out several years later, any other answer would defeat the 
purpose of the certification requirement, which is to protect the United 
States against illegal or erroneous payments. 55 Comp. Gen. 297, 299 
(1975). Except for statutorily authorized unvouchered expenditures, “I 
don’t know and they wouldn’t tell me” cannot be sufficient. 

The second relief standard, 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b)(1)(B), contains three 
elements, all of which must be satisfied—obligation incurred in good faith, 
payment not specifically prohibited, United States received value for the 
payment. If a certifying officer qualifies for relief under this standard, it 
becomes irrelevant whether he or she could also have qualified under the 
first standard. This is particularly useful because, in many cases, what 
would constitute reasonable diligence and inquiry for purposes of the first 
standard is far from clear. 

There is no simple formula for determining good faith. An important factor 
in evaluating good faith for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 3528 is whether the 
certifying officer had, or reasonably should have had, doubt regarding the 
propriety of the payment and, if so, what he or she did about it. Whether 
the certifying officer reasonably should have been in doubt depends on a 
weighing of all surrounding facts and circumstances and cannot be 

Page 9-99 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

resolved by any “hard and fast rule.” 70 Comp. Gen. 723, 726 (1991). In 
many cases, good faith is found simply by the absence of any evidence to 
the contrary. Id. See also B-262110, Mar. 19, 1997. 

At one time, the failure to obtain an advance decision from GAO on matters 
considered doubtful was viewed as an impediment to establishing good 
faith. E.g., 14 Comp. Gen. 578, 583 (1935). Depending on the 
circumstances, following the advice or instructions of some administrative 
official in lieu of seeking an advance decision may not constitute 
“reasonable inquiry” under the first relief standard of 31 U.S.C. § 3528. 
31 Comp. Gen. 653 (1952). However, it has become increasingly recognized 
that consulting agency counsel is a relevant factor in demonstrating good 
faith under the second standard. B-191900, July 21, 1978; B-127160, Apr. 3, 
1961. In B-250884, Mar. 18, 1993, GAO granted relief to a certifying officer 
who relied, not on agency counsel directly, but on agency guidelines, which 
had been reviewed by agency counsel. (GAO also noted in that decision 
that agency guidelines had been subsequently revised.) Similarly, in 
B-257893, June 1, 1995, GAO found that the certifying officer’s good faith 
was demonstrated, in part, by reliance on a settlement agreement which 
had been approved by agency counsel. 

To understand the second element—“no law specifically prohibited the 
payment”—it is helpful to note the language of the original 1941 enactment, 
which was “the payment was not contrary to any statutory provision 
specifically prohibiting payments of the character involved.” Pub. L. 
No. 389, ch. 641, 55 Stat. 875–76 (Dec. 29, 1941). This means statutes that 
expressly prohibit payments for specific items or services. 70 Comp. 
Gen. 723, 726 (1991); B-191900, July 21, 1978. In B-300192, Nov. 13, 2002, we 
described section 117 of Public Law No. 107-229, 116 Stat. 1465, 1468 
(Sept. 30, 2002) (the fiscal year 2003 continuing resolution) as amended, as 
such a statute. Section 117 prohibits the use of fiscal year 2003 
appropriated funds to pay for printing of the budget of the United States 
other than by the Government Printing Office. Other examples are 
31 U.S.C. § 1348(a) (telephones in private residences) and 44 U.S.C. § 3702 
(newspaper advertisements without prior written authorization). 

Under this interpretation, the phrase “no law specifically prohibited the 
payment” is not the same as the more general “payment prohibited by law.” 
It does not include violations of general fiscal statutes such as the 

Page 9-100 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. § 1341) or the general purpose statute 
(31 U.S.C. § 1301(a)). B-142871-O.M., Sept. 15, 1961.57 

The third element, value received, normally implies the receipt of goods or 
services with a readily determinable dollar value. E.g., B-241879, Apr. 26, 
1991 (automatic data processing equipment maintenance contract 
extended without proper delegation of procurement authority, services 
were performed). But cf. B-303177, Oct. 20, 2004 (certifying officer denied 
relief where government did not receive any value as a result of the 
erroneous payments). However, in appropriate circumstances, an 
intangible item may constitute value received where the payment in 
question has achieved a desired program result. In B-257893, June 1, 1995, 
for example, the National Archives and Records Administration received 
the benefits associated with avoiding litigation and related costs by 
entering into a settlement agreement, despite the fact that the agreement 
had improperly included the payment of attorney fees. See also B-250884, 
Mar. 18, 1993; B-191900, July 21, 1978; B-127160, Apr. 3, 1961. 

3. Disbursing Officers 
a. Standards of Liability and 
Relief 

As with certifying officers, the responsibilities and accountability of 
disbursing officers are mandated by statute. A disbursing officer in the 
executive branch must (1) disburse money only in accordance with 
vouchers certified by the head of the spending agency or an authorized 
certifying officer, and (2) examine the vouchers to the extent necessary to 
determine that they are (a) in proper form, (b) certified and approved, and 

(c)correctly computed on the basis of the facts certified. The disbursing 
officer is accountable for these functions, except that accountability for the 
correctness of computations lies with the certifying officer. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3325(a). Disbursing officers render their accounts quarterly. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3522(a)(1). 
57 One case, B-222048, Feb.10, 1987, implying that an Antideficiency Act violation would 
preclude relief under 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b)(1)(B), is inconsistent with the weight of authority 
as discussed in the text. 

Page 9-101 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

The administrative relief provision for nonmilitary disbursing officers is 
31 U.S.C. § 3527(c), enacted in 1955.58 The Comptroller General is 
authorized to relieve present or former disbursing officers from liability for 
deficiencies in their accounts resulting from illegal, improper, or incorrect 
payments, upon determining that the payment was not the result of bad 
faith or lack of reasonable care by the disbursing officer. The 
determination may be made by the agency and concurred in by GAO, or it 
may be made by GAO on its own initiative. As in the case of certifying 
officers, relief may be denied if the agency concerned fails to diligently 
pursue collection action against the recipient of the improper payment. 

The statute further provides that the granting of relief under 
section 3527(c) does not affect the liability or authorize the relief of the 
beneficiary or recipient of the improper payment nor does it diminish the 
government’s duty to pursue collection action against the beneficiary or 
recipient. 31 U.S.C. § 3527(d)(2). 

In contrast with the certifying officer relief statute, 31 U.S.C. § 3527(c) is 
not limited to the executive branch. E.g., B-288163, June 4, 2002; B-200108, 
B-198558, Jan. 23, 1981 (judicial branch). 

The relief statute contemplates the consideration of individual cases and 
does not authorize the blanket relief of unknown disbursing officers for 
unknown amounts. B-165743, May 11, 1973. 

Once it is determined that there has been an improper payment for which a 
disbursing officer is accountable, and that relief is desired, the primary 
issue is whether the payment was or was not the result of bad faith or lack 
of reasonable care on the part of the disbursing officer. “Bad faith” is 
difficult to define with any precision. It is somewhere between negligence 
and actual dishonesty, and closer to the latter. Bad faith cases tend to be 
relatively uncommon. Far more common are cases involving the 
reasonable care standard. This standard—whether the disbursing officer 
exercised reasonable care under the circumstances—is the legal definition 
of negligence and is the same standard applied in physical loss cases. 
65 Comp. Gen. 858, 861–62 (1986); 54 Comp. Gen. 112 (1974). 

58 Pub. L. No. 365, ch. 803, 69 Stat. 687 (Aug. 11, 1955). See also section B.2.b, including the 
discussion of military disbursing officers. 

Page 9-102 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

The determination of whether a payment was or was not the result of bad 
faith or lack of due care must be made on the basis of the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the particular payment in question. A high 
error rate in the disbursing office involved does not automatically establish 
lack of due care in the making of a particular payment nor does a low error 
rate and a record of an exemplary operation automatically establish due 
care. B-141038-O.M., Nov. 17, 1959; B-136027-O.M., June 13, 1958. The 
continued existence of an “inherently dangerous” procedure, however, 
does indicate lack of due care on the part of the responsible disbursing 
officer. B-162629-O.M., Nov. 9, 1967. 

It is difficult, if not impossible, to state hard and fast rules applicable 
inflexibly to all cases involving relief under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3527(c). What may be considered good faith and the exercise of due care 
in one set of circumstances may not be so considered in another. However, 
it may be stated generally that GAO will grant relief where (1) the agency 
has made proper efforts to collect from the recipient of the improper 
payment, (2) the agency has determined that the payment was not the 
result of bad faith or lack of due care on the part of the disbursing officer, 
and (3) no evidence to the contrary is available. Also, relief may be granted 
without the administrative determination where due care and the absence 
of bad faith are evident from the facts. 

Actual negligence which contributes to an improper payment will, of 
course, preclude the granting of relief. For example, making a payment on 
the basis of documents which have been obviously altered, without first 
seeking clarification, is not the exercise of due care. B-233276, Oct. 31, 
1989, aff’d upon reconsideration, B-233276, June 20, 1990; B-138593-O.M., 
Feb. 18, 1959; B-135910-O.M., July 14, 1958. Similarly, relief was denied in 
the following cases: 

• Disbursing officer made duplicate payments on voucher schedule 
covering payments already made. Disbursing officer had requested 
guidance on new procedures, and “duplicate” schedule with 
instructions had been sent to her in response to that request, with a 
cover letter clearly stating that the schedule covered payments 
previously made. The payment could only have been due to lack of due 
care. B-142051, Mar. 22, 1960. 
• Disbursing officer continued to pay New Mexico gasoline tax after 
State Attorney General and Judge Advocate General had both 
concluded that the United States was not liable for the tax. Although 
Page 9-103 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

the disbursing officer was aware of the rulings, he claimed that he had 

not received specific instructions to stop paying. B-135811, May 29, 

1959. 

• Disbursing officer reimbursed imprest fund on the basis of fictitious 
requisitions not supported by dealers’ invoices or delivery slips. 
B-137723-O.M., Dec. 10, 1958. 

As with physical losses, failure to follow applicable regulations is generally 
regarded as negligence, and if an improper payment is attributable to that 
failure, relief will be denied. For example, in B-271608, June 21, 1996, relief 
was denied a disbursing officer who failed to exercise due care, as 
evidenced by his failure to follow prescribed procedures. See also 
54 Comp. Gen. 112, 116 (1974); 44 Comp. Gen. 160 (1964). 

In B-271021, Sept. 18, 1996, a disbursing officer failed to follow regulations 
and was denied relief, even though the disbursing officer had received 
instructions from superiors to make the improper payment. Compliance 
with regulations will help establish due care, but the mere fact of 
compliance with regulations which are clearly insufficient may not always 
satisfy the standard. B-192558, Dec. 7, 1978. 

The concept of proximate cause is also applicable, and relief is appropriate 
where any negligence that may have existed was not the proximate cause 
of the improper payment. In one case, for example, local operating 
procedures at a military installation were found inadequate because they 
permitted personal checks to be cashed without checking identification 
cards. However, since the cashiers checked ID cards on their own 
initiative, and did so in the case for which relief was sought, the inadequacy 
could not have contributed to the loss. B-221415, Mar. 26, 1986. Also, in 
B-288163, June 4, 2002, a bankruptcy judge had ordered a disbursing officer 
to pay funds to a false claimant. In that case, we found that the disbursing 
officer’s error was not the proximate cause of the loss because the judge 
had ordered the payment. For other examples, see B-227436, July 2, 1987, 
and B-217663, July 16, 1985. 

The essence of negligence is the existence of a duty to exercise reasonable 
care in a particular situation and the violation of that duty. In B-188744, 
July 15, 1977, a Bureau of Indian Affairs disbursing officer erroneously 
made a payment to the wrong heir. Unknown to him, the probate and title 
determinations on which he had based the payment had been reopened and 
revised. Under established procedures, the disbursing officer was neither 

Page 9-104 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

required nor expected to verify inheritance determinations. Since the 
verification was not within the scope of his duty, and was not something 
anyone in his position would reasonably be expected to do, there was no 
lack of due care. See also B-137223-O.M., Jan. 18, 1960. Thus, negligence 
will generally not be imputed to a disbursing officer where payment is 
made on the basis of facts of record upon which the disbursing officer is or 
reasonably can be expected to rely, even though such facts are 
subsequently found to be erroneous. This assumes that there is nothing on 
the face of the documents presented to the disbursing officer which should 
reasonably have alerted him or her that something appeared to be wrong. 

A disbursing officer is accountable for payments made by his or her 
subordinates. However, relief may be granted under 31 U.S.C. § 3527(c) if 
the improper payment was not the result of bad faith or lack of due care 
attributable to the disbursing officer personally. B-141038-O.M., Nov. 17, 
1959. Where the actual disbursement is made by a subordinate, relief for 
the supervisory disbursing officer requires a showing that the disbursing 
officer exercised adequate supervision. Adequate supervision in this 
context means that the disbursing officer (1) maintained an adequate 
system of controls and procedures to avoid errors, and (2) took 
appropriate steps to ensure that the system was effective and was being 
followed at the time of the payment in question. E.g., 62 Comp. Gen. 476, 
480 (1983). A relief request must contain sufficient information to enable 
an independent evaluation. B-235037, Sept. 18, 1989. 

GAO has not attempted to define the elements of an adequate supervisory 
system. There can in fact be no fixed formula, as the system will vary 
based on such factors as the size of the disbursing operation and the types 
of payments or transactions involved. Nevertheless, several elements 
which commonly appear in good systems can be identified (although no 
single case lists them as such): 

• Compliance with agency regulations. For example, a disbursing office 
at an American embassy will need to ensure compliance with any 
pertinent directives or financial management regulations of the State 
Department. See B-271896, Mar. 4, 1997. 
• Locally developed instructions (often called standard operating 
procedures or SOPs) tailored to the needs of the particular disbursing 
office. Relief requests should include copies of any relevant SOPs. In 
B-241019, Aug. 19, 1991, we initially denied relief to a supervisory 
disbursing officer because the record did not contain evidence either 
Page 9-105 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

that (1) the officer maintained an adequate system of procedures and 

controls (SOPs were inadequate), or (2) that the officer took steps to 

ensure that the procedures were implemented effectively. (This case 

was reversed upon reconsideration in B-241019.2, Feb. 7, 1992, when 

additional information pertaining to the procedures was provided to 

GAO.) While SOPs are extremely helpful, the lack of a written SOP will 

not in and of itself cause a system to “flunk” the relief standard. E.g., 

B-215226, Apr. 16, 1985. 

• Training. This includes both initial training for new personnel and 
periodic refresher training, again tailored to the needs of the particular 
office. Training in this context does not necessarily mean formal 
classroom training, but may be in the form of on-the-job training and 
may include such devices as reading files which are circulated 
periodically and especially when pertinent changes occur. 
• Periodic review or inspection by the supervisor. The forms this may 
take will vary with the size and nature of the operation. 
The adequacy of a supervisory system is not, nor could it realistically be, 
measured against a zero-error standard. Many cases have made the point 
that a skillfully executed criminal scheme can occasionally outwit an 
adequate and well-supervised system. E.g., B-241880, Aug. 14, 1991; 
B-202911, June 29, 1981. Similarly, human error will occur even in the most 
carefully established and supervised system. The best system cannot be 
expected to eliminate or detect every clerical error by a subordinate. E.g., 

B-224961, Sept. 8, 1987; B-212336, Aug. 8, 1983. 

The cases also recognize that, in a large operation, the supervisory 
disbursing officer cannot reasonably be expected to personally review 
every check that is issued or every cash payment that is made. E.g., 
B-215734, Nov. 5, 1984 (check cashed with fraudulent endorsement); 
B-194877, July 12, 1979 (amounts of two payments inadvertently switched, 
resulting in overpayment to one payee); B-187180, Sept. 21, 1976 (wrong 
amounts inserted on checks). See also B-266001, May 1, 1996. Thus, it is 
possible for a supervisor to be relieved for an error by a subordinate which, 
if attributable to the disbursing officer personally, would have resulted in 
the denial of relief. We previously cited several cases denying relief for 
payments made on the basis of obviously altered documents. These were 
cases in which the disbursing officer saw or should have seen the 
documents. Relief has been granted for similar losses occurring in 
otherwise adequate systems under which the supervisor was not required 

Page 9-106 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

to see, and in fact did not see, the altered document. B-141038-O.M., 
Nov. 17, 1959. 

Where the subordinate who made the payment is also an accountable 
officer (a cashier, for example), the standard for relieving the subordinate 
is whether the individual complied with established procedures and 
whether anything occurred which should reasonably have made the 
individual suspicious that something was wrong. E.g., B-246418, Feb. 3, 
1992; B-233997.3, Nov. 25, 1991; B-241880, Aug. 14, 1991. Depending on the 
particular facts, in cases involving two disbursing officers accountable for 
a payment, one a supervisor and the other a subordinate, it is possible for 
relief to be granted to both, denied to both, or granted to one and denied to 
the other. Examples of cases applying the above standards in which relief 
was granted to both the supervisor and the subordinate disbursing officer 
are B-271017, Aug. 12, 1996, and B-260753, Jan. 11, 1996. Examples of cases 
applying the above standards in which relief was granted to the supervisor 
but not the subordinate are: B-260369, June 15, 1995 (cashier failed to 
follow procedures); B-231503, June 28, 1988 (cashier failed to observe 
annotations on voucher); and B-214436, Apr. 6, 1984 (agency declined to 
seek relief for subordinate who had failed to follow established 
procedures). 

In our coverage of physical loss cases, we emphasized the importance of 
statements by the accountable officer. The principle applies equally in 
improper payment cases. The existence of adequate controls and 
procedures is usually documented, but this is not always the case, and the 
passage of time may make it impossible to locate a copy of the specific 
version of the SOPs in effect at the time of the payment. Also, testimony of 
the accountable officer(s) and other involved persons is often the only way 
of establishing how the controls and procedures were being implemented 
at the time of the payment. While the disbursing officer’s own statement is 
obviously not disinterested and cannot be regarded as conclusive, it is 
always given appropriate weight and, as with unexplained loss cases, has 
often been enough to tip the balance in favor of relief where the record 
contains no controverting evidence or where documentary evidence is no 
longer available. Examples are B-234962, Sept. 28, 1989; B-215226, Apr. 16, 
1985; B-217637, Mar. 18, 1985; B-216726, Jan. 9, 1985; B-215833, Dec. 21, 
1984; and B-212603 et al., Dec. 12, 1984.

b. Some Specific Applications 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Finally, a disbursing officer has the same statutory right as a certifying 
officer to obtain an advance decision from the Comptroller General. 
31 U.S.C. § 3529.59 See B-270801, Mar. 19, 1996. Obviously, if the decision is 
to serve the purpose of protecting the disbursing officer, the request must 
include the facts which gave rise to the doubt. 20 Comp. Gen. 759 (1941). 
Following administrative advice in lieu of seeking a GAO decision may, 
depending on the circumstances, bear upon the issue of whether the 
disbursing officer exercised due care. E.g., 49 Comp. Gen. 38 (1969). We 
previously noted that consulting agency counsel will help a certifying 
officer establish good faith. There is no reason why it should not equally 
help a disbursing officer establish good faith and due care, although it may 
not be enough if the advice received flies in the face of contrary 
information in the hands of the disbursing officer. E.g., 65 Comp. Gen. 858 
(1986), aff’d upon reconsideration, B-217114.5, June 8, 1990, modified on 
other grounds, 70 Comp. Gen. 463 (1991). Whichever course of action is 
chosen, the disbursing officer faced with a doubtful payment needs to do 
something. The road to relief will be very difficult if a disbursing officer 
who is admittedly in doubt proceeds to make the payment without 
consulting either GAO or appropriate agency officials. See 23 Comp. 
Gen. 578 (1944). 

The federal government disburses money in an immense variety of 
situations—payments to employees (salary, allowances, awards), payments 
to contractors, payments under assistance programs, payments to various 
claimants, etc. Every situation in which proper payments can be made 
presents the potential for improper payments, resulting from such things as 
fraud, government error, or the misapplication of legal authority or 
limitations. To illustrate some of the situations that may arise, we present 
here a selection of improper payments for which relief has been sought 
under 31 U.S.C. § 3527(c). In each case, the relief question was approached 
by applying the principles and standards discussed in the previous 
section D.3.a. As noted above in sections B.2, C.1.b, and C.2.b of this 
chapter, the statutory scheme for military accountable officers was 

59 Effective on the date of enactment, section 204 of the General Accounting Office Act of 
1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 Stat. 3826, 3845–46 (Oct. 19, 1996), amended the Comptroller 
General’s authority under 31 U.S.C. § 3529 and transferred the authority to issue advance 
decisions with respect to the claims settlement functions transferred by section 211 of the 
Act to the Director of OMB or to the agency to which the function was delegated. The 
Comptroller General retains the authority to issue decisions to disbursing or certifying 
officers and heads of agencies on matters involving the use of appropriated funds that do 
not involve settling a claim or other function transferred to OMB. 

Page 9-108 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

changed by section 913 of Public Law No. 104-105, div. A, title IX, 
subtitle B, 110 Stat. 186, 410–12 (Feb. 10, 1996). Section 913 amended 
31 U.S.C. § 3527(b) to apply to all accountable officials of the armed forces 
and included a new section 3527(b)(1)(B) providing relief for erroneous 
payments made by military accountable officials. As in the case of a 
physical loss or deficiency, the finding of the Secretary involved regarding 
whether the circumstances warrant relief is conclusive on the Comptroller 
General. GAO has not yet addressed relief of military accountable officials 
for erroneous payments under the revised section 3527(b). Nevertheless, 
consideration of the principles addressed in the following cases is still 
useful. 

(1) Fraudulent travel claims 
Cases under this heading range from single payments to massive schemes. 
They involve two distinct situations—fraudulently obtained travel 
advances and payments based on fraudulent travel vouchers. 

In B-240654, Feb. 6, 1991, an imposter, using falsified travel orders and a 
phony military identification card, obtained travel advances at six Air 
Force bases totaling nearly $74,000. The Air Force was able to identify the 
imposter and he was arrested, but committed suicide before trial. See also 
B-248532, Oct. 26, 1992; B-248251, June 30, 1992. In another case, an 
individual stole an identification card from an athletic locker at the 
Pentagon and used it to obtain travel advances at several Army 
installations. The fraud was successful because the thief bore a sufficient 
resemblance to the card’s owner. B-217440, B-217440.2, Apr. 16, 1985; 
B-217440, Feb. 13, 1985. The losses in these cases were attributed to 
skillfully executed criminal activities. Other cases involving fraudulently 
obtained travel advances include B-261312, Feb. 5, 1995; B-246371, June 23, 
1992; B-234962, Sept. 28, 1989; B-221395, Mar. 26, 1986. 

The second group of cases is similar except that the fraudulent document is 
a travel voucher rather than a travel order. Several related cases involve a 
conspiracy carried out over several years by employees of the Army Corps 
of Engineers. Basically, the employees presented vouchers based on 
fraudulent lodging receipts, often provided by friends or relatives. The 
scheme eluded detection for several years until it was discovered that the 
providers of the receipts, who had “verified” the accuracy of the receipts to 
the Corps, were themselves participants in the fraud. The disbursing 
officer in one district was relieved in part, but relief was denied for 
payments made after he had received information putting him on notice of 

Page 9-109 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

the possibility of fraud. 65 Comp. Gen. 858 (1986). In another district, the 
disbursing officer stopped making payments immediately upon being 
advised of the investigation, and was relieved in full. B-217114.2, Feb. 3, 
1988. 

A simpler situation is B-215737, Nov. 5, 1984, in which an individual 
presented to an Army cashier a travel voucher which had been issued to 
someone else. Relief was granted to the Finance and Accounting Officer, 
but denied to the cashier because she failed to compare the name on the 
presenter’s identification card with the (different) name on the voucher. 
Some additional fraudulent travel voucher cases are B-241880, Aug. 14, 
1991; B-229274, Jan. 15, 1988; B-222915, Sept. 16, 1987; B-213824, July 13, 
1987; and B-224832, July 2, 1987. 

(2) Other cash payments fraudulently obtained 
It may be noted, somewhat cynically, that if there is a way to obtain cash 
from the federal government, someone will try to do it fraudulently. In 
some cases, losses can be prevented by the exercise of due care. In 
68 Comp. Gen. 371 (1989), for example, an individual deposited two 
“Greenback Money Drafts” in the patients’ account at a Department of 
Veterans Affairs hospital. These are drafts, resembling checks, which the 
issuing bank provides to various public places. A person with an account 
in the issuing bank can sign one of the forms and cash it elsewhere. The 
back of the form explicitly states, “You must call [the issuing bank] before 
cashing,” so that the bank can verify the existence of the account and the 
sufficiency of funds. In this instance, the cashier accepted the drafts 
without calling the issuing bank, the patient withdrew the funds shortly 
thereafter, and it was subsequently discovered that the drafts had been 
fraudulently negotiated. Relief was denied because of the cashier’s 
negligent failure to follow the explicit printed instructions. 

In another case, relief was denied to a cashier who made a cash payment to 
a courier without requiring any identification. The courier turned out to be 
an imposter. B-178953, Aug. 8, 1973. 

In many cases, due care will not prevent the loss, and relief is granted. 
Illustrative cases involving miscellaneous military cash payments, similar 
to the travel advance cases noted above, are B-245127, Sept. 18, 1991 
(transient/reaccession payment); B-226174, June 18, 1987 (casual 
payment); B-215226, Apr. 16, 1985 (special reenlistment bonus); and 
B-209717.2, July 1, 1983 (military pay voucher with separation orders).

Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Relief was denied to a cashier in another casual payment case, 
B-227209, Aug. 5, 1987, for neglecting to spot inconsistencies on the face of 
the voucher. 


(3) Military separation vouchers 
The cases under this heading involve overpayments on military separation 
vouchers attributable to government error rather than fraud on the part of 
the recipient. In each case, the supervisory disbursing officer was relieved, 
illustrating the previously noted proposition that even a well-established 
and carefully supervised system of controls and procedures cannot be 
expected to totally eliminate human error. 

In B-230842, Apr. 13, 1988, and B-227412, July 2, 1987, a cashier made an 
overpayment by using the amount from the wrong block on the voucher. In 
B-228946, Jan. 15, 1988, the cashier failed to clear a previous transaction 
from her adding machine. In all three cases, the agency sought relief for 
the supervisor while holding the cashier liable. Similar cases are B-222685, 
June 20, 1986; B-221453, June 18, 1986; and B-212293, Nov. 21, 1983. Relief 
has been granted to the cashier in cases where the cashier followed 
applicable procedures and the error was attributable to someone else. 
E.g., B-226614, May 6, 1987; B-221471, Jan. 7, 1986. 

(4) Assignment of contract payments 
Under the Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3727 and 41 U.S.C. § 15, 
when a contractor assigns future contract payments to a financing 
institution (assignee), the assignee must file written notice of the 
assignment and a copy of the assignment with the pertinent disbursing 
officer. Once this is done, the government’s obligation is to make future 
payments to the assignee, and payments made directly to the contractor 
are erroneous. In B-270715, July 23, 1996, an assignment bound the 
government, even though notice of the assignment was not given to the 
agency as required under the Act, because the agency was fully aware of 
the assignment and had “recognized” the assignment. 

In B-213720, Oct. 2, 1984, an assignment under an Army Corps of Engineers 
contract was properly filed with the disbursing officer, who acknowledged 
receipt but neglected to retain a copy. Also, a copy was inexplicably not 
placed in the contract file. A few months later, an invoice was submitted 
clearly stating that payment should be made to the assignee bank. A 
voucher examiner functioning as a certifying officer failed to make 

Page 9-111 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

appropriate inquiry to confirm the existence of the assignment and instead 
followed the advice of the purchasing agent to pay the contractor. The 
disbursing officer then made payment to the contractor, notwithstanding 
the information on the face of the invoice indicating the existence of an 
assignment. Since the Army voucher examiner was not a statutory 
certifying officer, primary liability remained with the disbursing officer. 
Given the disbursing officer’s failure to retain a copy of the assignment and 
to verify the proper payee, relief was denied. 

However, in B-270801, Mar. 19, 1996, a disbursing officer was relieved of 
liability for payment to a contractor, although there had been an 
assignment made to a financial corporation. The corporation had mailed a 
copy of the assignment to the disbursing office, as required, but the 
mailroom apparently lost the copy. The disbursing officer had followed 
established procedures and did not have actual notice of the assignment. 

In other cases in which a military finance and accounting officer is 
responsible for both certifying and disbursing functions, relief has been 
granted where the errors are solely those of subordinates and there is no 
lack of due care attributable to the disbursing officer personally. B-216246, 
May 22, 1985 (voucher examiner/certifying officer failed to follow standard 
operating procedures, nothing on face of voucher to suggest existence of 
assignment); B-214273, Dec. 11, 1984 (unknown clerk had misfiled notice of 
assignment, office processed over 3,000 vouchers a month and could preaudit 
only on random basis). 

(5) Improper purpose/payment beyond scope of legal authority 
Most improper purpose and similar cases will be certifying officer cases. 
Those that involve disbursing officers are either military cases or 
disbursements by imprest fund cashiers.60 The point to remember is that 
relief is governed by the standards of 31 U.S.C. § 3527(c), and the fact that a 
payment is unauthorized does not automatically indicate lack of due care. 

Several imprest fund cashiers have been relieved where the vouchers were 
proper on their face and included approvals by appropriate agency 
officials, including a contracting officer. B-221940, Oct. 7, 1987 

60 On November 9, 1999, Treasury issued a policy directive requiring that federal agencies 
eliminate agency imprest funds, with certain exceptions, by October 1, 2001. See 
section B.3.a of this chapter for more information on imprest funds.

(refreshments at seminar); B-211265, June 28, 1983 (air purifier); B-203553, 
Feb. 22, 1983 (air purifier). Prior approvals of similar purchases may also 
be relevant in establishing due care. 61 Comp. Gen. 634, 637 (1982). Note 
that the purchase in each case was not plainly illegal. Refreshments may 
be authorized under the Government Employees Training Act and air 
purifiers are authorized in some situations.61 Also, in B-302993, June 25, 
2004, GAO considered whether particular expenditures that were once 
viewed as personal expenses of the employee may in certain circumstances 
be considered an official expense of the agency. 

In B-217668, Sept. 12, 1986, relief was denied to an Army Finance and 
Accounting Officer who purchased beer for troops engaged in a joint 
military exercise. While the beer could have been purchased with 
nonappropriated funds (or—dare we suggest—paid for by the individuals 
who drank it), it is not an appropriate use of the taxpayers’ money. The 
decision recognized that relief might nevertheless be possible if the 
standards for relief of a supervisor under 31 U.S.C. § 3527(c) were met, but 
the record did not contain sufficient information to enable an independent 
judgment. 

4. Check Losses 
a. Check Cashing Operations Check cashing by disbursing officers is governed by 31 U.S.C. § 3342. 
Subsection (a) authorizes disbursing officers to— 
“(1) cash and negotiate negotiable instruments payable in 
United States currency or currency of a foreign country; 
“(2) exchange United States currency, coins, and negotiable 
instruments and currency, coins, and negotiable 
instruments of foreign countries; and 
“(3) cash checks drawn on the Treasury to accommodate 
United States citizens in a foreign country, but only if— 

61 See the discussion of refreshments in section C.5.b and air purifiers in section C.13.c of 
Chapter 4. 

Page 9-113 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

“(A) satisfactory banking facilities are not available in the 
foreign country; and 

“(B) a check is presented by the payee who is a United 
States citizen.” 

Transactions under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) are authorized for official 
purposes or to accommodate certain classes of persons, including 
government personnel and their dependents under certain circumstances, 
hospitalized veterans, contractors working on government projects, 
authorized nongovernmental agencies operating with government 
agencies, federal credit unions, and members of the military forces of an 
allied or coalition nation participating in a combined operation, combined 
exercise, or combined humanitarian or peacekeeping mission with the U.S. 
military if certain conditions are met. 31 U.S.C. § 3342(b). These are 
sometimes called “accommodation transactions.” The statute applies to 
legislative branch (and presumably judicial branch) agencies as well as 
executive branch agencies. 64 Comp. Gen. 152 (1984). The Treasury 
Department is authorized to issue implementing regulations and may 
delegate that authority to other agencies. 31 U.S.C. § 3342(d). 

In 1999, the Treasury Department directed agencies to eliminate most 
imprest funds, so accommodation transactions are now limited mainly to 
Department of Defense and Department of State overseas offices.62 
Furthermore, internal Defense Department and State Department 
regulations allow accommodation transactions only if local commercial 
banking facilities are not available or are inadequate. Department of 
Defense Financial Management Regulation No. 7000.14-R, vol. 5, ch. 4, 
Check Cashing Service (January 2004); Department of State Foreign 
Affairs Handbook, 4-FAH-3 H361.2, Guidelines for Authorizing 
Accommodation Exchange. 

Of particular relevance here are 31 U.S.C. §§ 3342(c)(2) and (c)(4): 

“(2) The head of an agency having jurisdiction over a 
disbursing official may offset, within the same fiscal year, a 
deficiency resulting from a transaction under subsection (a) 
of this section with a gain from a transaction under 

62 See the discussion of Treasury’s November 9, 1999, policy directive on imprest funds in 
section B.3.a of this chapter. 

Page 9-114 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

subsection (a). A gain in the account of a disbursing official 
not used to offset deficiencies under subsection (a) shall be 
deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. 

* * * * * 

“(4) Amounts necessary to adjust for deficiencies in the 
account of a disbursing official because of transactions 
under subsection (a) of this section are authorized to be 
appropriated.” 

One important application of the offsetting authority of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3342(c)(2) is losses resulting from certain foreign currency exchange 
transactions, and cases involving this application are noted later in this 
chapter. However, nothing in the statute limits it to foreign exchange 
transactions. The offsetting authority applies by its terms to “a deficiency 
resulting from a transaction under subsection (a),” and this includes check 
cashing operations as authorized by subsections (a)(1) and (b). 

Decisions rendered shortly after the statute was enacted applied it to 
uncollectible checks cashed over forged endorsements and explicitly 
recognized the statute as a form of relief. The first such case was 27 Comp. 
Gen. 211 (1947), stating at 213: 

“Since the cashing of a check is an operation authorized 
under the act, any loss arising out of such transaction 
properly may be considered as coming within the purview 
of the term ‘any deficiencies’ for which relief is 
contemplated under the act.” 

This holding was followed in 27 Comp. Gen. 663 (1948). The original 
version of 31 U.S.C. § 3342, enacted in 1944,63 did not include the offsetting 
authority. See B-39771, Sept. 26, 1950. It was added in 1953.64 Thus, the 
“relief” referred to in 27 Comp. Gen. 211 and 27 Comp. Gen. 663 was simply 
the authority to use agency appropriations to adjust the deficiencies. Both 
cases involved the Army, which at the time received annual appropriations 

63 Pub. L. No. 554, ch. 716, 58 Stat. 921 (Dec. 20, 1944). 
64 Pub. L. No. 61, ch. 115, § 2, 67 Stat. 61, 62 (June 16, 1953). 

Page 9-115 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

for this purpose. The Army was thus in a position to invoke the statute, and 
the adjustments had the effect of relieving the disbursing officers. 

For the next four decades, the principles established by 27 Comp. Gen. 211 
saw little use, and check cashing losses during that period were mostly 
treated as improper payments requiring relief under whatever authorities 
were available (31 U.S.C. § 3527(c) since 1955). A 1991 decision to the Air 
Force, 70 Comp. Gen. 616, changed this and, in effect, reverted to the 
approach of 27 Comp. Gen. 211, now augmented by the offsetting authority. 
After reviewing precedent and legislative history, the decision concluded 
that— 

“section 3342 may be applied to check cashing losses. Thus, 
an agency may use section 3342 to offset losses from 
cashing uncollectible checks with gains from other section 
3342(a) activities.” 

Offsetting under section 3342(c)(2) is done on a fiscal-year basis. An 
uncollectible check becomes a deficiency not when it is cashed by the 
disbursing officer, but when it is dishonored and returned to be charged to 
the disbursing officer’s account. If these events occur in different fiscal 
years, the deficiency is chargeable to the latter year. B-120737, Dec. 27, 
1954. If an item is charged as a deficiency in one year and collected in a 
subsequent year, the collection should be charged to the fiscal year account 
in which the collection is made regardless of the fiscal year in which the 
deficiency was charged. Id. 

For checks cashed within the authority of 31 U.S.C. § 3342, following the 
procedures of that statute eliminates the need to pursue relief under 
31 U.S.C. § 3527(c). If there is a net gain in an account for a given fiscal 
year, the net gain is deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts and 
that ends the matter. If there is a net loss, and the agency is able to make 
an adjustment from an available appropriation, the adjustment clears the 
disbursing officer’s account and similarly ends the matter. A net loss 
resulting from the application of 31 U.S.C. § 3342(c) is not an 
Antideficiency Act violation. 61 Comp. Gen. 649 (1982). 

It must be emphasized that 31 U.S.C. § 3342 does not make an agency’s 
appropriations available for these adjustments. It merely authorizes 
appropriations for that purpose. For disbursing officers within the 
Department of Defense, permanent authority exists to use appropriated 
funds for “losses in the accounts of disbursing officials and agents in 

Page 9-116 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

accordance with law.” 10 U.S.C. § 2781(2). Civilian agencies will need 
comparable authority which may be in the form of permanent legislation, 
specific appropriations, or specific language in a lump-sum appropriation 
(for example, “including adjustments as authorized by 31 U.S.C. § 3342”). 

The July 1991 decision made two other very important points. First, the 
offsetting authority of 31 U.S.C. § 3342 is discretionary. An agency is not 
required to use it, but retains the option of refusing to adjust a disbursing 
officer’s account, in which event the relief avenue of 31 U.S.C. § 3527(c) 
remains available. 

Second, while good faith and due care are prerequisites to relief under 
31 U.S.C. § 3527(c), section 3342 contains no comparable requirement. 
Thus, the use of section 3342 does not require findings of good faith and 
due care. Decisions stating or implying the contrary, such as 27 Comp. 
Gen. 211, were modified to that extent. Be that as it may, it is undesirable 
as a matter of policy to use 31 U.S.C. § 3342 to relieve a disbursing officer 
for losses attributable to bad faith or lack of due care, and an agency is well 
within its discretion to decline use of those procedures in such cases. 

The discretion to use 31 U.S.C. § 3342 applies only to checks cashed within 
the scope of the statute. Losses resulting from checks cashed beyond the 
scope of that authority (i.e., not for an official purpose or for a person not 
within one of the classes specified in subsection 3342(b)) may not be offset 
or adjusted under the authority of section 3342, but are improper payments 
for which administrative relief is available only under 31 U.S.C. § 3527(c). 

70 Comp. Gen. 420 (1991); B-127608-O.M., May 28, 1956. 

The losses under consideration—uncollectible check losses resulting from 
check cashing operations—fall into several distinct but related fact 
patterns. Cases cited below which predate GAO’s July 1991 decision are all 
section 3527(c) relief cases resolved under the principles and standards 
previously discussed; all could now be resolved under the offset and 
adjustment authority of 31 U.S.C. § 3342. 

• Uncollectible personal check. Cases in this category tend to involve 
either of two general situations: 
• Thief steals someone else’s personal checks and cashes them in 
conjunction with stolen or fraudulent identification. B-246418, 
Feb. 3, 1992; B-240440, Mar. 27, 1991; B-212588, Aug. 14, 1984. 
Page 9-117 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


b. Duplicate Check Losses 
Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

• Thief cashes checks from a fraudulently established checking 
account in the name of some other real or fictitious person. 
B-229827, Jan. 14, 1988; B-221415, Mar. 26, 1986; B-220737, B-220981, 

Dec. 10, 1985. 

• Fraudulent endorsement of government check. In this situation, a thief 
steals a legitimately issued government check (paycheck, tax refund 
check, etc.) and cashes it with the aid of stolen or fraudulent 
identification. E.g., B-227436, July 2, 1987; B-216726, Jan. 9, 1985; 
B-214436, Apr. 6, 1984. 
• Fraudulent alteration of amount on government check. If the amount 
is fraudulently raised by the payee, the liability of the disbursing officer 
is the difference between the original amount and the fraudulent 
amount. B-228859, Sept. 11, 1987. If the amount is altered and the 
check cashed by someone other than the payee, the disbursing officer’s 
liability is the full amount of the payment. B-221144, Apr. 22, 1986. The 
opportunity for fraudulent alteration of amounts naturally decreases 
when the amount is also spelled out in words on the face of the check. 
62 Comp. Gen. 476, 481 (1983). However, spelling the amount out in 
words is not required on government checks, and Treasury checks 
generally do not do so. See I TFM § 4-5035.50d. If a disbursing officer is 
in compliance with the TFM and applicable agency regulations, relief 
will not be denied solely because the amount is not written out in 
words. 65 Comp. Gen. 299 (1986); B-209697, Nov. 21, 1983. 
• Postal money order. The authority of 31 U.S.C. § 3342(a)(1) is not 
limited to checks but applies to “negotiable instruments” generally, 
which includes postal money orders. E.g., B-217663, July 16, 1985 
(fraudulent alteration of amount); B-213874, Sept. 6, 1984 (forged 
endorsement). 
The Department of Defense has established strict internal controls for 
accommodation transactions, which aim to virtually preclude fraudulent 
transactions and thus limits the grounds for granting relief to a disbursing 
officer who cashes a forged instrument. Department of Defense Financial 
Management Regulation No. 7000.14-R, vol. 5, ch. 4, Check Cashing Service 
(January 2004). 

A duplicate check loss, as we use the term here, is a loss resulting when 

(1)a payee claims nonreceipt of an original check, (2) the government 
issues a replacement check, and (3) both checks are negotiated. 
Page 9-118 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Replacement checks are issued under the authority of 31 U.S.C. § 3331. If 
an original check “is lost, stolen, destroyed in any part, or is so defaced that 
the value to the owner or holder is impaired,” the Secretary of the Treasury 
may issue a replacement check, and may delegate that authority to other 
agencies. 31 U.S.C. §§ 3331(b) and (g). The Secretary has discretionary 
authority to require an indemnification agreement from the owner or 
holder prior to issuing the replacement check. Id. § 3331(e). 

The current system for issuing replacement checks, developed by the 
Treasury Department in the mid-1980s, is reflected in 31 C.F.R. parts 245 
and 248 and I TFM chapter 4-7000.65 In brief, upon receipt of a claim for 
loss or nonreceipt of an original check, the spending agency may certify a 
new payment. 31 C.F.R. § 245.5. In agencies for which Treasury disburses, 
an agency certifying officer certifies the replacement check to a Treasury 
disbursing officer. For agencies which do their own disbursing, most 
notably the military departments, the “recertification” is an internal 
procedure based on agency as well as Treasury regulations. The 
replacement check, which has a different serial number from the original 
check, is called a “recertified check.” Formerly, most replacement checks 
were “substitute checks” with the same serial number as the original check. 
With the implementation of the recertification procedure, Treasury 
announced that substitute checks would generally no longer be available.66 

The Treasury regulations specify the responsibilities of the payee. If the 
original check shows up before the claimant receives the replacement 
check, the claimant should notify the agency and follow the agency’s 
instructions. 31 C.F.R. § 245.8(a). If the original check shows up after 
receipt of the replacement check, the claimant is to return the original to 
the issuing agency. “Under no circumstances should both the original and 
replacement checks be cashed.” Id. § 245.8(b). 

Payees do not always read Treasury regulations, however, and sometimes 
cash both checks. Since the agency’s obligation is to make payment once, 
cashing both checks results in an erroneous payment for which some 

65 Prior approaches had produced complex problems and were unsatisfactory. See 62 Comp. 
Gen. 91 (1982); GAO, Millions Paid Out in Duplicate and Forged Government Checks, 
AFMD-81-68 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 1, 1981). 

66 The regulations now use the term “substitute check” only in 31 C.F.R. part 248 in the 
context of “depositary checks,” checks drawn on accounts maintained in depositary banks 
in U.S. territories or foreign countries. 

Page 9-119 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

accountable officer is liable unless relieved. In the most common situation, 
the payee cashes both checks. The first check satisfies the government’s 
original obligation, and issuing the replacement check is an authorized 
transaction. Thus, the loss occurs “when the second check is wrongfully 
presented and paid. (The actual sequence in which the payee negotiates 
the original check and the replacement check is immaterial.)” 62 Comp. 
Gen. 91, 94 (1982). Depending on the agency and the nature of the error, 
the proper relief statute will be either 31 U.S.C. § 3528 (certifying officer) or 
31 U.S.C. § 3527(c) (disbursing officer). For the military departments, even 
though they may employ a “recertification” procedure, the proper statute is 
section 3527(c). 66 Comp. Gen. 192, 194 (1987). 

GAO’s first relief decision under the recertification procedure was 
65 Comp. Gen. 811 (1986). Relief for a duplicate check loss is granted if 

(1)the accountable officer followed applicable regulations and procedures, 
(2)there is no indication of bad faith, and (3) the agency has pursued or is 
pursuing adequate collection action to recover the overpayment. Id. at 812. 
This is essentially the same standard that had been applied under the 
former “substitute check” system. E.g., 65 Comp. Gen. 812, 813 (1986); 
62 Comp. Gen. 91, 97 (1982). A few more recent cases applying this 
standard are B-260753, Jan. 11, 1996 (Air Force); 70 Comp. Gen. 298 (1991) 
(Navy); B-237343, Jan. 23, 1991 (Army); and B-232773, Jan. 12, 1989 
(Defense Logistics Agency). Of course, relief cannot be granted until a loss 
actually occurs. 70 Comp. Gen. 9, 12 (1990); 66 Comp. Gen. 192, 194 (1987). 
The documentation required to support a relief request in a duplicate check 
case is spelled out in B-221720, May 8, 1986, and includes such things as 
copies of both checks, the claim of nonreceipt, the agency’s stop payment 
request, Treasury’s debit voucher, and documentation of collection efforts. 
If the disbursing officer is a supervisor and the duplicate check is actually 
issued by a subordinate, both are accountable officers for purposes of 
liability and relief. B-271017, Aug. 12, 1996; B-260639, June 15, 1995; 
62 Comp. Gen. 476, 479–80 (1983). The relief standards are those set forth 
in section D.3.a of this chapter for improper payments generally. As with 
other relief situations, lack of due care, failure to follow established 
procedures for example, will not preclude relief if it was not the proximate 
cause of the loss. 70 Comp. Gen. 298 (1991); B-225932, Mar. 27, 1987. 

Treasury regulations encourage, but do not require, the agency to obtain a 
signed statement from the claimant before issuing or certifying a 
replacement check. I TFM § 4-7060.20a. If the agency’s own regulations 
require the statement, failure to obtain it will generally be regarded as lack 

Page 9-120 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

of due care. Relief is granted or denied depending upon whether lack of 
due care was the proximate cause of the improper payment. B-225932, 
Mar. 27, 1987. If the statement is obtained but turns out to be a 
misrepresentation, it is not the accountable officer’s fault. B-247062, 
June 9, 1992. In 70 Comp. Gen. 9 (1990), GAO advised the Navy that it 
could waive its own requirement for claimant statements where a box 
containing over 4,600 checks was lost en route to the Philippines, and 
obtaining individual statements prior to issuing replacement checks would 
have caused undue delay and hardship. 

GAO has expressed concern over issuing replacement checks prematurely, 
that is, without giving the original check a reasonable time to arrive. While 
the timing is essentially a matter of agency discretion, it is also a factor 
which may bear upon the issue of due care. 63 Comp. Gen. 337 (1984). 
Timing should include risk assessment. Thus, a shorter waiting period may 
be appropriate where the payee has a continuing relationship with the 
agency and recoupment by offset is therefore presumably easier. I TFM 
§ 4-7060.20e; B-226116, Feb. 20, 1987. As a general proposition, GAO has 
said that it will not raise a question solely on the basis of a 3-day waiting 
period, but it might be a factor to be considered in determining whether a 
disbursing officer has exercised due care. 63 Comp. Gen. 337; I TFM 
§ 4-7060.20a. For checks mailed prior to the actual payment date, the 3-day 
period may include mailing days. B-230658, June 14, 1988. A waiting period 
of less than 3 days needs to be specifically justified. See B-215433, 
B-215515, July 2, 1984. A good example is B-246369, Feb. 3, 1992 (payee 
who was in Virginia could not have received original check inadvertently 
mailed to Florida). 

It is possible, although the cases are (and should be) rare, for duplicate 
check losses to occur with checks issued to a bank under direct deposit 
procedures. Recoupment efforts should be directed against the bank 
which made the error, leaving it to the bank to then recover from the 
individual depositor as an independent transaction. B-215431, B-215432, 
Jan. 2, 1985. Related decisions arising from the same set of losses are 
B-215432.3, Aug. 22, 1991 (finally granting relief upon documentation of 
collection efforts), and B-215432 et al., July 6, 1984. 

An agency’s internal controls and procedures form an important line of 
defense against duplicate check losses. One agency, for example, will issue 
a recertified check prior to obtaining the status of the original check only if 
the employee has sufficient funds in his or her retirement account to cover 
a potential loss, and requires specific clearances upon termination of 

Page 9-121 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

employment. These procedures, GAO commented, “will better safeguard 
federal funds.” B-232615, Sept. 28, 1988. Agencies should also develop 
guidelines for dealing with persons requesting several replacement checks 
within a relatively short time period. Three replacement check requests 
within an 11-month period, for example, should trigger some concern. 
B-221398, Sept. 19, 1986. Guidelines may include such things as counseling 
employees to take advantage of direct deposit procedures and delaying 
recertification until the status of the original check has been determined. 
The exact content of any such guidelines is up to the agency. B-217947, 
B-226384, Mar. 27, 1987; B-220500, Sept. 12, 1986. Indemnification 
agreements may be desirable in some circumstances, even where not 
required. See 66 Comp. Gen. 192, 194–95 (1987). Chargeback data received 
from Treasury should be processed and forwarded to the pertinent finance 
office as promptly as possible. B-226316 et al., Apr. 9, 1987. 

Cases occasionally present variations on the factual theme, but the basic 
relief approach is the same. E.g., B-226769, July 29, 1987 (agency issued 
replacement for wrong amount); B-195396, Oct. 1, 1979 (agency 
inadvertently issued two replacement checks). 

In our coverage of physical losses, we discussed the dollar amount GAO 
has established, currently $3,000, below which agencies may grant relief 
without the need for GAO involvement. In October 1991, GAO started 
extending the limit selectively to certain categories of improper payments, 
one of which is duplicate check losses. For duplicate check losses not 
exceeding $3,000, agencies may grant or deny relief administratively, 
without the need for GAO concurrence, in accordance with applicable 
statutes, regulations, and GAO decisions. B-243749, Oct. 22, 1991 (civilian); 
B-244972, Oct. 22, 1991 (military).67 Section C.2 of this chapter contains 
more detail on how the $3,000 limit operates. 

In the cases cited and discussed thus far, it was the payee who negotiated 
both checks. Where the original check is fraudulently negotiated by 
someone else, the situation is a bit different. Here, the replacement check 
rather than the original check satisfies the government’s obligation to the 
payee, and the loss results from negotiating the original check. 66 Comp. 
Gen. 192, 194 (1987). More precisely, the loss results from payment on the 
original check since there is nothing improper or incorrect in issuing the 

67 The process actually started with a limited authorization for the Army, B-214372, Oct. 9, 
1987, which was revoked by the more inclusive B-244972.

c. Errors in Check Issuance 
Process 
original check. Id. If forgery is established, Treasury will seek to recover 
from the bank which negotiated the check. See B-232772, Oct. 17, 1989. 

The October 1991 decisions just cited authorizing administrative resolution 
of duplicate check losses not exceeding $3,000 extended the authorization 
to another category of erroneous payments—those resulting from 
“mechanical and/or clerical errors during the check issuance process.” 
Thus, agencies may grant or deny relief for losses in this category within 
the monetary ceiling, as with duplicate check losses, in accordance with 
applicable statutes, regulations, and GAO decisions. B-243749, Oct. 22, 
1991(civilian); B-244972, Oct. 22, 1991 (military). The relief standards are 
the same as those previously discussed for other types of improper or 
erroneous payments. 

Cases under this heading may result from any type of check payment— 
salary payments, payments to contractors, benefit payments, etc.—and 
include a variety of fact patterns. A few cases involving erroneous tax 
refund checks will illustrate. In each case, the disbursing officer was a 
director of one of Treasury’s regional financial centers (formerly called 
disbursing centers), a supervisory official. In B-241098, B-241137, Dec. 27, 
1990, the printing system rejected two checks and automatically produced 
substitutes; the printing operator failed to remove and void the original 
checks; the originals and substitutes were issued and cashed by the payees. 
In B-187180, Sept. 21, 1976, a keypunching error transposed two numerals, 
resulting in issuance of a check for $718 instead of the correct amount of 
$178. In B-235037, Sept. 18, 1989, an overpayment was made due to an 
error during the “typing operation and proof reading process.” Relief was 
granted in the first two cases by applying the standards for relieving a 
supervisor; in the third, it was denied because the request contained 
neither a description of relevant controls and procedures nor statements by 
the individuals concerned. 

As demonstrated in B-241098, B-241137 (where the IRS printing system 
rejected two tax refund checks and automatically produced substitutes and 
the printing operator failed to void the originals), most mechanical errors 
are not purely mechanical, but involve human error as well, such as failure 
to spot the error during a verification process. Also, many of these cases 
involve the issuance of duplicate checks, the difference between these and 
the previously discussed duplicate check losses being that these losses do 
not result from a claim of nonreceipt but from the simultaneous issuance of 
duplicate checks attributable to government error. Similar cases involving 
other types of payments are B-239371, June 13, 1990; B-239094, June 13, 

Page 9-123 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

1990; B-237082 et al., May 8, 1990; B-235044 et al., Mar. 20, 1990; and 
B-235036, Oct. 17, 1989. Some factual variations follow: 

• Machine that stuffs checks into envelopes was misaligned, obscuring 
the names and addresses. Treasury decided to shred the original 
checks and reissue them. One of the originals was inadvertently 
delivered rather than shredded, causing a duplicate payment. B-245586, 
Nov. 12, 1991 (relief granted). 
• Due to mechanical failure, a checkprinting machine failed to advance a 
voucher schedule and a second check was issued to a person with the 
same name but different middle initial than the correct payee. A clerk 
failed to notice the error during verification. In view of the volume of 
work at the disbursing center, the error was viewed as the type that will 
occasionally escape even in a well-established and carefully supervised 
system. B-195106, July 12, 1979 (relief granted). 
• Malfunction of feed mechanism on printing machine caused one check 
to skip, printing the inscription on the next check. The first check was 
replaced without noticing the duplicate; both checks were issued. 
Relief was granted on the same basis as in B-195106. B-212431, Nov. 21, 
1983. 
“Clerical error” means human error without contributing mechanical 
malfunction. Relief standards remain the same. The cases noted in the 
following groupings, as with the last three tax refund cases cited above, are 
intended to illustrate factual variations. 

• Payment of wrong amount. The person preparing a check for a 
military separation voucher misread a dollar sign as the number “8,” 
and printed a check for $899 instead of the correct amount of $99. 
B-238863, July 11, 1991 (relief granted). A voucher examiner preparing 
a partial payment to a contractor erroneously used the total amount 
due on the contract instead of the amount of the partial payment. 
B-227410, Aug. 18, 1987 (relief granted). 
• Payment to wrong person. A clerk consolidating two contract 
payment vouchers in a single check payable to a credit union 
erroneously listed only one account number, causing an overpayment 
to one contractor and necessitating a replacement check to the other. 
B-238802, Dec. 31, 1990 (relief granted). Further examples are: 
B-254385, Mar. 22, 1994 (incorrect processing code generated payment 
Page 9-124 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

to wrong contractor; relief granted); B-234197, Mar. 15, 1989 
(misreading of documents resulted in payment to subcontractor 
instead of prime contractor; relief granted); B-212336, Aug. 8, 1983 
(voluntary child support allotment paid to wrong person due to error in 
assignment of organization code; relief granted); B-192109, June 3, 1981 
(check issued to wrong person with slightly different name than correct 
payee; relief granted); and B-194877, July 12, 1979 (amounts of two 
checks inadvertently switched; relief granted). 

• Duplicate payment. Treasury Financial Center was issuing 
replacements for a batch of mutilated checks. One mutilated check 
became separated from the rest and was erroneously released along 
with its replacement. A computer operator had failed to verify each 
replacement check against the corresponding mutilated check. 
Because controls were in place which would have prevented the error 
had they been followed, and considering the large volume of work at 
the disbursing center, relief was granted to the disbursing officer, the 
center’s director. (The computer operator is not an accountable 
officer.) B-231551, Sept. 12, 1988 (relief granted). 
Most duplicate payments are recovered, but many either are not or involve 
the expense of collection action or litigation. Especially in the area of 
payments to contractors, duplicate payment losses can involve large 
amounts. Duplicate payments are considered improper payments, 
reportable under the Improper Payments Information Act, Pub. L. No. 107300, 
116 Stat. 2350 (Nov. 26, 2002). GAO has emphasized the importance of 
adequate internal controls, as well as strong support and active 
involvement from agency management, the administration, and Congress, 
in reducing duplicate payments and other types of improper payments. See 
GAO, Financial Management: Status of the Governmentwide Efforts to 
Address Improper Payment Problems, GAO-04-99 (Washington, D.C.: 
Oct. 17, 2003); General Services Administration Needs to Improve Its 
Internal Controls to Prevent Duplicate Payments, GAO/AFMD-85-70 
(Washington, D.C.: Aug. 20, 1985); Strengthening Internal Controls Would 
Help the Department of Justice Reduce Duplicate Payments, GAO/AFMD85-
72 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 20, 1985). A case involving a duplicate 
payment to a contractor in which relief was granted on the basis of 
adequate controls is B-241019.2, Feb. 7, 1992. 

5. Statute of Limitations The accounts of accountable officers must be settled by GAO within 
3 years “after the date the Comptroller General receives the account.” 
Page 9-125 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

31 U.S.C. § 3526(c)(1). Once this 3-year period has expired, no charges may 
be raised against the account except for losses due to fraud or criminal 
action on the part of the accountable officer. Id. § 3526(c)(2). Enacted in 
1947,68 this legislation effectively operates as a limitation on establishing an 
accountable officer’s liability for improper expenditures. As the Defense 
Department pointed out in recommending the legislation, a time limitation 
is desirable because passage of time diminishes the chances of recovering 
from the payee or recipient, leaving the liability solely with the accountable 
officer. S. Rep. No. 80-99 (1947). 

Unlike other statutes of limitations which merely affect the remedy (for 
example, by barring the commencement of legal proceedings), 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3526(c) completely eliminates the debt. B-181466, Nov. 19, 1974 
(nondecision letter). Once an account has been settled, it cannot be 
reopened (except for fraud or criminality, as noted above), and the 
authority to grant or deny relief no longer exists. Thus, an accountable 
officer can escape liability for an improper expenditure if the government 
does not raise a charge against the account within the 3-year period. E.g., 

62 Comp. Gen. 498 (1983); B-223372, Dec. 4, 1989; B-198451.2, Sept. 15, 
1982. Once an accountable officer’s liability has been timely established, 
section 3526(c) does not limit the government’s recovery from that officer. 
31 U.S.C. § 3526(c)(4)(B). An accountable officer’s liability can be 
established by the officer’s agreement to repay the erroneous payment or 
by a denial of relief made by the agency. 70 Comp. Gen. 616 (1991); 
B-258735, Dec. 15, 1994. 

The statute of limitations of 31 U.S.C. § 3526(c) applies only to improper 
payments and not to physical losses or deficiencies. B-260563, Mar. 31, 
1995; 60 Comp. Gen. 674 (1981). An accountable officer’s liability for a 
physical loss or deficiency is wholly independent of anyone’s “raising a 
charge” against that officer’s account. 

The original version of 31 U.S.C. § 3526(c) was enacted at a time when 
accounts were physically transmitted to GAO for settlement, GAO 
reviewed every piece of paper, and then issued a certificate of settlement to 
the accountable officer, “disallowing” credit for questionable items. As a 
result of changes in audit methods, this is no longer done. Rather, accounts 
are now retained by the various agencies, and an account is regarded as 
settled by operation of law at the end of the 3-year period except for 

68 Pub. L. No. 72, ch. 78, 61 Stat. 101 (May 19, 1947).

unresolved items. GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of 
Federal Agencies, title 7, § 8.7 (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993) (hereafter 
GAO-PPM). 

To reflect these changes in audit procedures, the date a “substantially 
complete” account is in the hands of the agency and available for audit is 
now generally considered as the point from which the 3-year period begins 
to run. E.g., B-258735, Dec. 15, 1994. Assuming that supporting documents 
are available at the end of the time period covered by an accountable 
officer’s statement of accountability, this will usually mean the date on 
which that statement of accountability is certified. 7 GAO-PPM § 8.7. For 
example, in B-251994, Sept. 24, 1993, the agency’s disbursing officer 
prepared monthly statements of accountability, and thus the 3-year period 
for both the disbursing and certifying officer would begin on the last day of 
the month covered by the accountability statement that included the 
improper payment.69 

There are situations, however, in which the 3-year period does not begin to 
run until some later date. Where a loss is due to fraud, the period begins 
when the loss is discovered and reported to appropriate agency officials. 
B-272615, May 19, 1997; B-270442.2, Feb. 12, 1996. Where an agency has no 
way of knowing that an improper payment has occurred until it receives a 
debit voucher from the Treasury Department (duplicate check losses, for 
example), the 3-year period begins to run when the agency receives the 
debit voucher. B-226393, Apr. 29, 1988. If the date of receipt cannot be 
determined, the date of the debit voucher is used.70 Id. 

If an irregularity has not been resolved by the agency within 2 years from 
the time the statute of limitations begins to run, the irregularity should at 
that time be reported to GAO. This may be in the form of a relief request or 

69 Unlike disbursing officers, certifying officers are not custodians of public funds, and thus 
do not have accounts and statements of accountability in the same manner disbursing 
officers do. For purposes of audit and settlement, GAO considers the certifying officer’s 
account to be the certified vouchers and supporting papers relating to payments made by a 
disbursing officer over a particular accounting period. In other words, for payments 
comprising a disbursing officer’s statement of accountability, the 3-year period is essentially 
the same for the disbursing officer and for the certifying officers on whose certifications the 
disbursing officer relied. B-251994, Sept. 24, 1993. 

70 Prior decisions had not been entirely clear on precisely which date to use. E.g., B-220689, 
Sept. 24, 1986 (date of debit voucher); B-213874, Sept. 6, 1984 (inclusion in statement of 
accountability). B-226393 established the propositions stated in the text and modified prior 
decisions accordingly.

a copy of the agency’s irregularity report. This is designed to provide 
adequate time to consider a relief request or to otherwise prevent 
expiration of the statute of limitations where necessary. 7 GAO-PPM 
§ 8.4.C. See also 62 Comp. Gen. 476, 480 (1983); B-227538, July 8, 1987; 
B-217741, Oct. 15, 1985. Of course, nothing prevents an agency from 
seeking relief sooner if appropriate. 

As noted above, the 3-year limitation does not apply to losses attributable 
to fraud or other criminal action by the accountable officer. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3526(c)(2). It is automatically suspended during war. Id. § 3526(c)(3). 
And it may be suspended by the Comptroller General with respect to a 
specific item to get additional evidence or explanation necessary to settle 
an account. Id. § 3526(g). This may be in the form of a timely Notice of 
Exception (B-226176, May 26, 1987), or other written notification 
(B-272615, May 19, 1997; B-270715, July 23, 1996). The mere submission of 
a relief request within the 3-year period, however, is not sufficient to toll 
the 3-year statute of limitations. 62 Comp. Gen. 91, 98 (1982); B-220689, 
Sept. 24, 1986. 

Finally, 31 U.S.C. § 3526(c) deals solely with the liability of an accountable 
officer. It has no effect on the liability of the payee or recipient of an 
improper payment. It does not establish a limitation on recoveries against 
the improper payee or recipient nor does it affect the agency’s obligation to 
pursue collection action against the payee or recipient. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3526(c)(4)(A); Arnold v. United States, 404 F.2d 953 (Ct. Cl. 1968); 
B-205587, June 1, 1982. Nor does 31 U.S.C. § 3526(c) affect an agency’s 
ability to pay a voluntary creditor’s claim for reimbursement, which is 
governed by 31 U.S.C. § 3702. B-278805, July 21, 1999. 

The relief statutes discussed thus far—31 U.S.C. §§ 3527(a), (b), (c), and 

E. Other Relief 
3528—are the ones most commonly encountered and will cover the vast 

Statutes 

majority of cases. Several others exist, however. Our listing here is not 
intended to be complete. 

1. Statutes Requiring The statutes in this group are similar to 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527 and 3528 in that 
they require someone to actually make a relief decision.
Affirmative Action 

a. United States Court of The relief authority of the Court of Federal Claims is found in two 
Federal Claims provisions of law: 
Page 9-128 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

b. The Legislative and Judicial 
Branches 
“The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have 
jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim by a 
disbursing officer of the United States or by his 
administrator or executor for relief from responsibility for 
loss, in line of duty, of Government funds, vouchers, records 
or other papers in his charge.” 

28 U.S.C. § 1496. 

“Whenever the United States Court of Federal Claims finds 
that any loss by a disbursing officer of the United States was 
without his fault or negligence, it shall render a judgment 
setting forth the amount thereof, and the [Government 
Accountability Office] shall allow the officer such amount 
as a credit in the settlement of his accounts.” 

28 U.S.C. § 2512. 

These provisions, which originated together in legislation enacted in 1866,71 
predate all of the other relief statutes and were once the only relief 
mechanism available apart from private relief legislation. The Supreme 
Court has termed this legislation “a very curious provision” in that it 
permits a disbursing officer to establish a defense to a claim which “the 
government can only establish judicially in some other court.” United 
States v. Clark, 96 U.S. (6 Otto) 37, 43 (1877). In effect, it authorizes the 
Court of Federal Claims to render a declaratory (as opposed to money) 
judgment. Ralcon, Inc. v. United States, 13 Cl. Ct. 294, 300 (1987). Now, in 
view of the comprehensive scheme of administrative relief that Congress 
has enacted, this statute is rarely used. 

Since 31 U.S.C. § 3728, the primary certifying officer relief statute, does not 
apply to the legislative or judicial branches, Congress has enacted specific 
statutes for several legislative branch agencies and for the judicial branch 
authorizing or requiring the designation of certifying officers, establishing 
their accountability, and authorizing the Comptroller General to grant 
relief. Patterned after 31 U.S.C. § 3728, they are: 2 U.S.C. § 142b (Library of 
Congress), 2 U.S.C. § 142e (Congressional Budget Office), 2 U.S.C. § 142l 
(Office of Compliance), 2 U.S.C. § 1904 (Capitol Police), and 44 U.S.C. § 308 

71 Act of May 9, 1866, ch. 75, 14 Stat. 44.

c. Savings Bond Redemption 
Losses 
(Government Printing Office). The relevant provision for the judicial 
branch is 28 U.S.C. § 613. 

Losses resulting from the redemption of savings bonds are replaced from 
the fund used to pay claims under the Government Losses in Shipment Act. 
31 U.S.C. § 3126(a). The statute further provides that “an officer or 
employee of the Department of the Treasury is relieved from liability to the 
United States Government for the loss when the Secretary [of the Treasury] 
decides that the loss did not result from the fault or negligence of the . . . 
officer, or employee.” Relief is mandatory if the government does not give 
the officer or employee written notice of his or her liability or potential 
liability within 10 years from the date of the erroneous payment. Id. 

2. Statutes Providing 
“Automatic” Relief 
The statutes in this group either (1) provide that taking a certain authorized 
action which might otherwise be regarded as creating a loss will not result 
in accountable officer liability, or (2) authorize the resolution of certain 
losses in such a manner as not to produce liability. 
a. Waiver of Indebtedness Many statutes authorize the government to waive the recovery of 
indebtedness resulting from various overpayments or erroneous payments 
if certain conditions are met. Waiver statutes commonly include a 
provision to the effect that accountable officers will not be held liable for 
any amounts waived. For example, the statutes authorizing waiver of 
overpayments of pay and allowances require that full credit be given in the 
accounts of accountable officers for any amounts waived under the statute. 
5 U.S.C. § 5584(d) (civilian employees); 10 U.S.C. § 2774(d) (military 
personnel); 32 U.S.C. § 716(d) (National Guard). Once waiver is granted, 
the payment is deemed valid and there is no need to consider the question 
of relief. E.g., B-184947, Mar. 21, 1978. This result applies even where relief 
has been denied under the applicable relief statute. B-177841-O.M., Oct. 23, 
1973. 
Examples of comparable provisions in other waiver statutes are 5 U.S.C. 
§ 8129(c) (overpayments under Federal Employees Compensation Act), 
38 U.S.C. § 5302(d) (overpayment of veterans’ benefits), and 42 U.S.C. 
§ 404(c) (Social Security Act).

c. Foreign Exchange 
Transactions 
regulations, no accountable officer will be held liable for the portion 
unrecovered by virtue of the compromise. 31 U.S.C. § 3711(c). 

Earlier in this chapter we discussed 31 U.S.C. § 3342(c), which authorizes, 
with respect to activities authorized under section 3342(a), losses to be 
offset against gains on a fiscal-year basis, and also authorizes 
appropriations to make adjustments for net losses. Our prior discussion 
was in the context of check cashing operations. Another important use of 
31 U.S.C. § 3342(c) is accounting for certain foreign exchange losses. To 
implement this authority in the foreign exchange area, the Treasury 
Department has issued regulations in I TFM part 4, chapter 9000, and has 
established an account entitled “Gains and Deficiencies on Exchange 
Transactions.” See I TFM § 4-9065.10. As with the check cashing context, 
the relevant point here is that the use of 31 U.S.C. § 3342(c) accomplishes 
the necessary account adjustment and obviates the need to seek relief for 
any accountable officer. B-249796, Feb. 9, 1993. 

One use of the Gains and Deficiencies account is the adjustment of losses 
due to exchange rate fluctuations. E.g., 70 Comp. Gen. 616 (1991) (agency 
has discretion whether to offset gains and losses); 64 Comp. Gen. 152 
(1984) (restoration of losses in Library of Congress foreign currency 
accounts attributable to currency devaluations); 61 Comp. Gen. 649 (1982) 
(determination of proper exchange rate); B-245760, Jan. 16, 1992 
(devaluation of Laotian currency). However, in order to use the Gains and 
Deficiencies account, losses must result from “disbursing officer 
transactions” of the type authorized by 31 U.S.C. § 3342(a). 45 Comp. 
Gen. 493 (1966). In that case, the American Embassy in Cairo had made a 
payment for certain property in Egyptian pounds. The sales agreement was 
not executed and the money was refunded. At the time of the refund, the 
exchange rate had changed and the same amount of Egyptian pounds was 
worth less in U.S. dollars, resulting in a loss to the account. GAO agreed 
with the Treasury Department that the loss resulted from an administrative 
collection and not from a disbursing officer transaction, and should 
therefore be borne by the relevant program appropriation rather than the 
Gains and Deficiencies account. 

GAO has also considered the use of the Gains and Deficiencies account in a 
number of cases involving Vietnamese and Cambodian currency after the 
American evacuation from those countries in the mid-1970s. 56 Comp. 
Gen. 791 (1977). See also 61 Comp. Gen. 132 (1981) (piaster currency 
physically abandoned or left in accounts in Vietnam chargeable to Gains 
and Deficiencies); B-197708, Apr. 8, 1980 (Vietnamese and Cambodian

d. Check Forgery Insurance 
Fund 
currency received by Treasury from U.S. disbursing officers at exchange 
rate in effect at time of evacuation subsequently became valueless; loss 
held to be of the type contemplated by 31 U.S.C. § 3342(c)). However, U.S. 
currency which was thought to have been burned but which subsequently 
turned up in the United States had to be treated as a physical loss. 
56 Comp. Gen. at 793–96. (Relief was granted for this loss under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3527(a) in B-209978, July 18, 1983.) 

The Check Forgery Insurance Fund is a revolving fund the purpose of 
which is to make replacement payments to payees whose Treasury checks 
have been lost or stolen and cashed over a forged endorsement in limited 
situations.31 U.S.C. § 3343. Before the Fund may be used, three conditions 
must be satisfied: (1) the check is lost or stolen without fault of the payee; 

(2)the check is subsequently negotiated over the payee’s forged 
endorsement; and (3) the payee did not participate in any part of the 
proceeds of the check. Id. § 3343(b). Any recoveries from a forger, a 
transferee, or party on the check are restored to the Fund. Id. § 3343(d). 
A forged endorsement for purposes of the statute has been held to include 
an unauthorized endorsement purported to be made in a representative 
capacity. Strann v. United States, 2 Cl. Ct. 782 (1983) (plaintiff’s attorney 
endorsed tax refund check without authority). The third condition, 
participation in the proceeds, does not require a knowing participation. 
Koch v. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 590 F.2d 260 
(8th Cir. 1978); Duden v. United States, 467 F.2d 924 (Ct. Cl. 1972). In 
Duden, for example, the plaintiff’s former husband endorsed her name on a 
tax refund check and subsequently paid her part of the proceeds for 
support. She had no way of knowing that the payment came from those 
proceeds. While the endorsement was held not to be a forgery under the 
facts involved, the court also noted that the plaintiff’s participation in the 
proceeds would preclude recovery from the Check Forgery Insurance 
Fund. Duden, 467 F.2d at 930. 

The bank presenting a check to the Treasury for payment guarantees the 
genuineness of prior endorsements. 31 C.F.R. § 240.3. Thus, in many cases, 
the government will be able to recover from the presenting bank. E.g., 
Olson v. United States, 437 F.2d 981, 986–87 (Ct. Cl.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 
939 (1971). 

There is no mention of accountable officers in 31 U.S.C. § 3343. However, a 
payment from the Check Forgery Insurance Fund means that only one 
payment is charged to the appropriations of the agency incurring the 

Page 9-132 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

original obligation, with the effect that no accountable officer of that 
agency incurs any liability. See B-10929, Feb. 1, 1972. 

e. Secretary of the Treasury Enacted in 1947,72 31 U.S.C. § 3333 provides that the Secretary of the 
Treasury will not be liable for payments made “in due course and without 
negligence” of checks drawn on the Treasury or a depositary, or other 
obligations guaranteed or assumed by the United States, and that the 
Comptroller General “shall credit” the appropriate accounts for such 
payments. At one time, many duplicate check losses were handled under 
31 U.S.C. § 3333. See 62 Comp. Gen. 91 (1982). It was Treasury’s practice to 
accumulate the cases and submit them in groups, for example, B-115388, 
Oct. 12, 1976, and B-71585, Sept. 22, 1955, with credit being allowed as a 
matter of routine. With the development of Treasury’s previously discussed 
recertification procedure, much of the need to invoke 31 U.S.C. § 3333 
evaporated. While many of the earlier cases involved an exchange of 
correspondence between Treasury and GAO, nothing in the statute requires 
it, especially since GAO no longer maintains accounts and “relief” is 
mandatory anyway. 
f. Other Statutes There are several other statutes affecting the liability of accountable 
officers in a variety of contexts. A few of them are: 
• 5 U.S.C. § 8321. Accountable officers are not liable for payments in 
violation of statutes prescribing forfeiture of retirement annuities or 
retired pay as long as the payments are made “in due course and 
without fraud, collusion, or gross negligence.” The reason for this 
statute was to avoid having to deny relief under 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b) for 
payments made in good faith solely because the payments are 
specifically prohibited by law. B-122068, Mar. 18, 1955. 
• 31 U.S.C. § 3521(c). Previously noted, this statute protects 
accountable officers from liability for losses under an authorized 
statistical sampling procedure to audit vouchers. 
• 31 U.S.C. § 3528(c). Certifying officials are not liable for 
overpayments made to a common carrier if the overpayment occurred 
only because the administrative audit before payment did not verify 
transportation rates, freight classifications, or land-grant deductions 
72 Pub. L. No. 333, ch. 455, 61 Stat. 730 (Aug. 4, 1947). 

Page 9-133 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

and the Administrator of General Services has determined that 
verification by a prepayment audit would not adequately protect the 
interests of the government. 

• 42 U.S.C. § 659(f). Disbursing officers are not liable for a payment 
under a garnishment process for enforcement of child support and 
alimony obligations which is “regular on its face” and in compliance 
with 42 U.S.C. § 659. See 73 Comp. Gen. 194 (1994); 61 Comp. Gen. 229 
(1982). 
F. Procedures 
1. Reporting of 
Irregularities 
Agencies are required to document each fiscal irregularity that affects the 
account of an accountable officer whose accounts are required to be 
settled by GAO under 31 U.S.C. § 3526, regardless of how it is discovered. 
The report is retained as part of the account records and a copy provided to 
the accountable officer and to GAO if the irregularity is not resolved within 
2 years after the date the accounts are made available for audit. GAO, 
Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, 
§ 8.4.B (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993) (hereafter GAO-PPM). The 
contents of the report are set forth in 7 GAO-PPM § 8.12.A, and include 
such things as a description of how the irregularity occurred and a 
description of any known procedural deficiencies and corrective action. 

The agency’s next job is to attempt to resolve the irregularity, most 
importantly by pursuing collection action against the improper payee or 
recipient where possible. Recovery of the funds of course ends the matter. 
If the funds cannot be recovered and the case is one in which the agency 
may grant relief without GAO involvement, consideration of relief is the 
next step. If the matter is resolved administratively in either of these ways, 
the record should be further documented as specified in 7 GAO-PPM 
§ 8.12.B (required administrative determinations, etc.). There is no need to 
report resolved irregularities to GAO. 

If the irregularity cannot be resolved administratively within 2 years after 
the date the account is available for audit, and if the loss exceeds the 
monetary limit established for administrative resolution, the agency should 
then submit to GAO a copy of the updated irregularity report and a relief 
request if appropriate. 7 GAO-PPM § 8.4.C. This 2-year guideline is 

Page 9-134 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

especially important for improper payments in view of the 3-year statute of 
limitations of 31 U.S.C. § 3526(c).73 Thus, below-ceiling losses need not be 
reported to GAO at all; above-ceiling losses should be reported only if 
unresolved at the end of the 2-year period. Of course, the agency may 
request relief sooner if desired. 

2. Obtaining Relief The GAO official designated to exercise the Comptroller General’s 
authority under the various relief statutes is the Managing Associate 
General Counsel for Goal 3, Office of General Counsel, who is responsible 
for appropriations law matters. Relief requests where GAO action is 
necessary should be addressed to GAO’s Office of General Counsel. The 
request may be in simple letter format and should include all items 
specified in GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal 
Agencies, title 7, § 8.12.C (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993). These include a 
copy of the irregularity report, a description of collection actions taken, 
and any required administrative determinations. Of particular importance 
is a written statement by the accountable officer or a notation that the 
accountable officer chooses not to submit a separate statement. The 
accountable officer’s liability arises by operation of law and the 
government is not required to prove negligence. Therefore, it is important 
that all accountable officers be given the opportunity to include a 
statement in their relief requests because they have the burden of 
demonstrating that the loss occurred without any fault or negligence on 
their part. Id. Relief will be granted or denied in the form of a letter 
addressed to the official who submitted the request. 
In any case in which GAO has denied relief, the agency, or the accountable 
officer through appropriate administrative channels, may ask GAO to 
reconsider. GAO will not hesitate to reverse a decision shown to be wrong. 
Any request for reconsideration should set forth the errors which the 
applicant believes have been made and should include evidence (not mere 
unsupported allegations) to support the basis for relief, for example, that 
the original denial failed to consider certain evidence or to give it 
appropriate weight or relied too heavily on other evidence in the record. 
Denials of relief are often based not so much on the merits of the case but 

73 The 3-year limitation period begins to run when the agency’s accounts are substantially 
complete for audit purposes (i.e., when various documents supporting the applicable 
statement of accountability are available to the agency and GAO for audit). See 7 GAO-PPM 
§ 8.7. 

Page 9-135 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

simply on the failure of the original request to include sufficient 
information to enable an independent evaluation. Of course, if the agency 
cannot or is unwilling to make a required statutory determination, there is 
nothing GAO can do and a request for reconsideration is pointless. 

3. De Minimis Rule: 
Payments of $100 or 
Less 
In B-161457, July 14, 1976, a circular letter to all department and agency 
heads, and disbursing and certifying officers, the Comptroller General 
advised as follows: 

“[I]n lieu of requesting a decision by the Comptroller 
General for items of $25 or less, disbursing and certifying 
officers may hereafter rely upon written advice from an 
agency official designated by the head of each department 
or agency. A copy of the document containing such advice 
should be attached to the voucher and the propriety of any 
such payment will be considered conclusive on the General 
Accounting Office in its settlement of the accounts 
involved.” 

The amount has since been raised to $100. GAO, Policy and Procedures 
Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 8.3 (Washington, D.C.: 
May 18, 1993). This does not preclude a certifying or disbursing officer 
from seeking a decision if deemed necessary since the entitlement to 
advance decisions is statutory, but it does provide a means for simplifying 
the payment of very small amounts. An accountable officer is not liable for 
a payment made under this authority even if the payment is later found to 
be improper or erroneous. The $100 threshold applies equally to questions 
arising after payment has been made. 61 Comp. Gen. 646, 648 (1982). 

4. Relief versus Grievance 
Procedures 
Federal employees have the right to organize and to bargain collectively 
with respect to conditions of employment. 5 U.S.C. § 7102. Collective 
bargaining agreements may include negotiated grievance procedures, 
which may in turn provide for dispute resolution by binding arbitration. Id. 
§ 7121. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) decides questions of 
an agency’s duty to bargain in good faith under 5 U.S.C. § 7105(a)(2)(E). 
Agencies have a duty to bargain in good faith to the extent not inconsistent 
with federal law. Id. § 7117. The FLRA also decides appeals alleging that 
an arbitration award is contrary to federal law. Id. § 7122. 

Page 9-136 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Since the authority to relieve accountable officers is provided by statute, 
both GAO and the FLRA have determined that negotiated grievance 
procedures may not be used as a substitute for making the relief decision. 
B-213804, Aug. 13, 1985; National Treasury Employees Union and 
Internal Revenue Service, 14 F.L.R.A. 65 (1984). The same result applies to 
the State Department’s separate statutory grievance procedures. 67 Comp. 
Gen. 457 (1988). 

However, a grievance procedure may encompass an agency head’s 
determination that an accountable officer is negligent, as distinguished 
from the actual relief decision. See National Treasury Employees Union 
and Internal Revenue Service, 33 F.L.R.A. 229 (1988), citing 59 Comp. 
Gen. 113 (1979) for the proposition that GAO’s statutory role does not arise 
until after the agency head has made the requisite determination under 
section 3527 for disbursing officials. 

G. Collection Action 
1. Against Recipient A person who receives money from the government to which he or she is 
not entitled, however innocently, has no right to keep it. The recipient is 
indebted to the government, and the agency making the improper or 
erroneous payment has a duty to attempt to recover the funds, wholly 
independent of any question of liability or relief of an accountable officer. 
The duty to aggressively pursue collection action and the means of doing so 
are found primarily in the Federal Claims Collection Act as amended by the 
Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, at 31 U.S.C. § 3711, and the 
implementing regulations in the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 
31 C.F.R. parts 900–904,74 the details of which are covered elsewhere in this 
publication. Indeed, many of the statutes we have previously discussed 
emphasize that the relief process does not diminish this duty. E.g., 
31 U.S.C. §§ 3333(b), 3343(g), 3526(c)(4), 3527(d)(2). 
74 The Standards were previously promulgated jointly by the Department of Justice and GAO 
and were published at 4 C.F.R. parts 101–105. However, the Secretary of the Treasury was 
subsequently added as a co-promulgator and the Comptroller General removed. See Debt 
Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-134, § 31001(d)(2)(A), 110 Stat. 1321, 
1321-359 (Apr. 26, 1996); General Accounting Office Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 
§ 115(g)(1), 110 Stat. 3826, 3834–35 (Oct. 19, 1996). 

Page 9-137 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

Recovery from the improper payee or recipient removes the accountable 
officer’s liability regardless of whether relief has or has not been sought 
because there is no longer any loss. However, merely “flagging” the 
retirement account of an employee who has received an overpayment, for 
possible collection at some unpredictable future time, is not enough as it 
would delay indefinitely the final settlement of the account. 31 Comp. 
Gen. 17 (1951). 

In a sense, the recipient and the unrelieved accountable officer share an 
element of joint liability. The occasional decision has referred to this as 
“joint and several” liability, but it has been pointed out that this is incorrect. 
E.g., B-228946, Jan. 15, 1988. If two debtors are “jointly and severally” 
liable, the creditor has the option of collecting the full amount from either, 
with the debtor who pays then having a right of contribution against the 
remaining debtor(s). Certainly no one would suggest that someone who 
has defrauded the government and repays the debt has any right of 
contribution against the accountable officer. Also, under joint and several 
liability, the creditor may seek to collect a portion from each debtor. The 
agency in an accountable officer loss has no such option. B-212602, Apr. 5, 
1984. The agency’s first obligation is to seek recovery from the recipient. 
The recipient of an improper payment is liable for the full amount, with any 
amounts collected used to reduce the accountable officer’s liability. Id.; 
30 Comp. Gen. 298, 300 (1951). See also 62 Comp. Gen. 476, 478–79 (1983); 
54 Comp. Gen. 112, 114 (1974). 

So strong is this duty to seek recovery from the improper payee or recipient 
that the two primary relief statutes for improper payments explicitly 
authorize GAO to deny relief if the agency has failed to diligently pursue 
collection action against the recipient. 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527(c) (disbursing 
officers), 3528(b)(2) (certifying officers). See also B-271017, Aug. 12, 1996. 
GAO is extremely reluctant to deny relief solely on the basis of inadequate 
collection action because often the failure is attributable to the agency 
rather than the accountable officer. However, it has been done. E.g., 
B-234815, Oct. 3, 1989 (disbursing officer failed to initiate collection action 
despite repeated advice from agency counsel). 

Adequate collection action means compliance with the Federal Claims 
Collection Act and Standards. 62 Comp. Gen. 476, 478–79 (1983); B-233870, 
May 30, 1989. Accordingly, once it has been determined that the improper 
payments were not the result of bad faith or a lack of reasonable care on 
the part of the accountable officer, the issue is whether the agency 
undertook diligent collection agency. B-270715, July 23, 1996. A single 

Page 9-138 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

demand letter is generally not enough, and an agency should pursue 
additional means of collection if there is no response to the letter. 
62 Comp. Gen. 91, 98 (1982). See also 31 C.F.R. § 901.2. Resort to the 
Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards includes those collection 
measures, as and to the extent authorized, which result in collection of less 
than the full amount, for example, compromise. A compromise, including 
one by the Justice Department, not only resolves the claim against the 
recipient but operates as well to relieve the accountable officer for any 
amounts unrecovered because of the compromise. 31 U.S.C. § 3711(d); 
65 Comp. Gen. 371 (1986). Whether or not the accountable officer is 
entitled to relief does not affect the compromise authority. B-154400-O.M., 
Jan. 29, 1968. However, 31 U.S.C. § 3711(c) does not apply to any liability 
which may fall upon one who is not an accountable officer. B-235048, 
Apr. 4, 1991. The authority to suspend or terminate collection action is also 
available, but only in accordance with the claims collection act and 
regulations. 67 Comp. Gen. 457, 464 (1988); B-253582, Dec. 13, 1993; 
B-212337, Feb. 17, 1984; B-211660, Dec. 15, 1983. Unlike a compromise, the 
termination of collection action against the recipient does not eliminate the 
accountable officer’s liability for any unrecovered balance. 67 Comp. Gen. 
at 464. 

Adequate collection action also requires referral of the claim to the 
appropriate collection office within the agency without undue delay. GAO 
has advised the Army, for example, that a delay of more than 3 months will 
generally not be regarded as diligent. 65 Comp. Gen. 811 (1986); B-227187, 
June 16, 1987; B-227218, June 5, 1987. 

While diligent collection action is a necessary element of the relief 
equation, the fact that collection efforts have been unsuccessful, however 
diligent, does not by itself provide the basis for relieving the accountable 
officer. B-141838, Feb. 8, 1960; B-114042, Oct. 31, 1956. 

2. Against Accountable 
Officer 
If a loss cannot be recovered from the thief or other improper payee or 
recipient, and relief cannot be granted to the accountable officer, the 
accountable officer becomes indebted to the government for the amount 
involved. At that point, it is the agency’s responsibility to initiate collection 
action against the accountable officer in accordance with the Federal 
Claims Collection Act and Standards. E.g., B-223726, June 26, 1987; 
B-177430, Oct. 30, 1973. 

Page 9-139 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

If the accountable officer is still employed by the government, additional 
statutes come into play. Offset against salary is prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5512(a): 

“The pay of an individual in arrears to the United States 
shall be withheld until he has accounted for and paid into 
the Treasury of the United States all sums for which he is 
liable.” 

This statute does not apply to ordinary debtors but only to accountable 
officers. 37 Comp. Gen. 344 (1957); 23 Comp. Gen. 555 (1944); B-248376, 
Jan. 11, 1993. It has also been held that the provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 5512(a) 
are mandatory and cannot be waived. 64 Comp. Gen. 606 (1985); 39 Comp. 
Gen. 203 (1959); 19 Comp. Gen. 312 (1939). 

The application of 5 U.S.C. § 5512(a) to certain military accountable 
officers is limited by 37 U.S.C. § 1007(a), which prohibits withholding the 
pay “of an officer” under section 5512 unless the indebtedness is “admitted 
by the officer or shown by the judgment of a court, upon a special order 
issued in the discretion of the Secretary of Defense,75 or upon denial of 
relief of an officer under 31 U.S.C. § 3527.” Subsection 1007(a) applies to 
“officers,” meaning commissioned or warrant officers, and not to enlisted 
personnel or civilian accountable officers. 37 Comp. Gen. 344, 348 (1957). 
The admission may be oral or written but, if oral, a certificate of a 
commissioned officer that the accountable officer clearly and 
unequivocally admitted the shortage would be sufficient evidence. 
42 Comp. Gen. 83 (1962). The discretion to apply 5 U.S.C. § 5512(a) exists 
only in the absence of an admission or court judgment. Id. 

The original version of 5 U.S.C. § 5512(a), enacted in 1828,76 provided that 
“no money shall be paid” to the person in arrears until the debt is repaid. 
Thus, several early decisions exist for the somewhat barbaric proposition 
that the statute requires complete stoppage of pay. E.g., 9 Comp. Gen. 272 
(1930); 7 Comp. Gen. 4 (1927). While these and similar early decisions have

satisfied by withholding in reasonable installments. 64 Comp. Gen. 606 
(1985); B-180957-O.M., Sept. 25, 1979. The amount of the installment 
payments will be determined by the agency. B-241478, Apr. 5, 1991. 
Collection in installments is also authorized when operating under 
37 U.S.C. § 1007(c) for members of the uniformed services. For employees 
no longer on the payroll, offset under 5 U.S.C. § 5512(a) has been held to 
embrace collection from retirement funds to the extent authorized. 
Parker v. United States, 187 Ct. Cl. 553, 559 (1969); 39 Comp. Gen. 203, 206 
(1959). GAO has also approved “flagging” the retirement account of an 
accountable officer still on the payroll. B-217114, Feb. 29, 1988. 

When applying 5 U.S.C. § 5512(a) or 37 U.S.C. § 1007(a), the procedures to 
be followed are those prescribed by 31 C.F.R. § 901.3 for administrative 
offsets under 31 U.S.C. § 3716. 64 Comp. Gen. 142 (1984). 

If pay is withheld under 5 U.S.C. § 5512(a), the statute provides a means to 
obtain judicial review of the indebtedness. Under 5 U.S.C. § 5512(b), GAO 
is required, upon the request of the individual or his or her agent or 
attorney to immediately report the balance due to the Attorney General, 
and the Attorney General is required within 60 days to order suit to be 
commenced against the individual. This provision was part of the original 
1828 legislation, several decades prior to either the Tucker Act or the 
establishment of the Court of Claims, at a time when there was no other 
means available for the accountable officer to initiate judicial proceedings. 
It now exists as one way among several. Installment deductions are not 
required to stop during the litigation; if the accountable officer prevails, 
amounts collected are refunded. 64 Comp. Gen. 606, 608 (1985). 
Examples of referrals under 5 U.S.C. § 5512(b) are included at 64 Comp. 
Gen. 605 (1985); B-217114.7, May 6, 1991; and B-220492, Dec. 10, 1985. 

H. Restitution, 
Reimbursement, 
and Restoration 
1. Restitution and 
Reimbursement 
In the present context, restitution means the repayment of a loss by an 
accountable officer from personal funds; reimbursement means the 
refunding to an accountable officer of amounts previously paid in 
restitution. Prior to 1955, there was no statutory authority to permit the 
Page 9-141 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

reimbursement of an accountable officer who had made restitution to the 
government for a physical loss. Once an accountable officer made 
restitution (if, for example, the agency required it), the decisions held that 
there was no longer a deficiency in the account for which relief could be 
considered. 27 Comp. Gen. 404 (1948); B-101301, July 19, 1951. 

Legislation in 1955 amended what is now 31 U.S.C. § 3527(a) and 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3527(b) to expressly authorize reimbursement of the accountable officer 
for any amounts paid in restitution, if relief is granted.77 Accordingly, 
restitution by the accountable officer in physical loss cases is no longer an 
impediment to the granting of relief. E.g., B-155149, Oct. 21, 1964; 
B-126362, Feb. 21, 1956. The 1955 legislation amended only the physical 
loss relief statutes. There is no comparable reimbursement authority in the 
improper payment relief statutes, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527(c) and 3528. B-226393, 
Apr. 29, 1988; B-223840, Nov. 5, 1986; B-128557, Sept. 21, 1956. 

An obvious limitation on the reimbursement authority was illustrated in 
B-187021, Jan. 19, 1978. An imprest fund cashier sought reimbursement, 
claiming that she had discovered money missing from her cash box and 
replaced it from personal funds. However, by virtue of her actions in 
initially concealing the loss, she was unable to show that the loss had in 
fact ever occurred. Since the loss could not be established, reimbursement 
was denied. Thus, an accountable officer should always report a loss 
before making restitution. 

2. Restoration Restoration of an account suffering a loss or deficiency—an accounting 
adjustment to restore the shortage with funds from some other source—is 
authorized under two provisions of law, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527(d) and 3530. The 
Comptroller General is required by 31 U.S.C. § 3530(c) to prescribe 
implementing regulations. These are found in title 7 of GAO’s Policy and 
Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, § 8.14 (Washington, 
D.C.: May 18, 1993). 
a. Adjustment Incident to If relief is granted under either 31 U.S.C. § 3527(a) or 31 U.S.C. § 3527(c), 
Granting of Relief GAO may authorize restoration of the account. Under subsection (d), 
restoration is accomplished by charging either an appropriation 
specifically available for that purpose or, if there is no such appropriation, 

77 Pub. L. No. 334, ch. 694, 69 Stat. 626 (Aug. 9, 1955). 

Page 9-142 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

the appropriation or fund available for the accountable function. See 
B-288163, June 4, 2002. The charge is made to the fiscal year in which the 
adjustment is made, and not the fiscal year in which the loss occurred. 
Subsection (d) applies only to subsections (a) and (c), and not to 
subsection (b) (military disbursing officers). However, the military 
departments have separate authority in 10 U.S.C. §§ 2777(b) and 2781. 
There is no restoration provision in 31 U.S.C. § 3528, which sets out the 
responsibilities and relief from liability for certifying officials. 

Whenever account adjustment is deemed necessary, the agency should 
include in its relief request a citation (account symbol) to the appropriation 
it proposes to charge. GAO, Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance 
of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 8.14.A (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 1993) 
(hereafter GAO-PPM). In cases where agencies are authorized to grant 
relief without GAO involvement, they may also exercise the restoration 
authority of 31 U.S.C. § 3527(d) without GAO involvement. 7 GAO-PPM 
§8.14.C. 

A 1957 decision, 37 Comp. Gen. 224, considered the application of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3527(d) where one agency is disbursing funds on behalf of other agencies. 
State Department disbursing officers overseas, acting under delegations 
from the Treasury Department, were authorized to receive and disburse 
funds on behalf of other government agencies as well as the State 
Department. If the services were sufficiently extensive to warrant 
reimbursement, State charged the “user” agencies. Construing 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3527(d), the Comptroller General held that losses in such a situation for 
which relief was granted but which could not be related to the functions of 
any particular agency or agencies should be charged to State Department 
appropriations because they were the appropriations available for the 
accountable function. “This phraseology clearly is intended to mean the 
appropriation of the department or agency to which the expenses of 
carrying on the particular disbursing function are chargeable.” 37 Comp. 
Gen. at 226. Such adjustments could then be considered as part of the 
costs of the disbursing function for purposes of determining charges 
assessed against the user agencies and thus distributed to all user agencies 
in the same manner as other costs. Id. Twenty years later, GAO reached 
the same result with respect to losses of United States currency incident to 
the 1975 evacuation from Vietnam. 56 Comp. Gen. 791, 796–97 (1977). 

b. Other Situations If a loss is due to fault or negligence by an accountable officer, and the 
agency head determines that the loss is uncollectible, the amount of the 
loss may be restored by a charge to the appropriation or fund available for 
Page 9-143 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

the expenses of the accountable function. 31 U.S.C. § 3530(a). 
Uncollectible includes uncollectible from the accountable officer. E.g., 
B-177910, Feb. 20, 1973. As with adjustments under 31 U.S.C. § 3527(d), 
section 3530(a) requires the loss to be charged to the appropriation 
available for the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made (appropriation 
“currently available”). This authority applies (1) where relief is denied, or 

(2)where the agency does not seek relief, the uncollectibility 
determination being required in either event. Representative cases are 
B-271608, June 21, 1996; B-235405, Mar. 19, 1990; B-219246, Sept. 9, 1985; 
B-188715, Jan. 31, 1978; and B-167827, Feb. 4, 1975. 

Assuming the statutory conditions are met, adjustments under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3530 are made directly by the agency with no need for specific 
authorization or concurrence from GAO. GAO, Policy and Procedures 
Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, § 8.14.D (Washington, 
D.C.: May 18, 1993). Restoration under section 3530 is merely an 
accounting adjustment and does not affect the accountable officer’s 
personal liability. 31 U.S.C. § 3530(b). Thus, although the adjustment is 
premised on a determination of uncollectibility, collection efforts should 
resume if warranted by future developments. B-241725, Feb. 19, 1991. 

The statutes described above, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527(d) and 3530, will cover 
most situations in which restoration is needed in that relief is mostly either 
granted or denied or not sought. There are, however, situations in which 
neither statute applies. For example, a thief fraudulently obtained over 
$10,000 from the patients trust account at a Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) hospital. He was convicted and ordered to make restitution. The 
restitution order was lifted 3 years later, but the VA had by then recovered 
only a small portion of the loss. The VA decided that pursuing the thief any 
further would be fruitless, and it had previously determined that there had 
been no fault or negligence by the accountable officer. 

The VA was faced with a dilemma. Clearly the loss had to be restored since 
the trust account consisted of money belonging to patients, and just as 
clearly VA’s operating appropriations were the only available source. The 
problem was how to get there. Since the 3-year statute of limitations on 
account settlement (31 U.S.C. § 3526(c)) had expired, relief could no longer 
be considered, so 31 U.S.C. § 3527(d) could not be used. Equally unavailing 
was 31 U.S.C. § 3530 since the loss did not result from the accountable 
officer’s fault or negligence. However, since the VA had an undisputed 
obligation as trustee to return the trust funds to their rightful owners upon 
demand, the loss could be viewed as an expense of managing the trust 

Page 9-144 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 9 
Liability and Relief of Accountable Officers 

fund. The solution therefore was to restore funds from the unobligated 
balance of VA’s operating appropriation for the fiscal year in which the loss 
occurred. 68 Comp. Gen. 600 (1989). See also B-239955, June 18, 1991. The 
authority to make adjustments from the unexpended balances of prior 
years’ appropriations is now found in 31 U.S.C. § 1553(a). Once an account 
has been closed, generally five fiscal years after expiration,78 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1553(b) requires that the adjustment be charged, within certain limits, to 
current appropriations. Thus, the authority now found in 31 U.S.C. § 1553 
may provide an alternative if neither 31 U.S.C. § 3527(d) nor 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3530 is available. Of course, if the account to be restored has itself been 
closed pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §§ 1552(a) or 1555, restoration is no longer 
possible.

Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

The federal government provides assistance in many forms, financial and 

A. Introduction 
otherwise. Assistance programs are designed to serve a variety of 
purposes. Objectives may include fostering some element of national 
policy, stimulating private sector involvement, or furnishing aid of a type or 
to a class of beneficiaries the private market cannot or is unwilling to 
otherwise accommodate. The term “assistance” is statutorily defined in 
many federal laws. For example, the Federal Program Information Act 
broadly defines “assistance” as “the transfer of anything of value for a 
public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by [law].” 31U.S.C. 
§ 6101(3). A similar definition of “assistance” is found in the 
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, which adds the qualification, for 
purposes of that act, that the federal government provide such a transfer 
through grant or contractual arrangements. 31 U.S.C. § 6501(1). Another 
definition is provided in the Single Audit Act, which defines “Federal 
financial assistance” as “assistance that nonfederal entities receive or 
administer in the form of grants, loans, loan guarantees, property, 
cooperative agreements, interest subsidies, insurance, food commodities, 
direct appropriations, or other assistance.” 31 U.S.C. § 7501(a)(5).1 

Grants constitute one form of federal assistance. The Intergovernmental 
Cooperation Act defines a grant as “money, or property provided instead of 
money, that is paid or provided by the United States Government under a 
fixed annual or total authorization, to” an eligible beneficiary. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 6501(4)(A) and (B). The act defines eligible beneficiaries as including 
state and local governments as well as certain private nonprofit 
organizations. Id. The act specifically excludes from this definition such 
things as a loan, shared revenue, and payments under a research and 
development procurement contract. Id. § 6501(4)(C). Similarly, GAO’s 
budget glossary defines a grant as a “federal financial assistance award 
making payment in cash or in kind for a specified purpose,” adding: “The 
term ‘grant’ is used broadly and may include a grant to nongovernmental 
recipients as well as one to a state or local government, while the term

chapter.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

‘grant-in-aid’ is commonly used to refer only to a grant to a state or local 
government.”2 

Thus, a federal grant is a form of assistance authorized by statute in which 
a federal agency (the grantor) transfers something of value to a party (the 
grantee) for a purpose, undertaking, or activity of the grantee that the 
government has chosen to assist. The “thing of value” is usually money, but 
may, depending on the program legislation, also include property or 
services.3 The grantee, again depending on the program legislation, may be 
a state or local government, a nonprofit organization, or a private individual 
or business entity. Federal grants to state and local governments comprise 
the largest category, involving federal outlays of more than $406 billion in 
fiscal year 2004, which constituted 17.7 percent of total federal outlays and 

3.5percent of Gross Domestic Product.4 
The past four decades have witnessed a dramatic growth in federal grants, 
both in absolute dollar terms and as a proportion of total federal spending. 
The domestic Working Group’s recent publication, Guide to Opportunities 
for Improving grant Accountability (Washington, D.C.: October 2005), 
at 1–2, illustrates this growth.5 The Guide focuses on grants to state and 

2 GAO, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, GAO-05-734SP 
(Washington, D.C.: September 2005), at 60. The drafters of the Federal Grant and 
Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, 31 U.S.C. §§ 6301–6308, discussed in section B.2 of this 
chapter, opted against including a separate statutory definition for the term “grant-in-aid” in 
favor of using the simpler term “grant” to encompass all such transactions regardless of the 
identity of the recipient. S. Rep. No. 95-449, at 9 (1977). 

3 The earliest grant programs were land grants. Monetary grants appear to have entered the 
stage in 1879, but they are largely a 20th century development. Madden, The Constitutional 
and Legal Foundations of Federal Grants, in Federal Grant Law 9 (M. Mason ed. 1982). 
One example of land grants is the Morrill Act of 1862, Pub. L. No. 37-108, 12 Stat. 503 (July 2, 
1862), through which Congress assisted states with higher education by providing land 
grants to establish universities focused on agriculture, mechanics, and military science.

local governments, which make up about 80 percent of all federal grants. 
In 1960, such grants amounted to approximately $7 billion, representing 
about 7 percent of the total federal outlays. In the President’s budget 
request for fiscal year 2006, about $450 billion was included to fund over 
700 grant programs. As noted above, this represents over 17 percent of 
total federal outlays. 

“Cooperative agreements” constitute another form of federal assistance 
relationship. As we will discuss in section B of this chapter, cooperative 
agreements are very much like grants in that they are used to transfer 
something of value to the recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose 
as authorized by law. The key difference is that the federal agency 
providing the assistance has more involvement with the recipient in 
carrying out the activity being funded under a cooperative agreement than 
it does in the case of a grant. Given the similarity between these two forms 
of assistance, our discussion of grants in the remainder of this chapter 
applies as well to cooperative agreements except as otherwise noted. 
Indeed, the distinction between grants and cooperative agreements is 
rarely, if ever, the focus of GAO and judicial decisions. Rather, as discussed 
hereafter, the decisions typically involve issues concerning the use of 
procurement contracts versus assistance relationships. 

In July 2005, according to the most recent information available from the 
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance,6 58 federal agencies administered 
1,621 assistance programs. To be sure, a large number of these are not 
grant programs since the Catalog includes loan and loan guarantee 
programs plus certain types of nonfinancial assistance. Nevertheless, it is a 
safe statement that there are hundreds of federal grant programs 
administered by dozens of agencies. 

Grant programs typically are governed by detailed legislation and even 
more detailed regulations. As a result, many judicial and administrative 
grant cases are not amenable to broad treatment in this chapter since they

Administration and the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 6104 and

1984). The Catalog is a governmentwide list of financial and nonfinancial federal assistance 
programs, projects, services, and activities administered by federal agencies that provide 
assistance or benefits to the American public. 31 C.F.R. § 205.2 (2005). The most recently

hinge on specific statutory or regulatory provisions having limited general 
applicability. Nevertheless, it is still possible to extract a number of 
principles of “grant law” from the perspective of the availability and use of 
appropriated funds. Before we do so, it is necessary to discuss the 
differences and similarities of grants, cooperative agreements, and 
procurement contracts. 

B. Grants versus 
Procurement 
Contracts 
From the perspective of legal analysis, what precisely is a grant and when 
is it the appropriate funding vehicle for a federal agency to use? How do 
grants differ from contracts and what do they have in common? This 
section will explore these and related questions. We will first discuss 
judicial and GAO case law that often applies some basic contract law 
principles to grants but also recognizes significant differences between 
grants and contracts, particularly federal procurements. (As noted 
previously, grants are essentially the same as cooperative agreements for 
purposes of these cases.) We will then discuss statutory and administrative 
principles that have been developed to clarify the distinctions among 
grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements and when each should be 
used by a federal agency. 

1. Judicial and GAO 
Decisions on the Nature 
of Grants 
a. Contractual Aspects of 
Grants 
Courts frequently look to contract law principles to define the rights and 
obligations of the parties to a federal grant. In particular, the courts view 
the acceptance of a grant of federal funds subject to conditions that must 
be met by the grantee as creating a “contract” between the United States 
and the grantee. The “grant as a type of contract” approach evolved from 
early Supreme Court decisions. In what may be the earliest case on the 
subject, the government had made a grant of land to a state on the 
condition that the state would use the land, or the proceeds from its sale, 
for certain reclamation purposes. The Court stated: 

“It is not doubted that the grant by the United States to the 
State upon conditions, and the acceptance of the grant by 
the State, constituted a contract. All the elements of a 
contract met in the transaction—competent parties, proper

Agreements 

subject-matter, sufficient consideration, and consent of 
minds.” 

McGee v. Mathis, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 143, 155 (1866). See also United States v. 
Northern Pacific Railway Co., 256 U.S. 51, 63–64 (1921). 

The Supreme Court has consistently followed this approach in upholding 
conditions that Congress imposes upon recipients of federal grants. See, 
e.g., Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education, 544 U.S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 
1497 (2005); Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 
(1999); Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1 
(1981). Consistent with the analogy to contract principles, the key 
consideration in many of these cases is whether the grantee was 
sufficiently aware of the condition to constitute acceptance of it. As the 
Court observed in Jackson, 125 S. Ct. at 1509: 

“When Congress enacts legislation under its spending 
power, that legislation is ‘in the nature of a contract: in 
return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with 
federally imposed conditions.’ Pennhurst State School and 
Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S. Ct. 1531, 67 
L.Ed.2d 694 (1981). As we have recognized, ‘[t]here can . . . 
be no knowing acceptance [of the terms of the contract] if a 
State is unaware of the conditions [imposed by the 
legislation on its receipt of funds].’ Ibid.”7 

Lower courts also have applied contract principles to grants in various 
contexts: to enforce grantee compliance with grant conditions;8 to 
determine jurisdiction under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. § 1491) for claims 

7 See section C.1.b of this chapter for further discussion of congressional use of grants in the 
exercise of its constitutional spending power. Congress’s spending power is also discussed 
in Chapter 1, section B. 

8 E.g., United States v. Miami University, 91 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1142–44 (S.D. Ohio 2000), 
aff’d, 294 F.3d 797 (6th Cir. 2002); United States v. Frazer, 297 F. Supp. 319, 322–23 (M.D. Ala. 
1968); United States v. Sumter County School District No. 2, 232 F. Supp. 945, 950 (E.D.S.C. 
1964); United States v. County School Board, 221 F. Supp. 93, 99–100 (E.D. Va. 1963).

against the United States;9 and to analyze the nature of the government’s 
obligations under a particular grant statute or agreement.10 

GAO decisions likewise analogize grants to contracts for certain purposes. 
E.g., B-303927, June 7, 2005; 68 Comp. Gen. 609 (1989); 50 Comp. Gen. 470 
(1970); 42 Comp. Gen. 289, 294 (1962); 41 Comp. Gen. 134, 137 (1961); 
B-232010, Mar. 23, 1989; B-167790, Jan. 15, 1973. In 50 Comp. Gen. 470, for 
example, a medical teaching facility, recipient of a reimbursement-type 
construction grant under a federal statute, was caught in a cash flow crisis 
because disbursement of grant funds was much less frequent than its 
contractor’s need for progress payments. The question was whether the 
grant could be regarded as a “contract or claim” so the recipient could 
assign future grant proceeds to a bank in return for an interim loan, 
pursuant to the Assignment of Claims Act, 41 U.S.C. § 15. Under the 
Assignment of Claims Act, any party that has or will have a right to 
payment of $1,000 or more under a contract with the U.S. government may 
assign this right to a bank, trust company, or other financing company, 
assuming the party meets all the requirements of the Act. Id. § 15(b). 
Noting that the accepted grant constituted a “valid contract” and that 
assignment was not prohibited by the program legislation, regulations of 
the grantor agency, or the terms of the grant agreement, GAO concluded 
that assignment under the Assignment of Claims Act was permissible. 

9 E.g., Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare v. United States, 48 Fed. Cl. 785 (2001); 
Moore v. United States, 48 Fed. Cl. 394 (2000); Thermalon Industries, Ltd. v. United States, 
34 Fed. Cl. 411 (1995); Cole County Regional Sewer District v. United States, 22 Cl. Ct. 551 
(1991); County of Suffolk v. United States, 19 Cl. Ct. 295 (1990); Kentucky ex rel. Cabinet 
for Human Resources v. United States, 16 Cl. Ct. 755, 762 (1989); Rogers v. United States, 
14 Cl. Ct. 39, 44 (1987); Idaho Migrant Council, Inc. v. United States, 9 Cl. Ct. 85, 88–89 
(1985); Missouri Health & Medical Organization, Inc. v. United States, 641 F.2d 870 
(Ct. Cl. 1981); Texas v. United States, 537 F.2d 466 (Ct. Cl. 1976). While most of these cases 
use language carefully crafted to avoid confusion between a grant agreement and a 
“traditional,” that is, procurement, contract, the essence of the jurisdictional finding is that 
the grant claim is based on some form of “contract.” The Tucker Act cases are discussed in 
more detail later in section B.2.c of this chapter in relation to the Federal Grant and 
Cooperative Agreement Act. 

10 E.g., Knight v. United States, 52 Fed. Cl. 243 (2002), rev’d on other grounds, 65 Fed. 
Appx. 286 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare v. United States; 
Henke v. Department of Commerce, 83 F.3d 1445 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Arizona v. United States, 
494 F.2d 1285 (Ct. Cl. 1974). See also City of Manassas Park v. United States, 633 F.2d 181 
(Ct. Cl.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1035 (1980) (claim found to be noncontractual, but 
agreement referred to as “grant contract” and grantor-grantee relationship as “privity of 
contract”).

Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

b. Differences between Grants 
and Contracts 
As indicated above, the researcher will find a body of judicial and GAO 
case law standing for the proposition that there are certain contractual 
aspects to a grant relationship. It does not follow, however, nor has GAO or 
(to our knowledge) any court suggested, that all of the trappings of a 
procurement contract somehow attach to a grant. While grant 
relationships have certain “contractual” relationships, the contract analogy 
has its limits. 

Take, for example, the issue of consideration. While the typical grant 
agreement may well include sufficient legal consideration from the 
standpoint of supporting a legal obligation, it may be quite different from 
the consideration found in procurement contracts. As noted earlier in this 
chapter, a grant is a form of assistance to a designated class of recipients 
authorized by statute to meet recognized needs. Grant needs, by definition, 
are not needs for goods or services required by the federal government 
itself. The needs are those of a nonfederal entity, whether public or private, 
which the Congress has decided to assist as being in the public interest. 

An illustration of where this distinction on the issue of consideration can 
lead is 41 Comp. Gen. 134 (1961). That decision involved a statutory 
provision authorizing grants to states for the construction of sewage 
treatment works, up to a stated percentage of estimated costs, with the 
grantee to pay all remaining costs. Strong demand for limited funds meant 
that grants were frequently awarded for amounts less than the permissible 
ceiling. The question was whether these grants could be amended in a 
subsequent fiscal year to increase the amount to, or at least closer to, the 
statutory ceiling. If a straight “grant equals contract” approach had been 
applied, the answer would have been no, unless the government received 
additional consideration. However, GAO concluded that the amendments 
were authorized, noting that the “consideration” flowing to the government 
under these grants (in sharp contrast with procurement contracts) 
consisted only of “the benefits to accrue to the public and the United 
States” through use of the funds to construct the desired facilities. Id. 
at 137. 

In recognition of the essential distinctions between a grant agreement and 
a procurement contract, the Supreme Court has stated: 

“Although we agree . . . that . . . [the] grant agreements [at 
issue] had a contractual aspect, . . . the program cannot be 
viewed in the same manner as a bilateral contract governing 
a discrete transaction. . . . Unlike normal contractual 

Page 10-9 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

undertakings, federal grant programs originate in and 
remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the 
judgment of Congress concerning desirable public policy.” 

Bennett v. Kentucky Department of Education, 470 U.S. 656, 669 (1985). 
The state in that case had argued that, since the grant was “in the nature of 
a contract,” the Court should apply the principle, drawn from contract law, 
that ambiguities in the grant agreement should be resolved against the 
government as the drafting party. Id. at 666. Based on the analysis 
summarized in the quoted passage, the Supreme Court declined to do so. 

Similarly, the contract law doctrine of “impossibility of performance” has 
been held inapplicable to a grant. Maryland Department of Human 
Resources v. United States Department of Health & Human Services, 
762 F.2d 406 (4th Cir. 1985). In that case, the government had imposed a 
zero error standard on states under a grant program. The state argued that 
error-free administration was impossible. While agreeing with that factual 
proposition, the court nevertheless held that the zero tolerance level was 
permissible under the governing statute and regulations. The impossibility 
of performance doctrine, said the court, “relates to commercial contracts 
and not to grant in aid programs.” Id. at 409. 

A 1971 decision, 51 Comp. Gen. 162, illustrates another distinction. In that 
case, the Comptroller General concluded that an ineligible grantee could 
not be reimbursed for expenditures under quantum meruit principles. 
Quantum meruit is a “contract-implied-in law” theory founded on the 
principle that a party who receives a tangible benefit from another is 
entitled to compensation. In the typical grant situation, the grantee’s 
activities are not performed solely for the direct benefit of the government 
and the government does not receive any measurable, tangible benefit in 
the traditional contract sense. 

Similarly, the courts are reluctant to apply the “contract implied in fact” 
concept in the grant context. E.g., Capitol Boulevard Partners v. United 
States, 31 Fed. Cl. 758 (1994); Blaze Construction, Inc. v. United States, 
27 Fed. Cl. 646 (1993); Eubanks v. United States, 25 Cl. Ct. 131 (1992); 
Somerville Technical Services v. United States, 640 F.2d 1276 (Ct. Cl. 
1981). The reasoning, in part, is that a grant is a sovereign act binding the 
government only to the extent of its express undertakings. 

In American Hospital Association v. Schweiker, 721 F.2d 170 (7th Cir. 
1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 958 (1984), the court rejected the contention 

Page 10-10 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


c. Grants as “Hybrids” 
Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

that otherwise valid regulations of the Department of Health and Human 
Services impaired contractual rights of grantees under the Hill-Burton 
hospital assistance program: 

“[T]he relationship between the government and the 
hospitals here cannot be wholly captured by the term 
‘contract’ and the analysis traditionally associated with that 
term. . . . The contract analogy thus has only limited 
application.” 

721 F.2d at 182–83. Additionally, the court in United States v. Kensington 
Hospital, 760 F. Supp. 1120 (E.D. Pa. 1991), refused to apply the Anti-
Kickback Act of 198611 to government claims for fraud under the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs, finding that the government’s relationship with its 
grantees under these programs could not be characterized as “prime 
contracts” for purposes of the Act. 

Finally, appropriations law restrictions may not apply to grants in the same 
manner as they apply to contracts. Thus, GAO has held that the principle of 
“severability,” as embodied in the bona fide needs rule for purposes of 
contracts, is irrelevant to assistance agreements. See B-289801, Dec. 30, 
2002 (dealing with multiple year Education Department grants); B-229873, 
Nov. 29, 1988 (dealing with Small Business Administration cooperative 
agreements). These cases are discussed in section C.1 of this chapter. 

Perhaps most aptly, some courts have described grants as “hybrid” 
instruments in view of both their similarities to and differences from 
contracts. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Browner, 866 F. Supp. 
249, 252 (D. Md. 1994); Town of Fallsburg v. United States, 22 Cl. Ct. 633, 
642 (1991). In this regard, the court in Browner stated: “Essentially, grants 
are contracts with statutory and regulatory terms superimposed upon 
them.” 866 F. Supp. at 252. The court held that the appropriate standard of 
judicial review depended on the nature of the dispute before it. If the 
issues arose under the grant statute or regulations (as they did in this case), 
the court would review the agency’s actions under an abuse of discretion 
standard; other issues would be considered contractual and subject to de 

11 The Anti-Kickback Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-634, § 2 (a), 100 Stat. 3523 (Nov. 7, 1986), 
codified at 41 U.S.C. §§ 51–58, imposes criminal and civil sanctions against subcontractors 
who provide money, gifts, or other “kickbacks” to prime contractors in order to secure their 
subcontracts as part of a larger government contract. 

Page 10-11 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

novo review applying contract law principles. Fallsburg, which the 
Browner court followed, took the same approach in determining the 
appropriate standard for judicial review. See also, to the same effect, 
United States v. Hatcher, 922 F.2d 1402, 1406–07 (9th Cir. 1991), in which 
the court reviewed the federal funding agency’s actions under the 
Administrative Procedure Act rather than contract law principles since the 
issues arose under the program statute (in this case a program of individual 
scholarships). 

Other cases have followed the same approach without specifically referring 
to grants as hybrids. These cases emphasize that the rights and obligations 
of the parties, while contractual in nature, cannot be determined solely by 
reference to the terms of the grant agreement itself. Rather, the court must 
also look to such sources as the applicable grant statute, its legislative 
history, the grantor agency’s regulations, and applicable Office of 
Management and Budget guidance. See, e.g., Westside Mothers v. 
Haveman, 289 F.3d 852, 858 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1045 (2002); 
Institute for Technology Development v. Brown, 63 F.3d 445, 449 (5th Cir. 
1995). 

In sum, it is clear that the many varied rules and principles of contract law 
will not be automatically applied to grants. Nevertheless, it is equally clear 
that the creation of a grant relationship results in certain legal obligations 
flowing in both directions (grantor and grantee) that will be enforceable by 
the application of some basic contract rules. As the then Claims Court 
(now Court of Federal Claims) stated: 

“[A] notice of a federal grant award in return for the 
grantee’s performance of services can create cognizable 
obligations to the extent of the government’s undertakings 
therein.” 

Community Relations-Social Development Commission v. United States, 
8 Cl. Ct. 723, 725 (1985). Thus, if a grantee does what it has committed 
itself to do and incurs allowable costs, the government is obligated to pay. 
E.g., B-181332, Dec. 28, 1976. Conversely, the government has a right to 
expect that the grantee will use the grant funds only for authorized grant 
purposes and only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
grant. The right of a grantor agency to oversee the expenditure of funds by 
the grantee to ensure that the money is used only for authorized purposes, 
and the grantee’s corresponding duty to account to the grantor for its use of 
the funds, are implicit in the grant relationship and are not dependent upon

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

specific language in the authorizing legislation. See, e.g., B-303927, June 7, 
2005; 64 Comp. Gen. 582 (1985). 

2. The Federal Grant and 
Cooperative Agreement 
Act 
a. Purposes and Provisions of 
the Act 
Long-standing confusion and concern over federal agency use of grant 
relationships versus procurement relationships led the Commission on 
Government Procurement, in its 1972 report, to recommend the enactment 
of legislation to distinguish assistance from procurement and to further 
refine the concept of assistance by clearly distinguishing grants from 
cooperative agreements.12 While Congress did not enact all of the 
Commission’s recommendations, it did enact these two in the form of the 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-224, 
92 Stat. 3 (Feb. 3, 1978), codified at 31 U.S.C. §§ 6301–6308. Referring to the 
Commission’s findings, the report on this legislation by the then Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs (now the Senate Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs) observed: 

“No uniform statutory guideline exists to express the sense 
of Congress on when executive agencies should use either 
grants, cooperative agreements or procurement contracts. 
Failure to distinguish between procurement and assistance 
relationships has led to both the inappropriate use of grants 
to avoid the requirements of the procurement system, and 
to unnecessary red tape and administrative requirements in 
grants.” 

S. Rep. No. 95-449, at 6 (1977). 

The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act was enacted to— 

“prescribe criteria for executive agencies in selecting 
appropriate legal instruments to achieve— 

12 See generally 3 Report of the Commission on Government Procurement, chs. 1–3 
(Dec. 31, 1972).

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

(A) uniformity in their use by executive agencies; 
(B)a clear definition of the relationships they reflect; and 
(C) a better understanding of the responsibilities of the 
parties to them.” 
31 U.S.C. § 6301(2). To achieve these purposes, the act established 
standards that agencies are to use in selecting the most appropriate funding 
vehicle: a procurement contract, a grant, or a cooperative agreement. The 
standards are contained in sections 4, 5, and 6 of the act, codified at 
31 U.S.C. §§ 6303–6305, which are summarized below: 

• Procurement contracts. An agency is to use a procurement contract 
when “the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire (by 
purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or 
use of the United States Government.” 31 U.S.C. § 6303 (emphasis 
added). 
• Grant agreements. An agency is to use a grant agreement when the 
principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of value 
[money, property, services, etc.] to the recipient “to carry out a public 
purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United 
States instead of acquiring (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or 
services for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government,” 
and “substantial involvement is not expected” between the agency and 
the recipient when carrying out the contemplated activity. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 6304 (emphasis added). 
• Cooperative agreements. An agency is to use a cooperative agreement 
when the principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of 
value to the recipient “to carry out a public purpose of support or 
stimulation authorized by a law of the United States instead of 
acquiring (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the 
direct benefit or use of the United States Government,” and “substantial 
involvement is expected” between the agency and the recipient when 
carrying out the contemplated activity. 31 U.S.C. § 6305 (emphasis 
added). 
The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act authorizes the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide additional 
guidance in interpreting the act to “promote consistent and efficient use of 

Page 10-14 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

procurement contracts, grant agreements, and cooperative agreements.” 
31 U.S.C. § 6307(1). OMB published such guidance on August 18, 1978 
(43 Fed. Reg. 36860), which is still in effect.13 

The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act’s basic criterion on 
when to use a procurement contract rather than one of the two assistance 
arrangements (a grant or cooperative agreement) is clear and turns on the 
underlying purpose of the arrangement: If the federal agency’s primary 
purpose is to acquire goods or services for the direct benefit or use of the 
government, then a procurement contract must be used. On the other 
hand, the act calls for use of a grant or a cooperative agreement when the 
agency’s primary purpose is to provide assistance for the recipient to use in 
order to accomplish a public objective authorized by law. Thus, 
procurement contracts differ from either grants or cooperative agreements 
in terms of their basic purpose. 

Under the act, a grant and a cooperative agreement are closely related 
assistance arrangements with essentially the same basic purpose: to 
encourage the recipient of funding to carry out activities in furtherance of a 
public goal. The difference is the degree of involvement between the 
federal agency and the recipient in the performance of the activity being 
funded. When the involvement is expected to be “substantial,” the act 
requires use of a cooperative agreement rather than a grant. The act does 
not define “substantial” in this context. However, the Senate report on the 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act provided the following 
examples of situations that might require substantial federal involvement: 

• federal project management or federal program or administrative 
assistance would be helpful due to the novelty or complexity involved 
(for example, in some construction, information systems development, 
and demonstration projects); 
• federal/recipient collaboration in performing the work is desirable (for 
example, in collaborative research, planning or problem solving);

• federal monitoring is desirable to permit specified kinds of direction or 
redirection of the work because of interrelationships among projects in 
areas such as applied research; and 
• federal involvement is desirable in the early stages of ongoing 
programs, such as welfare or law enforcement programs, where 
standards are being developed or the application of standards requires 
a period of adjustment until recipient capability has been developed. 
S. Rep. No. 95-449, at 9–10. The OMB guidance expands on what 
substantial involvement means. See 43 Fed. Reg. at 36863. 
It should be emphasized that substantial involvement here refers to federal 
participation in the performance of the funded activity. This should not be 
taken to imply that a federal grantor agency lacks an oversight role when 
lack of substantial involvement calls for the use of a grant.14 Quite the 
contrary, GAO has held that grantor agencies have an affirmative duty to 
oversee grant performance and that, “[a]s a matter of law, a grantor agency 
may not disassociate itself from the performance of its grant.” B-303927, 
June 7, 2005, at 8–9. The decision in B-303927 cited a provision of the 
Single Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. § 7504(a)(1) (“Each Federal agency shall, in 
accordance with guidance issued by the Director [of the Office of 
Management and Budget], . . . monitor non-federal entity use of Federal 
awards”), as well as GAO and judicial decisions that emphasize the 
contractual nature of grant obligations. 

The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act authorizes OMB to 
exempt a transaction or program of an executive agency from its 
application. Id. § 6307(2). The original act provided this exemption 
authority only on a temporary basis. However, Congress later made the 
authority permanent. Pub. L. No. 97-162, 96 Stat. 23 (Apr. 1, 1982). The 
legislative history of Public Law 97-162 noted that OMB had used the 
exemption authority sparingly (only for nonmonetary grants and certain 
revenue sharing programs) and stated the expectation that future 
exemptions would likewise be few in number and limited to individual 
transactions or programs. S. Rep. No. 97-180, at 2 (1981). 

14 In this regard, OMB guidance specifically states that substantial involvement refers to 
performance of the funded activity rather than oversight. 43 Fed. Reg. at 36863.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

b. Agency Implementation of 
the Act 
Specific legislation may also exempt programs from the Federal Grant and 
Cooperative Agreement Act’s requirements. This was the case in B-279338, 
Jan. 4, 1999, where a provision of the Indian Self-Determination and 
Education Assistance Act, 25 U.S.C. § 450e-1, made such an exemption. In 
view of this exemption, the Comptroller General upheld the Interior 
Department’s use of a contract, rather than a grant, to fund a land 
acquisition for an Indian tribe using authority in the Self-Determination Act 
that ordinarily applied to a grant program. 

In determining the correct funding instrument to use, the threshold 
question to consider is whether the agency has statutory authority to 
engage in assistance transactions at all. While federal agencies generally 
have “inherent” authority to enter into contracts to procure goods or 
services for their own use, there is no comparable inherent authority to 
enter into assistance relationships, that is, to give away the government’ s 
money or property, either directly or by the release of vested rights, to 
benefit someone other than the government. 65 Comp. Gen. 605, 607 
(1986); B-210655, Apr. 14, 1983. Therefore, the relevant legislation must be 
studied to determine whether an assistance relationship is authorized at all, 
and if so, under what circumstances and conditions. See, e.g., 64 Comp. 
Gen. 582, 584 (1985); 59 Comp. Gen. 1, 8 (1979). 

It is important to note that the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement 
Act does not expand an agency’s substantive authority in this regard. While 
the act provides criteria for examining whether an arrangement should be a 
contract, grant, or cooperative agreement, determinations of whether an 
agency has authority to enter into such arrangements in the first instance 
must be based on the agency’s authorizing or program legislation. Once the 
necessary underlying authority is found, the legal instrument (contract, 
grant, or cooperative agreement) that fits the arrangement as contemplated 
must be used, using the statutory definitions for guidance as to which 
instrument is appropriate. 

The analysis of the agency’s program authority is not a matter of discretion; 
the requisite authority either is there or it is not. In this regard, however, 
the focus should be on the substance of an agency’s program authority 
rather than the particular labels used or not used. In this connection, a 
Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs report stated: 

“[The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act] was 
never intended to be an independent grant of authority to 
agencies to enter into assistance or contractual 

Page 10-17 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

c. Decisions Interpreting the 
Act 
relationships where no such authority can be found in 
authorizing legislation. Rather, it was and is intended to 
force agencies to use a legal instrument that, according to 
the criteria established by the Act, matches the intended 
and authorized relationship—regardless of the terminology 
used in existing legislation to characterize the instrument to 
be used in the transaction.”15 

Further discussion on this point may be found in B-196872-O.M., Mar. 12, 
1980, and a GAO report entitled Agencies Need Better Guidance for 
Choosing Among Contracts, Grants, and Cooperative Agreements, 
GGD-81-88 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 4, 1981). 

It is important that an agency identify the appropriate funding instrument 
because procurement contracts are subject to a variety of statutory and 
regulatory requirements that generally do not apply to assistance 
transactions. If the type of relationship is not determined properly, 
assistance arrangements could be used to evade competition and other 
legal requirements applicable to procurement contracts. Conversely, 
legitimate assistance awards should not be burdened by all of the 
formalities of procurement contracts. The following decisions illustrate 
how the act’s criteria have been applied. 

In 61 Comp. Gen. 428 (1982), GAO agreed with the Department of Energy’s 
use of a cooperative agreement with a private company to design and 
construct a “prototype solar parabolic dish/sterling engine system module,” 
finding that the proposal’s primary purpose was to encourage development 
and early market entry rather than to acquire the particular item for its own 
use, although it would eventually have governmental applications. 
Therefore, GAO held that the arrangement did not constitute a 
procurement contract requiring competition. 

In contrast, some decisions have held that a procurement contract is the 
appropriate instrument. For example, the Comptroller General determined 
in B-262110, Mar. 19, 1997, that the Environmental Protection Agency 
should have acquired conference support services using a procurement 
contract rather than a cooperative agreement because the support services 

15 S. Rep. No. 97-180, at 4 (1981). This report is on legislation that amended the original act 
rather than direct legislative history on the original act. Nevertheless, it is important as a 
clear statement from one of the relevant jurisdictional committees. 

Page 10-18 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

were a direct benefit to the agency. Similarly, the Comptroller General 
concluded in B-257430, Sept. 12, 1994, that the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) should have used a procurement contract to obtain 
survey services because the services directly benefited OPM by providing 
OPM assistance in performing the agency’s statutory duty and because 
OPM exercised significant influence over the survey arrangements.16 

The issue of whether an agency was improperly using an assistance 
instrument instead of a procurement contract has also been raised in 
judicial decisions. The court in Chem Service, Inc. v. Environmental 
Monitoring Systems Laboratory, 12 F.3d 1256 (3rd Cir. 1993), after 
reviewing the relevant authorizing legislation and its legislative history, 
held that the plaintiff company could challenge whether a cooperative 
research and development agreement between the Environmental 
Protection Agency and a private laboratory actually constituted a 
procurement contract that should have been subject to competition 
requirements under federal law. 

One common situation in which the question of the principal purpose of the 
funding relationship is raised is the so-called “third party” or “intermediary” 
situation where a federal agency provides assistance to specified recipients 
by using an intermediary. In these situations, it is necessary to examine the 
agency’s program authority to determine the authorized forms of 
assistance. The agency’s relationship with the intermediary should 
normally be a procurement contract if the intermediary is not itself a 
member of a class eligible to receive assistance from the government. In 
other words, if an agency program contemplates provision of technical 
advice or services to a specified group of recipients, the agency may 
provide the advice or services itself or hire an intermediary to do it for the 
agency. In that case, the proper vehicle to fund the intermediary is a 
procurement contract. The agency is “buying” the services of the 
intermediary for its own purposes, to relieve the agency of the need to 
provide the advice or services with its own staff. Thus, it is acquiring the 
services for “the direct benefit or use of the United States Government,” 

16 Additional decisions holding that a procurement contract rather than an assistance 
instrument should have been used are: 67 Comp. Gen. 13 (1987), aff’d upon 
reconsideration, B-227084.6, Dec. 19, 1988 (operation of research and training programs at a 
government facility funded by Maritime Administration); 65 Comp. Gen. 605 (1986) 
(proposed study, sponsored by Council on Environmental Quality, of risks and benefits of 
certain pesticides, intended for use by federal regulatory agencies); B-210655, Apr. 14, 1983 
(funding by Department of Energy of college campus forums on nuclear energy). 

Page 10-19 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

which mandates the use of a procurement contract under the Federal Grant 
and Cooperative Agreement Act. 

On the other hand, if the program purpose contemplates support to certain 
types of intermediaries to provide consultation or other specified services 
to third parties, the Comptroller General has approved the agency’s choice 
of a grant rather than a contract as the preferred funding vehicle. Thus, in 
58 Comp. Gen. 785 (1979), the Comptroller General found that the 
Department of Commerce could properly award a noncompetitive grant to 
an intermediary organization to provide management and technical 
assistance to minority business firms. Although the point was not detailed 
in the decision, the agency clearly had the requisite program authority to 
provide grant assistance to the intermediary. 

The Comptroller General came to the opposite conclusion in 61 Comp. 
Gen. 637 (1982). In that case, the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development had awarded a cooperative agreement to a nonprofit 
organization to provide technical assistance to certain block grant 
recipients. While the department’s authority to provide technical 
assistance to the block grant recipients was clear, there was no authority to 
provide assistance to the intermediary organization. The essence of the 
intermediary transaction was the acquisition of services for ultimate 
delivery to authorized recipients. Thus, the Comptroller General 
concluded that a procurement contract should have been used. 

The Senate committee report on legislation that amended the original 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act addressed the intermediary 
issue and agreed with GAO’s interpretation: 

“The choice of instrument for an intermediary relationship 
depends solely on the principal federal purpose in the 
relationship with the intermediary. The fact that the 
product or service produced by the intermediary may 
benefit another party is irrelevant. What is important is 
whether the federal government’s principal purpose is to 
acquire the intermediary’s services, which may happen to 
take the form of producing a product or carrying out a 
service that is then delivered to an assistance recipient, or if 
the government’s principal purpose is to assist the 
intermediary to do the same thing. Where the recipient of 
an award is not receiving assistance from the federal agency 
but is merely used to provide a service to another entity 

Page 10-20 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

which is eligible for assistance, the proper instrument is a 
procurement contract.” 

S. Rep. No. 97-180, at 3 (1981). 

The foregoing cases deal with the specific issue of which funding 
instrument to use, procurement contract versus assistance agreement. 
However, the analysis required by the Federal Grant and Cooperative 
Agreement Act may also be relevant when the main issue concerns the 
applicability of other federal laws to a particular funding instrument. The 
following cases provide examples. 

In B-196690, Mar. 14, 1980, the Interior Department asked whether it could 
use its 1978 and 1979 appropriations to fund expenses of the American 
Samoan Judiciary related to entertainment and the purchase of motor 
vehicles. Using the guidelines of the Federal Grant and Cooperative 
Agreement Act, the Comptroller General reviewed the relationship 
between the Interior Department and the American Samoan Judiciary and 
concluded that it was essentially a grant relationship. Therefore, 
restrictions such as those relating to entertainment and motor vehicles that 
would apply to the direct expenditure of appropriations by the federal 
government or through a contractor did not apply to expenditures by the 
grant recipient, absent some provision to the contrary in the appropriation, 
agency regulations, or grant agreement.17 For fiscal year 1980, Congress 
changed the statutory language to specifically appropriate funds “for grants 
to the judiciary in American Samoa,” thus removing any doubt that the 
Samoan Judiciary is a grant recipient. Pub. L. No. 96-126, 93 Stat. 954, 965 
(Nov. 27, 1979). 

In 59 Comp. Gen. 424 (1980), the Comptroller General viewed the 
Environmental Protection Agency’s public participation program of 
providing financial assistance to certain intervenors in proceedings before 
the agency as essentially a grant relationship rather than a contractual one. 
Accordingly, the decision held that 31 U.S.C. § 3324, which generally 
prohibits the government from making payments for goods or services in 

17 Of course, similar restrictions on allowable costs can be, and frequently are, imposed on 
grantees. For example, entertainment costs are unallowable grant costs under several OMB 
circulars. See OMB Circular No. A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions 
(May 10, 2004), Attachment J, § 17; OMB Circular No. A-122, Cost Principles for Non-profit 
Organizations (May 10, 2004), Attachment B, § 14. Section G of this chapter discusses 
grant cost issues in more detail.

Chapter 10

Agreements 

advance of delivery,18 did not to preclude participants from receiving funds 
in advance of the completion of their participation, subject to the provision 
of adequate fiscal controls. 

In another case, B-290900, Mar. 18, 2003, the Comptroller General held that 
the general requirement under 44 U.S.C. § 501 that the Government Printing 
Office perform printing and binding “for the government” did not apply to 
the publication of an educational brochure about the Michigan Lighthouse 
Project that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had helped to fund. 
The Michigan Lighthouse Project involved a cooperative agreement 
between BLM and other federal, state, and nonprofit entities to preserve 
historical lighthouses. While the decision did not refer specifically to the 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act, it did apply reasoning 
similar to the analysis called for by the act. The decision noted that the 
brochure was published as part of the cooperative agreement and thus 
generally benefited all of the parties to the agreement. Accordingly, for the 
same reason that the transaction did not involve work “for the government” 
within the meaning of 44 U.S.C. § 501, it did not represent the acquisition of 
services principally “for the direct benefit or use of the United States 
Government.” 

Judicial decisions also have considered the Federal Grant and Cooperative 
Agreement Act in considering the applicability of other laws. In 
Hammond v. Donovan, 538 F. Supp. 1106 (W.D. Mo. 1982), the court held 
that the relationship between the Labor Department and a state 
employment office was a grant, and therefore not subject to a statute 
requiring that certain procurement contracts contain an affirmative action 
for veterans provision. The court in Partridge v. Reich, 141 F.3d 920 
(9th Cir. 1998), reached the same conclusion in rejecting the contention that 
a grant was subject to the same statute considered in Hammond. 

Before leaving the subject of the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement 
Act, it is worth highlighting some judicial decisions that have considered 
the act in relation to a topic discussed in the previous section: whether and 
to what extent grants and cooperative agreements should be regarded as 
contracts. 

18 For a more detailed explanation of 31 U.S.C. § 3324 and advance payments in general, see 
Chapter 5, section C. For more on advance payments in the grant context, see section E of 
this chapter.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

The issue in several of the cases is whether assistance agreements can give 
rise to enforceable contract rights and obligations. The Tucker Act gives 
the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over claims against the United 
States “founded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the United 
States . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). In Trauma Service Group, Ltd. v. 
United States, 33 Fed. Cl. 426 (1995), the court determined that a 
memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the Defense Department and a 
health care provider was a cooperative agreement within the meaning of 
the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act. Reasoning that all 
federal agreements must fall into one of the act’s three categories, the court 
reasoned that the MOA, therefore, could not be a contract for purposes of 
the Tucker Act. Trauma Service Group, 33 Fed. Cl. at 429–30. Accordingly, 
the court dismissed the claim. 

Another judge of the same court came to the opposite conclusion in a case 
decided just a few months later, Thermalon Industries, Ltd. v. United 
States, 34 Fed. Cl. 411 (1995). The Thermalon court held that a National 
Science Foundation research grant could give rise to contract rights 
enforceable under the Tucker Act so long as the grant embodied the 
traditional elements of a contract: offer, acceptance by an officer having 
authority to bind the United States, and consideration. The court rejected 
the agency’s argument that the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement 
Act precluded treating the grant as a contract for Tucker Act purposes: 

“There is no suggestion in the [Federal Grant and 
Cooperative Agreement Act] that procurement contracts are 
the only type of contracts enforceable under the Tucker Act 
or that grant agreements that satisfy all of the ordinary 
requirements for a government contract should not be 
classified as contracts enforceable under the Tucker Act.” 

Thermalon, 34 Fed. Cl. at 417. Considering the Federal Grant and 
Cooperative Agreement Act’s legislative history, the court viewed that act 
as addressing “a very different set of concerns” than Tucker Act contract 
jurisdiction. Id. at 418. To the extent that its interpretation of the act was 
inconsistent with the analysis in Trauma Service Group, the court 
“respectfully disagree[d] with that analysis.” Id. at fn. 4. 

Later, in Trauma Service Group, Ltd. v. United States, 104 F.3d 1321 
(1997), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Federal 
Claims Court’s dismissal in that case, but actually sided with the 
Thermalon decision’s analysis on the Federal Grant and Cooperative 

Page 10-23 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Agreement Act point. The Federal Circuit determined that the plaintiff in 
Trauma Service Group had not established a violation of any duty owed to 
it under the terms of the MOA; thus, there could be no breach of contract. 
However, the Federal Circuit rejected the lower court’s conclusion that a 
cooperative agreement could never be a contract for purposes of the 
Tucker Act: 

“[A]ny agreement can be a contract within the meaning of 
the Tucker Act, provided that it meets the requirements for 
a contract with the Government, specifically: mutual intent 
to contract including an offer and acceptance, 
consideration, and a Government representative who had 
actual authority to bind the Government. See City of El 
Centro, 922 F.2d at 820; Thermalon, 34 Fed.Cl. at 414. As 
such, contrary to the opinion of the trial court, a MOA can 
also be a contract—whether this one is, we do not decide.” 

104 F.3d at 1326. Most recently, the Court of Federal Claims in 
Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare v. United States, 48 Fed. 
Cl. 785, 790–91 (2001), reiterated in dicta that a grant could confer 
jurisdiction under the Tucker Act if it contained all of the elements of a 
contract. In this regard, the court cited its prior decision in Trauma 
Service Group as well as the Thermalon decision and a number of cases 
that preceded the enactment of Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement 
Act. However, the court held that the grant in the case before it did not 
include the necessary elements of a contract. 

Other courts have also declined to interpret the Federal Grant and 
Cooperative Agreement Act as precluding the treatment of assistance 
agreements as contracts for purposes unrelated to determining the 
appropriate funding instrument for a federal agency to use. See Henke v. 
Department of Commerce, 83 F.3d 1445 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (Privacy Act 
disclosure exemption, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(5), pertaining to “Federal 
contracts” applied to a National Science Foundation grant that embodied 
the essential elements of a contract); United States v. President & Fellows 
of Harvard College, 323 F. Supp. 2d 151 (D. Mass. 2004) (cooperative 
agreements between the Agency for International Development and 
Harvard were contracts for purposes of a breach of contract action 
initiated by the United States). 

By way of summary, the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act 
provides criteria that agencies must use in deciding which funding 

Page 10-24 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

instrument to use from among contracts, grants, and cooperative 
agreements. This choice assumes, of course, that the agency has the 
requisite statutory authority to enter into assistance relationships in the 
form of a grant or cooperative agreement. The Federal Grant and 
Cooperative Agreement Act does not in itself supply such authority. Legal 
issues concerning the choice of instrument invariably focus on 
procurement versus assistance relationships, with the underlying concern 
often being whether competition requirements should apply. The 
Comptroller General and the courts may also look to the criteria in the 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act to classify a funding 
transaction for purposes of determining the applicability of other laws. In 
this context, however, the clear weight of authority is that the act’s 
classifications are not mutually exclusive. Thus, something that is clearly a 
“grant” for purposes of the act still may be a “contract” or at least have 
contract features for purposes of other laws.19 

3. Competition for 
Discretionary Grant 
Awards 
Grant programs are either mandatory or discretionary. In a mandatory 
grant program, Congress directs awards to one or more classes of 
prospective recipients who meet specific criteria for eligibility, in specified 
amounts. These grants, sometimes called “entitlement” or “formula” 
grants, are often awarded on the basis of statutory formulas.20 While the 
grantor agency may disagree on the application of the formula, it has no 
basis to refuse to make the award altogether. City of Los Angeles v. 
Coleman, 397 F. Supp. 547 (D.D.C. 1975). Thus, questions of grantee 
selection, and hence of competition, do not arise. The concept of 
competition can only apply when the grantor has discretion to choose one 
applicant over another. Therefore, the following discussion is limited to 
discretionary grants. 

The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act encourages 
competition in assistance programs where appropriate, in order to identify 

19 For additional background on many of the cases and issues discussed in this section, see 
Andreas Baltatzis, The Changing Relationship Between Federal Grants and Federal 
Contracts, 32 Pub. Cont. L. J. 611 (Spring 2003); Jeffrey C. Walker, Enforcing Grants and 
Cooperative Agreements as Contracts Under the Tucker Act, 26 Pub. Cont. L. J. 683 
(Summer 1997). 

20 See, e.g., B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002, at fn. 1, referring to an Education Department regulation 
(now found at 34 C.F.R. § 75.200 (2005)), that describes the difference between 
discretionary and formula grants.

Agreements 

and fund the best possible projects to achieve program objectives. 
31 U.S.C. § 6301(3). This, however, is merely a statement of purpose. 
There are few other legislative pronouncements specifying how this 
objective is to be achieved, certainly nothing approaching the detail and 
specificity of statutes applicable to procurement contracts such as the 
Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.21 Statutory requirements for 
competition in grantee selection do exist in certain contexts, but they tend 
to be very general and do not specify actual procedures. Two examples 
involving the Department of Defense are 10 U.S.C. § 2361(a)(1) 
(competitive procedures required for Defense Department research and 
development grants to colleges and universities), and 10 U.S.C. 
§ 2196(i)(competitive procedures also required for Defense Department 
manufacturing engineering education grants). 

In view of the essential differences between grants and procurement 
contracts, GAO has declined to use its bid protest mechanism, prescribed 
to assure the fairness of awards of contracts, to rule on the propriety of 
individual grant awards.22 That is, GAO will not consider a complaint by a 
rejected applicant that it should have received the grant rather than the 
recipient to whom it was actually awarded. See, e.g., B-203096, May 20, 
1981; B-199247, Aug. 21, 1980; B-199147, June 24, 1980; B-190092, Sept. 22, 
1977. This does not affect GAO’s jurisdiction to render decisions on the 
legality of federal expenditures, however, so GAO can and will render 
decisions on the legality of grant awards in terms of compliance with 
applicable statutes and regulations. Of course, GAO may also evaluate 
competition in grant awards from an audit perspective. One such 
evaluation is GAO, Discretionary Grants: Opportunities to Improve 
Federal Discretionary Award Practices, GAO/HRD-86-108 (Washington, 
D.C.: Sept. 15, 1986). 

21 Pub. L. No. 98-369, div. B, title VII, 98 Stat. 494, 1175 (July 18, 1984) (codified in scattered 
sections of titles 10, 31, and 41, United States Code). 

22 Under various statutory and regulatory authorities, GAO has served for more than 
75 years as an independent forum for the resolution of disputes (commonly referred to as 
“bid protests”) concerning the award of federal contracts. See 31 U.S.C. §§ 3551–3556 and 
4 C.F.R. pt. 21 (2005), which are the current statutory and regulatory provisions. For more 
information on the bid protest function, see GAO, Bid Protests at GAO: A Descriptive

GAO has adopted a similar position with respect to cooperative 
agreements. See, e.g., B-255780, Nov. 23, 1993, in which the Comptroller 
General dismissed a protest against the Small Business Administration’s 
use of a cooperative agreement to obtain management and technical 
assistance services because a provision in the Small Business Act gave the 
agency the discretion to choose whether to provide such services through 
grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement contracts. GAO will not 
consider a “protest” against the award of a cooperative agreement unless it 
appears that a conflict of interest exists or that the agency is using the 
cooperative agreement to avoid the competition requirements of the 
procurement laws and regulations (i.e., in violation of the Federal Grant 
and Cooperative Agreement Act). See, e.g., B-281439.3, 281439.4, Mar. 23, 
1999; B-260514, June 16, 1995; 64 Comp. Gen. 669 (1985); 61 Comp. Gen. 428 
(1982); B-258267, Dec. 21, 1994; B-256586, B-256586.2, May 9, 1994; 
B-255780, Nov. 23, 1993; B-216587, Oct. 22, 1984. Again, this refers to 
review under GAO’s “bid protest” jurisdiction and does not affect review 
under GAO’s other available authorities. 

In summary, assuming the proper instrument has been selected, GAO will 
not question funding decisions in discretionary federal assistance 
programs. B-228675, Aug. 31, 1987 (denial of an application for funding 
renewal was held to be a policy matter within the grantor agency’s 
discretion because nothing in the program legislation provided otherwise 
and the agency had complied with all the applicable procedural 
requirements. See also City of Sarasota v. Environmental Protection 
Agency, 813 F.2d 1106 (11th Cir. 1987) (court declined to review agency 
refusal to award grant for construction of a wastewater treatment project); 

Massachusetts Department of Correction v. Law Enforcement Assistance 
Administration, 605 F.2d 21 (1st Cir. 1979) (court upheld agency’s refusal to 
award grant, finding that procedural deficiencies, even though they 
amounted to “sloppiness,” were not sufficiently grave as to deprive the 
applicant of fair consideration). 

C. Some Basic 
Concepts 
A number of principles have evolved that are unique to grant law. These 
will be discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter. Many cases, 
however, involve the application of principles of law which are not unique 
to grants. As a general proposition, the fundamental principles of 
appropriations law discussed in preceding chapters apply to grants just as 
they apply to other expenditures. This section is designed to highlight a 
few of these areas, each of which is covered in detail elsewhere in this 
publication, and to show how they may apply in assistance contexts.

1. The Grant as an 
Exercise of 
Congressional 
Spending Power 
a. Constitutionality of Grant 
Conditions 
When Congress enacts grant legislation and provides appropriations to 
fund the grants, it is exercising the spending power conferred upon it by 
the Constitution.23 As such, it is clear that Congress has the power to attach 
terms and conditions to the availability or receipt of grant funds, either in 
the grant legislation itself or in a separate enactment. 
Oklahoma v. Civil Service Commission, 330 U.S. 127 (1947) (provision of 
Hatch Act prohibiting political activity by employees of state or local 
government agencies receiving federal grant funds upheld as within 
congressional power). See also West Virginia v. United States 
Department of Health & Human Services, 289 F.3d 281 (4th Cir. 2002) 
(upholding amendment to Medicaid legislation requiring states to recoup 
expenses from estates of deceased beneficiaries). 

In South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987) (citations omitted), the 
Supreme Court observed: 

“‘[T]he power of Congress to authorize expenditure of 
public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the 
direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.’ 
Thus, objectives not thought to be within Article I’s 
‘enumerated legislative fields’ . . . may nevertheless be 
attained through the use of the spending power and the 
conditional grant of federal funds.” 

The Supreme Court and lower courts have repeatedly affirmed the power 
of Congress to attach conditions to grant funds provided that the 
conditions are (1) in pursuit of the general welfare, (2) expressed 
unambiguously, (3) reasonably related to the purpose of the expenditure, 
and (4) not in violation of other constitutional provisions. New York v. 
United States, 505 U.S. 144, 171–72 (1992). In this case, the Supreme Court 
upheld the constitutionality of statutory grant conditions that imposed on 
states milestones for disposing of radioactive waste, although it declared 
unconstitutional another aspect of the statute. The following are additional 
examples of cases upholding grant conditions: United States v. American 

23 U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 is often referred to as the principal source of congressional 
spending power. Congress may be acting under other enumerated powers as well. 
“Congress is not required to identify the precise source of its authority when it enacts 
legislation.” Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d 445, 449 n. 8 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 
1070 (1990). For additional background on the congressional “power of the purse,” see 
Chapter 1, section B.

Library Association, 539 U.S. 194 (2003) (requiring public libraries to use 
Internet filters in order to receive federal subsidies); South Dakota v. Dole, 
483 U.S. 203, 207–08 (1987) (withholding a percentage of federal highway 
funds from states that do not adopt a minimum drinking age of 21); 
Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d 445 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1070 
(1990) (conditioning the receipt of federal highway funds on state adoption 
of the national speed limit). The following cases illustrate application of 
the criteria for grant conditions set forth in New York v. United States.24 

(1) Conditions must be in pursuit of the general welfare and related to the 
purpose of the expenditure 
These two criteria tend to overlap. In Hodges v. Thompson, 311 F.3d 316 
(4th Cir. 2000), cert. denied sub nom., 540 U.S. 811 (2003), the court found 
that both criteria were satisfied by a statutory provision requiring states 
develop and maintain automated child support enforcement data 
processing systems as a condition to receipt of funds under the Temporary 
Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. As to the “general welfare” 
criterion, the court agreed with the lower court that “Congress made a 
considered judgment that the American people would benefit significantly 
from the enhanced enforcement of child-support decrees and the 
diminution of the number of parents who are able to avoid their obligations 
simply by moving across local or state lines.” Hodges, 311 F.3d at 316. As 
to the “reasonably related” criterion, the court recognized “a 
complementary relationship between efficient child support enforcement 
and the broader goals of providing assistance to needy families through the 
TANF program.” Id. In Sabri v. United States, 541 U.S. 600 (2004), the 
Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of a federal criminal statute 
that proscribed bribery of officials of state or local government agencies 
that received at least $10,000 annually in federal funds. In rejecting a 
challenge that the statute exceeded Congress’s spending power because it 
did not require a nexus between the bribe and a use of federal funds, the 
Court observed: 

“Congress has authority under the Spending Clause to 
appropriate federal monies to promote the general 

24 Cases dealing with the validity of conditions attached to grants (and other forms of federal 
spending) also are discussed in Chapter 1, section B, and the update of that section in GAO, 
Principles of Federal Appropriations Law: Annual Update of the Third Edition, GAO-05354SP 
(Washington, D.C.: March 2005), available at www.gao.gov/legal.htm (last visited 
September 15, 2005).

welfare . . . and it has corresponding authority under the 
Necessary and Proper Clause . . . to see to it that taxpayer 
dollars appropriated under that power are in fact spent for 
the general welfare, and not frittered away in graft or on 
projects undermined when funds are siphoned off or 
corrupt public officers are derelict about demanding value 
for dollars. . . . It is true, just as Sabri says, that not every 
bribe or kickback offered or paid to agents of governments 
covered by [the statute] will be traceably skimmed from 
specific federal payments, or show up in the guise of a quid 
pro quo for some dereliction in spending a federal grant. . . . 
But this possibility portends no enforcement beyond the 
scope of federal interest, for the reason that corruption does 
not have to be that limited to affect the federal interest. 
Money is fungible, bribed officials are untrustworthy 
stewards of federal funds, and corrupt contractors do not 
deliver dollar-for-dollar value.” 

Sabri, 541 U.S. at 605–06. 

(2) Conditions must be unambiguous 
As discussed before in section B.1, the Supreme Court has characterized 
conditions Congress attaches to federal grants as “much in the nature of a 
contract.” Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 
(1981). Consistent with the contract analogy, it is particularly important 
that grant conditions be expressed with sufficiently clarity to establish 
knowing acceptance on the part of the grantees. As the Court stated in 
Pennhurst: 

“The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the 
spending power . . . rests on whether the [recipient] 
voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the 
‘contract.’ . . . There can, of course, be no knowing 
acceptance if a [recipient] is unaware of the conditions or is 
unable to ascertain what is expected of it. Accordingly, if 
Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of 
federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.” 

Id. at 17.

Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

One recent case on this point is Jackson v. Birmingham Board of 
Education, 544 U.S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 1497 (2005). The plaintiff in Jackson, a 
male and former coach of a high school girls’ basketball team, sued the 
school board under a federal statute prohibiting “sex discrimination” by 
recipients of education grant funds. He alleged that his firing was in 
retaliation for complaining that the girls’ team was not receiving equal 
access to athletic equipment and facilities. The school board countered 
that it lacked adequate notice that it could be held liable under the statute, 
which did not explicitly prohibit retaliation against persons who 
complained about discrimination. The Court rejected the school board’s 
argument on the basis that the board should have been on notice of a series 
of prior Supreme Court decisions that consistently construed the statute 
broadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional discrimination, and that 
retaliation was clearly a form of intentional discrimination. Jackson, 
125 S. Ct. at 1509–10. See also Garrett v. University of Alabama at 
Birmingham Board of Trustees, 344 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2003), holding that 
a statutory provision unambiguously conditioned the receipt by states of 
federal grant funds on a waiver of their Eleventh Amendment immunity to 
certain claims and that, by continuing to accept federal funds, the state 
agencies waived their immunity. 

By contrast, an en banc decision in Commonwealth of Virginia 
Department of Education v. Riley, 106 F.3d 559 (4th Cir. 1997), held that a 
statutory provision was not sufficiently clear to impose a binding condition 
on the use of grant funds. Riley involved a provision of the Individuals with 
Disabilities in Education Act that required recipients of grant funds under 
the act to ensure all children with disabilities the right to a free appropriate 
public education. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(1) (Supp. 1996). The federal 
Department of Education determined that the state of Virginia’s policy of 
discontinuing free public education for students (both disabled and 
nondisabled) who were expelled or suspended for a lengthy period violated 
this provision of the act. When the state appealed, a Fourth Circuit panel 
agreed with the Education Department. However, the court, en banc, held 
that the statute was insufficiently unambiguous to require that the state, as 
a condition of receiving the grant funds, continue to provide education for 
expelled or suspended students. Which interpretation of the statute was 
better in the abstract was not the question, said the court. Rather, citing 
South Dakota v. Dole and Pennhurst, the court held: 

Page 10-31 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

“The question is whether, in unmistakably clear terms, 
Congress has conditioned the States’ receipt of federal 
funds upon the provision of educational services to those 
handicapped students expelled for misconduct unrelated to 
their handicap: ‘[I]f Congress desires to condition the 
States’ receipt of federal funds, it ‘must do so 
unambiguously . . . .’” 

Riley, 106 F.3d at 566 (emphasis in original).25 

(3) Conditions must be otherwise constitutional 
Grant conditions obviously may not violate other federal constitutional 
provisions. While courts rarely strike down grant conditions on 
constitutional grounds, they have done so in two recent cases. In 
Legal Services Corp. v. Velasquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001), the Supreme Court 
held that a statutory provision prohibiting Legal Service Corporation 
grantees from representing clients in efforts to amend or otherwise 
challenge existing welfare law violated the First Amendment by interfering 
with the free speech rights of the clients. The court in American Civil 
Liberties Union v. Mineta, 319 F. Supp. 2d 69 (D.D.C. 2004), declared 
unconstitutional a statutory provision that prohibited the use of federal 
mass transit grant funds for any activity that promoted the legalization or 
medical use of marijuana. Relying on Legal Services Corp. v. Velasquez, 
the court held that the provision constituted “viewpoint discrimination” in 
violation of the First Amendment. Mineta, 319 F. Supp. 2d at 83–87. 

Even if a grant condition satisfies all of the New York v. United States 
criteria as discussed above, could it still be unconstitutionally coercive? 
Although it appears that no court has ever invalidated a federal grant 
condition on grounds of pure “coerciveness,” this possibility is frequently 
discussed in the case law. A leading example is West Virginia v. United 
States Department of Health & Human Services, 289 F.3d 281 (4th Cir. 
2002). In that case, West Virginia challenged on Tenth Amendment grounds 
a statutory provision requiring that as a condition to participating in the 
Medicaid program, states implement a program to recover certain 
expenditures from the estates of deceased Medicaid beneficiaries. Failure 

25 Subsequent to the decision in Riley, Congress amended the statute to explicitly require 
continuation for children with disabilities “who have been suspended or expelled from 
school.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A). 

Page 10-32 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

to comply could result in a loss of all or part of the state’s federal Medicaid 
reimbursement.26 The state did not contend that the condition violated any 
of the criteria in New York v. United States. Rather, West Virginia viewed 
the estate recovery program as “bad public policy” but maintained that it 
had no practical option to reject it. The state had participated in Medicaid 
for almost 30 years before “Congress changed the rules of the game” and 
mandated the estate recovery program. Withdrawal of its federal Medicaid 
funds at this stage would cause its health care system to “effectively 
collapse.” 

The court struggled with this argument. It cited several Supreme Court 
decisions in suggesting that compliance with the New York v. United States 
criteria might not be enough to immunize a grant condition from 
constitutional jeopardy: 

“[T]he Supreme Court has cautioned that ‘in some 
circumstances the financial inducement [to comply with a 
condition imposed upon the receipt of federal funds] 
offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the 
point at which pressure turns into compulsion.’ . . . Thus, 
while Congress may use its spending powers to encourage 
the states to act, it may not coerce the states into action. If 
the Congressional action amounts to coercion rather than 
encouragement, then that action is not a proper exercise of 
the spending powers but is instead a violation of the Tenth 
Amendment.” 

West Virginia, 289 F.3d at 286–87. The opinion then discussed at length 
decisions from the Fourth Circuit and other circuits that differed, largely 
on a conceptual level, as to whether there was a viable “coercion theory” 
applicable to federal grant conditions. It concluded in this regard: 

“[W]e are aware of no decision from any court finding a 
conditional grant to be impermissibly coercive. Although 
the Supreme Court has more than once referred to the 
existence of the coercion theory . . . its cases have provided 
little guidance for determining when the line between 
encouragement and coercion is crossed.” 

26 These provisions are found at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396p(b)(1) (requirement) and 1396c (penalty 
for noncompliance). 

Page 10-33 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Id. at 289. In fact, it noted that “most courts faced with the question have 
effectively abandoned any real effort to apply the coercion theory.” Id. 
at 290. Ultimately, the court rejected West Virginia’s coercion argument on 
the basis that the federal government was unlikely to take drastic action 
against the state: 

“If the government in fact withheld the entirety of West 
Virginia’s [Medicaid funding] because of the state’s failure to 
implement an estate recovery program, then serious Tenth 
Amendment questions would be raised. . . . In reality, 
however, the government threatened to withhold ‘all or part 
of [West Virginia’s] Federal financial participation in the 
State’s Medicaid Program.’ . . . This small difference in 
language makes all the difference in our analysis.” 

Id. at 291–92 (emphasis added). 

b. Effect of Grant Conditions A valid grant condition imposed by or pursuant to a federal statute is 
binding on the recipient and will prevail over inconsistent state law: 
“There is of course no question that the Federal 
Government, unless barred by some controlling 
constitutional prohibition, may impose the terms and 
conditions upon which its money allotments to the States 
shall be disbursed, and that any state law or regulation 
inconsistent with such federal terms and conditions is to 
that extent invalid.” 

King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 333 n.34 (1968); see also Townsend v. Swank, 
404 U.S. 282 (1971) (state statute inconsistent with eligibility criteria of Aid 
to Families with Dependent Children legislation held invalid); United 
States v. Miami University, 294 F.3d 797, 808 (6th Cir. 2002) (federal 
government has inherent power to sue to enforce conditions imposed on 
the recipients of federal grants); State of Kansas v. United States, 214 F.3d 
1196 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1035 (2000) (rejecting a state 
challenge to restrictions imposed on child support enforcement program 
under federal law); S.J. Groves & Sons v. Fulton County, 920 F.2d 752, 763– 
64 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1252 and 500 U.S. 959 (1991) (valid 
grantor agency regulations may preempt state law). 

Page 10-34 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

When Congress has imposed a valid condition on the receipt of grant funds, 
the condition is, in effect, a “condition precedent” to the recipient’s 
participation in the program.27 Unless permitted under the program 
legislation, the condition may not be waived or omitted even though a given 
state may not be able to participate because state law or the state 
constitution precludes compliance. North Carolina ex rel. Morrow v. 
Califano, 445 F. Supp. 532 (E.D.N.C. 1977), aff’d mem., 435 U.S. 962 (1978). 
See also Hodges v. Thompson, 311 F.3d 316 (4th Cir. 2002), cert. denied sub 
nom., 540 U.S. 811 (2003)(program requirement that state approved plan 
include automated data processing and information retrieval system was 
not coercive and agency has no discretion to deviate from the statutory 
noncompliance penalty provisions); 43 Comp. Gen. 174 (1963). 

Once federal conditions attach, there are limits to what a grantee can do to 
“de-federalize” the funded project or activity in order to free itself of the 
condition. In Ross v. Federal Highway Administration, 162 F.3d 1046 
(10th Cir. 1998), the state of Kansas had been working on a federally funded 
highway project for many years. However, one segment of the project had 
been stalled for 3 years because of environmental concerns and the ability 
of the parties to finalize a supplemental environmental impact statement. 
To resolve the impasse, state and local officials decided to proceed with 
this segment using only nonfederal funds. The Federal Highway 
Administration agreed and initiated action to terminate the environmental 
impact statement process on the basis that this segment of the project was 
no longer a “major federal action.” This strategy failed, however, when 
environmentalists sued and the court in Ross held that completion of the 
segment continued to be a major federal action even if locally funded: 

“At the advanced stage of the trafficway project, it was 
simply too late for the state of Kansas to convert the eastern 
segment into a local project. Since 1986, local, state and 
federal authorities scheduled, programmed and worked on 
the trafficway as a joint federal-state project. The federal 
nature of the trafficway was so pervasive that the Kansas 
authorities could not rid the project of federal involvement 
simply by withdrawing the last segment of the project from 
federal funding.” 

27 Of course, it is also within the power of Congress to authorize the making of unconditional 
grants. See B-80351, Sept. 30, 1948. 

Page 10-35 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

162 F.3d at 1052–53. The court acknowledged that the state had the right to 
select which of its highway projects would receive federal assistance, but 
said that this option could not be used to circumvent federal environmental 
laws. Id. at 1053. Ross cited and followed two very similar decisions: 
Scottsdale Mall v. State of Indiana, 549 F.2d 484 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. 
denied, 434 U.S. 1008 (1978), and San Antonio Conservation Society v. 
Texas Highway Dept., 446 F.2d 1013 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 
933 (1972). 

2. Availability of 
Appropriations 
As with obligations and expenditures in general, a federal agency may 
provide financial assistance only to the extent authorized by law and 
available appropriations. Thus, the three elements of legal availability— 
purpose, time, and amount—apply equally to assistance funds. 
a. Purpose As stated in 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a), appropriations may be used only for the 
purpose(s) for which they were made.28 One of the ways in which this 
fundamental proposition manifests itself in the grant context is the 
principle that grant funds may be obligated and expended only for 
authorized grant purposes. What is an “authorized grant purpose” is 
determined by examining the relevant program legislation, legislative 
history, and appropriation acts. 
GAO considered this issue in a recent decision, B-303927, June 7, 2005. 
Congress appropriated funds to the Department of Labor to assist in 
response and recovery following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks 
on the United States. The appropriation earmarked $125 million for the 
purpose of payment to the New York Workers’ Compensation Board for 
“processing of claims related to the terrorist attacks.” The Labor 
Department distributed the funds to the Board through a grant. The Board 
did not use the funds to process claims, but gave them to other New York 
state entities to reimburse those entities for claims they had paid on behalf 
of victims. GAO held that use of the funds for this purpose was 
inconsistent with the language of the appropriation. By contrast, GAO held 
in another “purpose” case, B-248111, Sept. 9, 1992, that grant funds were 
available for the activities in question based on the language of the 
authorizing statute and its legislative history. 

28 We discuss the concept of the availability of appropriations as to purpose in detail in 
Chapter 4. 

Page 10-36 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Disaster relief assistance legislation, found at 42 U.S.C. §§ 5122–5206, 
authorizes, among other things, federal financial contributions to state and 
local governments for the repair or replacement of public facilities 
damaged by a major disaster. Decisions under a prior version of this 
legislation had construed public facilities as including municipal airports 
(42 Comp. Gen. 6 (1962)), including airport facilities that had been leased 
to private parties for the purpose of generating income for airport 
maintenance (49 Comp. Gen. 104 (1969)). Assistance could also extend to 
a sewage treatment plant, but not one which was not completed, and thus 
not in operation, at the time of the damage. 45 Comp. Gen. 409 (1966). 
Unlike the earlier legislation, the current statute defines “public facility,” 
42 U.S.C. § 5122(8), and specifically includes airport and sewage treatment 
facilities. 

The following are additional examples of decisions dealing with the 
purpose availability of grant funds: 

• Airport development grants under Federal Airport Act may include 
runway sealing projects which are shown to be part of reconstruction 
or repair rather than normal maintenance. 35 Comp. Gen. 588 (1956). 
See also B-60032, Sept. 9, 1946 (grants under same legislation may be 
made for acquisition of land or existing privately owned airports, to be 
used as public airports, regardless of whether construction or repair 
work is immediately contemplated). 
• Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration is authorized to make 
grants to a labor union to fund emergency medical technician training 
program for coal miners since the proposal bears a sufficiently close 
relationship to coal mine safety to come within the scope of the 
governing program legislation, 30 U.S.C. § 951 (1970). B-170686, Nov. 8, 
1977. 
• Public Health Service grants for support of research training were 
found authorized under the Public Health Service Act, as amended.29 
B-161769, June 30, 1967. 

Grant funds provided by lump-sum appropriation are subject to the usual 
rule that an agency may reallocate discretionary funds within that 
appropriation as long as it uses those funds for purposes authorized under 

29 Pub. L. No. 86-798, 74 Stat. 1053 (Sept. 15, 1960).

Agreements 

the applicable appropriation and program statute.30 The court’s decision in 
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency v. EPA, 947 F.2d 283 (7th Cir. 
1991), illustrates this point. Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) could prescribe plans to implement air quality 
standards for states that failed to submit adequate plans. The act also 
authorized air pollution control grants to states, funded under EPA’s lumpsum 
Abatement, Control, and Compliance appropriation. Under its 
regulations, EPA divided available funds into nonmandatory annual 
allotments for each state. The regulations also authorized EPA to set aside 
a portion of the unawarded allotments to support federal implementation 
programs where required because of the absence of adequate state 
programs. One state argued that the set-aside policy amounted to a 
diversion of funds from their intended purpose and, therefore, violated 
31 U.S.C. § 1301(a). The court first upheld the regulation as a permissible 
interpretation of EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act. The court then 
found that there was no purpose violation because (a) the relevant 
appropriation act did not earmark any specific amount for grants to states, 
and (b) EPA was still using the set-aside funds for air pollution abatement 
programs, which was their intended purpose. 

The Comptroller General has applied essentially the same reasoning in 
several decisions dealing with grant funds. For example, in B-157356, 
Aug. 17, 1978, the then Department of Health, Education, and Welfare’s 
Office of Human Development Services (OHD) received a lump-sum 
appropriation covering a number of grant programs administered by 
various OHD components. The department wanted to make what it termed 
“cross-cutting” grants to fund research or demonstration projects that 
would benefit more than one target population (e.g., aged, children, Native 
Americans). To do this, each OHD component receiving grant funds under 
the lump-sum appropriation was asked to contribute a portion of its grant 
funds to a pool that would be used for approved cross-cutting grants. Since 
the lump-sum appropriation did not restrict the department’s internal 
allocation of funds for any given program, GAO approved the concept, 
provided that the grants were limited to projects within the scope of grant 
programs funded by the lump-sum appropriation, a condition necessary to 
assure compliance with 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a). See also B-258000, Aug. 31, 
1994, in which GAO held that a lump-sum Forest Service appropriation 
could be used to make a congressionally earmarked grant in a specific

appropriations.

amount to the Texas Reforestation Foundation where the proviso 
containing the earmark did not identify who should make the grant or the 
source of funds to be used. 

Funds provided for specific grants in the form of earmarked line-item 
appropriations cannot be diverted to other purposes. In 72 Comp. Gen. 317 
(1993), GAO held that the General Services Administration lacked authority 
to establish a “reserve account” for the expenses of administering a grant 
program through a percentage set aside from line-item appropriations of 
grant funds that had been awarded to various grantees. Since Congress 
provided specific amounts for specific purposes, the agency could not 
reduce the amount of the line-itemed grants in order to cover the cost of 
administration, notwithstanding post-enactment “approval” by a 
congressional subcommittee. 

Funds must be obligated by the grantor agency within their period of 
availability.31 The period of availability of appropriated funds is the period 
of time provided by law in which the administering agency has to obligate 
the funds. B-271607, June 3, 1996. The statutory requirement for recording 
obligations extends to all actions necessary to constitute a valid obligation, 
and includes, of course, grant obligations (31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(5)).32 Proper 
recording of grant obligations facilitates compliance with the “time of 
obligation” requirement by ensuring that agencies have adequate budget 
authority to cover their obligations. See B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003, aff’d in 
B-300480.2, June 6, 2003. 

In the context of discretionary grants, the obligation generally occurs at the 
time of award. See, e.g., B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002; 31 Comp. Gen. 608 
(1952).33 Thus, in B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003, aff’d in B-300480.2, June 6, 2003, 
GAO held that an obligation arises when the Corporation for National and 

31 See the discussion of the Availability of Appropriations as to Time in Chapter 5. 

32 See Chapter 7 for a general discussion of recording obligations and Chapter 7, section B.5 
for a specific discussion of recording requirements for grant obligations. 

33 The particular obligating document varies and can include an agency’s approval of a grant 
application or a letter of commitment. See 39 Comp. Gen. 317 (1959); 37 Comp. Gen. 861, 
863 (1958). Section 1501(a)(5) of title 31, United States Code, lists three forms of 
documentary evidence for grant obligations: (A) an appropriation providing for payment in 
a specific amount fixed by law or under a formula prescribed by law (i.e., a mandatory or 
formula grant); (B) an agreement authorized by law; or (C) plans approved consistent with 
law.

Community Service awards grants authorizing the grantees to enroll a 
specified number of participants into the education programs it funds. At 
that time, the Corporation incurs a recordable obligation in the amount of 
its maximum liability for those benefits since, at that point, the grantee 
rather than the Corporation controls the actual level of participant 
enrollment. Id. 

An obligation under a discretionary grant program generally does not exist 
absent a binding grant award. Thus, GAO concluded that a valid grant 
never came into existence when an “offer of grant” made by the Economic 
Development Administration to a Connecticut municipality was accepted 
by a town official who did not have authority to accept the grant, and the 
funds expired for obligation purposes before the town was able to ratify the 
unauthorized acceptance. B-220527, Dec. 16, 1985. The town later 
submitted a claim for reimbursement of its expenses, based on an 
“equitable estoppel” argument. Since the nonexistence of the grant was 
attributable to the town’s actions and not those of the federal agency, the 
claim could not be allowed. B-220527, Aug. 11, 1987. See also B-206244, 
June 8, 1982.

 The “bona fide needs rule,” which is a basic principle of time availability, 
holds that an appropriation is available for obligation only to fulfill a 
genuine or bona fide need of the period of availability for which the 
appropriation was made.34 This rule applies to grants and cooperative 
agreements as well as to other types of obligations or expenditures. See, 
e.g., 73 Comp. Gen 77 (1994); 64 Comp. Gen. 359 (1985); B-229873, Nov. 29, 
1988. However, as discussed hereafter, the manner in which the rule 
applies differs somewhat in the context of grants and other assistance 
transactions, as opposed to transactions in which the federal government is 
obtaining goods and services by contract. 

The specific issue that arises in the grant decisions is whether the principle 
of “severability,” a key element in applying the bona fide needs rule to 
contracts, has any relevance to assistance transactions. The principle of 
severability requires determining whether services that an agency seeks to 
obtain (usually by contract) are part of a single undertaking that fulfills an 
agency need of the fiscal year charged, or whether the services are 
severable in nature and fulfill a recurring need of the agency from fiscal 
year to fiscal year. If the services are severable, the bona fide needs rule 

34 See Chapter 5, section B, for a comprehensive discussion of the bona fide needs rule. 

Page 10-40 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

restricts use of the appropriation to obtaining that portion of the services 
needed during its period of availability. 

In a 1985 decision, 64 Comp. Gen. 359, GAO applied the severability 
principle to National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants. The 
decision concluded that the grants in question were severable, and 
therefore, NIH violated the bona fide needs rule by awarding them for 
3 years using 1-year appropriations. The decision did express some 
reservations about this result: 

“[W]e recognize that there are fundamental differences 
between a contract for materials or services and a research 
grant. The severability concept is not altogether analogous 
to the NIH research grants, which resemble subsidies rather 
than contracts for services.” 

64 Comp. Gen. at 365. Another decision, 73 Comp. Gen. 77 (1994), applied 
the severability principle to cooperative agreements. This decision held 
that certain cooperative agreements providing for the periodic issuance of 
project-specific research work orders were nonseverable and, therefore, 
could not be funded incrementally from 1-year appropriations. 

In B-229873, Nov. 29, 1988, however, GAO held that the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) did not violate the bona fide needs rule when it used 
a 1-year appropriation on the last day of the fiscal year to award 
cooperative agreements to Small Business Development Centers, even 
though the Centers would not use the money until the next fiscal year. 
Contrasting these cooperative agreements to service contracts that were 
subject to the severability principle, the decision observed: 

“[T]he purpose of the Small Business Development Centers 
appropriation is to fund an assistance program for nonfederal 
entities which, in turn, are expected to use the 
funds, together with some of their own, to fulfill a public 
purpose. Although the purpose of the program is to provide 
assistance to Centers for a 1-year period, it really does not 
matter when the Center begins or completes its tasks. The 
statutory purpose was fulfilled once a grant or cooperative 
agreement was awarded during the period of availability of 
the appropriation for obligation; in other words, the award 
constitutes the obligation, and upon award, the funds 
belong to the awardee.” 

Page 10-41 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

The decision in B-229873 distinguished 64 Comp. Gen. 359 rather than 
overruling it. 

A more recent decision, B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002, seems to lay to rest any 
vestiges of the severability principle as applied to grants or cooperative 
agreements. In approving the Education Department’s practice of 
awarding certain education grants for 5 years using 1-year appropriations, 
this decision stated flatly that “for grants, the principle of severability is 
irrelevant to a bona fide need determination.” Elaborating upon this 
conclusion, the decision explained: 

“We believe the application of the bona fide need rule found 
in the SBA case [B-229873] is the correct approach. It 
expressly recognizes the fundamental difference between a 
contract and a grant or cooperative agreement and the 
significance this difference has on a bona fide need analysis. 
Contracts and grants are transactions that fulfill 
significantly different needs of an agency, the former to 
acquire goods and services and the latter to provide 
financial assistance. B-222665, July 2, 1986 (principal 
purpose of a grant is to transfer something of value to the 
recipient to carry out a legislatively established public 
policy instead of acquiring goods or services for the direct 
benefit or use of the United States). . . . 

“The SBA decision is also more in keeping with past 
decisions, where we have routinely permitted agencies to 
award grants using fiscal year funds irrespective of the fact 
that the funds would not be expended until some time after 
the end of the fiscal year.” 

The decision observed that the relevant consideration was not the principle 
of severability but the applicable program legislation, and concluded in this 
regard: 

“In our opinion, Education’s award of 5-year grants is both 
consistent with program objectives and within its discretion 
under the program legislation. Under the program 
legislation, Education is not merely required to provide 
financial assistance, it is to ensure through various ways 
that students who have received services under the . . . 
program continue to receive those services from year-to-

Page 10-42 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


c. Amount

Agreements 

year until completion of high school. Awarding grants 
5 years in duration will aid in ensuring the continuity of 
grantee services to . . . students which the programs 
legislation seeks to provide. Therefore, Education is 
fulfilling its bona fide need under this program when it 
awards these 5-year grants.” 

Appropriations for grant programs are generally subject to the same time 
availability rules as other appropriations. Thus, for example, when 
Congress expressly provides that a grant appropriation “shall remain 
available until expended” (no-year appropriation), the funds remain 
available until they are obligated and expended by the grantor agency 
subject to the account closing statute, 31 U.S.C § 1555. It should be 
emphasized that the time availability of grant appropriations governs the 
grantor agency’s obligation and expenditure of the funds; it does not limit 
the time in which the grantee must use the funds once it has received them. 
Id. Of course, the grant statute or the grantor agency may impose time 
limits on a grantee’s use of funds. See City of New York v Shalala, 34 F.3d 
1161 (2nd Cir. 1994); Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Browner, 
866 F. Supp. 249 (D. Md. 1994). 

The Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a), among other things, requires 
that federal agencies avoid incurring obligations in excess of the amount 
available in their appropriations.35 Of course, grant obligations and 
expenditures are subject to the act. Restrictions on the availability of a 
lump-sum appropriation are not legally binding unless incorporated 
expressly or by reference in the appropriation act itself. Thus, a plan to 
award fewer National Institutes of Health biomedical research grants, 
funded under a lump-sum appropriation, than the number of grants 
provided for in congressional committee reports was not unlawful, as long 
as all the funds were properly obligated for authorized grant purposes. 
64 Comp. Gen. 359 (1985). See also B-157356, Aug. 17, 1978. 

35 For a general discussion of the Antideficiency Act, see Chapter 6, section C, and for 
amount availability, see Chapter 6, section C.2.e.

Agreements 

Minimum earmarks (e.g., “not less than” or “shall be available only”) in an 
authorization act were found controlling where a later-enacted 
appropriation act provided a lump sum considerably less than the amount 
authorized but nevertheless sufficient to meet the earmark requirements. 
64 Comp. Gen. 388 (1985).36 The grantor agency will have more discretion 
where the earmark is a maximum (“not to exceed”) or where it is expressed 
only in legislative history. B-171019, Mar. 2, 1977. See also 72 Comp. 
Gen. 317 (1993) (General Services Administration may not divert a portion 
of earmarked grants to cover administrative costs); compare Association 
of Metropolitan Water Agencies v. Browner, 24 F. Supp. 2d 83 (D.D.C. 1998) 
(agency was not obligated to set aside funds for health effects research 
earmarked in an authorization act where Congress never clearly made an 
appropriation pursuant to the specific authorization containing the 
earmark). 

In the absence of a contrary provision in the applicable program statute, 
regulations, or grant agreement, there is no basis to object to a grantee’s 
allocation of grant funds as long as the funds were spent for eligible grant 
activities. B-260990, June 13, 1996; 69 Comp. Gen. 600 (1990). See also 
71 Comp. Gen. 310 (1992) (allowing grantees to retain reasonable profit or 
fees under Small Business Administration policy directive). 

As the cases cited below illustrate, a federal institution is generally not 
eligible to receive grant funds from another federal source unless the 
program legislation so provides. The reason is that the grant funds would 
improperly augment the appropriations of the receiving institution. For 
example: 

• Federal grant funds for nurse training programs could not be allotted to 
St. Elizabeths Hospital since it was already receiving appropriations to 
maintain and operate its nursing school. 23 Comp. Gen. 694 (1944). 
• Haskell Indian Junior College, fully funded by the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, was not eligible to receive grant funds from federal agencies 
other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs since Congress had already 
provided for its needs by direct appropriations. B-114868, Apr. 11, 1975. 
36 See Chapter 2, section C, for a general discussion of the interplay between authorization 
and appropriation acts.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative

The Office of Education could not make a library support grant to the 
National Commission on Libraries and Information Science as it would be 
an improper augmentation of the Commission’s appropriations. 57 Comp. 
Gen. 662, 664 (1978). 

3. Agency Regulations 
a. General principles37 Legislation establishing an assistance program frequently will define the 
program objectives and leave it to the administering agency to fill in the 
details by regulation. Thus, agency regulations are of paramount 
importance in assessing the parameters of grant authority. These 
regulations, if properly promulgated and within the bounds of the agency’s 
statutory authority, have the force and effect of law and may not be waived 
on a retroactive or ad hoc basis. See generally B-300912, Feb. 6, 2004. 
See also 57 Comp. Gen. 662 (1978) (eligibility standards); B-163922, Feb. 10, 
1978 (grantee’s liability for improper expenditures); B-130515, July 17, 1974; 
B-130515, July 20, 1973 (matching share requirements). However, the 
prohibition against waiver does not necessarily apply to regulations that 
are merely “internal administrative guidelines” as long as the government’s 
interests are adequately protected. See 60 Comp. Gen. 208, 210 (1981). 
The operation of several of these principles is illustrated in B-203452, 
Dec. 31, 1981. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revised its 
regulations to permit indirect costs to be charged to Airport Development 
Aid Program grants. A grantee filed a claim for reimbursement of indirect 
costs incurred prior to the change in the FAA regulations, arguing that the 
charging of indirect costs was required by a Federal Management Circular 
(superseded by OMB Circulars) even before FAA recognized it in its own 
regulations. GAO first pointed out that Federal Management Circulars are 
internal management tools. They do not have the binding effect of law so 
as to permit a third party to assert them against a noncomplying agency. 
This being the case, there was no impediment to FAA’s revising its 
regulations without making the revision retroactive as long as both the old 
and the new regulations were within the scope of FAA’s legal authority. 
See also Pueblo Neighborhood Health Centers, Inc. v. United States 
Department of Health & Human Services, 720 F.2d 622, 625–26 (10th Cir. 

37 See Chapter 3, section C for a general discussion of agency regulations and administrative 
law principles applicable to them.

1983) (department’s grant application manual is an internal agency 
publication rather than a regulation with force and effect of law, so that 
deviations from it, in this case use of an ineligible member on a funding 
review panel, did not require reversal of agency action). 

Regulations of the grantor agency will generally be upheld as long as they 
are within the agency’s statutory authority, issued in compliance with 
applicable procedural requirements, and not arbitrary or capricious. The 
courts have sustained grant regulations in many contexts. See, e.g., 
Southeast Kansas Community Action Program, Inc. v. Secretary of 
Agriculture, 967 F.2d 1452 (10th Cir. 1992) (upholding a regulatory 
amendment to eliminate appeal procedures for nonrenewal of a grant 
program administrator’s contract); Gallegos v. Lyng, 891 F.2d 788 (10th Cir. 
1989) (upholding the authority of the Department of Agriculture to impose 
by regulation strict liability on states for lost or stolen food stamp 
coupons). Similarly, it was within the discretion of the Environmental 
Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act to prescribe regulations 
making wastewater treatment grants available only for the construction of 
new facilities and not for the acquisition of preexisting facilities. 
Cole County Regional Sewer District v. United States, 22 Cl. Ct. 551 
(1991). See also Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Browner, 
866 F. Supp. 249 (D. Md. 1994) (upholding agency’s enforcement of cut-off 
dates for completion of city’s federally funded sewerage facilities). 
Another illustration is American Hospital Association v. Schweiker, 
721 F.2d 170 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 958 (1984), upholding 
regulations imposing community service and uncompensated care 
requirements on recipients of Hill-Burton hospital construction grants. 

The informal rulemaking requirements (notice and comment) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (APA) do not apply to grant regulations. 
5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2) (the rulemaking requirements do not apply to “a matter 
relating to . . . grants. . .”). Several agencies, however, have published 
statements committing themselves to comply with the APA in developing 
grant regulations and have thereby effectively waived the exemption. See, 
e.g., Thomas Jefferson University v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994); 
Flagstaff Medical Center, Inc. v. Sullivan, 962 F.2d 879, 885 (9th Cir. 1992). 
Even if an agency has voluntarily waived the APA exemption for grants, 
other APA exemptions may still apply. See, e.g., Chief Probation Officers 
of California v. Shalala, 118 F.3d 1327 (9th Cir. 1997) (agency rule was

“Common Rules” 
interpretive, not legislative and, thus, not invalid for failure to follow APA 
rulemaking requirements).38 

Wholly apart from what the courts might or might not do, an agency’s 
discretion in funding matters is subject to congressional oversight as well. 
Congress, if it disfavors an agency’s actual or proposed exercise of 
otherwise legitimate discretion, can statutorily restrict that discretion, at 
least prospectively, either by amending the program legislation or by 
inserting the desired restrictions in appropriation acts. For an example of 
the latter, see B-300912, Feb. 6, 2004 (finding that federally granted rightsof-
way for construction of highways constituted a final rule prohibited 
from taking effect by appropriations act provision). See also B-238997.4, 
Dec. 12, 1990. Also, agency grant regulations may be subject to review by 
GAO and Congress under the Congressional Review Act, Pub. L. 
No. 104-121, title II, subtitle E, § 251, 110 Stat. 847, 868 (Mar. 29, 1996), 
codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 801–808.39 

Federal grants and cooperative agreements are typically subject to a wide 
range of substantive and other requirements under the particular program 
statutes as well as implementing agency regulations and other guidance 
that applies to them. However, they are governed as well by many 
additional cross-cutting requirements that are common to most assistance 
programs. These include federal statutory provisions made applicable to 
recipients of federal funds, such as the prohibitions against lobbying with 
grant funds under the so-called “Byrd Amendment” codified at 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1352.40 They also include a number of administrative requirements 
dealing with such subjects as audit and record-keeping and the allowability 
of costs. The importance of the cross-cutting agency regulations and 
centralized management guidance from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) is apparent throughout this chapter. The current structure 
for these requirements developed in the late 1980s. 

Prior to 1988, each agency issued grant management regulations to govern 
grants and cooperative agreements it made, although OMB Circular

No. A-102 did provide some governmentwide guidance for grants to state 
and local governments. (Another circular, No. A-110, provided some 
guidance for grants to other types of grantees.) In 1987, a memorandum 
from the President directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
to revise Circular No. A-102 to specify uniform, governmentwide terms and 
conditions for grants to state and local governments, and directed 
executive branch departments and agencies to propose and issue common 
regulations adopting these terms and conditions verbatim, modified where 
necessary to reflect inconsistent statutory requirements. 23 Weekly Comp. 
Pres. Doc. 254 (Mar. 12, 1987). The Presidential memorandum observed in 
part: 

“Circular A-102 was a significant step toward the 
simplification of grants management at the time. However, 
after 16 years, some of the provisions are out of date, there 
are gaps where the standards do not cover important areas, 
and agencies have interpreted the circular in numerous 
different ways in their regulations.” 

Id. at 255. Pursuant to this direction, the first iteration of what has come to 
be known as the “common rule” system was published for comment on 
June 9, 1987 (52 Fed. Reg. 21820–21862), issued in final on March 11, 1988 
(53 Fed. Reg. 8033–8103), and generally made effective as of October 1, 
1988. Later that year, OMB proposed a similar revision to Circular 
No. A-110, dealing with grants to institutions of higher education, hospitals, 
and other nonprofit organizations. 53 Fed. Reg. 44710 (Nov. 4, 1988). The 
structure of each circular was similar, featuring a brief introduction 
followed by attachments with detailed guidance on specific topics. 

There are currently a total of six OMB circulars on grants, but only three 
apply to any one type of grantee. Their coverage breaks down as follows:41 

• States, local governments, and Indian Tribes: Circular No. A-87 
(May 10, 2004) for cost principles and Circular No. A-102 (Aug. 29, 
1997) for administrative requirements. 
41 See www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/attach.html (last visited September 15, 2005).

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

• Educational institutions: Circular No. A-21 (May 10, 2004) for cost 
principles and Circular No. A-110 (Sept. 30, 1999) for administrative 
requirements. 
• Nonprofit organizations: Circular No. A-122 (May 10, 2004) for cost 
principles and Circular No. A-110 (Sept. 30, 1999) for administrative 
requirements. 
• All grantees: Circular No. A-133 (June 27, 2003) for audit requirements. 
The OMB circulars provide guidance only to federal grantor agencies; they 
do not apply directly to grantees. Therefore, each grantor agency has 
issued largely identical sets of regulations that prescribe requirements that 
are binding on their grantees. These are technically the so-called “common 
rules.” At present, each grantor agency has a set of four common rules. 
Two of the common rules are based on OMB’s grants management circulars 
covering cost principles, administrative requirements, audit, etc. A third 
common rule deals with the Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment, mentioned 
previously. The fourth common rule, discussed hereafter, deals with 
suspension and debarment and drug-free workplace requirements. 

A compilation showing where each agency’s common rule regulations are 
codified in the Code of Federal Regulations may be found at 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/chart.html(last visited September 15, 
2005). Since the common rule regulations are essentially the same for each 
federal grantor agency, we will use the Department of Agriculture version 
in the remainder of this chapter when citing to and illustrating the 
application of the common rules.42 The Department of Agriculture’s 
regulations are codified as follows: 

• Grants management common rule for states, local governments, and 
Indian tribes, 7 C.F.R. pt. 3016 (2005). 
• Grants management common rule for universities and nonprofit 
organizations, 7 C.F.R. pt. 3019. 
• Nonprocurement suspension and debarment and Drug-Free Workplace 
Act common rule, 7 C.F.R. pt. 3017. 
42 OMB is in the process of consolidating and streamlining its circulars and the common 
rules in title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. See 69 Fed. Reg. 26,276 (May 11, 2004).

• Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment common rule, 7 C.F.R. pt. 3018. 
As noted previously, the common rules establish consistency and 
uniformity among federal agencies in the management of grants and 
cooperative agreements. They were intended to supersede uncodified 
manuals and handbooks unless required by statute or approved by OMB. 
Thus, the Department of Agriculture’s regulations provide at 7 C.F.R. 
§ 3016.5: 

“All other grants administration provisions of codified 
program regulations, program manuals, handbooks and 
other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with 
this part are superseded, except to the extent they are 
required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the 
[OMB] exception provision in § 3016.6.” 

With respect to grants and grantees covered by the common rules, 
additional administrative requirements are to be in the form of codified 
regulations published in the Federal Register. 7 C.F.R. § 3016.6(a). 

As noted above, in addition to implementing OMB’s grants management 
circulars, the common rule format has been used in two other grant-related 
contexts. One implements the Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment, discussed 
previously. The common rule on this subject was issued by 28 grantor 
agencies on February 26, 1990. 55 Fed. Reg. 6736. 

The other common rule implements provisions relating to suspension and 
debarment and drug-free workplaces. On February 18, 1986, as part of the 
government’s effort to combat fraud, waste, and abuse, the President 
signed Executive Order No. 12549, which directed the establishment of a 
system for debarment and suspension in the assistance context.43 OMB 
implemented the executive order by developing common rule language, 
entitled “Government-wide Debarment and Suspension 
(Nonprocurement),” that was adopted by over 25 grantor agencies and 
patterned generally on comparable provisions for procurement contracts in 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation. This common rule was originally 
published at 53 Fed. Reg. 19160 (May 26, 1988). It was revised and 
republished in 2003 in a version that incorporates provisions implementing 

43 Exec. Order No. 12549, Debarment and Suspension, 51 Fed. Reg. 6370 (Feb. 18, 1986).

the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. §§ 701–707).44 68 Fed. 
Reg. 66,534 (Nov. 26, 2003). 

With respect to suspension and debarment, a person (including business 
entities and units of government) who is debarred is excluded from federal 
assistance and benefits, financial and nonfinancial, under federal programs 
and activities for a period of up to 3 years, possibly longer. Causes of 
debarment include certain criminal convictions, antitrust violations, a 
history of unsatisfactory performance, and failure to pay a single 
substantial debt or a number of outstanding debts owed to the federal 
government. See generally 7 C.F.R. pt. 3017, subpart H, for provisions 
relating to debarment. Suspension is a temporary exclusion, usually 
pending the completion of an investigation involving one or more of the 
causes for debarment. See generally 7 C.F.R. pt. 3017, subpart G, for 
provisions relating to suspension. The General Services Administration 
(GSA) is responsible for compiling and distributing a list of debarred or 
suspended persons. The list, now called the Excluded Parties List System, 
is maintained by GSA’s Office of Acquisition Policy and is available 
electronically. See generally 7 C.F.R. pt. 3017, subpart E. 

The Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, 
Pub. L. No. 106-107 (Nov. 20, 1999), 113 Stat. 1486, 31 U.S.C. § 6101 note, 
was enacted to improve the management and performance of federal 
financial assistance programs. The act required federal agencies to 
develop and implement a plan that would, among other things, streamline 
and simplify application, administrative, and reporting procedures for 
financial assistance programs. Pub. L. No. 106-107, § 5(a). It also required 
OMB to direct, coordinate, and assist federal agencies in establishing a 
common application and reporting system that would include uniform 
administrative rules for assistance programs across different federal 
agencies. Id. § 6(a)(1)(C). 

In furtherance of the act’s requirements, OMB is working to consolidate all 
six of its grants-related circulars as well as the agency common rules into a 
new title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. See 69 Fed. Reg. 26,276 
(May 11, 2004). Under this approach, title 2 will include the full text of each 
circular. In their portions of title 2, the grantor agencies will simply adopt 
by reference the text of the OMB circulars together with any agency


44 The provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act dealing specifically with federal grantees 
appear in 41 U.S.C. § 702.

Concept 
specific additions, exceptions, or clarifications. This will avoid the need 
for each individual agency to repeat separately the content of the OMB 
circulars as they now do in their common rules. 69 Fed. Reg. at 26,277. 
OMB began this process by publishing Circular No. A-110 as 2 C.F.R. 
part 215 (2005). It recently added three more circulars: numbers A-21, 
A-87, and A-122. See 70 Fed. Reg. 51,880; 51,910; 51,927 (Aug. 31, 2005). 

Apart from providing for regulatory consolidation and streamlining, the 
Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act contained a 
number of other provisions designed to improve federal assistance 
processes and performance. It also imposed additional responsibilities on 
the agencies and OMB. Section 7 of Public Law 106-107 mandated a GAO 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the act. GAO reported the results of its 
evaluation in Grants Management: Additional Actions Needed to 
Streamline and Simplify Processes, GAO-05-335 (Washington, D.C.: 
Apr. 18, 2005). See also GAO, Federal Assistance: Grant System Continues 
to Be Highly Fragmented, GAO-03-718T (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 29, 2003). 

Finally, to simplify relations between federal grantees and awarding 
agencies, OMB established the “cognizant agency” concept, under which a 
single agency represents all others in dealing with grantees in common 
areas.45 In this case, the cognizant agency reviews and approves grantees’ 
indirect cost rates. Approved rates must be accepted by other agencies, 
unless specific program regulations restrict the recovery of indirect costs. 

OMB published a list of cognizant agency assignments for some state 
agencies, cities and counties on January 6, 1986 (51 Fed. Reg. 552). The 
cognizant agency for governmental units not on that list is the one that 
provides the most grant funds to the entity. The Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) is the cognizant agency for all States and most 
cities. The cognizant agency for other organizations is determined by 
calculating which federal agency provides the most grant funding. For 
example, the Department of the Interior is the cognizant agency for all 
Indian tribal governments, and for hospitals, HHS serves as the cognizant 
agency.

4. Contracting by 
Grantees 
Grantees commonly enter into contracts with third parties in the course of 
performing their grants. While the United States is not a party to the 
contracts, the grantee must nevertheless comply with any requirements 
imposed by statute, regulation, or the terms of the grant agreement, in 
awarding federally assisted contracts. 54 Comp. Gen. 6 (1974). Violation of 
applicable procurement standards may result in the loss of federal funding. 
See Town of Fallsburg v. United States, 22 Cl. Ct. 633 (1991). 

For a period of nearly 10 years, GAO undertook a limited review of the 
propriety of contract awards made by a grantee in furtherance of grant 
purposes, upon request of a prospective contractor. This limited review 
role was announced in 40 Fed. Reg. 42406 (Sept. 12, 1975). (While these 
reviews were conducted in a manner similar to bid protests, mentioned 
previously in section B.4 of this chapter, GAO called the requests for review 
“complaints” rather than “protests.”) GAO applied the same limited review 
to contracts awarded under cooperative agreements. 59 Comp. Gen. 758 
(1980). 

GAO’s review was designed primarily to ensure that the “basic principles” 
of competitive bidding were applied. 55 Comp. Gen. 390, 393 (1975). 
Numerous decisions were rendered in this area. E.g., 57 Comp. Gen. 85 
(1977) (nonapplicability of Buy American Act); 55 Comp. Gen. 1254 (1976) 
(state law applicable when indicated in grant); 55 Comp. Gen. 413 (1975) 
(nonapplicability of Federal Procurement Regulations). 

By 1985, many agencies had developed their own review procedures, and 
the number of complaints filed with GAO steadily decreased. Determining 
that its review of grantee contracting was no longer needed, GAO 
discontinued its limited review in January 1985. 50 Fed. Reg. 3978 (Jan. 29, 
1985); 64 Comp. Gen. 243 (1985). The body of decisions issued during the 
1975–1985 period should nevertheless remain useful as guidance in this 
area. 

In a 1980 report, GAO reviewed the procurement procedures of selected 
state and local government grantees and nonprofit organizations in five 
states. The report concluded that the state and local governments 
generally had in place and followed sound procurement procedures 
(somewhat less so for the nonprofits), but also found a number of weak 
spots, many of which are now addressed in OMB directives. See GAO, 
Spending Grant Funds More Efficiently Could Save Millions, PSAD-80-58 
(Washington, D.C.: June 30, 1980). 

Page 10-53 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

With respect to state and local governments, standards for grantee 
procurement are set forth in the common rules. Using our Department of 
Agriculture example, its version of this rule is 7 C.F.R. § 3016.36. These 
rules require, among other things, that grantees and subgrantees have 
protest procedures to resolve disputes over their procurements. Id. 
§ 3016.36(b)(12). Federal grantor agencies review protests against grantee 
and subgrantee awards that involve violations of federal law or regulations 
(including the procurement standards in the common rules) or of the 
grantee’s or subgrantee’s protest procedures. Id. Grantor agencies are 
authorized, but not required, to review grantee/subgrantee procurements 
on other grounds. See Supplementary Information Statement, 53 Fed. 
Reg. 8034, 8039 (Mar. 11, 1988). 

An agency that has a review procedure for grantee procurement will be 
held to established precepts of administrative law in applying those 
procedures. For example, in Niro Atomizer, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F. Supp. 1212 

(S.D. Fla. 1988), the court instructed the agency to either follow its 
established procedures or announce that it was changing them, giving the 
parties notice and an opportunity to rebut. However, the court in 
A-G-E Corp. v. United States, 968 F.2d 650 (8th Cir. 1992), rejected a 
challenge that the common rules did not go far enough in regulating 
grantee procurements. The plaintiffs objected to a provision then in the 
common rules that permitted state grantees to apply resident preferences 
to their procurements.46 The court viewed the common rules as embodying 
internal executive branch management directives and held that the 
plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge them absent a showing that they 
were inconsistent with federal law. 
5. Liability for Acts of 
Grantees 
It is often said that the federal government is not liable for the unauthorized 
acts of its agents, “agents” in this context referring to the government’s own 
officers and employees. If this is true with respect to those who clearly are 
agents of the government, it logically must apply with even greater force to 
those who are not its agents. Grantees, for purpose of imposing legal 

46 The current version of the rule, 7 C.F.R. § 3016.36(c)(2), provides generally that: 

“Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner that 
prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-State or local 
geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in 
those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or 
encourage geographic preference.”

Agreements 

a. Liability to Grantee’s 
Contractors 
liability on the United States, are not “agents” of the government. While the 
demarcation is not perfect, we divide our discussion into two broad areas, 
contractual liability and liability for grantee misconduct. 

For the United States to be contractually liable to some other party, there 
must be “privity of contract,” that is, a direct contractual relationship 
between the parties. When a grantee under a federal grant enters into a 
contract with a third party (contractor), there is privity between the United 
States and the grantee, and privity between the grantee and the contractor, 
but no privity between the United States and the contractor and hence, as a 
general proposition, no liability. 

Perhaps the leading case in this area is D.R. Smalley & Sons, Inc. v. United 
States, 372 F.2d 505 (Ct. Cl.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 835 (1967). The plaintiff 
contractor had entered into a highway construction contract with the state 
of Ohio. The project was funded on a cost-sharing basis, with 90 percent of 
total costs to come from federal-aid highway funds. The contractor lost 
nearly $3 million on the project, recovered part of its loss from the state of 
Ohio, and then sued the United States to recover the unpaid balance. The 
contractor argued that Ohio was really the agent of the United States for 
purposes of the project because, among other things, the contract had been 
drafted pursuant to federal regulations, the United States approved the 
contract and all changes, and the United States was funding 90 percent of 
the costs. 

The court disagreed. Since there was no privity of contract between the 
United States and the contractor, the government was not liable. The 
involvement of the government in various aspects of the project did not 
make the state the agent of the federal government for purpose of creating 
contractual liability, express or implied. The court stated: 

“The National Government makes many hundreds of grants 
each year to the various states, to municipalities, to schools 
and colleges and to other public organizations and agencies 
for many kinds of public works, including roads and 
highways. It requires the projects to be completed in 
accordance with certain standards before the proceeds of 
the grant will be paid. Otherwise the will of Congress would 
be thwarted and taxpayers’ money would be wasted. . . . It 
would be farfetched indeed to impose liability on the 
Government for the acts and omissions of the parties who 
contract to build the projects, simply because it requires the 

Page 10-55 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

work to meet certain standards and upon approval thereof 
reimburses the public agency for the part of the costs.” 

Id. at 507. Some later cases applying the Smalley concept are Malone v. 
United States, 34 Fed. Cl. 257 (1995); Blaze Construction, Inc. v. United 
States, 27 Fed. Cl. 646 (1993); Somerville Technical Services, Inc. v. United 
States, 640 F.2d 1276 (Ct. Cl. 1981); Housing Corporation of America v. 
United States, 468 F.2d 922 (Ct. Cl. 1972); Cofan Associates, Inc. v. United 
States, 4 Cl. Ct. 85 (1983); 68 Comp. Gen. 494 (1989). 

The Cofan case presented an interesting variation in that the claimant was 
a disappointed bidder rather than a contractor, trying to recover under the 
theory, well-established in the law of procurement contracts, that there is 
an implied promise on the part of the government to fairly consider all bids. 
This did not help the plaintiff, however, since again there was no privity 
with the government. In this regard, the court observed: 

“[I]t is now firmly established that a person who enters into 
a contract with [a grantee] to perform services on a project 
funded in part by loans or grants-in-aid from the United 
States may not thereby be deemed to have entered into a 
contract with the United States. Nor is the result any 
different because the United States has imposed guidelines 
or restrictions on the use of funds, including procurement 
procedures.” 

4 Cl. Ct. at 86. See also Pendleton v. United States, 47 Fed. Cl. 480 (2000) 
(federal participation in state reclamation project was not sufficient to 
support plaintiffs’ claim for compensable Fifth Amendment taking against 
the United States). 

Another variation occurred in 47 Comp. Gen. 756 (1968). A contractor had 
succeeded in recovering increased costs from a state grantee. Under 
Smalley, it was clear that the government could not be held legally liable 
for the proportionate share of the recovery. However, it was apparent that 
the increased costs were due to the fact that erroneous soil profile 
information furnished by the state had contributed to an unrealistically low 
bid by the contractor. Under these circumstances, GAO advised that the 
grantor agency and the state could enter into a voluntary modification of 
the grant agreement to recognize the damage recovery as a project cost. 
See also B-167310, July 31, 1969. 

Page 10-56 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

In limited circumstances, there is a device that may be available to a 
contractor to have its claim considered by the federal government, 
illustrated by B-181332, Dec. 28, 1976.47 In that case, an agency had 
erroneously refused to fund a grant after it had been approved and the 
grantee’s contractor had incurred expenses in reliance on the approval. 
There clearly was no privity between the contractor and the United States. 
However, GAO recognized a procedural device drawn from the law of 
procurement contracts, and accepted a claim filed by the grantee (with 
whom the United States did have privity) “for and on behalf of” the 
contractor, in which the grantee acknowledged liability to the contractor 
only if and to the extent that the government was liable to the grantee. In 
effect, the contractor was prosecuting the claim in the name of the grantee. 
This device is potentially useful only where the government’s liability to the 
grantee can be established. See also 68 Comp. Gen. 494, 495–96 (1989); 
9 Comp. Gen. 175 (1929). A different type of contract, an employment 
contract, was the subject of 66 Comp. Gen. 604 (1987), in which GAO 
concluded, applying Smalley, that the United States was not liable to a 
former employee of a grantee for unpaid salary. The grantor agency had 
funded all allowable costs under the grant, and the grantee’s transgression 
was not the liability of the United States. 

As if to provide the adage that anything that can happen will happen, a 1983 
case combined all of the elements noted above. The Agency for 
International Development (AID) made a rural development planning grant 
to Bolivia. Bolivia contracted with a private American company to perform 
certain functions under the grant, and the company in turn entered into 
employment contacts with various individuals. The contract with the 
private company (but not the grant itself) was terminated, the company 
terminated the employment contracts, and the individuals then sought to 
recover benefits provided under Bolivian law. Clearly, AID was not legally 
liable to the individual claimants. However, some of the benefits to some of 
the claimants could qualify as allowable costs under the grant and could be 
paid, if approved by AID and the grantee, to the extent grant funds 
remained available. B-209649, Dec. 23, 1983. 

47 This decision and others described here arose under GAO’s former statutory authority to 
settle claims by or against the United States. This authority has been transferred from GAO 
to executive branch agencies. See notes following 31 U.S.C. § 3702. However, the 
principles stated in the decisions remain relevant.

Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

b. Liability for Grantee 
Misconduct 
A number of cases have involved attempts to impose liability on the United 
States under the Federal Tort Claims Act.48 The act makes the United 
States liable, with various exceptions, for the tortious conduct of its 
officers, employees, or agents acting within the scope of their employment. 
As a general proposition, a grantee is not an agent or agency of the 
government for purposes of tort liability. 

An important Supreme Court case is United States v. Orleans, 425 U.S. 807 
(1976), holding that a community action agency funded under a federal 
grant was not a “federal agency” for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims 
Act. The case arose from a motor vehicle accident involving plaintiff 
Orleans and an individual acting on behalf of the grantee. The Court first 
noted that the Federal Tort Claims Act “was never intended, and has not 
been construed by this Court, to reach employees or agents of all federally 
funded programs that confer benefits on people.” Orleans, 425 U.S. at 813. 
The Court then stated, and answered, the controlling test: 

“[T]he question here is not whether the [grantee] receives 
federal money and must comply with federal standards and 
regulations, but whether its day-to-day operations are 
supervised by the Federal Government. 

* * * * * 

“The Federal Government in no sense controls ‘the detailed 
physical performance’ of all the programs and projects it 
finances by gifts, grants, contracts, or loans.” 

Id. at 815–16. 

Thus, the general rule is that the United States is not liable for torts 
committed by its grantees. Neither the fact of federal funding nor the 
degree of federal involvement encountered in the typical grant (approval, 
oversight, inspections, etc.) is sufficient to make the grantee an agent of the 
United States of purposes of tort liability. Liability could result, however, if 
the federal involvement reached the level of detailed supervision of day-today 
operations noted in Orleans. An example is Martarano v. United 
States, 231 F. Supp. 805 (D. Nev. 1964) (state employee under cooperative 

48 The act’s principal provisions are found at 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671–2680.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

agreement working under direct control and supervision of federal 
agency). 

In another group of cases, attempts have been made to find the United 
States liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for allegedly negligent 
performance of its oversight role under a grant. The courts have found 
these claims covered by the “discretionary function” exception to Federal 
Tort Claims Act liability.49 Mahler v. United States, 306 F.2d 713 (3rd Cir.), 
cert. denied, 371 U.S. 923 (1962), followed in Daniel v. United States, 
426 F.2d 281 (5th Cir. 1970), and Rayford v. United States, 410 F. Supp. 1051 

(M.D. Tenn. 1976). See also Rothrock v. United States, 883 F. Supp. 333 
(S.D.Ind. 1994), aff’d, 62 F.3d 196 (7th Cir. 1995). 
In areas not covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act, the potential for 
individual liability cannot be disregarded. One such area is the so-called 
“constitutional tort,” or an action for damages based on an alleged violation 
of federal constitutional rights perpetrated under color of law. For 
example, an official of the Indian Health Service, acting jointly with a state 
official, told a nonprofit intermediary that further funding would be 
conditioned on the dismissal of an employee whom they thought was 
performing inadequately. The intermediary fired the employee, who then 
sued the state official and the federal official in their individual capacities. 
The suit against the federal defendant was based directly on the Fifth 
Amendment, for deprivation of a property interest (the plaintiff's job) 
without due process. The court first found that there had been a due 
process violation, and that the defendants were not entitled to qualified 
immunity because their conduct exceeded the scope of their authority. 
Merritt v. Mackey, 827 F.2d 1368 (9th Cir. 1987). The court noted that there 
was no basis for imposing liability on the United States. Id. at 1373–74. In 
the second published appellate decision in the case, the court affirmed a 
monetary damage award and an award of attorney’s fees against the 
individual officials. The federal official was personally liable for the fee 

49 The discretionary function exception excludes from the act’s coverage— 

“[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the 
Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, 
whether or not such statute or regulation be valid, or based upon the exercise 
or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function 
or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, 
whether or not the discretion involved be abused.” 

28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).

award under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 because he had acted in concert with a state 
official. Merritt v. Mackey, 932 F.2d 1317 (9th Cir. 1991). See also 
Downey v. Coalition Against Rape and Abuse, Inc., 143 F. Supp. 2d 423 

(D.N.J.2001), applying reasoning similar to Merritt in the context of a 
state-funded grant. 
However, the law concerning constitutional torts is unsettled. The concept 
of constitutional torts originated with Bivens v. Six Unknown Named 
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), and has 
been applied in many subsequent cases dealing with a range of 
constitutional rights. Recently, however, the Supreme Court has taken a 
narrow view of this concept. Of particular relevance here, the Supreme 
Court held in Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61 (2001), 
that a prisoner could not maintain a constitutional tort action against a 
private organization that operated a detention facility under a federal 
contract. The Court indicated that constitutional tort actions under Bivens 
can be maintained only against individual federal officers or employees; 
thus, such actions do not lie against “private entities acting under color of 
federal law” nor do they lie against federal agencies. Malesko, 534 U.S. 
at 66–74. 

In light of Malesko, it is unclear whether cases like Merritt v. Mackey, 
supra, would be decided the same way today. Malesko suggests that, as a 
general proposition, federal contractors and grantees and their employees 
would not be subject to liability for constitutional torts. Likewise, federal 
agencies would not have constitutional tort liability. It is possible that 
individual federal employees (like the one in Merritt) could still be held 
liable for inducing a grantee to violate someone’s constitutional rights. 
However, it is questionable whether a court would impose tort liability on a 
federal employee who induced a violation if the party who actually 
committed the violation could not be liable. For additional background on 
this subject, see Michael B. Hedrick, New Life for a Good Idea: 
Revitalizing Efforts to Replace the Bivens Action with a Statutory Waiver 
of the Sovereign Immunity of the United States for Constitutional Tort 
Suits, 71 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1055 (2003).

grant is a grant given to a governmental unit, usually a state, to be used for 
a variety of activities within a broad functional area.50 Block grants are 
usually formula grants. Under a block grant, the state is responsible for 
further distribution of the money. States naturally prefer block grants 
because they increase the states’ spending flexibility and at least in theory 
reduce federal control. See generally Library of Congress, Congressional 
Research Service, Federal Grants to State and Local Governments: 
Overview and Characteristics, No. RS20669 (Nov. 27, 2002), at 3–5; GAO, 
Grant Programs: Design Features Shape Flexibility, Accountability, and 
Performance Information, GAO/GGD-98-137 (Washington, D.C.: June 22, 
1998), at 3 (“In practice, the ‘categorical’ and ‘block’ grant labels and their 
underlying definitions represent the ends of a continuum and overlap 
considerably in its middle range.”). 

During the 1960s and 1970s, although some block grant programs were in 
existence, the emphasis was largely on categorical grants. The Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA), Pub. L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 357 
(Aug. 13, 1981), attempted to put a halt to this trend. See Library of 
Congress, Congressional Research Service, Federal Grants to State and 
Local Governments: A Brief History, No. RL30705 (Feb. 19, 2003), at 10. 
The act merged and consolidated several dozen categorical grant programs 
into block grants. GAO, Block Grants: Characteristics, Experience, and 
Lessons Learned, GAO/HEHS-95-74 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 9, 1995), 
at 7–9, App. II. 

In the mid-1990s, GAO cited the fiscal year 1996 budget resolution in 
reporting that Congress had “shown a strong interest in consolidating 
narrowly defined categorical grant programs for specific purposes into 
broader purpose block grants.” GAO, Block Grants: Issues in Designing 
Accountability Provisions, GAO/AIMD-95-226 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 1, 
1995), at 1. In 2003, however, GAO testified that, although Congress had 
made further efforts to consolidate categorical grant programs over the 
years, “each period of consolidation was followed by a proliferation of new 
federal programs.” GAO, Federal Assistance: Grant System Continues to 
Be Highly Fragmented, GAO-03-718T (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 29, 2003), 
at 4. 

50 These distinctions are discussed under the definition of “Grant” in GAO, A Glossary of 
Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, GAO-05-734SP (Washington, D.C.: September 
2005), at 60–61.

Although GAO could still report in 2003 that block grants were “one way 
Congress has chosen to consolidate related programs,” GAO also reported 
on certain “hybrid” approaches, including “consolidated categorical” 
grants, that would consolidate a number of narrower categorical programs 
while retaining standards and accountability for discrete federal 
performance goals, and “Performance Partnership Agreements,” in which 
states can shift federal funds across programs but are held accountable for 
discrete or negotiated measures of performance. GAO-03-718T, at 15; GAO,

Outstanding Needs, GAO-03-1146T (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 3, 2003), 
at 11–13.51 

Block grants reduce federal involvement in that they transfer much of the 
decision-making to the grantee and reduce the number of separate grants 
that must be administered by the federal government. It is a 
misconception, however, to think that block grants are “free money” in the 
sense of being totally free from federal “strings.” See, e.g., GAO/HEHS-9574, 
at App. III, “Accountability Requirements of 1981 Block Grants.” 

Restrictions on the use of block grant funds may derive from the organic 
legislation itself. For example, several of the OBRA programs include such 
items as limitations on allowable administrative expenses, prohibitions on 
the use of funds to purchase land or construct buildings, “maintenance of 
effort” provisions, and anti-discrimination provisions. Other OBRA 
provisions of general applicability (Pub. L. No. 97-35, §§ 1741–1745) impose 
reporting and auditing requirements, and require states to conduct public 
hearings as a prerequisite to receiving funds in any fiscal year. Another 
more recent example is the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
(TANF) block grants, for which Congress established time limits and work 
requirements for adults receiving aid. GAO, Welfare Reform: With TANF

Flexibility, States Vary in How They Implement Work Requirements and 
Time Limits, GAO-02-770 (Washington, D.C.: July 5, 2002) at 3. 

Applicable restrictions are not limited to those contained in the program 
statute itself. Other federal statutes applicable to the use of grant funds 
must also be followed. See, e.g., Ely v. Velde, 451 F.2d 1130 (4th Cir. 1971), 
holding that the National Historic Preservation Act and the National 
Environmental Policy Act applied to the then Law Enforcement Assistance 
Administration in making a block grant to Virginia under the Safe Streets 
Act. A later and related decision in the same case is 497 F.2d 252 (4th Cir. 
1974). See also Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights v. Rumsfeld, 
390 F.3d 219 (3rd Cir. 2004), cert. granted, 125 S. Ct. 1977 (2005) (reviewing 
statute withholding funding to educational institutions that deny U.S. 
military access to campus for recruiting purposes); Barbour v. Washington 
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 374 F.3d 1161 (D.C. Cir. 2004), cert. 
denied, 125 S. Ct. 1591 (2005) (public transit authority’s acceptance of 
federal grant funds resulted in a waiver of its immunity to a Rehabilitation 
Act claim); Maryland Department of Human Resources v. United States 
Department of Health & Human Services, 854 F.2d 40 (4th Cir. 1988) 
(requirement for apportionment by Office of Management and Budget 
applicable to funds under Social Services Block Grant); 6 Op. Off. Legal 
Counsel 605 (1982) (Uniform Relocation Assistance Act applicable to 
Community Development block grant); 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 83 (1982) 
(various antidiscrimination statutes applicable to Elementary and 
Secondary Education and Social Services block grants). 

If applicable, these additional restrictions may impose legal responsibilities 
on grantees. See, e.g., GAO, Native American Housing: Information on 
HUD’s Housing Programs for Native Americans, GAO/RCED-97-64, 
(Washington, D.C.: Mar. 28, 1997), at 14 (Indian hiring preference and 
Davis-Bacon Act). Thus the block grant mechanism does not totally 
remove federal involvement nor does it permit the circumvention of federal 
laws applicable to the use of grant funds. In this latter respect, a block 
grant is legally no different from a categorical grant. 

The common rule for uniform administrative requirements does not apply 
to the OBRA block grants. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. § 3016.4(a)(2). 

7. The Single Audit Act We noted in our introduction to this chapter that federal grants to state and 
local governments exceed $400 billion a year. With expenditures of this 
magnitude, it is essential that there be some way to assure accountability 
Page 10-63 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

on the part of the grantees. The traditional means of assuring 
accountability has been the audit. 

Prior to 1984, there were no statutory uniform audit requirements for state 
and local government grantees. Audits were performed on a grant or 
program basis and requirements varied with the program legislation. 
Under this system, gaps in audit coverage resulted because some entities 
were audited infrequently or not at all. Also, overlapping requirements 
produced duplication and inefficiency with multiple audit teams visiting 
the same entity and reviewing the same financial records. Congress 
addressed the problem by enacting the Single Audit Act of 1984, Pub. L. 
No. 98-502, 98 Stat. 2327 (Oct. 19, 1984), codified at 31 U.S.C. §§ 7501– 
7507.52 

The 1984 act’s objectives were to improve the financial management of 
state and local governments receiving federal financial assistance; 
establish uniform requirements for audits of federal financial assistance 
provided to state and local governments; promote the efficient and 
effective use of audit resources; and ensure that federal departments and 
agencies, to the extent practicable, rely upon and use audit work done 
pursuant to the act. Pub. L. No. 98-502, § 1(b). The 1984 act required each 
state and local entity that that received $100,000 or more in federal 
financial assistance (either directly from a federal agency or indirectly 
through another state or local entity) in any fiscal year to undergo a 
comprehensive, single audit of its financial operations. The 1984 act also 
required entities receiving between $25,000 and $100,000 in federal 
financial assistance to have either a single audit or a financial audit 
required by the programs that provided the federal funds.53 An informative 
discussion of the need for the 1984 legislation, with references to several

53 State and local entities receiving less than $25,000 in federal funds in any fiscal year were 
not required to have a financial audit.

reports by GAO and the Joint Financial Management Improvement 
Program (JFMIP),54 may be found in H.R. Rep. No. 98-708 (1984). 

In 1996, the Single Audit Act of 1984 underwent a major overhaul. Prior to 
1996, state and local governments followed one set of audit requirements 
and Indian tribes and nonprofit organizations, including educational 
institutions, followed another. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 199655 
established uniform requirements for audits of federal awards56 
administered by all nonfederal entities, not just state and local 
governments. In addition, the 1996 amendments, in order to reduce any 
burdens on nonfederal entities and to promote the efficient and effective 
use of audit resources, increased the dollar threshold needed to trigger an 
audit and based the audit requirement on an amount expended rather than 
on an amount received. 

As a result, any nonfederal entity, defined as a state, local government, or 
nonprofit organization, that expends federal awards equal to or in excess of 
$500,00057 in any fiscal year shall have either a single audit or a programspecific 
audit for such fiscal year. Audits are conducted annually. 
However, biennial audits are permissible for state and local governments 
that are required by their constitution or by a statute, in effect on January 1, 

54 On December 1, 2004, the principals of the JFMIP (GAO, Department of Treasury, Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), and Office of Personnel Management) signed an 
agreement that reassigned responsibility for financial management policy and oversight 
effectively eliminating JFMIP as a stand-alone organization. OMB issued a memorandum on 
December 2, 2004, that discusses in detail the changes to JFMIP’s role, the transfer of 
JFMIP’s Project Management Office to the CFO Council, the creation of a new Financial 
Systems Integration Committee of the CFO Council, and other transition issues. OMB,

56 Federal awards include federal cost-reimbursement contracts, grants, loans, loan 
guarantees, property, cooperative agreements, interest subsidies, insurance, food 
commodities, direct appropriations, or other assistance, but does not include amounts 
received as reimbursement for services rendered to individuals. 31 U.S.C. § 7501(a)(4), (5). 

57 Every 2 years, the Director of OMB shall review the dollar threshold amount for requiring 
the audits and may adjust the dollar amount consistent with the purposes of the Single Audit 
Act, as amended. 31 U.S.C. § 7502(a)(3). In 2004, OMB adjusted the dollar threshold to 
$500,000. For fiscal years ending on or before December 30, 2003, the threshold is $300,000.

1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. Also any nonprofit 
organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending 
between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is also permitted to undergo its 
audits biennially. 

The audit is to be conducted by an independent auditor in accordance with 
generally accepted government auditing standards. 31 U.S.C. § 7502(c). 
These standards are found in GAO’s publication Government Auditing 
Standards,58 commonly known as the “Yellow Book.” The Director of 
OMB, after consultation with the Comptroller General, and appropriate 
officials from federal, state, and local governments and nonprofit 
organizations, is required to prescribe guidance to implement the Single 
Audit Act, as amended. 31 U.S.C. § 7505(a). Guidance for implementing 
the act can be found in OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits of States, Local 
Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations (June 27, 2003).59 

The annual audit shall either cover the operations of the entire nonfederal 
entity or include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and 
other organizational units as long as the audit encompasses the financial 
statements and schedule of expenditures of the federal awards for each 
unit. 31 U.S.C. § 7502(d). If the nonfederal entity expends federal awards 
only under one program and is not required otherwise to receive a financial 
statement audit, it may elect to have a program-specific audit. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 7502(a)(1)(C). Performance audits60 are not required except as 
authorized by the Director. 31 U.S.C. §7502(c). 

The statute (31 U.S.C. § 7502(e)) requires the auditor to: 

• determine whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all 
material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles; 
58 GAO, Government Auditing Standards, GAO-03-673G (Washington, D.C.: June 2003). 

59 In March 2004, OMB issued a Compliance Supplement to Circular No. A-133. The 
supplement can be found at 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133_compliance/04/04toc.html (last visited 
September 15, 2005). 

60 Performance audits encompass a wide variety of objectives, including objectives related 
to assessing program effectiveness and results; economy and efficiency; internal control; 
and compliance with legal or other requirements and are described in more detail in 
Chapter 2 of the Government Auditing Standards, GAO-03-673G.

Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

• determine whether the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is 
presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the financial 
statements taken as a whole; 
• with respect to internal controls pertaining to the compliance 
requirements for each major program, 
• obtain an understanding of such internal controls; 
• assess control risk; and 
• perform tests of controls unless the controls are deemed o be 
ineffective; and 
• determine whether the nonfederal entity has complied with the 
provisions of laws, regulations, and contracts or grants pertaining to 
federal awards that have a direct and material effect on each major 
program. (“Major programs” are defined in 31 U.S.C. § 7501(a)(12)). 
If the audit discloses any audit findings, the nonfederal entity needs to 
prepare a corrective action plan to eliminate the audit findings or a 
statement explaining why corrective action is not necessary. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 7502(i). The corrective action plan needs to be consistent with the audit 
resolution standard promulgated by the Comptroller General as part of the 
standards for internal controls in the federal government61 pursuant to 
31 U.S.C. § 3512(c). The federal agency that provided the federal award 
needs to review the audit to determine whether prompt and corrective 
action has been taken regarding the audit findings. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 7502(f)(1)(B). 

GAO has reported over the last few years that more action is needed at 
both the nonfederal and federal level to ensure that audit findings are 
responded to, corrected, and tracked. See, e.g., GAO, Single Audit: 
Actions Needed to Ensure That Findings Are Corrected, GAO-02-705 
(Washington, D.C.: June 26, 2002); Single Audit: Single Audit Act

The nonfederal entity is required to transmit a reporting package, which 
shall include the financial statements, auditor opinion, and corrective 
action plan, if necessary, to a federal clearinghouse for public inspection. 
31 U.S.C. § 7502(h),(i). Report packages can be viewed by going to the 
Federal Audit Clearinghouse Home Page at http://harvester.census.gov/sac 
(last visited September 15, 2005). 

OMB’s guidance in Circular No. A-133 includes criteria for determining the 
appropriate charges to federal awards for the cost of audits. Section 230 of 
the Circular provides that, unless prohibited by law, the costs of audits are 
allowable charges to the federal awards. The charges may be considered a 
direct cost or an allocated indirect cost, as determined in accordance with 
the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. pts. 30 and 31), or other applicable cost 
principles or regulations. 

Audits conducted under the Single Audit Act, as amended, are in lieu of any 
other financial audit required by the nonfederal entity by any other federal 
law or regulation. 31 U.S.C. § 7503(a). However, that does not prohibit a 
federal agency from conducting or arranging for its own audit of the federal 
award if necessary to carry out the federal agency’s responsibilities under a 
federal law or regulation; it only requires that the federal agency pay for the 
cost of such an audit. 31 U.S.C. § 7503(b), (e). 

The law also requires the Comptroller General to monitor provisions in 
bills and resolutions reported by the committees of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives that require financial audits of nonfederal 
entities that receive federal awards, and report to the appropriate 
congressional committees any such provisions that are inconsistent with 
the Single Audit Act, as amended. 31 U.S.C. § 7506. 

Expenditures by grantees for grant purposes are not subject to all the same 

D. Funds in Hands of 
restrictions and limitations imposed on direct expenditures by the federal

Grantee: Status and 

government. For this reason, grant funds in the hands of a grantee haveApplication of been said to largely lose their character and identity as federal funds. The 
Comptroller General stated the principle as follows: 

Appropriation 
Restrictions 


Page 10-68 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

“It consistently has been held with reference to Federal 
grant funds that, when such funds are granted to and 
accepted by the grantee, the expenditure of such funds by 
the grantee for the purposes and objects for which made [is] 
not subject to the various restrictions and limitations 
imposed by Federal statute or our decisions with respect to 
the expenditure, by Federal departments and 
establishments, of appropriated moneys in the absence of a 
condition of the grant specifically providing to the contrary.” 

43 Comp. Gen. 697, 699 (1964). Thus, except as otherwise provided in the 
program statute, regulations,62 or the grant agreement, the expenditure of 
grant funds by a state government grantee is subject to the applicable laws 
of that state rather than federal laws applicable to direct expenditures by 
federal agencies. 16 Comp. Gen. 948 (1937). The rule applies “with equal if 
not greater force” when the grantee is another sovereign nation. B-80351, 
Sept. 30, 1948. 

One group of cases63 involves restrictions on employee compensation and 
related payments. Examples are: 

• Appropriation act provision prohibiting use of federal funds to pay 
salaries of persons engaging in a strike against the United States 
Government, did not apply to funds granted to states to assist in 
enforcing Fair Labor Standards Act64 and Walsh-Healey Public 
Contracts Act.65 The funds were not “salaries” as such; they were grant 
funds to reimburse states for services of state employees, and therefore 
were state rather than federal funds. 28 Comp. Gen. 54 (1948). See also 
39 Comp. Gen. 873 (1960). 
62 These regulations include, of course, Office of Management and Budget circulars and the 
common rules that implement them. As discussed in many other portions of this chapter, 
the circulars and the common rules impose a number of restrictions on a grantee’s use of 
funds. 

63 Some of the decisions cited may involve statutory restrictions on federal expenditures 
that have been changed or repealed since the decisions were issued. The cases are cited 
solely to illustrate the application of the grant rule and thus remain valid to that extent. 

64 Act of June 25, 1938, ch. 676, 52 Stat. 1066.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

• Requirement for specific authorizing legislation to use public funds to 
pay employer contributions for federal employee’s health and life 
insurance benefits does not apply to use of federal grant funds to 
contribute to state group health and life insurance programs for state 
employees. 36 Comp. Gen. 221 (1956). 
• Restrictions on retired pay not applicable to retired military officers 
working on grant-funded state project. 14 Comp. Gen. 916 (1935), 
modified on other grounds, 36 Comp. Gen. 84 (1956). 
• Federal restrictions on dual compensation for federal employees are 
inapplicable to grantee employees. B-153417, Feb. 17, 1964. 
The rule has been applied in a variety of other contexts as well. One 
example is the area of state and local taxes. Thus, federal immunity from 
payment of certain sales taxes does not apply to a state grantee since the 
grantee is not a federal agent. The grant funds lose their federal character 
and become state funds. Therefore, the state grantee may pay a state sales 
tax on purchases made with federal grant funds if the tax applies equally to 
purchases made from all nonfederal funds. 37 Comp. Gen. 85 (1957). See 
also B-177215, Nov. 30, 1972, applying the same reasoning for purchases 
made by a contractor who was funded by a federal grantee. Similarly, a 
state tax on the income of a person paid from federal grant funds involves 
no question of federal tax immunity. 14 Comp. Gen. 869 (1935). 

The following is a sampling of other restrictions which have been found 
inapplicable to grantee expenditures: 

• Adequacy of Appropriations Act (41 U.S.C. § 11) and prohibition on 
entering into contracts for construction or repair of public buildings, or 
other public improvements, in excess of amount specifically 
appropriated for that purpose (41 U.S.C. § 12). B-173589, Sept. 30, 1971. 
• Prohibition in 31 U.S.C. § 1343 on purchasing aircraft without specific 
statutory authority. 43 Comp. Gen. 697 (1964) (permissible for grantee 
under National Science Foundation research grant). See also B-196690, 
Mar. 14, 1980 (purchase of motor vehicle). However, an agency may not 
acquire excess aircraft or passenger vehicles by transfer for use by its 
grantees. 55 Comp. Gen. 348 (1975). 
• Prohibition in 31 U.S.C. § 1345 on payment of nonfederal person’s travel 
and lodging expenses to attend a meeting. 55 Comp. Gen. 750 (1976). 
Page 10-70 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

• Requirement for specific authority in order to establish a revolving 
fund. (Federal agency would need specific authority in view of 
31 U.S.C. § 3302(b)). 44 Comp. Gen. 87(1964). 
Where assistance funds are provided to the District of Columbia under a 
program of assistance to the states which defines “state” as including the 
District of Columbia, statutory restrictions expressly applicable to the 
District of Columbia remain applicable with respect to the assistance funds 
even though they would not necessarily apply to the assistance funds in the 
hands of the other states. 34 Comp. Gen. 593 (1955); 17 Comp. Gen. 424 
(1937); A-90515, Dec. 23, 1937. 

When applying the general rule that grantee expenditures are not subject to 
the same restrictions as direct federal expenditures, it is important to keep 
in mind that grantees are, of course, obligated to spend grant funds for the 
purposes and objectives of the grant and consistent with any statutory or 
other conditions attached to the use of the grant funds. See, e.g., B-303927, 
June 7, 2005; 42 Comp. Gen. 682 (1963); 2 Comp. Gen. 684 (1923). These 
conditions may include implied requirements, such as the implied 
requirement to adhere to “basic principles” of open and competitive 
bidding in the case of grantee contracts. 55 Comp. Gen. 390 (1975). They 
also include statutorily authorized requirements, as in the case of the Office 
of Personnel Management’s authority to establish merit standards for 
grantees under 42 U.S.C. § 4728(b) (Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 
1970). Statutory restrictions on lobbying with public funds may also apply 
to grantee expenditures. 

Grant recipients, because they receive federal government assistance, must 
comply with several federal statutes that prohibit various types of 
discrimination. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d) 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin under 
any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. The 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 794) similarly prohibits 
discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The Age 
Discrimination Act of 1975 further extends prohibited discrimination 
(42 U.S.C. § 6102). 

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. § 1681) prohibits 
sex discrimination in education programs or activities receiving federal 
financial assistance. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
§ 2000e-2) prohibits employment discrimination by grantees on the basis of 
sex as well as race, color, religion, or national origin for all employers who 

Page 10-71 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

have 15 or more employees. In addition, several grant statutes contain 
their own anti-discrimination provisions and include sex discrimination. 
E.g., 42 U.S.C. § 5309 (prohibiting discrimination in federally funded 
community development programs); 20 U.S.C. § 7231d(b)(2)(C) (magnet 
school grant applicants must provide assurances that they will not 
discriminate). 

Statements in some of the cases to the effect that grant funds upon being 
paid over to the grantee are no longer federal funds should not be taken out 
of context. The fact that grant funds in the hands of a grantee are no longer 
viewed as federal funds for certain purposes does not mean that they lose 
their character as federal funds for all purposes. See In re Universal 
Security & Protection Service, Inc., 223 B.R. 88, 92–93 (Bankr. E.D. La. 
1998). It has been held that the government retains a “property interest” in 
grant funds until they are actually spent by the grantee for authorized 
purposes.66 This property interest may take the form of an “equitable lien,” 
stemming from the government’s right to ensure that the funds are used 
only for authorized purposes, or a “reversionary interest” (funds that can 
no longer be used for grant purposes revert to the government). In re 
Alpha Center, Inc., 165 B.R. 881, 884–85 (Bankr. S.D. Ill. 1994). By virtue of 
this property interest, the funds, and property purchased with those funds 
to the extent unrestricted title has not vested in the grantee, are not subject 
to judicial process without the government’s consent. E.g., Henry v. First 
National Bank of Clarksdale, 595 F.2d 291, 308–09 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. 
denied, 444 U.S. 1074 (1980). 

Likewise, in Department of Housing and Urban Development v. 

K.Capolino Construction Corp., No. 01 Civ. 390 (JGK) (S.D.N.Y., May 7, 
2001), the court granted the agency’s request for an injunction to prevent 
the use of federal low-income housing grant funds to satisfy a judgment in a 
defamation action against the grantee: 
“The Supreme Court held in Buchanan v. Alexander, 45 U.S. 
(4 How.) 20–21, (1846), that federal funds in the hands of a 
grantee remain the property of the federal government 
unless and until expended in accordance with the terms of 
the grant and are not subject to attachment or garnishment. 
That decision, despite its age, remains the law today. . . . 

66 See section G.1.a. of this chapter for further discussion of this point in the context of grant 
costs and accountability.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Unless the federal government consents, sovereign 
immunity prevents federal funds from being subject to 
attachment or garnishment proceedings.” 

Slip op. at 4. 

The concept is illustrated in two cases from the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Seventh Circuit. In Palmiter v. Action, Inc., 733 F.2d 1244 (7th Cir. 
1984), the court rejected the argument that grant funds lose their federal 
character when placed in the grantee’s bank account, and held that federal 
grant funds in the hands of a grantee are not subject to garnishment to 
satisfy a debt of the grantee. The holding would presumably not apply 
where the grantee had actually spent its own money and the federal funds 
were paid over as reimbursement. Id. at 1249. The court considered a 
similar issue in the context of a bankruptcy petition filed by a grantee 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In re Joliet-Will County 
Community Action Agency, 847 F.2d 430 (7th Cir. 1988). The issue was 
whether grant funds in the hands of the grantee, as well as personal 
property purchased with grant money, were assets of the bankrupt and 
therefore subject to the control of the trustee in bankruptcy. Directing the 
trustee to abandon the assets, the court held that they remained the 
property of the federal government. In the course of reaching this result, 
the court noted that unpaid creditors of the bankrupt could, to the extent 
their claims were within the scope of the grant, be paid by the grantor 
agency out of the recovered funds. Id. at 433–35. 

A case discussing both Palmiter and Joliet-Will and reaching a similar 
result is In re Southwest Citizens’ Organization for Poverty Elimination, 
91 B.R. 278 (Bankr. D.N.J. 1988). A grantee, which had purchased a number 
of motor vehicles with Head Start grant funds, filed a Chapter 11 
bankruptcy petition. The Department of Health and Human Services 
sought return of the property, contending that the bankrupt’s title was 
subject to the government’s right to require transfer to another grantee 
under the program legislation and regulations. The trustee argued that the 
motor vehicles were property of the bankruptcy estate, and that the 
trustee’s interest superseded any interest of the government. After a 
detailed review of precedent, the court directed the trustee to return the 

Page 10-73 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

vehicles to the federal grantor, concluding that the government’s rights 
amounted to a reversionary interest.67 

Another theory occasionally encountered but which appears to have 
received little in-depth discussion is the theory that a grantee holds grant 
funds, and property purchased with those funds, in the capacity of a 
trustee. For example, in Joliet-Will, 847 F.2d at 432, the court held that the 
grantee was essentially “a trustee, custodian, or other intermediary, 
who . . . is merely an agent for the disbursal of funds belonging to another,” 
and that the grantee’s “ownership” was nominal, like that of a trustee. The 
trust concept finds support in an early Supreme Court decision, Stearns v. 
Minnesota, 179 U.S. 223, 249 (1900), a land grant case in which the Court 
discussed the grant in trust terms. 

However, this trust theory cannot create a federal interest where one does 
not logically exist. In one case, Transit Express, Inc. v. Ettinger, 246 F.3d 
1018 (7th Cir. 2001), a firm that offered to provide drivers to a grantee sued 
the Federal Transit Administration because the grantee did not choose to 
contract with it to drive vans that were purchased with the grant funds. 
The federal grant had been used only to purchase the vans, not to fund the 
operations of the grantee. Thus, the court ruled that the presence of 
federal grant funds as a source to finance purchase of the vans under the 
federal program was completely irrelevant to the grantee’s actions in 
obtaining drivers for the vans. Specifically, the court stated that “federal 
funds lurking in the background of this case cannot serve as an 
independent basis for establishing jurisdiction.” Id. at 1026. As a result, the 
contractor’s complaint was dismissed. 

Another area in which grant funds in the hands of a grantee continue to be 
treated as federal funds is the application of federal criminal statutes 
dealing with theft of money or property belonging to the United States. 
There are numerous cases in which the courts have applied various 
provisions of the Criminal Code, such as 18 U.S.C. § 641, to the theft or 

67 In a bankruptcy case that considered several of the personal property cases discussed 
above, the court held that with regard to real property, a trustee enjoys the rights of a bona 
fide purchaser and is, thus, entitled to notice of another’s claim to the real property. In re 
Premier Airways, Inc. v. United States Department of Transportation, 303 B.R. 295 
(Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 2003). Therefore, the court determined that a trustee’s interest in real 
property purchased with federal grant funds was superior to that of the federal grantor 
agency where the grantor agency failed to perfect its interest in the real property as a matter 
of record prior to the grantee’s commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding.

embezzlement of grant funds or grant property in the hands of grantees. 
Examples involving a variety of grant programs are Hayle v. United States, 
815 F.2d 879 (2nd Cir. 1987) (violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641); United States v. 
Harris, 729 F.2d 441 (7th Cir. 1984) (violation of 18 U.S.C. § 657); 
United States v. Hamilton, 726 F.2d 317 (7th Cir. 1984) (violation of 
18 U.S.C. § 665(a)); United States v. Montoya, 716 F.2d 1340 (10th Cir. 1983) 
(violation of 18 U.S.C. § 287); United States v. Smith, 596 F.2d 662 (5th Cir. 
1979) (violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641); United States v. Rowen, 594 F.2d 98 
(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 834 (1979) (violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641). 


In each of these cases, the court rejected the argument that the statute did 
not apply because the funds or property were no longer federal funds or 
property. It makes no difference whether the funds are paid to the grantee 
in advance or by reimbursement (Montoya, 716 F.2d at 1344), or that the 
funds may have been commingled with nonfederal funds (Hayle, 815 F.2d 
at 882). The holdings are based on the continuing responsibility of the 
federal government to oversee the use of the funds. E.g., Hayle, 815 F.2d 
at 882; Hamilton, 726 F.2d at 321. The result would presumably be 
different in the case of grant funds paid over outright with no continuing 
federal oversight or supervision. E.g., Smith, 596 F.2d at 664. 


Lastly, the presence of federal grant funds had an unusual impact on an age 
discrimination case brought against a federally-funded private 
organization. The plaintiff in Neukirchen v. Wood County Head Start, Inc., 
53 F.3d 809 (7th Cir. 1995), had obtained a money judgment for age 
discrimination against a local Head Start organization. She attempted to 
collect the judgment by executing against personal property the 
organization owned, including items of property purchased with grants 
funds that had a unit acquisition cost of less than $1,000. The then 
applicable regulations provided that once such property was no longer 
needed for grant purposes, it could be retained or disposed of by the 
grantee with no further obligation to the federal government.68 The 
plaintiff argued that the federal government retained no interest in property 
subject to this provision. The argument proved unavailing. Citing Joliet- 
Will, supra, the court stated: 


68 See Neukirchen, 53 F.3d at 812. As the court noted, this rule is no longer in effect and has 
been replaced by more stringent accountability requirements. Id. at 813, n. 4. For the 
current common rules on this subject, see, for example, 7 C.F.R. §§ 3019.32–3019.37. 

Page 10-75 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

“It is clear in this circuit that property purchased with 
federal grant funds constitutes federal property. . . . It is 
also axiomatic that the doctrine of sovereign immunity 
prevents a judgment creditor from attaching federal 
property, absent consent by the United States.” 

Neukirchen, 53 F.3d at 811–12. The court was not persuaded that the rule 
for property costing less than $1,000 created an exception: 

“Given the overwhelming control that the Secretary [of 
Health and Human Services] exercises over property 
purchased with federal funds and the corresponding lack of 
discretion on Wood County’s part, we do not believe that the 
absence of specific regulations requiring Wood County to 
reconvey to the United States property costing less than 
$1,000 commands a different result. We, therefore, 
conclude that Joliet-Will’s rationale requires that property 
purchased with federal grant funds, including property 
costing less than $1000, constitutes federal property.” 

Id. at 813. The result would be different, the court noted, for property that 
was in fact no longer needed; however, that was not true of the property at 
issue. Id. at n.4. Thus, even though the grantee had violated federal law in 
discriminating against the plaintiff, the majority of the grantee’s assets 
were immune from execution since they had been purchased with federal 
funds, a result that the court described as “paradoxical, indeed.” Id. at 814. 

Trillions of dollars in cash move into and out of the United States Treasury 

E. Grant Funding 
every year, and the federal government has a responsibility to the taxpayer 
to efficiently manage this cash flow in terms of collection, internal controls, 
investment, and disbursement. In the disbursement part of this process, 
good cash management practices include not paying the bills too late or too 
early. Timely disbursement of funds to resolve current liabilities as they 
come due yields positive results for the federal government both by 
avoiding late payment penalties and maximizing the time during which the 
cash reserves earn a return for the government through short-term 
investments. 

The need for sound cash management in the federal government plays an 
important role in the funding of grants and other assistance awards. 

Page 10-76 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Although grants are not subject to the general prohibition against advance 
payment of public funds, they are subject to laws and regulations intended 
to prevent grantees from earning interest on cash reserves at the expense 
of the federal government. The general rule is that interest earned on grant 
funds pending their use for program purposes belongs to the federal 
government. Special rules apply to state governmental grantees under the 
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act69 and the Cash Management 
Improvement Act,70 discussed in section E.2.b of this chapter. Once the 
grant funds have been used for program purposes, however, cash generated 
by the grant funds is generally treated as program income that belongs to 
the grantee. 

In addition to cash management concerns, grant funding also involves 
consideration of whether the federal government should bear the entire 
cost of program activities or require the grantee to shoulder part of the 
financial burden. If the grant program does provide for cost sharing, this is 
usually accomplished through either a local/matching share provision or a 
maintenance of effort provision. 

1. Advances of 
Grant/Assistance Funds 
The framework for managing cash flow in the federal government generally 
prohibits federal agencies from paying for goods or services before 
receiving them. However, the general statutory prohibition against the 
advance payment of public funds, 31 U.S.C. § 3324,71 does not apply to 
grants. This is because the primary purpose of assistance awards is to 
assist authorized recipients and not to obtain goods or services for the 
government. Thus, the policy behind the advance payment prohibition has 
much less force in the case of assistance awards than in the case of 
procurement contracts. Accordingly, the Comptroller General has held 
that 31 U.S.C. § 3324 does not preclude advance funding in authorized grant 
relationships; unless restricted by the program legislation or the applicable 
appropriation, the authority to make grants is sufficient to satisfy the 
requirements of 31 U.S.C. § 3324. 60 Comp. Gen. 208 (1981); 59 Comp. 
Gen. 424 (1980); 41 Comp. Gen. 394 (1961). As stated in 60 Comp. Gen. 
at 209, “[t]he policy of payment upon receipt of goods or services is simply 

69 Pub. L. No. 90-577, 82 Stat. 1098 (Oct. 16, 1968). 
70 Pub. L. No. 101-453, 104 Stat. 1058 (Oct. 24, 1990). 
71 For an in-depth discussion of advance payments, see Chapter 5, section C. 


Page 10-77 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

inconsistent with assistance relationships where the Government does not 
receive anything in the usual sense.” 

This does not mean that there can never be an advance payment problem in 
a grant case. Because the authority to advance funds must, at least in a 
general sense, be founded on the program legislation, advance payments 
would probably not be authorized under an assistance program that 
provided for payment by reimbursement. Also, the Comptroller General 
found advance payment violations in two grant-related cases from the 
1970s involving the College Work-Study Program: 56 Comp. Gen. 567 
(1977) and B-159715, Aug. 18, 1972. Under the College Work-Study 
Program as it existed in the 1970s when these two cases were decided, a 
student was placed with an employer, which might have been a federal 
agency. The student’s salary was paid from two sources: 80 percent was 
paid by the college under a Department of Education grant, and the 
remaining 20 percent was paid by the employer. In the 1972 case, an 
employing federal agency proposed to advance pay the college’s 80 percent 
share of the student’s salary and then seek reimbursement of this amount at 
a later date from the college. The Comptroller General found this advance 
payment arrangement to violate 31 U.S.C. § 3324. Five years later, in 
56 Comp. Gen. 567 the Comptroller General found a violation of the same 
statute when the agency/employer proposed to advance its 20 percent 
share to the college, which would in turn place the funds in an escrow 
account for payment to the student after the work was performed. 

2. Cash Management of 
Grants 
a. General Rule on Interest on 
Grant Advances 
One problem with the advance funding of assistance awards is that the 
recipient may draw down funds before the funds are actually needed. This 
is a matter of concern for several reasons. For one thing, advances under 
an assistance program are intended to accomplish the program purposes 
and not to profit the recipient other than in the manner and to the extent 
specified in the program. But there is another reason. When money is 
drawn from the Treasury before it is needed, or in excess of current needs, 
the federal government loses the use of the money. The principle was 
expressed as follows: 

Page 10-78 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

“When Federal receipts are insufficient to meet 
expenditures, the difference is obtained through borrowing; 
when receipts exceed expenditures, outstanding debt can 
be reduced. Thus, advancing funds to organizations outside 
the Government before they are needed either 
unnecessarily increases borrowings or decreases the 
opportunity to reduce the debt level and thereby increases 
interest costs to the Federal Government.” 

B-146285, Oct. 2, 1973, at 3. Thus, premature drawdown not only profits the 
grant recipient, but does so at the expense of the rest of the taxpayers. 

To reduce premature drawdowns and thus promote efficient cash 
management in the federal government in its grant funding, yet not 
discourage advance funding of grants in appropriate circumstances, a 
default rule has developed. The Comptroller General has consistently held 
that, except as otherwise provided by law, interest earned by grantees on 
funds advanced by the United States under an assistance agreement 
pending their application to grant purposes belongs to the United States 
rather than to the grantee. Such interest is to be accounted for as funds of 
the United States and must be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts under 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). For example, in B-251863, Aug. 27, 
1993, the Comptroller General applied this rationale in refusing to approve 
the proposal of the Fish and Wildlife Service to provide $584,930 to a 
nonprofit grantee over a 5-year period by advancing the grantee $500,000 
and allowing the grantee to earn $84,930 in interest during that time to 
retain and use for grant purposes. See also 71 Comp. Gen. 387 (1992); 
69 Comp. Gen. 660 (1990); 42 Comp. Gen. 289 (1962); 40 Comp. Gen. 81 
(1960); B-203681, Sept. 27, 1982; B-192459, July 1, 1980; B-149441, Apr. 16, 
1976; B-173240, Aug. 30, 1973.72 

If the grantee is unable to document the actual amount of interest earned 
on the grant advances, the general rule is that the grantor agency should 
use the “Treasury tax and loan account” rate prescribed by 31 U.S.C. § 3717 
for debts owed to the United States. 69 Comp. Gen. 660 (1990). If, 

72 Limitations on the use of interest earned on advance funds are also contained in the 
common rules. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. § 3016.21(i)(2005) (state and local government grantees); 
7 C.F.R. § 3019.22(l) (other grantees). For example, section 3016.21(i) requires nonexempt 
grantees and subgrantees to “promptly, but at least quarterly, remit interest earned on 
advances to the Federal agency.” However, it does permit them to keep up to $100 per year 
in interest to pay administrative expenses. 

Page 10-79 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

however, the grantee is a state, then interest will be determined in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 6503(c)(1), discussed hereafter. 

Except for states, discussed separately in the section immediately 
following, the general rule that the United States owns interest earned on 
grant advances applies whether the grantee is a public or private entity. 
The rationale for the rule is that unless expressly provided otherwise, funds 
are paid out to a grantee to accomplish the grant purposes, not for the 
grantee to invest the money and earn interest at the expense of the 
Treasury. Thus, grant funds are to be applied promptly to the grant 
purposes. 1 Comp. Gen. 652 (1922). 

In 40 Comp. Gen. 81 (1960), the Comptroller General held that interest on 
foreign currencies advanced by the Department of Agriculture under 
cooperative agreements, earned between the time the funds were advanced 
and the time they were used, could not be retained for program purposes 
but had to be returned to the Treasury for deposit in the General Fund as 
miscellaneous receipts. In 42 Comp. Gen. 289 (1962), the rule was applied 
with respect to State Department grants to American-sponsored schools 
and libraries overseas. The Comptroller General stated, “[t]here can be no 
doubt that only the Congress is legally empowered to give away the 
property or money of the United States.” Id. at 293. The decision further 
concluded that the enabling legislation did not provide sufficient authority 
to use the grant funds to establish a permanent interest-bearing 
endowment fund. In B-149441, Feb. 17, 1987, the Comptroller General 
found that since the National Endowment for the Humanities had no 
authority in its program legislation to permit its grantees to establish an 
endowment fund with grant moneys, the Endowment could not authorize 
its grantees to accomplish the same purpose with matching funds. 

Citing both 42 Comp. Gen. 289 and B-149441, discussed immediately above, 
the Comptroller General held in 70 Comp. Gen. 413 (1991) that legislative 
authority would be required for a “debt for equity swaps” proposal whereby 
the United States Information Agency (USIA) would purchase discounted 
foreign debt from commercial lenders and transfer the notes to grantees in 
the foreign country, who would in turn exchange the notes for local 
currency or local currency denominated bonds and use the income thus 
generated for program activities. However, since USIA has statutory 
authority to accept conditional gifts, the Comptroller General held that 
USIA could accept a donation of foreign debt and use the principal and 
income for authorized activities in accordance with the conditions 
specified. 

Page 10-80 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

The rule does not apply, however, if earning interest is consistent with the 
grant purposes. Thus, in B-230735, July 20, 1988, where use of grant funds 
to establish an endowment trust was authorized by law, the Comptroller 
General concluded that the grantee could use income from the endowment 
as nonfederal matching funds on other grants, as long as such use was 
consistent with the terms and conditions of the grant agreement. 

In B-192459, July 1, 1980, a grantee transferred grant funds to a trustee 
under a complex construction financing arrangement. The trustee was 
independent, that is, not an agent of the grantee, and the grantee could not 
get the funds back upon demand. The Comptroller General determined 
that the transfer to the trustee was in the nature of a disbursement for grant 
purposes. Therefore, interest earned by the trustee after the transfer could 
be treated as grant income and retained under the terms of the grant 
agreement. However, interest on grant funds placed in bank accounts and 
certificates of deposit by the grantee prior to transfer to the trustee had to 
be returned to the Treasury. The grantor agency lacked the authority to 
permit the grantee to retain interest earned on grant funds prior to their 
application to grant purposes. 

In 64 Comp. Gen. 103 (1984), the Agency for International Development 
advanced grant funds to the government of Egypt, which in turn advanced 
these funds to certain local and provincial elements of that government. 
Since the purpose of the grant was to assist Egypt in its efforts to 
decentralize certain governmental functions by developing experience at 
the local level in managing and financing selected projects, the Comptroller 
General concluded that the advances of funds by the government of Egypt 
to the local and provincial entities could legitimately be viewed as 
disbursements for grant purposes. Thus, the subgrantees could retain 
interest earned on those advances. However, in another 1984 case also 
involving the Agency for International Development, the Comptroller 
General found that subgrantees could not retain interest on funds advanced 
to them by the grant recipient under a cooperative agreement whose 
purpose was to help develop certain technologies because the grantor 
agency had advanced these funds to the grantee before the grantee had a 
legitimate program need for the funds. 64 Comp. Gen. 96 (1984). Both 
decisions followed the approach set forth in B-192459, July 1, 1980, 
summarized above. 

In evaluating the disposition of interest income, an important determinant 
is whether the interest was earned before or after the grant funds were 
applied to authorized grant purposes. The key word here is “authorized.”

Agreements 

b. State Governments and 
Interest on Grant Advances 
For example, under the Community Development Block Grant program, 
grantee cities and counties may use the funds to make loans for certain 
community projects. Grantees may retain interest earned on those loans 
for grant-related uses as a type of “program income,” that is, grant-related 
income, which is discussed in more detail in section E.4 of this chapter. 
However, if a loan is later found to be ineligible under the program, the 
funds were never used for an authorized grant purpose, and interest earned 
by the grantee must be paid over to the United States for deposit as 
miscellaneous receipts. 71 Comp. Gen. 387 (1992). 

Congress can, of course, legislatively make exceptions to the rule by 
providing assistance in the form of an unconditional gift or by other 
appropriate statutory provisions. See, e.g., 44 Comp. Gen. 179 (1964) 
(provision in appropriation act exempting educational institutions from 
liability for interest under certain Public Health Service Act grants); 
B-175155, June 11, 1975 (interest rule not applicable with respect to 
“grants” to Amtrak).73 

(1) Intergovernmental Cooperation Act 
Prior to 1968, the prohibition on retention of interest income applied to 
states as well as to other grantees. 20 Comp. Gen. 610 (1941); 3 Comp. 
Gen. 956 (1924); 26 Comp. Dec. 505 (1919); 24 Comp. Dec. 403 (1918); 
A-46031, Jan. 16, 1933. There was no reason to draw a distinction. This, of 
course, was premised on the absence of any statutory guidance. 

The treatment of interest on grant advances to state governments is now 
governed by the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968, Pub. L. 
No. 90-577, 82 Stat. 1098 (Oct. 16, 1968), codified at 31 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6508. 
The law evolved in two stages. The original Intergovernmental 
Cooperation Act created what was to be, for 22 years, the major exception 
to the rule that interest on grant advances belongs to the United States. 
The 1968 statute first codified the requirement for federal grantor agencies 

73 A conceptually related case is 71 Comp. Gen. 310 (1992), which upheld a Small Business 
Administration regulation providing for a reasonable profit to grantees under the Small 
Business Innovation Development Act.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

to schedule the transfer of grant funds so as to minimize the time elapsing 
between transfer and grantee disbursement.74 The statute then provided: 
“States shall not be held accountable for interest earned on grant-in-aid 
funds, pending their disbursement for program purposes.” Pub. L. 
No. 90-577, § 203. 

The theory behind the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act was that federal 
grantor agencies could control the release of grant funds and thereby 
preclude situations from arising in which state grantees would be in a 
position to earn excessive interest on grant advances. If the timing of the 
release of funds was properly managed, interest the state might earn would 
be too small to be a matter of concern. The statutory exception was not 
intended to create a windfall for state grantees. See Pennsylvania Office of 
Budget v. Department of Health & Human Services, 996 F.2d 1505 
(3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1010 (1993).75 

The original statutory exception for interest on grant advances did not 
prove satisfactory, however. Grantor agencies complained of premature 
drawdown of grant advances while grantee states complained of slow 
federal payment in reimbursement situations. Congress responded by 
amending 31 U.S.C. § 6503 in section 5 of the Cash Management 
Improvement Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-453, 104 Stat. 1058, 1059 (Oct. 24, 
1990). The 1990 amendment was intended to address both the federal and 
state concerns. Thus, the House report on the legislation, H.R. Rep. 
No. 101-696, at 3–4 (1990), stated: 

“Under current law, the States need not account to the 
Federal Government for interest earned on Federal funds 
disbursed to the States prior to payment to program 
beneficiaries. However, when the Federal Government 
complains of undue profits made by the States as a result of 
early drawdown of Federal funds, the States are quick to 
point out numerous instances where they lose interest 

74 In B-146285, Apr. 10, 1978, the Comptroller General concluded that the Intergovernmental 
Cooperation Act did not repeal by implication a statute which prescribed both the timing 
schedule and the amount of payments under a particular assistance program, but rather was 
geared primarily to programs without statutory payment schedules. 

75 The opinion in Pennsylvania Office of Budget provides a useful discussion of the 
background, purposes, and legislative history of the interest exception in the original 
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act. See 996 F.2d at 1510–12. 

Page 10-83 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

opportunities because the Federal Government is slow to 
reimburse them for the monies the States advance to fund 
Federal programs. This bill seeks to provide a fair and 
equitable resolution to these differences between the 
Federal Government and the States.” 

The Cash Management Improvement Act retained the general requirement 
of 31 U.S.C. § 6503 to minimize the time elapsing between transfer of funds 
from the Treasury to the grantee and grantee disbursement of those funds 
for program purposes. It also provided sanctions to enforce this 
requirement. These provisions are discussed further in section E.2.c of this 
chapter. With respect to interest, the act amended 31 U.S.C. § 6503(c) to 
provide that for advance payment programs, unless inconsistent with 
program purposes the state must pay interest to the United States from the 
time the funds are transferred to the state’s account to the time they are 
paid out by the state for program purposes. Interest payments are to be 
deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. For reimbursement 
programs, the United States must pay interest to the state from the time of 
payout by the state to the time the federal funds are deposited in the state’s 
bank account. 31 U.S.C. § 6503(d). Interest in both directions (i.e., from 
states to the federal government under 31 U.S.C. § 6503(c) and from the 
federal government to states under 31 U.S.C. § 6503(d)) is to be paid 
annually, at a rate based on the yield of 13-week Treasury bills, using offset 
to the extent provided in Treasury regulations. Id. §§ 6503(c), (d), (i).76 

(2) Decisions under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act 
(i) State entities covered 
The original Intergovernmental Cooperation Act applied only to states and 
their agencies or instrumentalities; it did not extend to “political 
subdivisions” of states, such as cities, towns, counties, or special districts 
created by state law. Pub. L. No. 90-577, § 102, 82 Stat. 1098, 1099 (Oct. 16, 
1968), codified at 31 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6508. The Cash Management 
Improvement Act, Pub. L. No. 101-453, 104 Stat. 1058 (Oct. 24, 1990), 
expanded the relevant definition to apply to “an agency, instrumentality, or 
fiscal agent” of a state, including territories and the District of Columbia, 

76 The interest provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act took effect during the 
second half of 1993. Pub. L. No. 101-453, § 5(e), as amended by the Cash Management 
Improvement Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-589, § 2, 106 Stat. 5133 (Nov. 10, 1992). 

Page 10-84 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

but the definition retains the exclusion for “a local government of a State,” 
such as a city, county, or town. 31 U.S.C. § 6501(9). Thus, GAO decisions 
under the original Intergovernmental Cooperation Act should remain 
relevant in determining which entities are “states” in this context. What 
constitutes a covered state entity under the act is further refined in 
implementing Treasury Department regulations at 31 C.F.R. § 205.2 (2005). 

In 56 Comp. Gen. 353 (1977), the Comptroller General addressed how to 
determine which state entities were covered by the Intergovernmental 
Cooperation Act, concluding as follows: 

“[A] Federal grantor agency is not required by the 
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 and its 
legislative history to accept the Bureau of the Census’ 
classification of an entity . . . in determining whether that 
entity is a State agency or instrumentality or a political 
subdivision of the State. It is bound by the classification of 
the entity in State law. Only in the absence of a clear 
indication of the status of the entity in State law may it make 
its own determination based on reasonable standards, 
including resort to the Bureau of the Census’ 
classifications.” 

Id. at 357. If the classification under state law is not clear and 
unambiguous, the grantee may be required to obtain a legal opinion from 
the state Attorney General in order to assist in making the determination. 
Id. 

In a more recent case dealing with the current statutory definition, the 
Federal Circuit found that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 
(MBTA) was an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
and was therefore entitled under 31 U.S.C. § 6503(d) to interest on 
reimbursement payments from the federal government. Massachusetts 
Bay Transportation Authority v. United States, 129 F.3d 1226, 1236–37 
(Fed. Cir. 1997). In arriving at this conclusion, the court noted that the 
MBTA was located within the state’s Executive Office of Transportation 
and Construction and that the members of MBTA’s board of directors were 
appointed and removed by the state’s governor. The court also found it 
significant that the MBTA had been defined as a state instrumentality in a 
Comptroller General decision (56 Comp. Gen. 353 (1977)) and in an opinion 
of the Massachusetts Attorney General.

Agreements 

(ii) Grants covered by the former interest exemption 
The exception to the prohibition against retention of interest income by 
state grantees in the original Intergovernmental Cooperation Act was held 
to apply to pass-through situations where states are the primary recipients 
of grant funds, which are then passed on to subgrantees. In B-171019, 
Oct. 16, 1973, the Comptroller General concluded that the exception 
applied to political subdivisions, which were subgrantees of states. The 
Justice Department reached the same conclusion in 6 Op. Off. Legal 
Counsel 127 (1982). Subsequent decisions applied the exception to 
nongovernmental subgrantees as well, recognizing that there was no basis 
to distinguish between governmental and nongovernmental subgrantees. 
59 Comp. Gen. 218 (1980), aff’d, B-196794, Feb. 24, 1981. 

Other cases under the version of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act 
that predated the Cash Management Improvement Act may remain relevant 
as well. For example, the statute does not necessarily apply to funds in 
contexts other than those specified. Thus, in 62 Comp. Gen. 701 (1983), the 
Comptroller General concluded that a subgrantee under a Labor 
Department grant to a state was not entitled to retain interest it had earned 
by investing funds received from the Internal Revenue Service as a refund 
of Federal Insurance Contributions Act (social security) taxes. In 
North Carolina v. Heckler, 584 F. Supp. 179 (E.D.N.C. 1984), the court 
found the statute inapplicable in a situation in which the state had 
wrongfully obtained federal funds and earned interest on them pending 
repayment to the government. 

In two recent judicial decisions, courts agreed with the federal government 
that the act’s exemption did not apply because the transactions at issue did 
not constitute grants covered by the act. In California State University v. 
Riley, 74 F.3d 960, 964–65 (9th Cir. 1996), the Ninth Circuit held that, 
contrary to the state’s contention, “Pell grants” were not “grants” under the 
act’s definition. Paraphrasing the language of 31 U.S.C. § 6501(4), which 
remains the same today, the court stated: 

“The ‘grants’ that are the subject of the ICA 
[Intergovernmental Cooperation Act] are grants to states, 
local governments, or beneficiaries under a state plan or 
program administered by the state.” 

Riley, 74 F.3d at 964 (emphasis in original). Under the Pell grant program, 
the state university did not administer the grants but acted merely as a 

Page 10-86 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

Agreements 

c. Other Cash Management 
Requirements 
conduit for disbursing the Pell grants, which were provided directly from 
the federal government to students meeting the eligibility requirements. 
Similarly, the court in New York Department of Social Services v. Shalala, 
876 F. Supp. 29 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), aff’d, 50 F.3d 179 (2nd Cir. 1995), determined 
that a state agency could not retain interest earned on payments received 
from the federal government as reimbursement for administering federal 
Social Security disability programs. The court held that the payments did 
not constitute a “grant” for purposes of the Intergovernmental Cooperation 
Act since the statute specifically excludes from its definition of a grant “a 
payment to a State or local government as complete reimbursement for 
costs incurred in paying benefits or providing services to persons entitled 
to them under a law of the United States.” Id. at 33. See 31 U.S.C. 
§ 6501(4)(C)(vii). 

Our discussion up to now has focused exclusively on the treatment of 
interest earned on federal grant funds. However, there are other important 
cash management considerations and additional relevant requirements in 
the Cash Management Improvement Act, Pub. L. No. 101-453, 104 Stat. 1058 
(Oct. 24, 1990), and its implementing regulations.77 Some of these are 
highlighted below. 

Section 4 of the act added a new section 3335 to title 31, United States 
Code, which imposes a general requirement for federal agencies to provide 
for the “timely disbursement” of federal funds to eligible recipients in 
accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
31 U.S.C. § 3335(a).78 If an agency fails to comply with this requirement, the 
Secretary may collect from the agency a charge in an amount the Secretary 
determines to be the cost to the general fund of the Treasury caused by the 
noncompliance. 31 U.S.C. § 3335(b). The charge is to be deposited into the 
Treasury as miscellaneous receipts and is to be derived, to the maximum 
extent possible, from funds available to the offending agency for 
administrative operations rather than from program accounts. Id. 
§§ 3335(c) and (d). The Secretary’s authority to collect charges is 
permissive rather than mandatory and, according to the legislative history, 
is to be “restricted to cases of egregious or repeated noncompliance, and 

77 For a summary of the Cash Management Improvement Act and a review of its initial years 
in operation, see GAO, Financial Management: Implementation of the Cash Management 
Improvement Act, GAO/AIMD-96-4 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 8, 1996). 

78 Disbursement is to be accomplished through cash, checks, electronic funds transfer, or 
any other means identified by the Treasury Secretary. 

Page 10-87 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

[not to] be used in a routine manner to finance interest costs incurred by 
the Federal Government.” H.R. Rep. No. 101-696, at 7 (1990). 

Section 5 of the Cash Management Improvement Act also amended 
31 U.S.C. § 6503 to provide more specific requirements that apply to 
assistance programs administered by the states. Section 6503, as so 
amended, directs both federal grantor agencies and state grantees, 
consistent with Treasury regulations, to “minimize the time elapsing 
between transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance 
or redemption of checks, warrants, or payments by other means” by the 
state grantee for program purposes. 31 U.S.C. § 6503(a). Furthermore, it 
requires the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into an agreement with each 
state receiving grant funds that prescribes fund transfer methods and 
procedures, as chosen by the state and approved by the Secretary. 
31 U.S.C. § 6503(b). If an agreement cannot be reached with a particular 
state, the Secretary is authorized to establish default procedures for that 
state by regulation. 31 U.S.C. § 6503(b)(3). 

The Treasury Department’s regulations implementing the Cash 
Management Improvement Act are codified at 31 C.F.R. parts 205 and 206 
(2005). Part 205 contains those provisions most relevant to assistance 
programs. See, e.g., 31 C.F.R. §§ 205.8 (default procedures in the absence of 
a Treasury-state agreement); 205.11 and 205.33 (requirements for fund 
transfers and drawdowns); 205.19 (calculation of interest); 205.34 (federal 
oversight and compliance responsibilities). 

The crux of the government’s policy related to timeliness, as stated in 
31 C.F.R. §§ 205.11 and 205.33, is that federal agencies must limit a funds 
transfer to a state to the minimum amounts needed by the state and must 
time the disbursement to be in accord with the actual, immediate cash 
requirements of the State in carrying out a federal assistance program. 
Similarly, a state must minimize the time between the drawdown of federal 
funds from the federal government and their disbursement for federal 
program purposes. In B-244617, Dec. 24, 1991 (nondecision letter), GAO 
concurred with a determination by the Social Security Administration that 
a period of 15 months between a state’s drawdown and disbursement of 
federal funds for state employee retirement contributions did not meet the 
latter requirement. 

Although the above discussion focuses on state grantees, the same cash 
management concerns apply, of course, with respect to other recipients of 
federal assistance. Thus, similar requirements for other grantees can be 

Page 10-88 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

found in Office of Management and Budget circulars and agency 
regulations. See, for example, the cash management provisions of the 
Department of Agriculture’s common rules applicable to local government 
grantees as well as states (7 C.F.R. § 3016.20) and those applicable to 
institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations (7 C.F.R. 
§§ 3019.21 and 22). 

The authority of a state to require its own grantees to account to it for 
funds it makes available to them is generally a matter within the discretion 
of the state. See B-196794, Jan. 28, 1983 (nondecision letter) (observing 
that each state “has the primary responsibility for employing whatever 
form of organization and management procedures it feels is necessary to 
assure proper and efficient administration of the funds advanced”). 
However, the common rules include some minimal internal control and 
accountability standards for state grantees in relation to their subgrantees. 
For example, the Department of Agriculture common rule in 7 C.F.R. 
§ 3016.20(b)(7) provides, in part, with respect to cash management: 

“Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to ensure 
the receipt of reports on subgrantees’ cash balances and 
cash disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to 
prepare complete and accurate cash transactions reports to 
the awarding agency. When advances are made by letter-ofcredit 
or electronic transfer of funds methods, the grantee 
must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash 
drawdowns by their subgrantees to assure that they 
conform substantially to the same standards of timing and 
amount as apply to advances to the grantees.” 

3. Program Income Once grant funds have been applied to their grant purposes, they still can 
generate income, directly or indirectly, in various ways. This, as 
distinguished from interest on grant advances, is called “program income.” 
Program income is defined broadly under the common rules as “gross 
income received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement during 
the grant period.” See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. § 3016.25(b) (2005). Program income 
may include such things as income from the sale of commodities, fees for 
services performed, and usage or rental fees. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. 
§ 3016.25(a). Grant-generated income may also include investment 
income, although this will be uncommon. See B-192459, July 1, 1980. 
Page 10-89 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Although included in the broad common rule definition of program income, 
income from the sale of real property receives special treatment and is 
governed instead by the common rule on real property. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. 
§§ 3016.25(f), 3016.31, 3019.24(g). This difference was important in 
B-290744, Sept. 13, 2002, in which the Comptroller General found that the 
Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century79 did not alter the common 
rule related to program income and the proceeds of the sale of real 
property that the grantee no longer needs for the originally authorized 
purpose. The decision thus concluded that the federal government had 
retained its percentage interest in the proceeds Massachusetts had earned 
from the sale of excess property acquired with Federal Highway Trust 
funds. The Comptroller General determined that the 1998 statute did not 
remove the federal character of the federal interest in the real property that 
was sold. 

In contrast to income earned on grant advances, program income (other 
than proceeds from real property sales) does not automatically acquire a 
federal character and is not required to be deposited in the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts. It may, unless the grant provides otherwise, be 
retained by the grantee for grant-related use. 44 Comp. Gen. 87 (1964); 
41 Comp. Gen. 653 (1962); B-192459, July 1, 1980; B-191420, Aug. 24, 1978. 

In 44 Comp. Gen. 87, the Comptroller General concluded that a grantee 
could establish a revolving fund with grant income in the absence of a 
contrary provision in the grant agreement. However, the initial amount of a 
revolving fund established from either the principal of a grant or the 
income generated under the grant, when returned to the grantor agency 
upon completion of the grant, may not be considered a return of grant 
funds for further use by the grantor but must be deposited in the Treasury 
as miscellaneous receipts. B-154996, Nov. 5, 1969. 

Under the common rules, there are three generally recognized methods for 
the treatment of program income: 

• Deduction. Deduct program income from total allowable costs to 
determine net costs on which grantor and grantee shares will be based. 
This approach results in savings to the federal government because the 
income is used to reduce contributions rather than to increase program 
size. 
79 Pub. L. No. 105-178, § 1303, 112 Stat. 107, 227 (June 9, 1998). 

Page 10-90 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

• Addition. Add income to the funds committed to the project, to be 
used for program purposes. This approach increases program size. 
• Cost-sharing or matching. Use income to finance any applicable 
nonfederal matching requirements. Under this approach, the federal 
contribution and program size remain the same. 
See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. §§ 3016.25(g), 3019.24(b). 

Although the common rules provide for three alternative treatments of 
program income, the deduction method is the default rule with the 
methods or a combination of them being used only if specified by the 
applicable federal agency regulations or grant agreement. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. 
§ 3016.25(g). The rule further provides: 

“In specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may 
distinguish between income earned by the grantee and 
income earned by subgrantees and between the sources, 
kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of 
this section, program income in excess of any limits 
stipulated shall also be deducted from outlays.” 

Id. 

The common rules provide that the deduction method is the default rule for 
program income earned by state and local government grantees as 
described above. The common rules likewise make deduction the default 
in the treatment of program income for most other grantees, the exception 
being research grants for which addition is the default. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. 
§§ 3019.24(b)–(d); 2 C.F.R. §§ 215.24(b)–(d). An illustration of the 
application of the deduction method can be found in Pennsylvania 
Department of Public Services v. Health & Human Services, 80 F.3d 796 
(3rd Cir. 1996), which involved revenue the state earned from a fee charged 
for filing a child support case in the state. The court held that the fee 
revenue was program income, which the state had to deduct from the total 
allowable program costs in order to determine the net costs on which the 
federal and state shares were to be based. 

Some types of program income are subject to special rules: 

Page 10-91 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

• Proceeds from the sale of real and personal property provided by the 
federal government or purchased in whole or in part with federal funds. 
Special rules are set forth in the common rules. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. 
§§ 3016.25(f), 3016.31, 3016.32, 3019.24(g), 3019.32, 3019.34. See also 
B-290744, Sept. 13, 2002. 

• Royalties received as a result of copyrights or patents produced under a 
grant. A special rule states that this income may be treated as other 
program income if specified in applicable agency regulations or the 
grant agreement. See 7 C.F.R. §§ 3016.25(e), 3019.24(h). See also 
B-186284, June 23, 1977; GAO, Administration of the Science 
Education Project “Man: A Course of Study” (MACOS), MWD-76-26 
(Washington, D.C.: Oct. 14, 1975). 
4. Cost-Sharing Federal grant funds constitute a significant portion of the total 
expenditures of state and local governments. In fiscal year 2004, federal 
grants made up 25 percent of the total expenditures of state and local 
governments. Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the United States 
Government for Fiscal Year 2006 (Feb. 7, 2005), at 131. When the federal 
government chooses to provide financial assistance to some activity, it may 
also choose to fund the entire cost, but it is not required to do so. City of 
New York v. Richardson, 473 F.2d 923, 928 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied sub nom., 
412 U.S. 950 (1973). “[T]he judgment whether to [provide assistance], and 
to what degree, rests with [Congress].” Id. Thus, a program statute may 
provide for full funding, or it may provide for “cost-sharing,” that is, 
financing by a mix of federal and nonfederal funds. Reasons for costsharing 
range from budgetary considerations to a desire to stimulate 
increased activity on the part of the recipient. The two primary costsharing 
devices are “matching share” provisions and “maintenance of 
effort” provisions. For a detailed analysis and critique of both devices, see 
GAO, Federal Grants: Design Improvements Could Help Federal 
Resources Go Further, GAO/AIMD-97-7 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 18, 1996). 
See also GAO, Block Grants: Issues in Designing Accountability 
Provisions, GAO/AIMD-95-226 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 1, 1995).

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

a. Local or Matching Share (1) General principles 
A matching share provision is one under which the grantee is required to 
contribute a portion of the total project cost. The “match” may be 50-50, or 
any other mix specified in the governing legislation. A matching share 
provision typically prescribes the percentages of required federal and 
nonfederal shares. However, the legislation need not provide explicitly for 
a nonfederal share. A statute authorizing assistance not in excess of a 
specified percentage of project costs will normally be interpreted as 
requiring a local share of nonfederal funds to make up the difference. (The 
rest of the money has to come from someplace.) 

As discussed in more detail in section E.5.a of this chapter, a grantee 
generally may not use funds received under one federal grant program to 
meet its nonfederal share under another federal grant program. See 
B-270654, May 6, 1996 (private nonprofit corporation could not use general 
support funds it received from the State Department as the nonfederal 
match for other federal grants it received from the Agency for International 
Development and the United States Information Agency); B-214278, Jan. 25, 
1985 (funds from the Farmers Home Administration’s Water and Waste 
Disposal Development Grant Program could not be used to satisfy the 
nonfederal match requirement of the Environmental Protection Agency’s 
treatment works construction grant program). Congress can, of course, 
enact a statutory exception that expressly permits this method of funding 
the nonfederal share. See, e.g., B-239907, July 10, 1991 (Community 
Development Block Grants (CDBG) can constitute the nonfederal share 
because one of the statutorily authorized activities for CDBG funds is 
providing the nonfederal share for other federal grant programs that are 
listed in the community’s annual CDBG application document). 

When a federal agency enters into an assistance agreement with an eligible 
recipient, an entire project or program is approved. Where a local share is 
required, this agreement includes an estimate of the total costs, that is, a 
total that will exceed the amount to be borne by the federal government. 
The additional contribution that is needed to supply full support for the 
anticipated costs is the local, or nonfederal, matching share. Once the 
agreement is accepted, the assistance recipient is committed to providing 
the nonfederal share if it wishes to continue with the grant. E.g., B-130515, 
July 20, 1973. Failure to meet this commitment may result in the 
disallowance of all or part of otherwise allowable federal share costs.

Matching share requirements are often intended to “assure local interest 
and involvement through financial participation.” 59 Comp. Gen. 668, 669 
(1980). Such requirements may also serve to hold down federal costs. The 
theory behind the typical matching share requirement may be summarized 
as follows: 

“In theory, the fiscal lure of Federal grants entices State and 
local governments into allocating new resources to satisfy 
the non-Federal match for programs they otherwise would 
not have funded on their own. While State and local 
jurisdictions may not be willing or able to fully fund a 
program from their own resources, they would most likely 
agree to spend new resources on the same project if most of 
the project costs were paid by the Federal Government.” 

GAO, Proposed Changes in Federal Matching and Maintenance of Effort 
Requirements for State and Local Governments, GGD-81-7 (Washington, 
D.C.: Dec. 23, 1980), at 9. This approach has been termed “cooperative 
federalism.” E.g., King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 316 (1968). It is also known 
as the “federal carrot.” See City of New York v. Richardson, 473 F.2d 923, 
928 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied sub nom., 412 U.S. 950 (1973). 

Matching requirements are most commonly found in the applicable 
program legislation. However, they may also be found in appropriation 
acts. E.g., 58 Comp. Gen. 524 (1979); 31 Comp. Gen. 459 (1952). A 
matching provision in an appropriation act, like any other provision in an 
appropriation act, will apply only to the fiscal year(s) covered by the act or 
the appropriation to which it applies, unless otherwise specified. 58 Comp. 
Gen. at 527. 

If a program statute authorizes grants but neither provides for nor prohibits 
cost-sharing, the grantor agency may in some cases be able to impose a 
matching requirement administratively by regulation. The test is the 
underlying congressional intent. If legislative history indicates an intent for 
full federal funding, then the statute will generally be construed as 
requiring a 100 percent federal share. B-226572, June 25, 1987; B-169491, 
June 16, 1980. However, cost-sharing regulations have been regarded as 
valid when the statute was silent and it could reasonably be concluded that 
Congress left the matter to the judgment of the administering agency. 
B-130515, July 17, 1974; B-130515, July 20, 1973. Such regulations may be 
waived uniformly and prospectively, but may not be waived on a 
retroactive and ad hoc basis. Id. 

Page 10-94 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Matching funds, as with the federal assistance funds themselves, can be 
used only for authorized grant purposes. B-230735, July 20, 1988; B-149441, 
Feb. 17, 1987. In the latter case, the Comptroller General concluded that 
the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) could not divert state 
matching funds to establish private endowments that, under existing 
authorities, could not have been created by a direct award of NEH funds. 
See also 42 Comp. Gen. 289, 295 (1962). Also, unless otherwise specified in 
the governing legislation, a grantee may match only a portion of the funds 
potentially available to it, and thereby receive a correspondingly smaller 
grant. 16 Comp. Gen. 512 (1936). 

Under a cost-sharing assistance program funded by advance payments of 
the federal contribution, the Comptroller General has held that the 
advances may be made prior to the disbursement of the nonfederal share as 
long as adequate assurances exist (e.g., by contractual commitments) that 
the local share will be forthcoming. 60 Comp. Gen. 208 (1981). See also 
23 Comp. Gen. 652 (1944) (payment by federal agency of local share under 
cooperative agreement, subject to contractual agreement to reimburse). 

Where the statute authorizing federal assistance specifies the federal share 
of an approved program as a specific percentage of the total cost, the 
grantor agency is required to make awards to the extent specified and has 
no discretion to provide a lesser (or greater) amount. Manatee County, 
Florida v. Train, 583 F.2d 179, 183 (5th Cir. 1978); 53 Comp. Gen. 547 (1974); 
B-197256, Nov. 19, 1980. However, where the federal share is defined by 
statutory language that specifies a maximum federal contribution but no 
minimum, the agency can provide a lesser amount. 50 Comp. Gen. 553 
(1971). 

Although most cost-sharing programs are in terms of a fixed federal share, 
some programs may provide for a declining federal share. Under a 
declining share program in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act, the 
Comptroller General concluded that the federal share could be determined 
in the year the grant was made, notwithstanding the fact that the grantee 
would not actually incur the costs until the following fiscal year. B-175155, 
July 29, 1977. Another cost-sharing variation is the “aggregate match,” in 
which the nonfederal share is determined by cumulating the grantee’s 
contributions from prior time periods. An example is discussed in 

58 Comp. Gen. 524 (1979).

Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

(2) Hard and soft matches 
The program statute may define or limit the types of assets that may be 
applied to the nonfederal share. A provision limiting the nonfederal share 
to cash contributions is called a “hard match.” In 31 Comp. Gen. 459 
(1952), the matching share was described in the appropriation act that 
required it as an “amount available.” In the absence of legislative history to 
support a broader meaning, the Comptroller General concluded that the 
matching share must be in the form of money and that the value of other 
nonmonetary contributions could not be considered. A more explicit “hard 
match” requirement is discussed in 52 Comp. Gen. 558 (1973), in which the 
Comptroller General concluded that the matching share, while it must be in 
the form of money, could include donated funds as well as grantee funds. 
While the program discussed in 52 Comp. Gen. 558 no longer exists, the 
case remains useful for this point and for the detailed review of legislative 
history illuminating the purpose and intent of the “hard match” provision. 

Congress continues to include hard match requirements in laws providing 
for cost sharing with federal grants. For example, the Transportation 
Equity Act for the 21st Century established job access and reverse commute 
grants, which require that the grantee provide at least 50 percent of the 
funding for each project and that the nonfederal share— 

“(i) shall be provided in cash from sources other than 

revenues from providing mass transportation, but may 

include amounts received under a service agreement; and 

“(ii) may be derived from amounts appropriated to or made 
available to a department or agency of the Federal 
Government (other than the Department of Transportation) 
that are eligible to be expended for transportation.” 

Pub. L. No. 105-178, § 3037(h), 112 Stat. 107, 390 (June 9, 1998) (emphasis 
added). 

The program legislation may expressly authorize the inclusion of assets 
other than cash in the nonfederal contribution. See 56 Comp. Gen. 645 
(1977). An example is found in the Klamath River Basin Fishery Resources 
Restoration Act, Pub. L. No. 99-552, 110 Stat. 3080 (Oct. 27, 1986), codified 
at 16 U.S.C. §§ 460ss–460ss-6, which requires that at least 50 percent of the 
cost of developing and implementing the program come from nonfederal 

Page 10-96 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

sources but explicitly states that noncash assets may count toward the 
nonfederal share. That statute specifically states: 

“In addition to cash outlays, the Secretary [of the 
Department of Interior] shall consider as financial 
contributions by a non-federal source the value of in kind 
contributions and real and personal property provided by 
the source for purposes of implementing the program.” 

16 U.S.C. § 460ss-5(b)(2). 

If, however, the legislation is silent with respect to the types of assets that 
may be counted, the statute will generally be construed as permitting an 
“in-kind” or “soft” match, that is, the matching share may include the 
reasonable value of property or services as well as cash. 52 Comp. 
Gen. 558, 560 (1973); B-81321, Nov. 19, 1948. The valuation of in-kind 
contributions can get complicated. An example is 31 Comp. Gen. 672 
(1952) (value of land could not include the cost or value of otherwise 
unallowable improvements to the land previously added by the grantee). 

Current valuation standards for state and local governments are found in 
the common rule captioned “Matching or Cost Sharing.” See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. 
§ 3016.24. For institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other 
nonprofit organizations, such standards can be found in 7 C.F.R. § 3019.23, 
also captioned “Cost Sharing or Matching.” 

(3) Matching one grant with funds from another 
As noted in the preceding section, an important and logical principle is that 
neither the federal nor the nonfederal share of a particular grant program 
may be used by a grantee to match funds provided under another federal 
grant program unless specifically authorized by law. In other words, a 
grantee may not (1) use funds received under one federal grant as the 
matching share under a separate grant, nor may it (2) use the same grantee 
dollars to meet two separate matching requirements. B-270654, May 6, 
1996; 56 Comp. Gen. 645 (1977); 47 Comp. Gen. 81 (1967); 32 Comp. 
Gen. 561 (1953); 32 Comp. Gen. 141 (1952); B-214278, Jan. 25, 1985; 
B-212177, May 10, 1984; B-130515, July 20, 1973; B-229004-O.M., Feb. 18, 

Page 10-97 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

1988; B-162001-O.M., Aug. 17, 1967. See also the common rule at 7 C.F.R. 
§ 3016.24(b). A contrary rule would largely nullify the cost-sharing 
objective of stimulating new grantee expenditures.80 

Normally, exceptions to the rule are in the form of express statutory 
authority. A prominent example is section 105(a)(9) of the Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 5305(a)(9), 
which authorizes community development block grant funds to be used as 
the nonfederal share under any other grant undertaken as part of a 
community development program. See 59 Comp. Gen. 668 (1980); 
56 Comp. Gen. 645 (1977); B-239907, July 10, 1991. The 1991 opinion 
concluded that community development block grant regulations no longer 
apply once the funds have been applied as a match under another grant 
program, at least where applying the regulations would substantially 
interfere with use of the funds under the receiving grant. See also 52 Comp. 
Gen. 558, 564 (1973); 32 Comp. Gen. 184 (1952). 

In 59 Comp. Gen. 668, GAO considered a conflict between two statutes, the 
Housing and Community Development Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5301–5321, which, 
as noted, permits federal grant funds to fill a nonfederal matching 
requirement, and the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, 
which provides for cost-sharing grants but expressly prohibits the use of 
federal funds received from other sources to pay a grantee’s matching 
share. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1454, 1455, and 1464(c). Finding that the statutory 
language could not be reconciled, and noting further that there was no 
helpful legislative history under either statute, the Comptroller General 
concluded, as the most reasonable result consistent with the purposes of 
both statutes, that community development block grant funds were 
available to pay the nonfederal share of Coastal Zone Management Act 
grants for projects properly incorporated as part of a grantee’s community 
development program. See also B-229004-O.M., Feb. 18, 1988, which 
essentially followed 59 Comp. Gen. 668 and concluded that community 
development block grant funds could be used for the matching share of 
certain grants under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, 
Pub. L. No. 100-77, 101 Stat. 482 (July 22, 1987). 

80 By way of contrast, this general rule does not apply to federal loans. The reason is that 
loans, unlike grants, are expected to be repaid and the recipient is thus, at least ultimately, 
using its own funds. Of course, the proposed use of the funds must be authorized under the 
loan program legislation. B-207211-O.M., July 9, 1982. See also B-214278, Jan. 25, 1985. 

Page 10-98 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

A somewhat less explicit exception is discussed in 57 Comp. Gen. 710 
(1978), holding that funds distributed to states under Title II of the Public 
Works Employment Act of 1976, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6721–6736 
(called the “countercyclical revenue sharing program”), may be applied to 
the states’ matching share under the Medicaid program. GAO agreed with 
the Treasury Department that Title II payments amounted to “general 
budget support as opposed to categorical or block grants or contracts” 
(57 Comp. Gen. at 711), a form of revenue sharing, and thus should be 
construed in the context of the (since repealed) General Revenue Sharing 
Program. General Revenue Sharing was characterized by a “no strings on 
local expenditures” policy, evidenced by the fact that a provision in the 
original legislation barring the use of funds as the nonfederal share in other 
federal programs had been repealed. Stressing the strong analogy between 
Title II and General Revenue Sharing, the decision concluded that implicit 
in the “no strings” policy was the authority to apply Title II funds to a state’s 
matching share under Medicaid. For a description of the former General 
Revenue Sharing Program, see, for example, GAO, Federal Assistance: 
Temporary State Fiscal Relief, GAO-04-736R (Washington, D.C.: May 7, 
2004) and Federal Grants: Design Improvements Could Help Federal 
Resources Go Further, GAO/AIMD-97-7 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 18, 1996). 

It should also be noted that where any federal assistance funds are used as 
nonfederal matching funds for another grant, such use must be consistent 
with the grant under which they were originally awarded as well as the 
grant they are intended to implement. 59 Comp. Gen. 668; 57 Comp. Gen. 
at 715; B-230735, July 20, 1988. 

Funds received by a property owner from a federal agency as just 
compensation for property taken by eminent domain belong to the owner 
outright and do not constitute a “grant.” Therefore, they may be used as the 
nonfederal share of a grant from another federal agency, even where the 
taking and the grant relate to the same project. B-197256, Nov. 19, 1980. 

(4) Relocation allowances 
Federally assisted programs which result in the displacement of individuals 
and business entities may, apart from eminent domain payments, result in 
the payment of relocation allowances under the Uniform Relocation 
Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended 
42 U.S.C. §§ 4601–4655. Under the statute, authorized relocation payments 
provided by a state incident to a federally assisted project which results in 
relocations are to be treated in the same manner as other project costs. 

Page 10-99 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Thus, under a program statute which provides for a 90 percent federal 
contribution, 90 percent of authorized relocation payments will be 
reimbursable as an allowable program cost. In other words, any applicable 
matching share requirement will apply equally to the relocation payments. 

B-215646, Aug. 7, 1984. 

(5) Payments by other than grantor agency 
Of course there is nothing wrong with grantees receiving funds from more 
than one federal source, including other federal grants for which they are 
eligible. If the grants are administered by different agencies, each agency is 
making payments under its own program. Occasionally, an agency is asked 
to make payments not associated with any of its own assistance programs, 
to a grantee or grant beneficiary under some other agency’s program. The 
cases fall into two groups. 

The first situation involves services performed by an assistance beneficiary 
to an agency other than the grantor agency. Under the College Work-Study 
Program, not to exceed 75, or 90 in certain cases, percent of the student’s 
salary is paid by the college under a Department of Education grant, with 
the remainder paid by the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 2753(b)(5). The 
“employer” may be another federal agency. 46 Comp. Gen. 115 (1966). In 
addition to the salary contribution, the employing agency may pay 
unreimbursed administrative costs such as social security taxes and 
compensation insurance. 50 Comp. Gen. 553 (1971); 46 Comp. Gen. 115. 
However, an agency may not, without statutory authority, participate in a 
work-study program authorized by state law and not coordinated with the 
federal program. B-159715, Dec. 18, 1978. 

The authority to pay administrative costs under the work-study program is 
based on the cost-sharing nature of that program. Absent comparable costsharing 
provisions, there is no authority to pay administrative costs. 
61 Comp. Gen. 242 (1982) (agency to which employee had been assigned 
under former Comprehensive Employment and Training Act lacked 
authority to reimburse grantee for retirement contributions). 

The second group of cases involves projects which benefit other federal 
facilities. Under program legislation which does not give the grantor 
agency discretion to reduce the federal share, the grantor agency is not 
authorized to exclude from total cost a portion of an otherwise eligible 
project solely because that portion would provide service to another 
federal facility. 59 Comp. Gen. 1 (1979). Where the grantor agency has 

Page 10-100 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

reduced its contribution because a portion of the project would serve 
another federal facility, the “benefited agency” normally would not be 
authorized to make up the shortfall without receiving additional 
consideration above and beyond the improved service it would have 
received anyway. B-189395, Apr. 27, 1978. However, if Congress chooses to 
appropriate funds to the benefited agency to make up the shortfall, the 
benefited agency may make otherwise proper contributions without 
requiring additional legal consideration as long as its contribution, when 
added to the amount contributed by the grantor agency, does not exceed 
the statutorily specified federal share. 59 Comp. Gen. 1; B-198450, Oct. 2, 
1980; B-199534, B-200086, Oct. 2, 1980. 

The illustration given in 59 Comp. Gen. 1 may help to clarify these 
principles. Suppose the statutory federal share is 75 percent and the total 
project cost is $10 million. The federal share is 75 percent of $10 million, or 
$7.5 million. Now suppose the grantor agency determines that 20 percent 
of the project will serve another federal facility. Under 59 Comp. Gen. 1, it 
is improper for the grantor agency to reduce total cost by 20 percent (i.e., 
from $10 million to $8 million) and to then contribute only 75 percent of the 
$8 million, for a federal share of $6 million. The correct federal share 
should have remained 75 percent of $10 million. 

Suppose further that the grantor agency has made the reduction and 
Congress appropriates money to the benefited agency to make up the 
shortfall. Using the same hypothetical figures, the benefited agency may 
contribute $1.5 million (20 percent of the federal share of $7.5 million) as 
the federal share of that portion of the project attributable to its use, 
without further legal consideration. However, as mentioned above, its 
contribution, when added to the contribution of the grantor agency, may 
not exceed the specified statutory share unless further legal consideration 
is received by the government. 

The decision at 59 Comp. Gen. 1 and the two October 1980 decisions 
resulted from a disagreement between GAO and the Environmental 
Protection Agency over grant funding policy under the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act, commonly known as the Clean Water Act, codified at 
33 U.S.C. §§ 1251–1387. The Act authorized EPA to make 75 percent81 
construction grants for wastewater treatment systems. EPA construed the

Pub. L. No. 97-117, § 7, 95 Stat. 1623, 1625 (Dec. 29, 1981). See B-207211-O.M., July 9, 1982.

b. Maintenance of Effort 
Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

statute as permitting it to proportionately reduce its contribution to the 
extent a project benefits other federal facilities. As noted, GAO concluded 
that EPA lacked authority to reduce its contribution below 75 percent, and 
that the benefited agencies could not make up the shortfall. EPA disagreed, 
and to resolve the funding impasse, Congress, apparently as a temporary 
expedient, provided funds to certain agencies, specifically the Army and 
the Navy. However, Congress did not provide funds for the Air Force to 
offset the reduced grants, and the issue arose again in B-194912, Aug. 24, 
1981. The Comptroller General reaffirmed GAO’s position and concluded 
that, absent specific congressional approval, the appropriations of the Air 
Force were not available to make up for the reduced grant amounts. 

Suppose the state of New Euphoria spends around a million dollars a year 
for the control of noxious pests. After several years, the continued 
proliferation of noxious pests leads Congress to conclude that the program 
is not going as well as everyone might like, and that federal financial 
assistance is in order. Congress therefore enacts legislation and 
appropriates funds to provide annual pest-control grants of half a million 
dollars to each affected state. 

New Euphoria applies for and receives its grant. Like most other states, 
however, New Euphoria is strapped for money and faced with various 
forms of taxpayer revolt. While the state government certainly believes 
that noxious pests merit control, it would, if it had free choice in the matter, 
rather use the money on what it regards as higher priority programs. The 
state uses the $500,000 federal grant for its pest control program; it has no 
choice because it has contractually committed itself with the federal 
government to do so as a condition of receiving the grant. However, it then 
takes $500,000 of its own money away from pest control and applies it to 
other programs. If the purpose of the federal grant legislation is simply to 
provide general financial support to New Euphoria, that purpose has been 
accomplished and the state has clearly benefited. But if the federal 
purpose is to fund an increased level of pest control activity, the objective 
has just as clearly been frustrated. 

When Congress wants to avoid this result, a device it commonly uses is the 
“maintenance of effort” requirement. Under a maintenance of effort 
provision, the grantee is required, as a condition of eligibility for federal 
funding, to maintain its financial contribution to the program at not less 
than a stated percentage (which may be 100 percent or less) of its 
contribution for a prior time period, usually the previous fiscal year. The 
purpose of maintenance of effort is to ensure that the federal assistance 

Page 10-102 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

results in an increased level of program activity, and that the grantee, as did 
New Euphoria, does not simply replace grantee dollars with federal dollars. 
GAO has observed that maintenance of effort, since it requires a specified 
level of grantee spending, “effectively serves as a matching requirement.” 
GAO, Proposed Changes in Federal Matching and Maintenance of Effort 
Requirements for State and Local Governments, GAO/GGD-81-7 
(Washington, DC: Dec. 23, 1980), at 2. 

GAO has also observed that a grant for something the grantee is already 
spending its own money on is, without maintenance of effort, little more 
than another form of revenue sharing. 

“When Federal grant money is used to substitute for 
ongoing or planned State and local expenditures, the 
ultimate effect of the Federal program funds is to provide 
fiscal relief for recipient States and localities rather than to 
increase service levels in the program area. When fiscal 
substitution occurs, narrow-purpose categorical Federal 
programs enacted to augment service levels are 
transformed, in effect, into broad purpose fiscal assistance 
like revenue sharing. Maintenance of effort provisions, if 
effective, can prevent substitution and ensure that the 
Federal grant is used by the grantee for the specific purpose 
intended by the Congress.” 

GAO/GGD-81-7, at 48–49. See also GAO, Block Grants: Issues in 
Designing Accountability Provisions, GAO/AIMD-95-226, (Washington, 
D.C.: Sept. 1, 1995), at 17–18. 

One type of maintenance of effort requirement is illustrated by the 
following provision from the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7405(c)(1): 

“No [air pollution control] agency shall receive any grant 
under this section during any fiscal year when its 
expenditures of non-Federal funds for recurrent 
expenditures for air pollution control programs will be less 
than its expenditures were for such programs during the 
preceding fiscal year. . . .” 

A variation is found in 20 U.S.C. § 7901, which is applicable to certain 
education grants. The basic requirement is in section 7901(a):

“A local educational agency may receive funds under a 
covered program for any fiscal year only if the State 
educational agency finds that either the combined fiscal 
effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of the 
agency and the State with respect to the provision of free 
public education by the agency for the preceding fiscal year 
was not less than 90 percent of the combined fiscal effort or 
aggregate expenditures for the second preceding fiscal 
year.” 

Maintenance of effort statutes will invariably provide fiscal sanctions if the 
grantee does not meet its commitment. Sanction provisions are of two 
types. Under one version, the grantee’s allocation of federal funds is 
reduced in the same proportion as its contribution fell below the required 
level. For example, 20 U.S.C. § 7901(b)(1) provides: 

“The State educational agency shall reduce the amount of 
the allocation of funds under a covered program in any 
fiscal year in the exact proportion by which a local 
educational agency fails to meet the requirement of 
subsection (a) of this section by falling below 90 percent of 
both the combined fiscal effort per student and aggregate 
expenditures (using the measure most favorable to the local 
agency).” 

The second and more severe version is illustrated by the Clean Air Act 
provision quoted above and discussed in B-209872-O.M., Mar. 23, 1984, an 
internal GAO memorandum. Under this version, the grantee, falling short 
of its maintenance of effort commitment, loses all grant funds under the 
program for that fiscal year. GAO has endorsed the enactment of 
legislation making proportionate reduction the standard rather than total 
withdrawal. GAO/GGD-81-7, at 71. 

Some maintenance of effort statutes authorize the administering agency to 
waive the requirement for a specified time period if some natural disaster 
or other unforeseen event caused the funding shortfall. An illustration is 
20 U.S.C. § 7901(c): 

“The Secretary may waive the requirements of this section if 
the Secretary determines that a waiver would be equitable 
due to— 

Page 10-104 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

(1)exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a 
natural disaster; or 
(2)a precipitous decline in the financial resources of the local 
educational agency.” 
If a grantee fails to meet its commitment and the noncompliance cannot be 
waived, any disbursement of federal funds in excess of the amount 
permitted by the program statute must generally be recovered. 51 Comp. 
Gen. 162 (1971). Failure to require repayment of such funds “would, in 
effect, constitute the giving away of United States funds without authority 
of law.” Id. at 165.82 

A variation of the maintenance of effort provision is the so-called 
“nonsupplant” provision, which requires that federal funds be used to 
supplement, and not supplant, nonfederal funds which would otherwise 
have been made available. Nonsupplant is sometimes used in conjunction 
with maintenance of effort. For example, in addition to coverage under the 
maintenance of effort provision at 20 U.S.C. § 7901, quoted above, certain 
education grant programs are also covered under 20 U.S.C. § 6321(b)(1): 

“A State educational agency or local educational agency 
shall use Federal funds received under this part only to 
supplement the funds that would, in the absence of such 
Federal funds, be made available from non-Federal sources 
for the education of pupils participating in programs 
assisted under this part, and not to supplant such funds.” 

GAO has reported on the difficulty with monitoring and enforcing 
nonsupplant provisions. See GAO, Disadvantaged Students: Fiscal 
Oversight of Title I Could Be Improved, GAO-03-377 (Washington, D.C.: 
Feb. 28, 2003); Welfare Reform: Challenges in Maintaining a Federal-
State Fiscal Partnership, GAO-01-828 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 10, 2001); 

82 See Chapter 10, section H for a general discussion of recovery of grantee indebtedness.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

GAO/GGD-81-7, at 71.83 These reports noted that in flexible grant 
environments, a strong maintenance of effort provision may prove more 
useful than a traditional nonsupplant requirement. While a nonsupplant 
provision might limit the intended breadth of a block grant by locking 
states into a pre-established funding priorities, a strong maintenance of 
effort provision might both limit substituting federal funds for state and 
local funds while providing greater state discretion. GAO-03-377, at 25; 
GAO-01-828, at 47. 

F. Obligation of 
Appropriations for 
Grants 
1. Requirement for 
Obligation 
As with any other type of expenditure, the expenditure of federal 
assistance program funds requires an obligation that is proper in terms of 
purpose, time, and amount, and the obligation must be properly recorded.84 
With respect to recording of the obligation in the grant or subsidy context, 
31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(5) requires that the obligation be supported by 
documentary evidence of a grant payable— 

“(A) from appropriations made for payment of, or 
contributions to, amounts required to be paid in specific 
amounts fixed by law or under formulas prescribed by law; 

83 The 1980 report also noted: 

“Most Federal program officials we contacted agreed that nonsupplant is 
difficult, if not impossible, to enforce because it calls for an external judgment 
on what grantees would have done if Federal funds were not available. 
Basically, this calls for a Federal agency to assess the motives behind 
particular changes in State and local plans or budgets and to judge whether 
the presence of Federal grant funds drove the particular State or local action.” 

GAO/GGD-81-7, at 54. 

84 The purpose, time, and amount requirements are essentially the same for grants as for 
other expenditures. What constitutes an obligation in the grant context, and what will or 
will not satisfy 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(5), are discussed in more detail in section C.2 of this 
chapter and in Chapter 7, section B.5. 

Page 10-106 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

“(B) under an agreement authorized by law; or 

“(C) under plans approved consistent with and authorized 
by law.” 

Briefly stated, the “obligational event” for a grant generally occurs at the 
time of grant award. Therefore, this is when the grantor agency must 
record an obligation under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(5), not when the grantee 
draws down the funds or when the grantee incurs its own obligations. See 
B-300480, Apr. 9, 2003, aff’d, B-300480.2, June 6, 2003. 

2. Changes in Grants Changes in grants may come about for a variety of reasons: the original 
grantee may be unable to perform, the grant amount may be increased, 
there may be a redefinition of objectives, etc. If the change occurs in the 
same fiscal year (or longer period if a multiple year appropriation is 
involved) in which the original grant was made, there is no obligation 
problem as long as the amount of the appropriation available for obligation 
is not exceeded. If, however, the change occurs in a later fiscal year, the 
question becomes whether the amended grant remains chargeable to the 
appropriation initially obligated or whether it constitutes a new obligation 
chargeable to appropriations current at the time the change is made. As 
pointed out in 58 Comp. Gen. 676, 680 (1979), the cases have identified 
three closely related areas of concern that must be satisfied before a 
change may be viewed as a so-called “replacement grant,” that is, not as 
creating a new obligation that must be charged to the current 
appropriation: 
• the bona fide need for the grant project must continue; 
• the purpose of the grant from the government’s standpoint must remain 
the same; and 
• the revised grant must have the same scope. 
The “scope” of a grant, as stated in 58 Comp. Gen. at 681— 

“grows out of the grant purposes. These purposes must be 
referred to in order to identify those aspects of a grant that 
make up the substantial and material features of a particular 

Page 10-107 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

grant which in turn fix the scope of the Government’s 
obligation.” 

As a general proposition, a grant amendment which changes the scope of 
the grant or which makes the award to an entirely different grantee (not a 
successor to the original grantee), and which is executed after the 
appropriation under which the original grant was made has ceased to be 
available for obligation, may not be charged to the original appropriation. 
58 Comp. Gen. 676 (1979). If the amendment amounts to a substitute grant, 
it extinguishes the old obligation and creates a new one. Id. at 678. The 
new obligation is chargeable to the appropriation available at the time the 
new obligation is created. Id. There are also situations where a grant 
amendment creates a new obligation chargeable to the later appropriation 
without extinguishing the original obligation. Id. In either event, if the 
grantor agency does not recognize that the change creates a new obligation 
when the change is made, there is a potential Antideficiency Act violation. 
On the other hand, a change which qualifies as a “replacement grant” 
remains chargeable to the original appropriation. 57 Comp. Gen. 205, 
208–09 (1978). Of course, an agency with the requisite program authority 
can change the scope of a grant if current appropriations are used. 
60 Comp. Gen. 540, 543 (1981). 

The clearest example of a change that creates a new obligation is where the 
amount of the award is increased. If the grantee has no legal right 
stemming from the original grant agreement to compel execution of the 
amendment, the increase in amount is a new obligation chargeable to 
appropriations current when the change is made. 41 Comp. Gen. 134 
(1961); 39 Comp. Gen. 296 (1959); 37 Comp. Gen. 861 (1958). However, an 
upward adjustment in a “provisional indirect cost rate” contained in a grant 
award, which contemplated a possible increase in the indirect cost rate at a 
later date, does not constitute an additional or new award. 48 Comp. 
Gen. 186 (1968). Payments resulting from such an adjustment are 
chargeable to the appropriation originally obligated by the grant. Id. 
Similarly, the increase in a grant award to cover the cost of audits that were 
required under the original grant agreement was within the scope of the 
grant awards. 72 Comp. Gen. 175 (1993). Payments necessary to cover the 
audit costs can be made out of the expired appropriations that were 
originally obligated for the grants. Id. 

As a general rule, when a recipient of a grant is unable to implement the 
grant as originally contemplated, and an alternative grantee is designated 
subsequent to the expiration of the period of availability for obligation of 

Page 10-108 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

the grant funds, the award to the alternative grantee must be treated as a 
new obligation and is not properly chargeable to the appropriation current 
at the time the original grant was made. B-164031(5), June 25, 1976; 

B-114876, A-44014, Jan. 21, 1960. 

However, it is possible in certain situations to make an award to an 
alternative grantee after expiration of the period of availability for 
obligation where the alternative award amounts to a “replacement grant” 
and is substantially identical in scope and purpose to the original grant. 
57 Comp. Gen. 205 (1978); B-157179, Sept. 30, 1970. In the latter decision, 
the Comptroller General did not object to the use of unexpended grant 
funds originally awarded to the University of Wisconsin to engage 
Northwestern University in a new fiscal year to complete the unfinished 
project. Approval was granted because the project director had transferred 
from the University of Wisconsin to Northwestern University and he was 
viewed by all the parties as the only person capable of completing the 
work. The decision also noted that the original grant was made in response 
to a bona fide need then existing, and that the need for completing the 
project continued to exist.85 

GAO has also indicated that it might be possible in certain situations to 
develop procedures to designate an alternate grantee at the time an award 
is made to the principal grantee, provided that all of the criteria for 
selection of the principal and required administrative action are also met 
concerning the alternate, with the sole exception that the award to the 
alternate is not mailed to it pending a determination as to whether the 
principal actually complies with the terms of the award. The validity of any 
such procedure would have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. 

B-114876, July 29, 1960; B-114876, Mar. 15, 1960. 

A shift in the community to be served by the grant may constitute a new 
obligation depending on the circumstances. Thus, in B-164031(5), June 25, 
1976, the original grantee ran into financial difficulties and was unable to 
utilize a hospital modernization award under the Hill-Burton program. The 
Comptroller General found that a proposal to shift the award to another 
hospital would constitute a new undertaking rather than a replacement 
grant since the hospitals were over 100 miles apart and served essentially 
different communities. 

85 See section C.2.b of this chapter for a discussion of the applicability of the bona fide needs 
rule to grants. 

Page 10-109 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

An enlargement of the community to be served will not necessarily 
constitute a new obligation. The grant in 58 Comp. Gen. 676 (1979) was to 
set up a demonstration community service volunteer program. The grant 
defined the number of participants deemed necessary to generate the 
desired test results. The geographic site for which the grant was awarded 
was expected to produce the necessary number of volunteers, but did not. 
It was held that the geographical area could be expanded to produce the 
desired number of volunteers. The modification in these circumstances 
would not constitute a new and separate undertaking and could be funded 
from the appropriation originally obligated. 

A change in the research objectives of a grant will constitute a new 
obligation notwithstanding that some aspects of the original grant and the 
modification may be related. 57 Comp. Gen. 459 (1978). See also 39 Comp. 
Gen. 296 (1959). 

A 1969 decision involved amendments by the National Institute of Mental 
Health which would change the use of grant funds from construction to 
renovation and vice-versa beyond the period of obligational availability. 
Since the amendments met the statutory eligibility criteria, since they 
would still accomplish the original grant objectives, and since they 
involved neither a change in grantees nor an increase in amount, they were 
held permissible under the original obligations. B-74254, Sept. 3, 1969.

G. Grant Costs 
1. Allowable versus 
Unallowable Costs 
a. The Concept of Allowable 
Costs 
Recipients of assistance awards are expected to use the assistance funds 
for the purposes for which they were awarded, subject to any conditions 
that may attach to the award. Expenditures or costs that meet the grant 
purposes and conditions are termed “allowable costs.” An expenditure 
which is not for grant purposes or is contrary to a condition of the grant is 
not an allowable cost and may not be properly charged to the grant. 

Allowable costs are determined on the basis of the relevant program 
legislation, regulations, including OMB circulars and the common rules, 
and the terms of the grant agreement. First and foremost, of course, is the 
program statute. Thus, where the legislation and legislative history of a 
program clearly limited the purposes for which grant funds could be used, 
grantees could not use grant funds for nonspecified purposes, including 
one for which Congress had provided funds under a separate 
appropriation. 35 Comp. Gen. 198 (1955). In 55 Comp. Gen. 652 (1976), 
however, a statute prohibiting certain costs was held to apply only to direct 
costs and, absent legislative history to the contrary, did not preclude use of 
standard indirect cost rates even though technically a percentage of the 
indirect cost rates could be attributed to the prohibited items. 

The role of agency regulations is illustrated by California v. United States, 
547 F.2d 1388 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 824 (1977). Under the 
Federal-Aid Highway Act, 23 U.S.C. § 120, the United States pays 90 percent 
of the “total cost” of certain highway construction, with “cost” being 
defined to include the cost of right-of-way acquisition. The Federal 
Highway Administration had issued a policy memorandum stating that 
program funds would not be used to pay interest on any portion of a 
condemnation award or settlement for more than 30 days after the money 
is deposited with the court. California challenged the restriction. The 
court said: 

“Certainly, Congress must have intended that the statutory 
obligation to pay 90 percent of the total cost must include 
some corresponding right to impose reasonable limitations 

Page 10-111 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

upon such costs, rather than to leave the Federal Treasury 
at the mercy of unfettered discretion by the State as to what 
expenditures may be made and charged accordingly.” 

Id. at 1390. The court saw no need to decide whether the policy 
memorandum rose to the level of a “regulation.” Either way, it was a 
reasonable exercise of the agency’s authority to administer the program. 
See also Louisiana Department of Highways v. United States, 604 F.2d 
1339 (Ct. Cl. 1979) (Federal Highway Administration regulation disallowing 
costs of grantee settlements of worthless claims). 

Several GAO decisions illustrate the significance of the grant agreement. 
For example, where a grant application specified that certain costs would 
be incurred and the program legislation was ambiguous as to whether 
those costs should be allowed, the grantor agency was held bound by the 
grant agreement, that is, by its acceptance of the application. B-118638.101, 
Oct. 29, 1979. 

As discussed previously, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
prescribes guidance on federal assistance cost principles. This guidance is 
found in a series of OMB Circulars: No. A-21, Cost Principles for 
Educational Institutions (May 10, 2004); No. A-87, Cost Principles for 
State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments (May 10, 2004); and 
No. A-122, Cost Principles for Non-profit Organizations (May 10, 2004). 
These circulars are incorporated in the common rules issued by the 
individual grantor agencies. The Department of Agriculture common rules, 
for example, reference the OMB cost principles at 7 C.F.R. § 3016.22(b) 
(2005).86

 As explained in OMB Circular No. A-87, Attachment A (General Principles 
for Determining Allowable Costs), allowable costs are of two types, direct 
and indirect.87 Direct costs are items that are specifically identifiable and 

86 See section C.3.b of this chapter for a discussion of the nature and evolution of the 
common rules. As in earlier sections, we will cite to the Department of Agriculture version 
of the common rules for ease of presentation. 

87 Section D of Attachment A of the circular explains that there is no universal rule for 
classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect under every accounting system. “A cost 
may be direct with respect to some specific service or function, but indirect with respect to 
the Federal award or other final cost objective.” Id. § D.2. The most important requirement 
is to treat each cost item consistently in like circumstances as either direct or indirect. 

Page 10-112 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

attributable to a particular final cost objective. Id. § E.1. In other words, 
direct costs are obligations or expenditures of a recipient which can be tied 
to a particular award. For example, if a recipient purchases an item of 
equipment necessary to carry out a particular award, the purchase price is 
a direct cost under that award. Id. § E.2.c. Indirect costs are costs incurred 
for common objectives which cannot be directly charged to any single cost 
objective. Id. § F.1. A common example is depreciation. The concept of 
indirect costs is essentially an accounting device to permit the allocation of 
overhead in proportion to benefit. See B-203681, Sept. 27, 1982. 

The over-allocation of indirect costs is unauthorized and therefore 
unallowable. The reason is that 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) restricts the use of 
appropriated funds to the purposes for which they were appropriated, and 
payment of the over-allocation would not serve the purposes of the 
appropriation. B-203681, Sept. 27, 1982. 

A grantee may generally substitute other allowable costs for costs which 
have been disallowed, subject to any applicable cost ceiling. If additional 
funds become available as the result of a cost disallowance, those funds 
should be used to pay any “excess” allowable costs which could not be paid 
previously because of the ceiling. 68 Comp. Gen. 247, 248–49 (1989). The 
courts have also applied this concept in one form or another. In Institute 
for Technology Development v. Brown, 63 F.3d 445, 450–52 (5th Cir. 1995), 
the court explicitly followed the GAO approach and allowed costsubstitution. 
The court in New York v. Riley, 53 F.3d 520 (2nd Cir. 1995), 
referred to a similar administrative practice by the Department of 
Education, which it called “equitable offset,” whereby the Department 
could permit a grantee to substitute allowable costs for disallowed costs 
that could have been—but never were—charged to a grant. However, the 
court described this practice as embodying “concepts of equity, not 
entitlement as a matter of right.” Id. at 522. In any event, its applicability 
was a moot point in this case since the grantee could not document any 
potential allowable costs to substitute for costs that had been disallowed. 
Id. 

The familiar cost overrun is not the exclusive province of the government 
contractor. Assistance recipients may also incur overruns. A claim 
resulting from an overrun under a cooperative agreement was denied in 
B-206272.5, Mar. 26, 1985, because, under the agreement, the agency was 
not obligated to fund overruns unless it chose to amend the agreement and, 
in its discretion, it had declined to do so. Cf. B-209649, Dec. 23, 1983 (labor 
benefits awarded by court to employees of grantee’s contractor could be

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

regarded as indirect costs under grant terms, as long as applicable ceiling 
on indirect costs was not exceeded). 

Issues concerning allowable grant costs often involve technical disputes 
over accounting principles and practices that take place far from the public 
spotlight. However, a major and very public controversy arose in the early 
1990s centering on questionable items that universities were claiming as 
indirect “overhead” costs under federal research grants. These problems 
are detailed in Lynn McGuire, Federal Research Grant Funding at 
Universities: Legislative Waves From Auditors Diving Into Overhead 
Cost Pools, 23 Journal of College and University Law 563 (Winter 1997). 
Inquiries into alleged improper charges, which were spearheaded by the 
House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s Subcommittee on Oversight 
and Investigations, included a series of congressional hearings, GAO 
reviews, audits by executive branch agencies, and a report on the ABC 
television program 20/20. The allegations involved many of the nation’s 
leading academic institutions such as Harvard Medical School, Stanford 
University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. Alleged improper charges included depreciation 
for a 72-foot yacht, a public relations trip to Paris, a Nile River cruise, a 
Saint Patrick’s Day party, football tickets for potential university donors, 
and the purchase of an antique commode for the residence of a retired 
university chancellor. The problems resulted from what GAO described as 
“breakdowns in several key areas of the system dealing with indirect 
costs.” GAO, Federally Sponsored Research: Indirect Costs Charged by 
Selected Universities, GAO/T-RCED-92-20 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 29, 
1992), at 9. In that testimony, GAO identified the main areas of breakdown 
as follows: 

• Inadequate criteria in OMB Circular No. A-21 for determining allowable 
costs and how to allocate them among university functions; 
• Inadequate university systems and controls to ensure that only 
allowable indirect costs were charged to the federal government; and 
Page 10-114 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

• Lax oversight on the part of cognizant federal agencies that were 
responsible for auditing particular universities.88 
Remedial actions at the federal level included major revisions to enhance 
the guidance contained in OMB Circular No. A-21 and improved auditing 
procedures by the cognizant federal agencies. See McGuire, 23 J.C. & U.L. 
at 576–80. 

Where a cost is not allowable, as far as the government is concerned, the 
recipient still has the funds. If the grant funds have already been paid over 
to the grantee and no allowable costs of an equal amount are subsequently 
incurred, the recipient is required to return the amount of the improper 
charge to the government. E.g., Utah State Board for Vocational 
Education v. United States, 287 F.2d 713 (10th Cir. 1961). The United States 
“has a reversionary interest in the unencumbered balances of such grants, 
including any funds improperly applied.” 42 Comp. Gen. 289, 294 (1962). 
See also B-198493, July 7, 1980. This requirement cannot be waived. 
B-171019, June 3, 1975. Thus, the Comptroller General has held that an 
agency cannot waive its statutory regulations to relieve a grantee of its 
liability for improper expenditures. B-163922, Feb. 10, 1978. Similarly, an 
agency may not amend its regulations to relieve a grantee’s liability for 
expenditures for administrative costs in excess of a statutory limitation. 
B-178564, July 19, 1977, aff’d, 57 Comp. Gen. 163 (1977). 

The courts have endorsed the principle that the federal government has a 
reversionary interest in grant funds until they are properly applied and 
accounted for. Citing Buchanan v. Alexander, 45 U.S. (4 How.) 20 (1846), 
one court observed that a federal agency “has a strong and surprisingly 
ancient claim for its right to require the repayment of all funds which 
cannot be proven to have been spent on legitimate, allowable costs.” 
City of New York v. Sullivan, No. 91 Civ. 2959 (RWS), (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 
1993), slip op. at 11, rev’d on other grounds sub nom., 34 F.3d 1161 (2nd Cir. 
1994). The court elaborated on this point as follows: 

“Since federal money belongs to the federal government 
until actually spent on allowable costs, the [agency’s] 

88 Two other GAO products dealing with this subject are Federal Research: System for 
Reimbursing Universities’ Indirect Costs Should be Reevaluated, GAO/RCED-92-203

Charged by Stanford University, GAO/T-RCED-91-18 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 13, 1991).

decision—that the City must present source documentation 
which proves to [the agency’s] satisfaction that the money 
was drawn down to cover . . . [appropriate costs] or else 
return the money to the federal government—is not 
capricious or arbitrary.” 

City of New York v. Sullivan, slip op. at 11. Other recent decisions 
applying the reversionary interest concept in different contexts are In re 
Universal Security and Protection Service, Inc., 223 B.R. 88, 91–92 (Bankr. 

E.D.La. 1998); In re Alpha Center, Inc., 165 B.R. 881, 884 (Bankr. S.D. Ill 
1994); and Department of Housing and Urban Development v. 
K.Capolino Construction Corp., No. 01 Civ. 390 (JGK), (S.D.N.Y. 2001), 
slip. op. at 4–6. 
While not directed specifically at the problems described above, Congress 
enacted two laws during the 1990s to streamline, simplify, and thereby

GAO has continued to review issues relating to the appropriateness of 
grant costs and the processes by which they are determined. Examples 
include: Grants Management: EPA Actions Taken against Nonprofit 
Grant Recipients in 2002, GAO-04-383R (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 30, 2004); 
Disadvantaged Students: Fiscal Oversight of Title I Could Be Improved,

b. Grant Cost Cases Grant cost cases are extremely difficult to categorize because what is 
allowable under one assistance program may not be allowable under 
another. Also, the cases frequently turn on complex accounting and factual 
issues that are unique to the particular case. Accordingly, summaries of a 
number of cases are given below with little further attempt to generalize. 
However, it is first important to describe one recurring theme that runs 
through most of the cases and often appears to have a decisive effect on the 
outcome: the high degree of judicial deference accorded to agency findings 
of fact and interpretations of the applicable statutes and regulations. 
(1) Scope of judicial review 
Grant cost cases typically come to the courts in the form of appeals from an 
agency determination that often follows an administrative hearing by an 
agency appeals board.90 These court cases are generally governed by the 
judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 
5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706. Under the most relevant scope of review standards, an 
agency action will be sustained unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of 
discretion, not otherwise in accordance with law, procedurally flawed, or 
unsupported by substantial evidence. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (D), (E). 
Likewise, the courts will generally accord considerable deference to the 
agency’s interpretation of the applicable statutes and regulations, although 
the precise extent of deference varies.91 One recent grant cost case 
described the standards of review as follows: 

“Under the APA, we may set aside agency action only if it 
was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or 
otherwise not in accordance with law. The standard is a 
narrow one, and the reviewing court may not substitute its 
judgment for that of the agency. However, the agency must 
articulate a rational connection between the facts found and 
the conclusions made. Also, we must give substantial 

90 For example, a number of the court cases discussed below are appeals from decisions of 
the Department of Health and Human Services Departmental Appeals Board (DAB). 
According to the DAB’s Web site, it hears disputes that may involve as much as $1 billion in 
grant funds annually. See www.hhs.gov/dab/background.html (last visited September 15, 
2005). 

91 See Chapter 3, section B, for a general discussion of the extent of judicial deference to 
agency interpretations.

Agreements 

deference to an agency’s interpretation of its own 
regulations.” 


Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County, Washington v. Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, 371 F.3d 701, 706 (9th Cir. 2004) (citations 
and internal quotation marks omitted). 

Concerning the deference due agency regulatory interpretations, the court 
in Public Utility District No. 1 cited Thomas Jefferson University v. 
Shalala, 512 U.S. 504 (1994). In Thomas Jefferson University, the Supreme 
Court sustained the agency’s interpretation of a regulation dealing with the 
reimbursement of costs under the Medicare program, applying the 
following standards: 

“The APA . . . commands reviewing courts to hold unlawful 
and set aside agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an 
abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with 
law. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). We must give substantial 
deference to an agency’s interpretation of its own 
regulations. Our task is not to decide which among several 
competing interpretations best serves the regulatory 
purpose. Rather, the agency’s interpretation must be given 
controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or 
inconsistent with the regulation. In other words, we must 
defer to the Secretary’s interpretation unless an alternative 
reading is compelled by the regulation’s plain language or by 
other indications of the Secretary’s intent at the time of the 
regulation’s promulgation.” 

512 U.S. at 512 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 

Another grant cost case that also cited Thomas Jefferson University 
illustrates the decisive role that deference to agency interpretations can 
play. In Alabama v. Shalala, 124 F. Supp. 2d 1250 (M.D. Ala. 2000), the 
court acknowledged that both the grantee and the federal agency presented 
reasonable interpretations of the applicable cost criteria, but concluded 
that the agency’s interpretation must take precedence since it was 
“reasonable and not arbitrary or capricious.” Id. at 1259. 

Of course, even an agency determination that might otherwise be within its 
discretion will be overturned if it is procedurally defective. For example, 
the court in Arizona v. Thompson, 281 F.3d 248 (D.C. Cir. 2002), did not 

Page 10-118 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

question the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) to direct the allocation of common administrative costs among the 
multiple grant programs that they benefited, in accordance with a general 
principle in the then-current OMB Circular No. A-87 (Aug. 27, 1997), at 
Attachment A, § C.3.a. However, the court rejected the department’s 
directive because it rested on the faulty premise that the Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program statute mandated this cost 
allocation method: 

“[The] determination was made in reliance on HHS’ 
mistaken belief that the statute gave it no choice in the 
matter. Although nothing we have said necessarily 
precludes HHS, in the exercise of its discretion, from relying 
on the principles of Circular A-87 to determine the most 
appropriate cost allocation rule to apply to TANF, that is not 
the course the Department followed in this case.” 

281 F.3d at 259. See also Nebraska Department of Health & Human 
Services v. United States Department of Health & Human Services, 
340 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2004) (rejecting a similar cost allocation directive 
on the basis that it constituted a substantive rule issued without the noticeand-
comment rulemaking required by the Administrative Procedure Act). 

(2) Court case examples 
With the scope of review considerations in mind, we turn to some specific 
case examples. 

Under the cost principles OMB Circular No. A-87, contributions to a reserve 
for self-insurance are an allowable grant cost if certain conditions are met. 
However, Alabama violated OMB Circular No. A-87 by transferring the 
federal share of excess self-insurance reserves from its state insurance 
fund to its general treasury fund to be used for purposes unrelated to the 
federal grants that supplied the insurance contributions. Alabama v. 
Shalala, 124 F. Supp. 2d 1250 (M.D. Ala. 2000), affirming a decision of the 
Department of Health and Human Services Departmental Appeals Board 
(DAB).92 The court rejected Alabama’s argument that appropriate costs 

92 The version of OMB Circular No. A-87 applicable to the transfers at issue was dated 
January 28, 1981. Alabama, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 1253, fn.2. The self-insurance reserve 
provision in that version was in Attachment B, § C.4(c). Id. at 1254. 

Page 10-119 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

were incurred, and the transaction was in effect complete once the grant 
funds were initially paid into the state insurance fund. Instead, the court 
held that the insurance contributions retained their character as federal 
funds and remained subject to OMB Circular No. A-87 until they were 
disbursed by the state insurance fund. Id. at 1257–60.93 The court also 
rejected Alabama’s argument that a subsequent amendment to Circular 
No. A-87 which specifically prohibited the transfer of the federal share of 
insurance contributions to other state funds demonstrated that such 
transfers were appropriate before the amendment. Id. at 1257, fn. 9 (“the 
amendments may have made more explicit requirements that had always 
existed under the cost principles and other sources of federal 
appropriations law”).94 

In a case very similar to Alabama v. Shalala, the court in Oklahoma ex rel. 
Office of State Finance v. United States, 292 F.3d 1261 (10th Cir. 2002), cert. 
denied, 537 U.S. 1188 (2003), affirmed the DAB’s disallowance of a portion 
of federal contributions for the health benefits of state employees who 
administered federal programs. The disallowance was triggered by the 
state’s transfer of the funds from an insurance reserve fund to a general 
fund to be used for state educational expenditures rather than state 
employee health benefits. The court held that the amended version of OMB 
Circular No. A-87 was dispositive and “singularly fatal” to the state’s appeal: 

“OMB [Circular No.] A-87’s definition of ‘cost’ excludes 
‘transfers to a general or similar fund.’ . . . Federal monies 
forwarded to Oklahoma’s Clearing Fund represent 
unrecoverable ‘transfers to a general or similar fund.’ Thus, 
there is no need to ascertain when federal money loses its 
federal nature, or even if the monies Oklahoma is 
attempting to be reimbursed for are necessary and 
reasonable expenditures. The money diverted to the 
Clearing Fund fails to qualify as a reimbursable cost in the 
first instance.” 

93 In this regard, the court relied on Pennsylvania Department of the Budget v. United 
States Department of Health & Human Services, 996 F.2d 1505 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 
510 U.S. 1010 (1993), discussed previously in section E of this chapter. 

94 The current version of OMB Circular No. A-87 (May 10, 2004) retains this prohibition at 
Attachment B, § 22.d(5) (“Whenever funds are transferred from a self-insurance reserve to 
other accounts (e.g., general fund), refunds shall be made to the Federal Government for its 
share of funds transferred, including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer.”).

Oklahoma, 292 F.3d at 1264. 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) acted reasonably in 
reducing a grantee’s fringe benefit overhead reimbursement for overtime 
labor from a uniform rate of 36 percent to about 10 percent, which 
approximated the actual overtime labor costs to the grantee. Public Utility 
District No. 1 of Snohomish County, Washington v. Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, 371 F.3d 701 (9th Cir. 2004). The grantee utility 
district argued that FEMA was attempting to “rewrite” the grant conditions 
by reducing the reimbursement rate based on a post-award audit by the 
agency’s inspector general since use of the 36 percent flat rate constituted a 
common accounting practice that was not prohibited by the grant terms. 
The court rejected this argument, holding that the language in OMB 
Circular No. A-87 making fringe benefits allowable costs “to the extent that 
the benefits are reasonable and are required by law” provided a basis for 
reducing the costs via a post-award audit: 

“We need not ponder whether the District’s use of a uniform 
fringe benefit overhead rate is a ‘proper’ or commonlyaccepted 
method of accounting for such expenses. This 
fact remains: the District has never challenged FEMA’s 
contention that the District’s actual fringe benefit expenses 
for overtime labor for work attributable to the 1995 and 
1996 storms was about ten percent, as opposed to the thirtysix 
percent billed by the District. 

“The District’s use of the thirty-six percent rate resulted in a 
sizable windfall—in excess of $600,000—for the District. 
That this windfall may have resulted from the District’s use 
of an accepted accounting practice is of no consequence. 
. . . FEMA did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner 
by challenging the District’s use of the thirty-six percent 
fringe benefit rate, where the use of the rate resulted in 
FEMA paying District expenses having nothing to do with 
the disasters for which federal relief was given.” 

Public Utility, 371 F.3d at 710. The court also sustained FEMA’s reduction 
of other costs reimbursed to the grantee based on the results of the 
inspector general audit, concluding that the disallowances were not 
arbitrary or capricious. Id. at 711–13.

The court affirmed a Department of Health and Human Services DAB 
decision upholding the denial of reimbursement for interest costs incurred 
by the state in acquiring computer equipment to be used to administer 
several social service programs partly funded by federal grants. 
New York v. Shalala, 959 F. Supp. 614 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), aff’d, 143 F.3d 119 
(2nd Cir. 1998). Again, the court held that the disallowances constituted a 
valid application of the cost principles embodied in OMB Circular No. A-87 
and, in turn, incorporated into Department of Health and Human Services 
regulations. Among other things,95 the state argued that (1) the applicable 
statutes provided for reimbursement of “necessary” expenses, (2) interest 
was a necessary expense, and (3) therefore, the circular’s exclusion of 
interest violated the statutes. However, the court held that, since the 
relevant statutes did not specifically address reimbursement of interest, the 
federal agencies had discretion to determine whether and to what extent 
interest constituted a “necessary” expense: 

“[The state’s] . . . interpretation . . . may be as reasonable as 
the Secretary’s; however, this is not the standard the Court 
applies in reviewing an agency’s construction of a statute. 
Even where the State offers a reasonable alternative 
interpretation of a statute, the decision of where to ‘draw 
the line’ with respect to reimbursing costs is left to the 
discretion of the agency. HHS’s interpretation of the 
Statutes need only be reasonable—it need not be the only 
reasonable interpretation.” 

New York, 959 F. Supp. at 620–21 (emphasis in original; citations omitted). 

The court in Delta Foundation, Inc. v. United States, 303 F.3d 551 (5th Cir. 
2002), affirmed a DAB decision that sustained a series of cost 
disallowances arising from an inspector general audit of community 

95 The state also argued, to no avail, that OMB lacked authority to prescribe governmentwide 
cost principles and that the Department of Health and Human Services violated the 
notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act in incorporating the 
circular into its own regulations. On the former point, the court stated: 

“OMB has been deemed ‘the President’s principal arm for the exercise of his 
managerial functions.’ . . . One such managerial function is to provide federal 
agencies with consistent, government-wide policy guidance.” 

New York, 959 F. Supp. at 618. On the latter point, it observed that the state was on notice of 
the circular’s provisions and failed to object to them for at least 20 years. Id. at 619.

Agreements 

development block grants. The case is quite fact-specific, but it illustrates 
the principles of deference to agency findings and interpretations 
discussed previously. It also demonstrates the importance of grantee 
compliance with record-keeping and cost-documentation requirements. 
For example, the court observed with reference to certain disallowed 
costs: 

“As the Board correctly noted, the Circular [OMB Circular 
No. A-122] requires that Delta supply time records reflecting 
‘the distribution of activity of each employee’ and ‘account 
for the total activity for which employees are compensated.’ 
. . . The Board’s refusal to accept Delta’s ‘good word’ in 
place of the required documentation is certainly not 
arbitrary and capricious.” 

Delta Foundation, 303 F.3d at 570. But see Institute for Technology 
Development v. Brown, 63 F.3d 445, 454–58 (5th Cir. 1995) (decision is 
somewhat unusual since the court rejected the agency’s determination that 
depreciation did not constitute an allowable cost under the applicable 
regulations and grant agreements, prompting a dissent criticizing the 
majority for not deferring to the agency on this point). 

In Missouri Department of Social Services v. United States Department of 
Education, 953 F.2d 372 (8th Cir. 1992), the court affirmed the agency’s right 
to recover excess salary costs paid to the grantee. The court agreed that 
the grantee did not maintain adequate accounting procedures and records 
to apportion its employees’ salaries between time relating to the federal 
grants and time spent on nongrant activities, as required by federal 
regulations. The court also upheld the agency’s determination that the 
grantee’s circumstances did not meet the requirements of a regulation 
excusing the repayment of unallowable costs in the presence of “mitigating 
circumstances.” Id. at 376. 

Board of Trustees of Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of Indiana v. 
Sullivan, 936 F.2d 988 (7th Cir. 1991), cert denied, 502 U.S. 1072 (1992), 
affirmed a decision by the DAB that the grantee was reimbursed excess 
payments for the retirement benefits of state employees who administered 
federal grant programs. An audit had determined that the state made 
retirement contributions on behalf of state employees administering 
federal grants that were greater than its contributions for state employees 
who performed only nonfederal activities and were wholly state funded. 
The court agreed that this violated the federal cost principle that, in order 

Page 10-123 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

to be allowable, a cost must be consistent with policies, regulations, and 
procedures that apply uniformly to both federally assisted and other 
activities of the grantee: 

“Whatever the state actually pays to state workers is the 
benchmark for measuring the federal government’s share. 
Indiana pays its public workers partly in cash and partly in 
promises. Indiana is free to make that choice for itself but 
may not claim 100% in cash up front from the federal 
government if it is unwilling to put the retirement program 
for other state employees on an equivalently well-funded 
basis.” 

Sullivan, 936 F.2d at 992. 

Litigation costs incurred by grantees in suing the United States were found 
unallowable under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, 42 U.S.C. 
§§ 10101–10226. Nevada v. Herrington, 827 F.2d 1394 (9th Cir. 1987). 

(3) GAO case examples 
GAO has also had occasion over the years to consider grant cost issues. 
The following are examples of GAO decisions discussing various grant 
programs. 

GAO held that the Asia Foundation may not use its general support grant 
funds from the Department of State to match other federal grants from the 
Agency for International Development and the United States Information 
Agency. Generally, funds derived from other federal grants do not qualify 
as matching funds unless statutorily authorized. The Asia Foundation does 
not have specific statutory authority to use grant funds to match other 
federal grants. B-270654, May 6, 1996. 

Under applicable OMB Circulars, the cost of grant audits is an allowable 
cost. Therefore, the National Endowment for the Humanities could 
provide grant funds to nonprofit institutions to cover such audit costs, and 
could increase a grant award to accommodate such costs where the initial 
award was inadequate for this purpose. 72 Comp. Gen. 175, 177 (1993). 

Recovery of antitrust damages by a state grantee stemming from a grantfinanced 
project serves to reduce the actual costs of the grantee and must 
be accounted for to the government. This is true even where the United 

Page 10-124 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

States has declined to participate in the cost of the antitrust action. 
57 Comp. Gen. 577 (1978). However, the United States is not entitled to 
share in treble damages. Id.; 47 Comp. Gen. 309 (1967). Out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by the state in effecting the recovery should be shared 
by the federal government in the same proportion as the recovered 
damages. B-162539, Oct. 11, 1967. 

Where a grantee paid a nondiscriminatory sales tax on otherwise proper 
expenditures with grant funds, the taxes are not taxes imposed on the 
United States and are allowable. 37 Comp. Gen. 85 (1957). However, 
property taxes were held not allowable under a construction grant because 
they represent operating costs rather than construction costs. B-166506, 
Feb. 14, 1973. 

The payment of expert witness fees was found unrelated to the purposes of 
a research grant. 42 Comp. Gen. 682 (1963). 

Construction of a bridge could not be paid for out of federal aid highway 
funds where the construction was necessitated by a flood control project 
and not as a highway project. 41 Comp. Gen. 606 (1962). 

Buses acquired by a city under a “mass transportation” grant could be used 
for charter service, an unauthorized grant purpose, where such use was 
merely incidental to the primary use of the buses for authorized mass 
transit purposes. B-160204, Dec. 7, 1966. 

The salary of an individual hired to evaluate the Upward Bound Program at 
a grantee college was disallowed as a grant cost, because the grant 
document contained no provision for such an expenditure and the 
applicable program guidelines specified that evaluation was not an 
allowable expense. B-161980, Nov. 23, 1971. 

The cost of a luncheon for top officials of the Department of Human 
Resources, District of Columbia Government, was disallowed as an 
improper administrative expense under a social services program grant 
under Title XX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1397a. B-187150, 
Oct. 14, 1976. 

Ordinarily, increased project costs resulting from grantee negligence giving 
rise to justified claims for damages would not be allowable. However, a 
damage award was viewed as a recognizable cost element where the 
grantee’s error had contributed to an unrealistically low initial cost, but an 

Page 10-125 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


c. Note on Accounting 
Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

amendment to the grant was required before the increased costs could be 
allowed. 47 Comp. Gen. 756 (1968). 

Under a Federal Airport Act (Act of May 13, 1946, ch. 251, 60 Stat. 170) 
program providing for federal payment of a specified percentage of 
allowable project costs, the fair value of land and equipment donated to the 
grantee could be treated as an allowable cost because failure to do so 
would, in effect, penalize the grantee for the contributions of “public 
spirited citizens.” B-81321, Nov. 19, 1948. 

Cost principles on which a grant award is conditioned are binding on the 
grantee. B-203681, Sept. 27, 1982. It is the grantee’s responsibility to 
maintain adequate fiscal records to support the allowable costs claimed. 
With respect to the common rules applicable to state and local 
governments, see generally 7 C.F.R. § 3016.20. Section 452(a) of the 
General Education Provisions Act, as amended, 20 U.S.C. § 1234a(a), 
illustrates the importance of compliance with record-keeping 
requirements. It provides that the Secretary of Education’s burden of 
establishing a prima facie case for recovery of misspent grant funds is 
satisfied where the grantee fails to maintain records required by law or fails 
to afford the Secretary access to such records. 

As a number of the cases discussed above demonstrate, the courts tend to 
require strict adherence to grantee cost documentation and record-keeping 
requirements. Thus, the court observed in Montgomery County v. United 
States Department of Labor, 757 F.2d 1510, 1512–13 (4th Cir. 1985): 

“[T]he County contends that it is inequitable to equate its 
record-keeping failure with a misspending of federal monies 
and to require it to repay virtually all of the funds expended 
by its subgrantee . . . In support of its contention, the 
County asserts that the purposes of CETA [the 
Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] were met by 
[the subgrantee’s] performance and cites corrective steps 
which the County has since taken. . . . We are unpersuaded. 

* * * * * 

“Record keeping is at the heart of the federal oversight and 
evaluation provisions of CETA and its implementing 
regulations. Only by requiring documentation to support 

Page 10-126 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

expenditures is the [Department of Labor] able to verify that 
billions of federal grant dollars are spent for the purposes 
intended by Congress. Unless the burden of producing the 
required documentation is placed on recipients, federal 
grantees would be free to spend funds in whatever way they 
wished and obtain virtual immunity from wrongdoing by 
failing to keep required records. Neither CETA nor the 
regulations permit such anomalous results.” 

The above passage was quoted with approval in Louisiana Department of 
Labor v. United States Department of Labor, 108 F.3d 614, 618 (5th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 522 U.S. 823 (1997). The court in this case reached a similar 
result, adding: 

“We conclude that the final decision of the Secretary is 
based on substantial evidence, and that the state and the 
[grantee] and its subgrantees cavalierly disregarded the 
accounting requirements and procurement procedures 
specified by the JTPA [Job Training Partnership Act] and the 
accompanying regulations. Federal grant recipients who 
are entrusted with public funds are bound to fulfill that 
public trust by discharging their duties in strict compliance 
with the requirements established by Congress. 
Accordingly, we emphasize that the procedural 
requirements of the JTPA are not merely hortatory ideals; 
they are obligatory duties. Grant recipients who . . . fail to 
honor these procedural requirements, dishonor and 
disserve the public trust.” 

108 F.3d at 620. See also City of Newark v. United States Department of 
Labor, 2 F.3d 31, 34–35 (3rd Cir. 1993), to the same effect. 

In one case, GAO did concur in a proposal by a grantor agency to adopt a 
method of calculation that disallowed less than the entire amount of a grant 
where the grantee had maintained inadequate records. B-186166, Aug. 26, 
1976. In this case, a university had received a series of federal research 
grants spanning a number of years. The university had no records to 
document its disposition of grant funds for periods prior to fiscal year 1974. 
Audits of available university records for grant expenditures in fiscal years 
1974 and 1975 disclosed certain unallowable costs. The GAO decision held 
that the grantor agency had discretion to disallow the same proportion of 

Page 10-127 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

funds for the years for which no documentation was available as were 
disallowed for the periods for which records existed. 

In a variety of cases involving the Medicare and Medicaid programs, courts 
have approved cost reimbursement disallowances on the basis of error rate 
statistical data, such as errors imputed from a quality control system. In 
Georgia v. Califano, 446 F. Supp. 404, 409–10 (N.D. Ga. 1977), the court 
upheld the determination of overpayments under the Medicaid program on 
the basis of statistical sampling, in view of the “practical impossibility” of 
individual claim-by-claim audit. The court also noted that, under the 
pertinent federal regulations, the state was given the opportunity to present 
evidence before the disallowance became final. See also Ratanasen v. 
California Department of Health Services, 11 F.3d 1467, 1469–71 (9th Cir. 
1993); Chaves County Home Health Service, Inc. v. Sullivan, 931 F.2d 914 

(D.C.Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1091 (1992); Webb v. Shalala, 49 F. 
Supp. 2d 1114, 1123 (W.D. Ark. 1999) and cases cited. Likewise, random 
sampling has been sustained as an audit technique to identify improper 
expenditures of vocational rehabilitation grant funds. Michigan 
Department of Education v. United States Department of Education, 
875 F.2d 1196, 1205 (6th Cir. 1989) (“audit of the thousands of cases 
comprising the universe of cases would be impossible. . . . [and] . . . a final 
determination is not made until the state has had an opportunity to present 
its own evidence of an error in the audit”). 
In Maryland v. Mathews, 415 F. Supp. 1206 (D.D.C. 1976), a case involving 
the then Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, the court held 
that an agency can establish by regulation a withholding of federal financial 
participation in a specified amount set by a tolerance level, as long as the 
tolerance level is reasonable and supported by an adequate factual basis. 
The regulation involved in the specific case, however, did not meet the test 
and was found to be arbitrary and therefore invalid. It also has been held 
that, if setting a tolerance level is discretionary, the agency can set it at 
zero. Maryland Department of Human Resources v. United States 
Department of Health & Human Services, 762 F.2d 406 (4th Cir. 1985); 
California v. Settle, 708 F.2d 1380 (9th Cir. 1983). See also United States v. 
Texas, 507 U.S. 529 (1993), which involved statutory and regulatory 
provisions that required states to reimburse the federal government for a 
portion of the replacement costs of lost or stolen food stamps exceeding 
specified tolerance levels. (The validity of these requirements was not 
contested in this case.)

2. Pre-Award Costs 
(Retroactive Funding) 
“Retroactive funding” means the funding of costs incurred by a grantee 
before the grant was awarded. Three separate situations arise: (1) costs 
incurred prior to award but after the program authority has been enacted 
and the appropriation became available; (2) costs incurred prior to award 
and after program authority was enacted but before the appropriation 
became available; and (3) costs incurred prior to both program authority 
and appropriation availability. 

Situation (1): In this situation, the grantee seeks to charge costs incurred 
before the grant was awarded (in some cases even before the grantee 
submitted its application) but after both the program legislation and the 
implementing appropriation were enacted. 

There is no rule or policy that generally restricts allowable costs to those 
incurred after the award of a grant. However, agencies may adopt such a 
policy by regulation. B-197699, June 3, 1980. Thus, in a number of cases, 
grant-related costs incurred prior to award, but after the program was 
authorized and appropriated funds were available for obligation, have been 
allowed where (a) there was no contrary indication in the language or 
legislative history of the program statute or the appropriation, 

(b)allowance was not prohibited by the regulations of the grantor agency, 
and (c) the agency determined that allowance would be in the best interest 
of carrying out the statutory purpose. 32 Comp. Gen. 141 (1952); 31 Comp. 
Gen. 308 (1952); B-197699, June 3, 1980; B-133001, Mar. 9, 1979; B-75414, 
May 7, 1948. (The above criteria are not specified as such in any of the 
cases cited but are derived from viewing all of the cases as a whole.) 
Situation (2): In this situation, pre-award costs are incurred after program 
legislation has been enacted, but before an appropriation becomes 
available. 

Prior to the Comptroller General’s decision in 56 Comp. Gen. 31 (1976), a 
“general rule” was commonly stated to the effect that absent some 
indication of contrary intent, an appropriation could not be used to pay 
grant costs where the grantee’s obligation arose before the appropriation 
implementing the enabling legislation became available. 45 Comp. 
Gen. 515 (1966); 40 Comp. Gen. 615 (1961); 31 Comp. Gen. 308 (1952); 
A-71315, Feb. 28, 1936. 

In 56 Comp. Gen. 31, the Comptroller General reviewed the earlier 
decisions and concluded that there was no legal requirement for a general 
rule prohibiting the use of grant funds to pay for costs incurred prior to the 

Page 10-129 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

availability of the applicable appropriation. Rather, the determination 
should be made on a case-by-case basis. Thus, the decision announced: 

“We would prefer to base each decision from now on on the 
statutory language, legislative history, and particular factors 
operative in the particular case in question, rather than on a 
general rule.” 

Id. at 35. 

In reviewing the earlier decisions, the Comptroller General found that each 
had been correctly decided on its own facts. Thus, retroactive funding was 
prohibited in 40 Comp. Gen. 615 (1961), 31 Comp. Gen. 308 (1952), and 
A-71315, Feb. 28, 1936. However, in each of those cases, there was some 
manifestation of an affirmative intent that funds be used only for costs 
incurred subsequent to the appropriation. For example, 31 Comp. Gen. 308 
concerned grants to states under the Federal Civil Defense Act.96 The 
committee reports and debates on a supplemental appropriation to fund 
the program contained strong indications that Congress did not intend that 
the money be used to retroactively fund expenses incurred by states prior 
to the appropriation. By way of contrast, there were no such indications in 
the situation considered in 56 Comp. Gen. 31 (matching funds provided to 
states under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 196597). 
Accordingly, 56 Comp. Gen. 31 did not overrule the earlier decisions, but 
merely modified them to the extent that GAO would no longer purport to 
apply a “general rule” in this area. 

In determining whether retroactive funding is authorized, relevant factors 
are evidence and clarity of congressional intent, the degree of discretion 
given the grantor agency, and the proximity in time of the cost being 
incurred to the grant award. As in Situation (1), significant factors also 
include the agency’s own regulations and the agency’s determination that 
funding the particular costs in question will further the statutory purpose. 
Accordingly, the authority will be easier to find where an agency has broad 
discretion and favorable legislative history. With this approach, retroactive 
funding authority may be found to exist (as in 56 Comp. Gen. 31), or not to 
exist (as in 40 Comp. Gen. 615). 

96 Pub. L. No. 81-920, 64 Stat. 1245 (Jan. 12, 1951). 
97 Pub. L. No. 88-578, 78 Stat. 897 (Sept. 3, 1964).

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

If an agency wishes to recognize retroactive funding in limited situations in 
its regulations, it must, in order to avoid potential Antideficiency Act 
problems, make it clear that no obligation on the part of the government 
can arise prior to the availability of an appropriation. Of course, the grant 
itself cannot be made until the appropriation becomes available. 56 Comp. 
Gen. at 36. 

Situation (3): In this situation, the grantee seeks to charge costs incurred 
not only before the appropriation became available, but also before the 
program authority was enacted. 

Costs incurred prior to both the program authorization and the availability 
of the appropriation may generally not be funded retroactively. See 

56 Comp. Gen. 31 (1976); 32 Comp. Gen. 141 (1952); B-11393, July 25, 1940. 

GAO recognizes that there may possibly be exceptions even to this rule 
(56 Comp. Gen. at 35), but thus far there are no decisions identifying any. 

One final situation deserves mention. In each of the retroactive funding 
cases cited above, the grant was in fact subsequently awarded. In 
B-206244, June 8, 1982, a state had applied for an Interior Department grant 
under the Youth Conservation Corps Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1701–1706 (1976), 
and later withdrew its application due to funding uncertainties. The state 
then filed a claim for various expenses it had incurred in anticipation of the 
grant. GAO held that payment would violate both the program legislation 
and the purpose statute, 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a). Interior’s appropriation was 
intended to accomplish grant purposes, but the state’s expenses did not 
accomplish any grant purposes since the grant was never made.

H. Recovery of 
Grantee 
Indebtedness 
1. Government’s Duty to 
Recover 
This section is intended to summarize the application of “debt collection 
law” in the context of assistance programs, and to highlight a few issues in 
which the fact that a grant is involved may be of special relevance.98 

Claims in favor of the United States against an assistance recipient may 
arise for a variety of reasons. As a general proposition, it has been the view 
of both GAO and the executive branch that the United States has not only a 
right but a duty to recover amounts owed to it, and that this duty exists 
without the need for specific statutory authority. This applies to assistance 
recipients just as it would apply to other debtors. The Federal Claims 
Collection Standards require each agency to “aggressively collect all debts 
arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services 
to, that agency.” 31 C.F.R. § 901.1(a) (2005).99 See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. 
§ 3016.52(a) (the Department of Agriculture’s common rule on collection of 
amounts due): 

“Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to 
which the grantee is finally determined to be entitled under 
the terms of the award constitute a debt to the Federal 
Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after 
demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt by: 

“(1) Making an administrative offset against other 
requests for reimbursements, 

98 The General Accounting Office Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 Stat. 3826 (Oct. 19, 
1996), transferred the Comptroller General’s claims settlement authority, and related 
authorities, to the executive branch. Thus, executive branch agencies are now primarily 
responsible for prescribing guidance on claims collection matters. See B-303906, Dec. 7, 
2004, at 2. 

99 As part of the transfer of claims-related functions referenced in the preceding footnote, 
the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury now prescribe the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards. See 31 U.S.C. § 3711(d)(2); 31 C.F.R. § 900.1(a).

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

“(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the 
grantee, or 

“(3) Other action permitted by law.” 

For example, grant funds erroneously awarded to an ineligible grantee 
must be recovered by the agency responsible for the error, including 
expenditures the grantee incurred before receiving notice that the agency’s 
initial determination had been made in error. 51 Comp. Gen. 162 (1971); 
B-146285, B-164031, Apr. 19, 1972. The cited decisions recognize that there 
might be exceptional circumstances in which full recovery might not be 
required, but exceptions would have to be considered on an individual 
basis. See also 18 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 74, 76 (1994) (“In the . . . context 
of federal grants to state and local agencies, courts have stated that the 
federal government may use principles of restitution to recover monies that 
were granted for specific purposes and then used in contravention of those 
purposes, even in the absence of statutory authority expressly permitting 
such recovery.”). 

In a recent case, federal grant funds given by the U.S. Department of Labor 
to the New York Workers’ Compensation Board to meet its expenses 
related to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the World Trade 
Center were improperly transferred by the Board to other New York State 
entities. B-303927, June 7, 2005. Despite the fact that both the Department 
and the Board contributed to the misunderstandings that resulted in the 
payments to the other entities, GAO concluded that the Department should 
seek recovery of the funds improperly transferred unless the Secretary of 
Labor seeks and obtains congressional ratification of the grant 
expenditures to date. Id. at 10. 

Similarly, where an agency misapportions formula grant funds so that some 
states receive excess funds, the excess must be recovered. If the 
misapportionment resulted in other states receiving less than their formula 
amount, the apportionments of all of the states involved must be 
appropriately adjusted. B-275490, Dec. 5, 1996, at fn. 10; 41 Comp. Gen. 16 
(1961). 

Courts have upheld the authority of federal agencies to seek recovery of 
assistance payments where the grantee has not used those payments for 
authorized purposes within a prescribed period or where the grantee has 
not accounted for the funds within a reasonable period of time. In Mayor 
and City Council of Baltimore v. Browner, 866 F. Supp. 249 (D. Md. 1994), 

Page 10-133 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

the court rejected the city’s challenge to the Environmental Protection 
Agency’s authority to impose cut-off dates for use of grant funds for 
construction of sewage treatment facilities: 

“The City argues that the imposition of cut-off dates is 
inappropriate absent specific authority in the Clean Water 
Act, the regulations pertaining to the administration of 
grants, or the terms of the grant offer or acceptance forms. 
However the presence of project period start and finish 
dates on each grant award and the repeated references 
throughout the regulations to time limits and schedules for 
grant-funded projects anticipate such actions. . . . 

“Although the establishment of cut-off dates is not explicitly 
provided for in the relevant regulations, they are obviously 
implied and required to lend force to the provisions 
regulating the timing of grant-funded projects. Otherwise, 
the establishment of time limits would be a meaningless 
exercise for grantor and grantee. EPA must have a method 
to attain reimbursement of funds already disbursed when a 
project exceeds its time limit. Cut-off dates are simply the 
enforcement of the limits specifically provided for in the 
regulations in the context of grant funds disbursed 
proactively. The regulations in question are not ‘arbitrary, 
capricious, or manifestly contrary’ to [the Clean Water Act] 
and a policy of imposing cut-off dates for grant funding is 
not invalid.” 

866 F. Supp. at 251–52 (footnotes omitted). 

City of New York v. Shalala, 34 F.3d 1161 (2nd Cir. 1994), concerned Head 
Start grant funds paid to the city and distributed by the city to its 
constituent agencies over a period of years but which the constituent 
agencies had not yet disbursed for valid program purposes. The 
Department of Health and Human Services eventually disallowed these 
accumulated balances. The Departmental Appeals Board sustained the 
department’s disallowances. The Head Start statute did not specifically 
empower the department to disallow accumulated balances on the basis of 
their age and lack of documentation that the funds had been properly 
disbursed. City of New York, 34 F.3d at 1166–67. Nevertheless, the court 
held that the department “acted reasonably in deciding that, after a certain 
period of time, the City was no longer entitled to postpone its accounting 

Page 10-134 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

obligations.” Id. at 1168. The court also rejected the city’s argument that 
the department could not apply a rule treating accounts receivable as bad 
debt once they became more than two years old. Id. at 1170. 

Where, under an assistance program, the government is authorized or 
required to recover funds for whatever reason, the Federal Claims 
Collection Act of 1966, as amended, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3711–3720E,100 and the 
joint Treasury Department-Justice Department implementing regulations 
(Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 C.F.R. parts 900–904) apply 
unless the program legislation under which the claim arises or some other 
statute provides otherwise. See 31 C.F.R. § 900.1(a). 

Indebtedness to the United States may also result from the misuse of grant 
funds. E.g., Utah State Board for Vocational Education v. United States, 
287 F.2d 713 (10th Cir. 1961); Mass Transit Grants: Noncompliance and 
Misspent Funds by Two Grantees in UMTA’s New York Region, 
GAO/RCED-92-38 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 23, 1992). The cases usually arise 
when the grantor agency disallows certain costs. Here again the 
government’s position has been that the right to recover exists independent 
of statute, supplemented or circumscribed by any statutory provisions that 
may apply. See, e.g., B-198493, July 7, 1980; B-163922, Feb. 10, 1978. As 
discussed hereafter, the government’s right to recover has come under 
attack by recipients, particularly during the 1980s, but such attacks rarely 
succeed. 

What we present here is by no means an exhaustive cataloguing of the 
cases. Our selection is designed to serve three purposes: (1) summarize 
what the law appears to be as of the date of this publication; (2) reflect any 
discernible trends; and (3) point out some issues that may be of more 
general relevance. As a general proposition, the courts have looked first to 
the program legislation and usually have concluded that adequate authority 
to support the government’s right of recovery can be found in, or deduced 
from, the enabling statute. 

The cases we selected for purposes of illustration are drawn largely from 
two massive grant programs (perhaps more accurately described as 
collections of programs) that have operated in various forms and under 

100 Major amendments to the original 1966 Act were made by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 
Pub. L. No. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749 (Oct. 25, 1982), and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 
1996, Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, 1321-358 (Apr. 26, 1996).

Agreements 

many statutory iterations for decades: Title I of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act (ESEA), and the Comprehensive Employment 
and Training Act (CETA).101 Both of these programs have undergone 
extensive legislative changes over the years. The most recent major 
amendments to ESEA were enacted by the No Child Left Behind Act of 
2001, Pub. L. No. 107-110, 115 Stat. 1425 (Jan. 8, 2002). CETA was replaced 
in 1982 by the Job Training Partnership Act, Pub. L. No. 97-300, 96 Stat. 1322 
(Oct. 13, 1982). The most recent major amendments to this program were 
enacted by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-220, 
112 Stat. 936 (Aug. 7, 1998). We chose these programs because they both 
generated a large volume of litigation on a variety of relevant topics. Apart 
from whatever value specific cases may have by analogy to other programs, 
the material illustrates the kinds of issues that have arisen and the 
approach the courts, including the Supreme Court, have taken in resolving 
them. 

ESEA included a provision, very common in grant program legislation, 
requiring the states to provide adequate assurances to the Department of 
Education that grant funds would be used only on qualifying programs. In 
addition, the law was amended in 1978 to give the Secretary of Education 
explicit authority to direct the repayment of misspent grant funds from 
non-ESEA sources. 20 U.S.C. § 2835(b) (1982).102 Prior to this amendment, 
the statute had provided simply that payments under Title I shall take into 
account the extent to which any previous payment to the same state was 
greater or less than it should have been. 

Two states argued that the 1978 amendments did not apply to misspent 
funds prior to 1978, and that the government’s sole remedy with respect to 
pre-1978 funds was to withhold future grant funds, in which event the state 
would simply undertake a smaller Title I program. The government argued 
that the right to recover existed both under the pre-1978 law and under the 
common law. The Supreme Court held that the pre-1978 version of the law 
clearly gave the government the right to recover misspent funds. Bell v. 

101 The original source of Title I of ESEA was the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-10, 79 Stat. 27 (Apr. 11, 1965). CETA was originally enacted as the 
Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-203, 87 Stat. 839 
(Dec. 28, 1973). 

102 See 20 U.S.C. § 7844 for current provisions governing grantee assurances, and 20 U.S.C. 
§§ 1234a–1234b for provisions dealing with recovery of misused grant funds.

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

New Jersey, 461 U.S. 773 (1983). The pre-1978 language in question 
provided that ESEA payments—

 “shall take into account the extent (if any) to which any 
previous payment to such State educational agency under 
this title (whether or not in the same fiscal year) was greater 
or less than the amount which should have been paid to it.” 

Pub. L. No. 89-10, § 207(a)(1). The Court held that the plain terms of this 
language as well as its legislative history recognized the federal 
government’s right to recover misused funds. It rejected as “no more than 
remotely plausible” the state’s alternative interpretation that this language 
merely authorized the government to reduce future grants. The Court 
described the consequences of the state’s interpretation, which it clearly 
considered untenable, as follows: 

“[T]he Federal Government recovers nothing: it pays less, 
but it receives correspondingly less in the way of Title I 
programs. Under that reading, the State would have no 
liability to the Federal Government for misspent funds.” 

Bell, 461 U.S. at 783, fn. 8. Apart from the holding itself and its significance 
with respect to any program statutes with similar language,103 two other 
points from this decision are noteworthy: 

• The existence and amount of the state’s debt are to be determined 
administratively by the agency in the first instance, subject to judicial 
review. Id. at 791–92. (This is the same approach used in the Federal 
Claims Collection Standards for debt collection generally.) 
• Because the Court found adequate authority in the statute, it declined 
to rule on the existence of a common-law right. Id. at 782 n.7. 
In a 1981 case, a lower court had found a common-law right of recovery 
along with the ESEA statutory right. West Virginia v. Secretary of 
Education, 667 F.2d 417 (4th Cir. 1981). A 1987 case also upheld the 

103 The court in Ledbetter v. Shalala, 986 F.2d 428, 433–34 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 
1010 (1993), followed Bell, holding that substantively identical language in the Older 
Americans Act (42 U.S.C. § 3029(a)) likewise conferred a right to recover misspent grant 
funds. 

Page 10-137 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

government’s common-law right of recovery, at least to the extent of 
overallocations or other erroneous payments. California Department of 
Education v. Bennett, 829 F.2d 795, 798 (9th Cir. 1987). 

Two years after Bell, the Supreme Court considered another issue arising 
from the same litigation and held that the 1978 amendments to ESEA were 
not retroactive for purposes of determining whether funds had been 
misspent. Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. 632 (1985). What is important 
here is the more general rule the Court announced, namely, that 
substantive rights and obligations under federal grant programs are to be 
determined by reference to the law in effect when the grants were made. 
Id. at 638–41. 

The Court also rejected an argument that recovery would be inequitable 
because the state acted in good faith. The role of the reviewing court is to 
determine if the proper legal standards are applied. If they are, a court has 
“no independent authority to excuse repayment based on its view of what 
would be the most equitable outcome.” Id. at 646. In any event, said the 
Court, “we find no inequity in requiring repayment of funds that were spent 
contrary to assurances provided by the State in obtaining the grants.” Id. 
at 645. 

In Bennett v. Kentucky Department of Education, 470 U.S. 656 (1985), 
decided on the same day as Bennett v. New Jersey, the Court reaffirmed 
the government’s right of recovery under ESEA Title I: 

“The State gave certain assurances as a condition for 
receiving the federal funds, and if those assurances were 
not complied with, the Federal Government is entitled to 
recover amounts spent contrary to the terms of the grant 
agreement.” 

470 U.S. at 663. The Court further concluded that neither “substantial 
compliance” by the state nor the absence of bad faith would absolve the 
state from its liability. Id. at 663–65. See also B-229068-O.M., Dec. 23, 1987, 
applying Kentucky to grants under Title V of the Surface Mining Control 
and Reclamation Act of 1977.104 Other cases likewise hold that general 
equitable considerations cannot override specific agreements and

regulations governing grant transactions. E.g., Missouri Department of 
Social Services v. United States Department of Education, 953 F.2d 372, 
375–76 (8th Cir. 1992); Maine v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 91 (D. Me. 1999). In 
the latter case, the court observed: 

“Boiled down, Plaintiff contends that to allow the federal 
government to recover its overpayments in fiscal years 1993 
and 1994, while denying the State its proposed offset for 
federal contributions that should have been made relative to 
the State’s supplemental contributions from 1982 through 
1993, is simply unfair. . . . 

“Principles of equity and fairness must, and do, play a 
fundamental role in our system of justice. . . . But the 
principle of fairness cannot be the beginning, middle, and 
end of a legal analysis, especially in a case such as this 
where the transactions at issue are specifically and 
intricately governed by regulations and statutes. This is not 
a contract dispute between two lay people. This is a highlyregulated, 
complex legal transaction between a state and 
the federal government. In that light, [the state’s] reliance 
on ‘broad, nontechnical principles of substantive fairness 
and equity’ rings hollow.” 

81 F. Supp. 2d at 95. See also Maryland Department of Human 
Resources v. United States Department of Agriculture, 976 F.2d 1462, 
1480–81 (4th Cir. 1992). 

One point in Bell seems to have generated some uncertainty. The Court 
noted that the Secretary “has not asked us to decide what means of 
collection are available to him, but only whether he is a creditor. Since the 
case does not present the issue of available remedies, we do not address it.” 
Bell, 461 U.S. at 779 n.4. Thus, the Court did not approve or disapprove of 
any particular remedy. This led one court to conclude that the Bell analysis 
requires two separate questions: whether the federal government has a 
right of recovery and, if so, what remedies are available to it. Maryland 
Department of Human Resources v. United States Department of Health 
& Human Services, 763 F.2d 1441, 1455 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that 
government has statutory right of recovery under Title XX of Social 

Page 10-139 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Security Act105). However, another court expressed doubt over the 
existence of such a dichotomy, construing the Supreme Court’s silence in 
Bennett v. Kentucky Department of Education as approval of the means of 
recovery employed in that case, a direct repayment order. St. Regis 
Mohawk Tribe v. Brock, 769 F.2d 37, 49 n.16 (2nd Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 
476 U.S. 1140 (1986) (right of recovery under Comprehensive Employment 
and Training Act). The St. Regis court went on to conclude that “Congress 
left it to the Secretary to establish additional remedial procedures, 
consistent with the purposes of the legislation, to insure compliance by 
prime sponsors.” 769 F.2d at 50. 

Another group of cases involves the former CETA program. There is a 
strong parallel to the ESEA cases in that the original CETA included 
general authority to adjust payments to reflect prior overpayments or 
underpayments, and was amended in 1978 to explicitly authorize the 
Secretary of Labor to recover misspent funds by ordering repayment from 
non-CETA funds.106 Essentially following Bell, a rather long line of cases 
upheld the Labor Department’s right, under the pre-1978 CETA, to recover 
misspent funds and to do so by directing repayment from non-CETA funds. 
City of Gary v. United States Department of Labor, 793 F.2d 873 (7th Cir. 
1986); St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, supra; Mobile Consortium v. United States 
Department of Labor, 745 F.2d 1416 (11th Cir. 1984); California Tribal 
Chairman’s Association v. United States Department of Labor, 730 F.2d 
1289 (9th Cir. 1984); North Carolina Commission of Indian Affairs v. 
United States Department of Labor, 725 F.2d 238 (4th Cir.), cert. denied,

Consortium v. Donovan, 721 F.2d 1162 (8th Cir. 1983); Lehigh Valley 
Manpower Program v. Donovan, 718 F.2d 99 (3rd Cir. 1983); Atlantic 
County v. United States Department of Labor, 715 F.2d 834 (3rd Cir. 1983). 

The St. Regis (769 F.2d at 47), California Tribal (730 F.2d at 1292), and 
North Carolina (725 F.2d at 240) courts, as had the Supreme Court in Bell, 
declined to comment on the existence of a common-law right of recovery. 
The Texarcana court noted that its decision was consistent with prior 
decisions recognizing the common-law right. 721 F.2d at 1164. None of the 
cases purported to deny that right. More recently, the court in Harrod v. 

105 42 U.S.C. §§ 1397–1397f.

Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

Glickman, 206 F.3d 783, 789 (8th Cir. 2000), similarly endorsed the federal 
government’s broad authority to recover improper payments: 

“The appellants also contend that the agency’s attempt to 
seek reimbursement of their disaster relief payments in 1994 
was untimely, because the agency action was final when the 
government paid the benefits in 1989, and the agency had no 
authority to seek reimbursement years after a final agency 
action. We disagree. 

“We have long held that the common law permits the 
government to recover funds that its agents wrongfully or 
erroneously paid, even absent specific legislation 
authorizing the recovery. See Collins v. Donovan, 661 F.2d 
705, 708 (8th Cir.1981); see also Texarkana Metro. Area 
Manpower Consortium v. Donovan, 721 F.2d 1162, 1164 
(8th Cir. 1983). The Supreme Court has stated, ‘Ordinarily, 
recovery of Government funds, paid by mistake to one 
having no just right to keep the funds, is not barred by the 
passage of time.’ United States v. Wurts, 303 U.S. 414, 416, 
58 S. Ct. 637, 82 L. Ed. 932 (1938). The government’s right to 
recover funds paid out erroneously ‘is not barred unless 
Congress has clearly manifested its intention to raise a 
statutory barrier.’ Id.” 

The court also held that estoppel ordinarily will not apply against the 
federal government in the absence of affirmative evidence of misconduct. 
Harrod, 206 F.3d at 789. 

Another group of CETA cases concerned a provision which required the 
Secretary of Labor to investigate any complaint alleging improprieties and 
to issue a final determination not later than 120 days after receiving the 
complaint. The consequences of failing to meet the 120-day deadline 
became a hotly litigated issue. The lower courts split, some holding that 
failure to meet the deadline barred the Labor Department from attempting 
to recover misused funds, while others held that the failure did not bar 
further action. Using an analysis which should be useful in a variety of 
situations, the Supreme Court resolved the conflict in Brock v. Pierce 
County, 476 U.S. 253 (1986), holding that the mere use of the word “shall” in 
the statute did not remove the power to act after 120 days. 

Page 10-141 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

An additional CETA case that deserves mention is Board of County 
Commissioners v. United States Department of Labor, 805 F.2d 366 
(10th Cir. 1986). In that case, the court held that funds embezzled by an 
employee of a CETA grantee are “misspent” for purposes of the 
government’s right of recovery. The grantee had argued that the funds 
were not “misspent” because it had never spent them. “No CETA 
regulation lists embezzlement as an allowable cost,” rejoined the court. Id. 
at 368. 

Finally, three cases dealing with the transition between CETA and the 
statute that immediately followed it—the Job Training Partnership Act 
(JTPA)—further illustrate judicial support for the federal government’s 
right to recover misspent funds. The JTPA contained language stating that 
its provisions “shall not affect administrative or judicial proceedings . . . 
begun between October 13, 1982 and September 30, 1984,” under CETA. 
29 U.S.C. § 1591(e) (1988). Several CETA grantees argued that this 
language barred recovery of misspent CETA grant funds unless 
administrative or judicial proceedings were begun prior to September 30, 
1984. This argument drew a decidedly chilly response from the courts. The 
opinion in City of Newark v. United States Department of Labor, 2 F.3d 31, 
34 (3rd Cir. 1993) was typical: 

“We can identify no basis for adopting this convoluted 
construction of the statute. In particular, Newark has called 
our attention to no provision in the JTPA that would, indeed, 
bar the Secretary from recovering misspent funds, and 
which would thereby ‘affect’ administrative proceedings 
commenced after September 30, 1984 in the manner Newark 
suggests. In the absence of any such JTPA provision, we 
cannot merely presume that Congress used the word ‘affect’ 
to mean ‘bar’ or ‘preclude.’ 

“Indeed, it would appear, to the contrary, that Congress in 
no way intended the passage of the JTPA to hinder the 
Secretary’s efforts to recoup misspent or mismanaged funds 
granted under CETA.” 

The court went on to cite congressional committee reports expressing 
concern over the abuse of CETA funds and the need to recover them. The 
courts reached the same result in Inland Manpower Association v. 
Department of Labor, 882 F.2d 343 (9th Cir. 1989), and St. Clair County 

Page 10-142 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

Agreements 

CETA, Michigan v. United States Department of Labor, No. 89-3829 
(6th Cir. 1990).107 

Where does all this leave us? Certainly the government’s right to recover 
under programs with statutory provisions similar to the former ESEA 
Title I and CETA programs would seem to be settled. In more general 
terms, several lower courts have recognized the government’s basic right to 
recover under the common law.108 While the Supreme Court declined to 
address the common law issue in Bell, its later decision in West Virginia v. 
United States, 479 U.S. 305 (1987) seems instructive. 

The issue in West Virginia was whether the United States could recover 
“prejudgment interest on a debt arising from a contractual obligation to 
reimburse the United States for services rendered by the Army Corps of 
Engineers.” 479 U.S. at 306. Applying federal common law, a unanimous 
Supreme Court held that it could.109 While this was not a grant case nor 
was the government’s right to collect the underlying debt in dispute, it 
would not seem to require a huge leap in logic to infer a recognition of an 
inherent right in the government to recover amounts owed to it. 

In sum, the government’s assertion of an inherent (i.e., common law) right 
to recover sums owed to it under assistance programs thus far has 
withstood assault. The issue may be largely moot at this juncture, however, 
since the courts invariably find a right to recover in the provisions of the 
applicable statutes, regulations, and/or grant agreements. 

107 These courts also noted that, in any event, audits had commenced before September 30, 
1984, and held that administrative proceedings were “begun” for purposes of the statute 
once audits were initiated. 

108 See, in addition to the cases cited in the text, Tennessee v. Dole, 749 F.2d 331, 336 (6th Cir. 
1984), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1018 (1985) (Federal-Aid Highway Act); Woods v. United States, 
724 F.2d 1444 (9th Cir. 1984) (Food Stamp Act); Mount Sinai Hospital v. Weinberger, 
517 F.2d 329 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 935 (1976) (Medicare); Pennsylvania 
Department of Transportation v. United States, 643 F.2d 758, 764 (Ct. Cl.), cert. denied, 
454 U.S. 826 (1981) (Federal-Aid Highway Act). 

109 In a subsequent case, United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529 (1993), the Court addressed an 
issue left open in West Virginia and held that the Debt Collection Act did not limit the 
government’s common law right to seek pre-judgment interest.

2. Offset and Withholding 
of Claims Under Grants 
Offset and withholding are two closely related remedies. While the terms 
are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same. Offset, in the 
context of grantee indebtedness, refers to a reduction in grant payments to 
a grantee who is indebted to the United States where the debt arises under 
a separate assistance program or is owed to an agency other than the 
grantor agency. Withholding is the act of holding back funds from the same 
grant or program in which the violation or other basis for creating the 
government’s claim occurred. In a sense, withholding may be viewed as a 
type of offset. 

GAO has adopted a “policy rule” that offset or withholding should not be 
used where it would have the effect of defeating or frustrating the purposes 
of the grant. E.g., B-171019, Dec. 14, 1976; B-186166, Aug. 26, 1976. The 
application of this rule depends upon the nature and purpose of the 
assistance program. “Individual consideration must be given to each 
instance.” B-182423, Nov. 25, 1974. Naturally, this consideration must 
include any relevant provisions of the program legislation, agency 
regulations, or the grant agreement. 

In 43 Comp. Gen. 183 (1963), for example, a farmer who was receiving 
payments under the Soil Bank Act,110 administered by the Department of 
Agriculture, was indebted to the United States for unpaid taxes. Since the 
basic purpose of the Soil Bank Act was to protect and increase farm 
income, GAO decided that whether those payments should be applied to 
the recovery of an independently arising debt was a matter within 
Agriculture’s discretion, based on Agriculture’s determination “as to the 
extent to which such withholding would tend to effectuate or defeat the 
purposes of the [Soil Bank Act].” Id. at 185. Similarly, relying heavily on 
the Treasury Department’s interpretation of the State and Local Fiscal 
Assistance Act of 1972111 (general revenue sharing, since repealed), GAO 
concluded in B-176781-O.M., Dec. 6, 1974, that offset against revenue 
sharing funds payable to a city was inappropriate to recover an 
overpayment to that city under a Federal Aviation Administration grant. 
Thus, agencies have some discretion in the matter. 

110 Pub. L. No. 540, ch. 327, 70 Stat. 188 (May 28, 1956), repealed by Pub. L. No. 89-321, § 601, 
79 Stat. 1187, 1206 (Nov. 3, 1965). 

111 Pub. L. No. 92-512, 86 Stat. 919 (Oct. 20, 1972).

Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

It has been somewhat easier to conclude that offset will frustrate grant 
objectives where grant payments are made in advance of grantee 
performance. E.g., 55 Comp. Gen. 1329 (1976); B-171019, Dec. 14, 1976. 
This is true to the extent the grantee is able to reduce its level of 
performance. Take, for example, a grant to construct a hospital. If a debt is 
offset against grant advances and the grantee can simply forgo the project 
and not build the hospital, there is no meaningful recovery. The federal 
government ends up keeping its own money, the grantee pays nothing, and 
the losers are the intended beneficiaries of the assistance, the patients who 
would have used the hospital. To this extent, an offset would accomplish 
nothing. This was the same analysis used for rejecting offset, for example, 
in B-171019, Dec. 14, 1976. As noted previously, the Supreme Court 
invoked essentially the same rationale in Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U.S. 773 
(1983), in rejecting the state’s argument that future grant payments could 
be reduced to satisfy its past indebtedness. 

The problem was highlighted in a 1982 GAO report, Federal Agencies 
Negligent in Collecting Debts Arising From Audits, AFMD-82-32 
(Washington, D.C.: Jan. 22, 1982). The report first noted GAO’s policy and 
its rationale: 

“[I]t is normally inappropriate for the Government to offset 
debts against an advance of funds to a grantee unless there 
is assurance that the same level of grant performance will 
be maintained. 

“. . . When the offset is not replaced with non-Federal funds, 
there has, in effect, been no repayment. The scope of the 
program has simply been reduced and the intended 
recipient of the benefits loses by the amount of the audit 
disallowance.” 

Id. at 26. The report then recommended that grantor agencies “require 
grantee debtors to certify that their payment of audit-related debts has not 
reduced the level of performance of any Federal program,” and monitor 
those assurances through grant management and audit follow-up. Id. at 28. 

The concept also appeared in B-186166, Aug. 26, 1976, in which the 
Department of Agriculture was exploring options to recover misapplied 
and unaccounted-for funds advanced to a university under research grants. 
Agriculture proposed crediting the indebtedness against allowable indirect 
grant costs. This would be done by requiring the university to document 

Page 10-145 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

that it was expending the amount of earned indirect costs on approved 
program grants, thus maintaining the agreed-upon performance level. GAO 
concurred cautiously, on the condition that the grantee voluntarily agree to 
this approach. Should this method fail to satisfy the indebtedness, GAO 
further noted that the grantee was a state university and advised 
Agriculture to seek offset against other amounts owed to the state by the 
federal government. 

Whatever impediments may exist in the case of grant advances, offset will 
be more readily available under reimbursement-type grants. E.g., 55 Comp. 
Gen. 1329, 1332 (1976). Nevertheless, the general policy rule still applies. 
Thus, in B-163922.53, Apr. 30, 1979, the Comptroller General advised the 
Departments of Labor and Transportation that disallowed costs under a 
Labor Department grant could be offset against reimbursements due under 
a Federal Highway Administration grant, but that Transportation still “must 
make the determination on a case-by-case basis as to whether offset will 
impair the program objectives.” 

When the GAO decisions cited in the preceding paragraphs were issued, 
the offset referred to was essentially nonstatutory. Administrative offset 
received a statutory basis with the enactment of section 10 of the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. § 3716. The corresponding portion of the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards, revised at that time to reflect the 1982 
legislation, was 4 C.F.R. § 102.3. 

As originally enacted in 1982, the administrative offset provided by 
31 U.S.C. § 3716 did not apply to debts owed by state and local 
governments. See 31 U.S.C. § 3701(c) (1982). However, the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-134, § 31001(d)(1), 110 Stat. 1321, 
1321-358–59 (Apr. 26, 1996), amended 31 U.S.C. § 3701(c) to eliminate the 
offset exemption for state and local governments. The 1996 Act also added 
language to 31 U.S.C. § 3716(d) providing that nothing in section 3716 
prohibits the use of any other administrative offset under another statute or 
the common law. Pub. L. No. 104-134, § 31001(d)(2)(D). See also the 
current Federal Claims Collection Standards at 31 C.F.R. § 901.3(a)(3) 
(“Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or payments that 
are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be 
collected by administrative offset under the common law or other 
applicable statutory authority.”). 

As noted above, offset and withholding are technically different. Many 
program statutes include withholding provisions. E.g., Perales v. Heckler, 

Page 10-146 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

762 F.2d 226 (2nd Cir. 1985) (withholding provision in Medicaid legislation 
may be used to recoup overpayments from state even though state has not 
yet recovered from provider). 

The theory behind withholding is that where a grantee has misapplied grant 
funds, or in other words, where a grantee’s costs are disallowed, the 
grantee has, in effect, spent its own money and not funds from the grant. 
Since the issue frequently comes to light in a subsequent budget period, 
withholding may be viewed as the determination that an amount equal to 
the disallowed cost remains available for expenditure by the grantee and is 
therefore carried over into the new budget period. Accordingly, the 
amount of new money that must be awarded to the grantee to carry on the 
grant program is reduced by the amount of the disallowance. This may not 
be strictly applicable where the statutory program authority establishes an 
entitlement to the funds on the part of the grantee or provides other 
specific limitations on the use of withholding. 

Under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, an agency to which a debt 
is owed is required in most cases to explore the possibility of collecting by 
offset from other sources. See generally 31 C.F.R. § 901.3.112 If offset is not 
available, a withholding provision may provide the basis to accomplish a 
similar result, at least in part. In 55 Comp. Gen. 1329 (1976), for example, 
the then Community Services Administration (CSA) was statutorily 
authorized to suspend (withhold) grant payments to satisfy certain grantee 
tax delinquencies. Under this authority, the CSA could pay the suspended 
amounts over to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to satisfy a grantee’s 
tax liability to the extent that it was incurred by the grantee in carrying out 
CSA grants. Since funds previously advanced under the grant should have 
been used to pay the required taxes in the first place, transfer of the 
suspended funds to the IRS amounted to payment of an authorized grant 
purpose. See also B-171019, Dec. 14, 1976 (withholding authority of former 
Law Enforcement Assistance Administration). 

In any event, withholding under a limited statutory withholding provision 
does not satisfy the requirement for the agency to seek offset from other 

112 31 C.F.R. § 901.3(a) incorporates a number of statutory exceptions to offset, but few of 
these apply to federal assistance payments. Offset is usually accomplished through the 
centralized Treasury Department offset program, although individual agencies may also 
effect offsets. See 31 C.F.R. §§ 901.3(b)–(c). 

Page 10-147 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

sources to the extent of any remaining liability for which withholding is not 
available. B-163922, Feb. 10, 1978. 

Statutory withholding provisions may include procedural safeguards, most 
typically notice and opportunity for hearing. Any such procedural 
requirements must, of course, be satisfied. See B-226544, Mar. 24, 1987; 
7 C.F.R. § 3016.43(b). The common rules authorize withholding against 
advances. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. § 3016.52(a)(2). 

As with offset, it should be kept in mind that nothing is accomplished by 
withholding unless the grantee carries out its program at the same level as 
would otherwise have been the case. The Supreme Court made this point 
in Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U.S. 773 (1983), discussed previously. The Court 
rejected the state’s suggestion that the federal government was free to 
reduce future grant advances, with the state then undertaking a smaller 
program. The Court recognized that, under this approach, the government 
would recover nothing and the states would effectively have no liability for 
misspent funds. Congress, said the Court, must have contemplated that the 
government would receive a net recovery by paying less for the same 
program level. Id. at 781 n.5 and 783 n.8. 

A 1985 decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
took the analysis one step further. The case is Maryland Department of 
Human Resources v. United States Department of Health & Human 
Services, 763 F.2d 1441 (D.C. Cir. 1985). After discussing the Bell analysis, 
the court went on to conclude: 

“[W]here a statute gives the federal government a right of 
recovery and also authorizes prospective withholding 
[withholding funds for services not yet rendered] as a 
remedy, the state remains obligated to provide all the 
services that it promised to supply in return for the funds 
that were then prospectively withheld in satisfaction of the 
state’s debt to the federal government. If a state then 
proceeds to reduce the size of its federally funded program, 
the state has committed a new and independent breach of 
the funding conditions, which gives rise to a new debt to the 
federal government.” 

Maryland, 763 F.2d at 1455–56. Under this approach, the remedy is clearly 
a meaningful one. How far the courts will go in applying it remains to be 
seen. Issues still to be resolved are the extent to which the principle may 

Page 10-148 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 10 
Federal Assistance: Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 

apply to an offset as opposed to a withholding, or to a nonstatutory offset 
or withholding. 

In Housing Authority of the County of King v. Pierce, 701 F. Supp. 844 

(D.D.C.1988), modified on other grounds, 711 F. Supp. 19 (D.D.C. 1989), 
the court considered the recoupment of overpayments under advancefunded 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing 
subsidies. HUD regulations (but not the program statute) authorized 
recoupment by reducing future subsidy payments. The court upheld HUD’s 
common-law right to recover in the manner specified in the regulations. 
The court further commented that the teachings of Bell and Maryland 
Department of Human Resources “might and perhaps should guide HUD in 
the course of the recovery here,” but found those cases not dispositive 
because they dealt with statutory rather than common-law remedies. 
Pierce, 701 F. Supp. at 850 n.11. 
As the above discussion indicates, there is a direct relationship between 
the appropriateness of offset or withholding against grant advances and the 
grantee’s obligation to maintain the agreed-upon program level. To date, 
however, the case law does not provide definitive guidance for sorting 
through the many legal and practical issues that this relationship presents. 
Perhaps future litigation or legislation will help to flesh out the details of 
this relationship.

Chapter 11 

Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

A. Introduction 
1. General Description The preceding chapter dealt with one of the major forms of federal 
financial assistance, the grant. Another major form is credit assistance, 
which includes direct loans and, the subject of this chapter, guaranteed and 
insured loans. In essence, a guaranteed loan is a loan or other advance of 
credit made to a borrower by a participating lending institution, where the 
United States government, acting through the particular federal agency 
involved, “guarantees” payment of all or part of the principal amount of the 
loan, and often interest, in the event the borrower defaults. A statutory 
definition along these lines is found in 2 U.S.C. § 661a(3) as follows: 
“The term ‘loan guarantee’ means any guarantee, 
insurance, or other pledge with respect to the 
payment of all or a part of the principal or interest 
on any debt obligation of a non-Federal borrower 
to a non-Federal lender, but does not include the 
insurance of deposits, shares, or other withdrawable 
accounts in financial institutions.”1 

Depending on the particular program, the borrower may be a private 
individual, business entity, educational institution, or a state, local, or 
foreign government. In some cases, the guarantee may be created when a 
loan originally made by a government agency is subsequently sold by the 
agency to a third party with the government’s assurance of repayment. 

Strictly speaking, an insured loan and a guaranteed loan are two different 
things. An insured loan is one made initially by the federal agency and then 
sold, while a guaranteed loan is a loan made by a private lender. 
Occasionally, the agency’s program legislation may draw the distinction. 
For example, the Department of Agriculture has authority both to make

Process, GAO-05-734SP (Washington, D.C.: September 2005), at 53, and in OMB Circular 
No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, part V, “Federal Credit,” 
§ 185.3(m) (June 21, 2005). Summary information on individual programs may be found in 
the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, prepared annually by the General Services 
Administration and Office of Management and Budget and available in electronic form at

Loans 

insured loans and to guarantee loans made by other lenders. Under 
7 U.S.C. § 935, the Department can make insured loans, defined in 
subsection 935(b) as loans that are “made, held, and serviced by the 
Secretary [of Agriculture], and sold and insured by the Secretary 
hereunder.” Under 7 U.S.C. § 936, the Department can guarantee loans 
which are “initially made, held, and serviced by a legally organized lending 
agency.”2 Another example is the Department’s rural industrialization loan 
program established by 7 U.S.C. § 1932, again authorizing both insured and 
guaranteed loans. For purposes of this chapter, we use the term 
“guarantee” to refer to both guaranteed and insured loans unless otherwise 
indicated. 

The objective of this chapter is to illustrate the kinds of issues and 
problems that arise in this area and the approaches used in resolving them. 
We have for the most part emphasized several of the better-known 
guarantee programs. Naturally, the extent to which any given case will 
have more general applicability will depend on the agency’s organic 
legislation, program regulations, and the particular circumstances. Since 
program statutes and regulations are subject to change, the reader should 
view the discussion as merely illustrative of the particular issue involved. 

The primary purpose of loan guarantees is to induce private lenders to 
extend financial assistance to borrowers who otherwise would not be able 
to obtain the needed capital on reasonable terms, if at all. Or, as a 
congressional subcommittee put it, loan guarantee programs are designed 
to redirect capital resources by intervening in the private market decision 
process, in order to further objectives deemed by Congress to be in the 
national interest.3 These objectives may be social (veterans’ home loan 
guarantees), economic (small business programs), or technological 
(guarantees designed to foster emerging energy technologies).

Assistance to Rural Areas and Avoid Unnecessary Financial Risk, GAO-04-647

Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

When the federal government guarantees a loan, the guarantee is extended 
to the original lender supplying the funds, generally either a private lender 
or the Federal Financing Bank, described in detail in section C.1.e of this 
chapter, as well as to any subsequent assignees or purchasers of the 
guaranteed portion of the loan. The subsequent purchase of a guaranteed 
loan from the original lender is called the “secondary market.” See, e.g., 
51 Comp. Gen. 474 (1972). Secondary market purchasers are frequently 
large investment entities such as mutual funds or pension funds. 

Secondary market purchasers are not always waiting in the wings, 
checkbooks in hand. Congress has on several occasions taken action to 
help create, stimulate, or facilitate secondary markets by establishing 
privately owned but federally chartered corporations known as 
“government-sponsored enterprises” (GSEs). Since a GSE is a creature of 
Congress, the actions it may take are those authorized in its enabling 
legislation. 71 Comp. Gen. 49 (1991) (Federal Agricultural Mortgage 
Corporation, or “Farmer Mac”). For discussions from the programmatic 
perspective, see GAO, Farmer Mac: Greater Attention to Risk 
Management, Mission, Public Purpose, and Corporate Governance Is 
Needed, GAO-04-827T (Washington, D.C.: June 2, 2004); Farmer Mac: Some 
Progress Made, but Greater Attention to Risk Management, Mission, and 
Corporate Governance Is Needed, GAO-04-116 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 16, 
2003); and Farmer Mac: Revised Charter Enhances Secondary Market 
Activity, but Growth Depends on Various Factors, GAO/GGD-99-85 
(Washington, D.C.: May 21, 1999).4 

Under a loan guarantee, the risk against which the guarantee is made is, for 
the most part, default by the borrower. In some cases, however, other risks 
may be covered as well, and a few examples will be noted later in this 
chapter. 

4 We do not address GSEs further in this publication. Readers needing more may consult 
several GAO products such as Government-Sponsored Enterprises: A Framework for 
Strengthening GSE Governance and Oversight, GAO-04-269T (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 10, 
2004); GSEs: Recent Trends and Policy, T-OCE/GGD-97-76 (Washington, D.C.: July 16, 
1997); Government-Sponsored Enterprises: A Framework for Limiting the Government’s 
Exposure to Risks, GAO/GGD-91-90 (Washington, D.C.: May 22, 1991); and Budget Issues:

Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

The Analytical Perspectives volume of the President’s budget submission 
for fiscal year 2006 provides extensive background on credit and insurance 
activities, including loan guarantee programs and the operations of GSEs.5 
At the end of 2004, the face value of federal loan guarantees totaled over 
$1.2 trillion.6 This represents a dramatic expansion of loan guarantees in 
recent decades. In 1970, the total face value of outstanding loan guarantees 
was less than $2 billion and slightly higher than the outstanding value of 
direct loans. While the aggregate face value of direct loans has remained 
fairly consistent since 1970, loan guarantees have increased exponentially.7 
The following are some examples of major loan guarantee and insured loan 
programs:8 

• In 2004, the Department of Agriculture provided $3.23 billion of 
homeownership loan guarantees through its rural housing programs to 
34,800 households, of which 30 percent went to very low- and lowincome 
families. 
• In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Federal 
Housing Administration insured $107 billion in mortgages for almost 
900,000 households. 
• In 2004, the Department of Veterans Affairs provided $35 billion in 
guarantees to assist 270,571 borrowers through its VA housing program 
for veterans, active duty military personnel, and certain reservists. 
• The fiscal year 2006 budget proposes more than $25 billion in Small 
Business Administration loan guarantees for small businesses and 
disaster victims. 
In the typical loan guarantee program, the lender is charged a fee by the 
agency, prescribed in the program legislation. However, no fee is charged 
in some programs. For example, 7 U.S.C. § 936 provides that no fee shall be 
charged for rural electrification program loan guarantees. Where a fee is

Year 2006, chapter 7, “Credit and Insurance” (Feb. 7, 2005), at 85–122, available at

Loans 

charged, its disposition is governed by (1) the Federal Credit Reform Act of 
1990, discussed later in this chapter, or (2) where the Credit Reform Act 
does not apply, the applicable program legislation, or (3) in the absence of 
any guidance in the program legislation, the miscellaneous receipts statute 
(31 U.S.C. § 3302). 

A guarantee may extend to 100 percent of the amount of the underlying 
loan, or some lesser percentage as specified in the program legislation. 
E.g., 7 U.S.C. § 936 (rural electrification and telephone service; 
100 percent); 42 U.S.C. § 1472(h)(2) (Doug Bereuter single family housing 
loan guarantee program; 90 percent); 15 U.S.C. § 636(a)(2)(A) (small 
business plant acquisition, construction, conversion, or expansion; 
75 or 85 percent, depending on the loan balance). Unless otherwise 
provided, a maximum guarantee percentage applies only to restrict the 
amount the administering agency is authorized to guarantee. E.g., 
B-137514, Nov. 3, 1958 (no objection to proposal for borrower to 
“guarantee” portion of loan not covered by government guarantee by 
making “irrevocable deposit” financed by separate loan, thereby providing 
lender with 100 percent guarantee). 

Banks do not loan money without interest, and the typical loan guarantee 
therefore covers accrued but unpaid interest as well as unpaid principal. 
The program statute may set a maximum acceptable rate of interest or may 
authorize the administering agency to do so by regulation. Assuming there 
is nothing to the contrary in the enabling legislation, an agency may, within 
its discretion, extend its guarantees to loans with variable interest rates 
(rates which rise or fall with changes in prevailing rates) as well as loans 
with fixed interest rates. B-184857, June 11, 1976. 

Credit assistance legislation frequently vests considerable discretion in the 
administering agency. E.g., B-202568, Sept. 11, 1981 (imposition of “no 
credit elsewhere” eligibility test to meet funding shortfall within SBA’s 
broad discretion under section 7(b) of the Small Business Act,15 U.S.C. 
§ 636(b)); B-134628, Jan. 15, 1958 (the then Civil Aeronautics Board was 
authorized within its discretion to make payments to lender immediately 
upon debtor’s default rather than after completion of foreclosure 
proceedings). 

While GAO will not, at the request of a rejected applicant, review the 
exercise of an agency’s discretion in rejecting an application for a loan 
guarantee, B-178460, June 6, 1973 (nondecision letter), GAO may address 
an agency’s use of appropriations for particular purposes and may review 

Page 11-7 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

an agency’s conduct of a program under its general audit authority. For 
example, the Emergency Loan Guarantee Act, Pub. L. 92-70, 85 Stat. 
178 (Aug. 9, 1971), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1841–1852, specifically authorized GAO to 
audit any borrower applying for a loan guarantee, but made no mention of 
auditing the Emergency Loan Guarantee Board which administered the 
program. 15 U.S.C. § 1846(b). An issue arose in connection with the 
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation assistance program, carried out under this 
statute. GAO took the position that it had the authority to audit the Board’s 
conduct of the program to evaluate whether the Board and borrower were 
complying with the statutory provisions and whether the government’s 
interests were being adequately protected. This authority derives from 
GAO’s basic audit statutes, such as 31 U.S.C. §§ 712 and 717, and does not 
have to be repeated in every piece of legislation. B-169300, Sept. 6, 1972; 
B-169300, Sept. 21, 1971. Occasionally, however, the program legislation 
will specifically authorize or require GAO audits. See, e.g., Launching Our 
Communities’ Access to Local Television (“LOCAL TV”) Act of 2000, 
Pub. L. No. 106-553, title X, § 1006, 114 Stat. 2762, 2762A-138 (Dec. 21, 
2000), at 47 U.S.C. § 1105 (requiring annual GAO audits of loan guarantee 
operations under that Act). 

2. Sources of Guarantee 
Authority 
The authority to guarantee the repayment of indebtedness must be derived 
from some statutory basis. In most cases, this takes the form of express 
statutory authorization. Typically, the statute will authorize the 
administering agency to establish the terms and conditions under which 
the guarantee will be extended, but may also impose various limitations. 
An example is section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act 
of 1974, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 5308, which authorizes the Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development to issue loan guarantees to support 
various community and economic development activities. 
Subsection 108(a) provides in part: 

“The Secretary is authorized, upon such terms and 
conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, to guarantee 
and make commitments to guarantee, only to such extent or 
in such amounts as provided in appropriation Acts, the 
notes or other obligations issued by eligible public entities, 
or by public agencies designated by such eligible public 
entities, for the purposes of financing (1) acquisition of real 
property or the rehabilitation of real property owned by the 
eligible public entity (including such related expenses 
as the Secretary may permit by regulation); (2) housing 

Page 11-8 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

rehabilitation; (3) economic development activities . . . ; 

(4) construction of housing by nonprofit organizations for 
homeownership . . . ; (5) the acquisition, construction, 
reconstruction, or installation of public facilities (except 
for buildings for the general conduct of government); 
or (6) . . . public works and site or other improvements. 
A guarantee under this section may be used to assist a 
grantee in obtaining financing only if the grantee has made 
efforts to obtain such financing without the use of such 
guarantee and cannot complete such financing consistent 
with the timely execution of the program plans without such 
guarantee. Notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant 
to this section shall be in such form and denominations, 
have such maturities, and be subject to such conditions as 
may be prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary.” 
Subsection 108(a) and the remaining provisions of that section go on to 
specify additional authorizations, limitations, terms, and conditions 
applicable to the loan guarantees. 

Program authority, as in the example cited, is most commonly in the form 
of permanent legislation authorizing an ongoing program. In addition, 
guarantee programs are occasionally enacted to deal with a specific crisis 
of limited duration. One example of this latter type is the Chrysler 
Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979.9 A more recent example is the 
Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act,10 which, among 
other things, authorized loan guarantees for airlines in the wake of the 
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Guarantee programs may also be 
enacted as part of appropriation acts. An example is discussed in GAO’s 
report Israel: U.S. Loan Guaranties for Immigrant Absorption, 
GAO/NSIAD-92-119 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 12, 1992). 

It is also possible for loan guarantee authority to be derived by necessary 
implication from a statutory program of financial assistance, that is, under 
program legislation which does not explicitly use the term “guarantee” or 
“insure.” For example, the current version of section 7(a) of the Small 

9 Pub. L. No. 96-185, 93 Stat. 1324 (Jan. 7, 1980). 
10 Pub. L. No. 107-42, 115 Stat. 230 (Sept. 22, 2001). 

Page 11-9 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Business Act, 15 U.S.C. § 636(a), authorizes the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) to make loans to small business concerns as follows: 

“The Administration is empowered to the extent and in 
such amounts as provided in advance in appropriation Acts 
to make loans for plant acquisition, construction, 
conversion, or expansion, including the acquisition of land, 
material, supplies, equipment, and working capital, and to 
make loans to any qualified small business concern . . . for 
purposes of this chapter. Such financings may be made 
either directly or in cooperation with banks or other 
financial institutions through agreements to participate on 
an immediate or deferred (guaranteed) basis.” 

The statute then goes on to list a number of limitations. A 1981 
amendment11 added the word “guaranteed.” Even before the amendment, 
GAO had concluded that a loan guarantee program was within the SBA’s 
discretion under section 7. 51 Comp. Gen. 474 (1972). An earlier decision, 
B-140673, Oct. 12, 1959, had upheld a “deferred participation” program 
under section 7(a), under which SBA would purchase the agreed portion of 
the deferred participation loan immediately upon demand and reserve the 
right to recover from the lender if SBA subsequently determined that the 
lender had not substantially complied with the participation agreement. In 
view of the broad discretion granted SBA under the statute, SBA was not 
required to make the “substantial compliance” determination before 
making payment to the lender.12 

The evolution of SBA’s authority to conduct its disaster loan program, 
15 U.S.C. § 636(b), followed a similar pattern. In B-121589, Oct. 19, 1954, 
the Comptroller General tentatively approved a deferred participation 
program, strongly urging that the statute be amended to include 
“immediate or deferred participation” language patterned after the pre-1981 
version of section 636(a). This was done and, based on 51 Comp. 

11 The amendment was enacted by section 1902 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1981, Pub. L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 357, 767 (Aug. 13, 1981). 

12 The primary difference between a loan guarantee program and a deferred participation 
loan program is that the lending institution can demand that SBA pay the outstanding 
balance of a deferred participation loan at any time, but can demand SBA’s purchase of the 
outstanding balance of a guaranteed loan only under the conditions prescribed in the 
regulations—generally only upon default of the borrower. 

Page 11-10 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Gen. 474, was found sufficient to authorize SBA to guarantee disaster loans 
to eligible borrowers by participating lending institutions. 58 Comp. 
Gen. 138, 145 (1978). To remove any doubt, the same amendment which 
added the word “guaranteed” to section 636(a) added it as well to 
section 636(b).13 

In connection with credit assistance under the Small Business Investment 
Act of 1958,14 GAO recognized the SBA’s implied authority to establish a 
program in which SBA would guarantee loans made by private lending 
institutions to small business investment companies, even though the 
statute authorized only a direct loan program. 42 Comp. Gen. 146 (1962). 
The decision pointed out that the legislative history of a 1961 amendment 
to the act clearly demonstrated that Congress intended to continue the 
nonstatutory “standby” guaranteed loan program that had existed for 
several years, and concluded therefore that the absence of specific 
language authorizing the program was due to the apparent belief by both 
Congress and SBA that such language was unnecessary and did not reflect 
an intent to deny SBA the authority. See also B-149685, Mar. 20, 1968. The 
guarantee program is now expressly authorized in 15 U.S.C. § 683. 

Authority by necessary implication cannot be derived solely from the 
purpose clause of a statute, which sets out the congressional objectives 
underlying the legislation, but must be supported by the operative 
provisions of the statute. 71 Comp. Gen. 49 (1991). 

Regardless of whether a loan guarantee program is established under an 
express statutory provision or by necessary implication, the basic 
responsibility for administering the program clearly rests with the agency 
involved. This includes the authority to determine whether or not to 
extend a guarantee in a particular case, and the manner in which the 
guarantees are to be handled. The agency has considerable discretion,

B. Budgetary and 
Obligational 
Treatment 
When a federal agency guarantees a loan, there is no immediate cash 
outlay. The need for an actual cash disbursement, apart from 
administrative expenses, does not arise unless and until the borrower 
defaults on the loan and the government is called upon to honor the 
guarantee. Depending on the terms of the loan, this may not happen until 
many years after the guarantee is made. It is thus apparent that loan 
guarantees require budgetary treatment different from ordinary 
government obligations and expenditures. This treatment is prescribed 
generally by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). Before 
describing the FCRA, it is important to first describe the pre-credit reform 
situation because it illustrates the objectives of credit reform and because 
FCRA does not cover all programs. 

1. Prior to Federal Credit Prior to credit reform, the authority to guarantee or insure loans generally 
Reform Act was not regarded as budget authority. Indeed, the original enactment of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 expressly excluded loan guarantees from 
the statutory definition of budget authority. 15 Under this treatment, the 
extension of a loan guarantee was an off-budget transaction and was, at the 
extension stage, largely not addressed by the budget and appropriations 
process. If and when the government had to pay on the guarantee (i.e., 
upon default), the administering agency would seek liquidating 
appropriations, and these liquidating appropriations counted as budget 
authority. Of course, by the time a liquidating appropriation became 
necessary, the United States was contractually committed to honor the 
guarantee, and Congress had little choice but to appropriate the funds. 
This is an example of so-called “backdoor spending.” By the time the 
budget and appropriations process became involved, there was no 
meaningful role for it to play. 
When a loan guarantee is committed or issued, it cannot be known with 
absolute certainty when or to what extent the government might be called 
upon to honor it. Accordingly, and since budget authority was not provided 
in advance, the making of a loan guarantee, however binding on the 
government the commitment may have been, was treated only as a 
contingent liability and did not result in a recordable obligation for 
purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a). A recordable obligation did not arise until 
the contingency occurred (default by the borrower or other event as 

15 Pub. L. No. 93-344, § 3(a)(2), 88 Stat. 297, 299 (July 12, 1974).

Loans 

authorized in the program legislation), at which time it was recorded 
against the appropriation or fund available for liquidation. 65 Comp. 
Gen. 4 (1985); 60 Comp. Gen. 700, 703 (1981). 

Under this approach, the obligation was viewed as “authorized by law” for 
purposes of the Antideficiency Act, and there was no violation if 
obligations resulting from authorized guarantees exceeded available 
budgetary resources. 65 Comp. Gen. 4 (1985); B-226718.2, Aug. 19, 1987. 

There was a certain logic to this approach. Many loans are repaid in whole 
or in part, with the result that the government is never called upon to pay 
under the guarantee, the only disbursements being the administrative 
expenses of running the program. To require budget authority in the full 
amount being guaranteed would artificially inflate the budget. The 
problem was that the pre-credit reform approach went to the opposite 
extreme, by reflecting the cost to the government in the year the guarantee 
was made as zero. Since there was no longer any room for discretion by 
the time liquidating appropriations became necessary, loan guarantee 
programs were not forced to compete with other programs for increasingly 
scarce budgetary resources. No one involved in the budget process— 
Congress, the Office of Management and Budget, GAO—particularly liked 
this system, and reform became inevitable. 

At an absolute minimum, GAO strongly encouraged the imposition of 
limits, either in the enabling legislation or in appropriation acts, on the total 
amount of loans to be guaranteed. E.g., GAO, Legislation Needed to 
Establish Specific Loan Guarantee Limits for the Economic Development 
Administration, FGMSD-78-62 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 5, 1979). Ceilings 
of this type may limit the amount of guarantees that can be issued in a given 
fiscal year, or the total amount of guarantees that can be outstanding at any 
one time. An example of the former is discussed in 60 Comp. 
Gen. 700 (1981). 

A device that became common in the 1980s was the granting of loan 
guarantee authority only to the extent provided in advance in appropriation 
acts. The device was reinforced in 1985 when Congress (1) added to the 
Congressional Budget Act a definition of “credit authority” (“authority to 
incur direct loan obligations or to incur primary loan guarantee 
commitments”), and (2) subjected to a point of order any bill providing new 
credit authority unless it also limited that authority to the extent or 
amounts provided in appropriation acts. These provisions are now 
codified at 2 U.S.C. §§ 622(10) and 651(a)(3), respectively. 

Page 11-13 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

While this device provided a measure of congressional control, it still did 
not require the advance provision of actual budget authority. For example, 
the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act, which predated the 1985 
legislation noted above, limited the authority to guarantee loans to the 
amounts provided in advance in appropriation acts. The Comptroller 
General and the Attorney General both concluded that this provision did 
not require advance budget authority, but was satisfied by an appropriation 
act provision placing a ceiling on the total amount of loans that could be 
guaranteed, that is, on contingent liability. B-197380, Apr. 10, 1980; 

Loan Guarantees—Authority of Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee 
Board to Issue Guarantees, 43 Op. Att’y Gen. 219, 4A Op. Off. Legal 
Counsel 12 (1980). 

Both opinions also concluded that the appropriation act ceiling related only 
to outstanding loan principal, with contingent liability for loan interest 
being in addition to the stated amount. 

Where loan guarantee authority is limited to amounts provided in 
appropriation acts—and we emphasize that we are addressing situations 
not governed by the Federal Credit Reform Act—those “amounts,” as 
noted, are not actual budget authority but ceilings on contingent liability. 
Therefore, while exceeding the ceiling may be illegal for other reasons,16 it 
does not violate the Antideficiency Act. 64 Comp. Gen. 282, 288–90 (1985). 
Analogous to budget authority, loan guarantee authority must generally be 
used (i.e., commitments made) in the fiscal year or years for which it is 
provided unless the appropriation act provides otherwise. B-212857, 
Nov. 8, 1983. Also, where advance authority in appropriation acts is 
statutorily required and Congress does not provide it, the agency’s 
authority to carry out the program may be effectively suspended for the 
fiscal year in question. B-230951, Mar. 10, 1989.17 

Congress may set a minimum program level as well as a ceiling. Again, for 
programs not governed by the Credit Reform Act, failure to achieve the 
minimum commitment level would not constitute an impoundment since 

16 An “unusual” case where exceeding a ceiling was not illegal, because of rather explicit 
legislative history, is 53 Comp. Gen. 560 (1974). 

17 Standing alone, 2 U.S.C. § 651(a) is not a statutory requirement for advance appropriation 
authority. A point of order may not be raised or may be defeated, in which event the validity 
of any ensuing legislation is not affected. As in the situation discussed in B-230951, many 
program statutes independently impose the requirement.

the commitment amount is not budget authority. B-195437.2, Sept. 17, 1986. 
However, under a loan insurance program where the loan itself is made by 
the agency, failure to achieve a mandated minimum program level would be 
an impoundment unless the failure results from programmatic factors. Id. 

2. Federal Credit Reform 
Act of 1990 
Consideration of various reform proposals during the 1980s centered on 
the recognition that there is a “subsidy element” to a government loan 
guarantee program. If all loans were repaid, there would be no cost to the 
government apart from administrative expenses. Were this the case, 
however, there would probably have been no need for the program to begin 
with. Since the objective of a loan guarantee program is to enhance the 
availability of credit which the private lending market alone cannot or will 
not provide, it is reasonable to expect that there will be defaults, most 
likely at a higher rate than the private lending market experiences. It 
became apparent that credit reform had to do two things. First, it had to 
devise a meaningful way of measuring the true cost to the government; and 
second, it had to bring those costs fully within the budget and 
appropriations process. See, e.g., GAO, Budget Issues: Budgetary 
Treatment of Federal Credit Programs, GAO/AFMD-89-42 (Washington, 
D.C.: Apr. 10, 1989). 

The culmination of these reform efforts was the Federal Credit Reform Act 
of 1990 (FCRA), enacted by section 13201(a) of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508, 104 Stat. 1388, 1388-609 
(Nov. 5, 1990), and codified as an amendment to title V of the Congressional 
Budget Act at 2 U.S.C. §§ 661–661f. The approach of the FCRA is to require 
budget authority to cover the subsidy portion of a loan guarantee program, 
with the nonsubsidy portion (i.e., the portion expected to be repaid) 
financed through borrowings from the Treasury. See 2 U.S.C. § 661c(b). 
The Office of Management and Budget has issued detailed instructions for 
implementing the FCRA. These instructions are now contained in OMB 
Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, 
part V, “Federal Credit” (June 21, 2005), and OMB Circular No. A-129, 

Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables 

(November 2000). The FCRA applies to loan guarantee commitments made

Commitments 

on or after October 1, 1991, with exceptions to be noted later. See 2 U.S.C. 
§§ 661c(a) and (b). For accounting guidance concerning the FCRA, see 
Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, Accounting for Direct 
Loans and Loan Guarantees, SFFAS No. 2 (Aug. 23, 1993), as amended by 
SFFAS No. 18 (May 2000).18 

One of the major purposes of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 
(FCRA) is to “measure more accurately the costs [i.e., the subsidy element, 
in essence] of Federal credit programs.” 2 U.S.C. § 661(1). Before the 
budgetary and appropriations aspects of FCRA can come into play, the 
administering agency, working with the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), must determine the cost of its programs. The law defines “cost” as 
the “estimated long-term cost to the Government . . . calculated on a net 
present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental 
effects on governmental receipts or outlays.” Id. § 661a(5)(A). More 
specifically for purposes of this chapter, the cost of a loan guarantee is 
the— 

“net present value, at the time when the guaranteed 
loan is disbursed, of the following estimated cash flows: 

“(i) payments by the Government 
to cover defaults and delinquencies, 
interest subsidies, or other payments; 
and 

“(ii) payments to the Government 
including origination and other fees, 
penalties and recoveries; 

“including the effects of changes in loan terms resulting 
from the exercise by the guaranteed lender of an option 
included in the loan guarantee contract, or by the borrower 
of an option included in the guaranteed loan contract.” 

Id. § 661a(5)(C).

Loans 

Historical experience is obviously a relevant factor in determining cost. 
Risk assessment is also very important, and OMB requires agencies to 
develop risk categories for their credit programs. OMB Circular No. A-11, 
Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, pt. 5, “Federal 
Credit,” § 185.5(a) (June 21, 2005). Agencies should not blindly rely on 
historical experience when the risk factor has changed. See GAO, SBA 
Disaster Loan Program: Accounting Anomalies Resolved but Additional 
Steps Would Improve Long-Term Reliability of Cost Estimates, GAO-05409 
(Washington, D.C.: Apr. 14, 2005); Loan Guarantees: Export Credit 
Guarantee Programs’ Long-Run Costs Are High, GAO/NSIAD-91-180 
(Washington, D.C.: Apr. 19, 1991), at 3. For example, it is not unreasonable 
to expect the default rate under a guaranteed student loan program to 
increase during a recession, resulting in a higher cost. Established 
secondary market experience is also relevant in assessing risk. NSIAD-91180, 
at 15–16. 

Developing reliable subsidy cost estimates for purposes of FCRA has 
proven to be a challenging undertaking. In the 15 years since enactment of 
FCRA, GAO has issued numerous reports critiquing agency practices in this 
regard. The following are just a few of many examples: GAO-05-409, 
above; Credit Reform: Improving Rural Development’s Credit Program 
Cost Estimates, GAO/AIMD-00-286R (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 22, 2000); 
Credit Reform: HUD’s Fiscal Year 2000 Credit Subsidy Budget Estimates 
Were Reasonable, But Could Have Been Improved, GAO/AIMD-00-60R 
(Washington, D.C.: Jan. 14, 2000); Credit Reform: Key Credit Agencies Had 
Difficulty Making Reasonable Loan Program Cost Estimates, 
GAO/AIMD-99-31 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 29, 1999); and Credit Reform: 
Greater Effort Needed to Overcome Persistent Cost Estimation Problems, 

GAO/AIMD-98-14 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 30, 1998). 

While dealing primarily with one direct loan program, a recent report 
contains a useful general overview of the analytic requirements and 
methodologies for developing FCRA cost estimates, as well as a glossary of 
relevant terms: GAO, Department of Education: Key Aspects of the 
Federal Direct Loan Program’s Cost Estimates, GAO-01-197 (Washington, 
D.C.: Jan. 12, 2001), at 48–53 (Appendix I: Estimating Credit Program 
Costs) and 60–62 (Glossary). 

The second major purpose of FCRA is to “place the cost of credit programs 
on a budgetary basis equivalent to other Federal spending.” 2 U.S.C. 
§ 661(2). To accomplish this, 2 U.S.C. § 661c(b), perhaps the key provision 
of FCRA, provides: 

Page 11-17 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, . . . new loan 
guarantee commitments may be made for fiscal year 1992 
and thereafter only to the extent that— 

“(1) new budget authority to cover their 
costs is provided in advance in an 
appropriations Act; 

“(2) a limitation on the use of funds otherwise 
available for the cost of a . . . loan guarantee 
program has been provided in advance in 
an appropriations Act; or 

“(3) authority is otherwise provided in 
appropriation Acts.” 

Thus, unless Congress specifically provides otherwise, loan guarantees 
may be made only if budget authority to cover their cost has been provided 
in advance. The cost of a loan guarantee is regarded as new budget 
authority for the fiscal year “in which definite authority becomes available 
or indefinite authority is used.” 2 U.S.C. § 661c(d)(1). 

To implement these concepts, the law defines two accounts for credit 
programs, a “program account” and a “financing account.” The program 
account is the budget account into which appropriations of budget 
authority are made. The financing account is a revolving, nonbudget 
account from which the guarantees are actually administered. It receives 
cost payments from the program account and includes all other cash flows 
resulting from the guarantee commitment. 2 U.S.C. §§ 661a(6) and (7). 
Administrative expenses are required to be shown as a separate and 
distinct line item within the program account. Id. § 661c(g). 

Provisions contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, 
Pub. L. No. 108-447, 118 Stat. 2809 (Dec. 8, 2004),19 illustrate how Congress 
makes the appropriations contemplated by 2 U.S.C. § 661c. Typically, the 
provisions include a specific amount for the loan subsidy costs and state 
that such costs “shall be as defined in section 502 of the Congressional 
Budget Act,” that is, 2 U.S.C. § 661a(5)(A), quoted previously. The 

19 As its title suggests, this omnibus act incorporated the fiscal year 2005 appropriations acts 
for many federal departments and agencies. 

Page 11-18 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

provisions also include a separate amount for administrative expense, as 
required by 2 U.S.C. § 661c(g).20 Finally, the provisions frequently include a 
limit on the aggregate principal amount of loan guarantees. See, for 
example, the following provision: 

“MINORITY BUSINESS RESOURCE CENTER PROGRAM” 

“For the cost of guaranteed loans, $500,000, as authorized 
by 49 U.S.C. 332: Provided, That such costs, including the 
cost of modifying such loans, shall be as defined in 
section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974: 
Provided further, That these funds are available to subsidize 
total loan principal, any part of which is to be guaranteed, 
not to exceed $18,367,000. In addition, for administrative 
expenses to carry out the guaranteed loan program, 
$400,000.” 

118 Stat. 3200. Other examples of provisions taking this form appear at 
118 Stat. 3305 (Community Development Loan Guarantees Program 
Account) and 118 Stat. 3309–10 (Federal Housing Administration’s General 
and Special Risk Program Account). 

Frequently, the appropriation provisions include both loan guarantee 
programs and related direct loan programs, which are also subject to the 
FCRA. Some of these provisions impose separate limits for direct loans 
and loan guarantees. See, e.g., Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund Program 
Account (118 Stat. 2822); Rural Housing Insurance Fund Program Account 
(118 Stat. 2828); Small Business Administration’s Business Loans Program 
Account (118 Stat. 2911). Other provisions combine the direct and 
guaranteed loan programs, and occasionally other programs such as grants, 
under one overall subsidy cost cap. For example, the Subsidy 
Appropriation for Export and Investment Assistance by the Export-Import 
Bank provides in part: 

“For the cost of direct loans, loan guarantees, insurance, 
and tied-aid grants as authorized by section 10 of the 
Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended, $59,800,000, 

20 A very general definition of “administrative expenses” may be found in B-24341, Mar. 12, 
1942, at 5. For FCRA purposes, see also OMB Cir. No. A-11, § 185.3(a); GAO-01-197, at 60.

Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

to remain available until September 30, 2008: Provided, 
That such costs, including the cost of modifying such loans, 
shall be as defined in section 502 of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974 . . .” 

118 Stat. 2968. In 72 Comp. Gen. 347, 349 (1993), GAO quoted from the 
legislative history of a predecessor version of this appropriation language 
to the effect that this language was intended to give the Bank “the flexibility 
to determine, in response to demand, the appropriate mix of direct loans, 
guaranteed loans, tied-in grants, and mixed credits and insurance.” Other 
examples of such flexible provisions can be found with respect to the 
Renewable Energy Program (118 Stat. 2831) and the Development Credit 
Authority (118 Stat. 2974). In addition to allowing agencies to determine 
the mix of direct and guaranteed loans, these provisions grant additional 
flexibility since they do not separately cap the overall principal amounts of 
direct or guaranteed loans. Thus, agencies retain discretion to determine 
the total principal amounts assuming, of course, that the total amounts 
would not carry estimated subsidy costs exceeding the budget authority 
provided pursuant to section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act. 

For loan guarantee programs, the President’s annual budget is to reflect the 
cost of the program in accordance with 2 U.S.C. § 661a(5) and the planned 
level of new guarantee commitments. 2 U.S.C. § 661c(a). Congress then 
makes an appropriation to cover these costs and administrative expenses 
to the program account. 

The appropriation of costs “shall constitute an obligation of the credit 
program account to pay to the financing account.” Id. § 661c(d)(1). When 
a loan for which a guarantee commitment has been made is disbursed by 
the lender, the cost of the guarantee is obligated against the program 
account and transferred into the financing account. Id. § 661c(d)(2). OMB 
Circular No. A-11, at §§ 185.9–185.31, contains detailed budget formulation, 
reporting, and execution instructions for federal credit programs, including 
loan guarantees. For example, like other forms of budget authority, credit 
program accounts and financing accounts are subject to apportionment 
unless exempted by statute or by OMB. Id. § 185.14.

 The law recognizes that estimating costs is not an exact science and that 
cost estimates are subject to change over time. Accordingly, costs 
generally are to be reestimated annually as long as the loans are 
outstanding. OMB Cir. No. A-11, §§ 185.3(y), 185.6. See GAO, SBA Disaster 
Loan Program: Accounting Anomalies Resolved but Additional Steps 

Page 11-20 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Would Improve Long-Term Reliability of Cost Estimates, GAO-05-409 
(Washington, D.C.: Apr. 14, 2005), for a description of this process and 
issues related to the calculation of interest rates. If a reestimation results 
in an increase to the cost estimate, the law provides permanent indefinite 
budget authority for the program account. 2 U.S.C. § 661c(f). The agency 
requests an apportionment of this indefinite authority from OMB, and then 
records an obligation against the program account and pays the funds into 
the financing account. OMB Cir. No. A-11, § 185.17. 

The law also provides for the treatment of “modifications.” For purposes 
of FCRA, a modification is defined as follows: 

“The term ‘modification’ means any Government action that 
alters the estimated cost of an outstanding direct loan (or 
direct loan obligation) or an outstanding loan guarantee (or 
loan guarantee commitment) from the current estimate of 
cash flows. This includes the sale of loan assets, with or 
without recourse, and the purchase of guaranteed loans. 
This also includes any action resulting from new legislation, 
or from the exercise of administrative discretion under 
existing law, that directly or indirectly alters the estimated 
cost of outstanding direct loans (or direct loan obligations) 
or loan guarantees (or loan guarantee commitments) such 
as a change in collection procedures.” 

2 U.S.C. § 661a(9). See also OMB Cir. No. A-11, § 185.2. 

The law prohibits the modification of a loan guarantee commitment “in a 
manner that increases its costs unless budget authority for the additional 
cost has been provided in advance in an appropriations Act.” 2 U.S.C. 
§ 661c(e). Modifications include such things as forgiveness, forbearance, 
reductions in interest rate, prepayments without penalty, and extensions of 
maturity, except where permitted under an existing contract. OMB Cir. 
No. A-11, § 185.3(r). They also include the sale of loan assets and actions 
resulting from new legislation, such as a statutory restriction on debt 
collection. Id. As with reestimates, at the time a modification is made, the 
agency records an obligation of the estimated cost increase against the 
program account and pays the amount into the financing account. 
Id. § 185.7. 

If an agency’s original cost estimates, reestimates, and modification 
estimates have been accurate, the balances of financing accounts for loan 

Page 11-21 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

guarantees should always be sufficient to make any required payments. 
However, if a balance is not sufficient, the “Secretary of the Treasury 
shall . . . lend to, or pay to the financing accounts such amounts as may be 
appropriate.” 2 U.S.C. § 661d(c). The Secretary is also authorized to 
borrow or receive amounts from the financing accounts. Id. All of these 
transactions between the Treasury and financing accounts are subject to 
the apportionment requirements of the Antideficiency Act. Id. 

Under the FCRA structure as outlined above, there are two separate sets of 
“obligations”—obligations against the program account when budget 
authority is transferred to the financing account, and obligations against 
the financing account when claims are made for payment under a 
guarantee. 

OMB Circular No. A-11, § 145.3, identifies five actions specific to credit 
programs that will result in Antideficiency Act violations: 

• Overobligation or overexpenditure of the amounts appropriated or 
apportioned for subsidy costs. This includes a modification resulting in 
such an overobligation or overexpenditure. 
• Overobligation or overexpenditure of the credit level supported by the 
enacted subsidy cost appropriation. 
• Overobligation or overexpenditure of the amount appropriated for 
administrative expenses. 
• Obligation or expenditure of the expired unobligated balance of the 
cost appropriation, except to correct mathematical or data input errors 
in calculating subsidy amounts. However, error correction will be 
considered a violation if it exceeds the amount of the expired 
unobligated balance. 
• Overobligation or overexpenditure of the apportioned borrowing 
authority in a financing account. 
Finally, the law emphasizes that the provisions of the FCRA are not to be 
construed as changing or overriding the administering agency’s authority to 
determine the terms and conditions of eligibility for, or amount of, a loan or 
loan guarantee. 2 U.S.C. § 661d(g). 

Page 11-22 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

As a result of FCRA, guarantee programs are no longer unrestricted. Even 
if the applicable appropriation act does not explicitly set a maximum 
program level, the program level that can be supported by the enacted cost 
appropriation, reinforced by the Antideficiency Act, constitutes an 
effective ceiling. Programs not governed by FCRA may have their own 
ceilings. Although a loan or guarantee may not exceed a statutory ceiling, it 
may nevertheless be possible to extend assistance if the borrower qualifies 
under another program. For example, in 35 Comp. Gen. 219 (1955), the 
Small Business Administration could not make a disaster loan to a small 
business concern which had suffered damage in a flood because SBA had 
already used up the applicable ceiling on disaster loans. However, it could 
make a business loan to the same borrower if the transaction otherwise 
met the criteria under SBA’s business loan program. 

In addition to providing a new system for setting loan guarantee program 
levels, the FCRA also affected other statutory provisions whose application 
is tied to such program levels. The decision in 72 Comp. Gen. 347 (1993) 
provides an example. That decision concerned a statutory provision, 
12 U.S.C. § 635(b)(1)(E)(v), requiring the Export-Import Bank to “make 
available, from the aggregate loan, guarantee, and insurance authority 
available to it, an amount to finance exports directly by small business 
concerns . . . which shall be not less than” a specified percentage of “such 
authority for each fiscal year.” At the time of the decision the percentage 
was 10 percent; it is now 20 percent. Prior to enactment of the FCRA, 
Congress had included in appropriation acts a total principal amount for 
annual loans and guarantees and the Bank used that figure to determine the 
amount to reserve for small business concerns under the statute. However, 
in implementing FCRA for this program, Congress decided to include only 
an annual amount for the program’s subsidy cost and not to attach an 
overall limit to the principal amount of loans. Under these circumstances, 
GAO agreed with the Bank’s General Counsel that the Bank could develop 
an estimate of the total loan amounts for a given year starting from the 
subsidy cost figure in order to apply the small business reserve: 

“Although it is only an extrapolation from cost, the Bank’s 
proposal to estimate the total projected authorizations for 
the year based upon the amount of subsidy appropriated 
appears to represent a reasonable starting point. As the 
General Counsel points out, projections based on the 
estimated cost of loan, guarantee and insurance 
commitments under credit reform do not directly yield a 
figure for the Bank’s available aggregate loan, guarantee, 

Page 11-23 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

and insurance authority. Furthermore, we have no 
objection to the Bank, in addition to estimating total 
authorizations for the ensuing fiscal year starting with the 
amount of subsidy appropriated, using such other 
reasonable factors . . . as are consistent with the Bank’s 
statutory objectives and authority.” 

72 Comp. Gen. at 349–50 (footnote omitted). The decision went on to hold 
that the Bank could not divert any of the small business reserve to other 
purposes if it appeared that small businesses were unlikely to use the full 
reserve for a given fiscal year. Id. at 350–51. 

b. Pre-1992 Commitments The treatment described above applies to loan guarantee commitments 
made on or after October 1, 1991. Commitments made prior to fiscal year 
1992 were made under the rules summarized in section B.1 of this chapter. 
Since pre-1992 guarantees were not subject to any requirement to 
determine subsidy costs or to obtain advance appropriations of budget 
authority, they required different treatment and were addressed in separate 
provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). 
Three provisions, which remain in the FCRA, are particularly relevant to 
pre-1992 commitments. First, the law establishes “liquidating accounts,” 
defined as budget accounts which include all cash flows to and from the 
government resulting from pre-1992 commitments. 2 U.S.C. § 661a(8). 
Second, all collections resulting from pre-1992 guarantee commitments are 
to be credited to the liquidating account and are available to liquidate 
obligations to the same extent they were under the applicable program 
legislation prior to enactment of FCRA. Id. § 661f(b). At least once a year, 
unobligated balances in the liquidating account which are in excess of 
current needs are to be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury. Id. 

Third, 2 U.S.C. § 661d(d)(1) specifies the types of payments resulting from 
pre-1992 commitments that can be made from liquidating accounts. 
Paragraph (3) of subsection 661d(d) provides: 

“If funds in liquidating accounts are insufficient to satisfy 
obligations and commitments of such accounts, there is 
hereby provided permanent, indefinite authority to make 
any payments required to be made on such obligations and 
commitments.” 

Page 11-24 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


c. Entitlement Programs 
Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Thus, for pre-1992 guarantees which are liquidated in accordance with the 
terms of the original commitment, payment will still be made from 
liquidating appropriations. The main change under FCRA is the provision 
of these liquidating appropriations on a permanent, indefinite basis. 

A “modification” to a pre-1992 loan guarantee—the term having the same 
meaning as described in section B.2.a of this chapter for post-1991 
guarantees—is treated differently. See OMB Circular No. A-11, 
Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, pt. 5, “Federal 
Credit,” § 185.7(c) (June 21, 2005). 

A partial exemption from the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) is 
found in 2 U.S.C. § 661c(c), which provides that the requirement for the 
advance appropriation of budget authority to cover estimated costs does 
not apply to (1) a loan guarantee program which constitutes an entitlement, 
or (2) programs of the Commodity Credit Corporation existing on FCRA’s 
date of enactment (November 5, 1990). An entitlement program is one in 
which the provision of assistance is mandatory with respect to borrowers 
and lenders who meet applicable statutory and regulatory eligibility 
requirements. The statute gives two examples—the guaranteed student 
loan program and the veterans’ home loan guarantee program. Since the 
exemption is from the appropriation requirement of 2 U.S.C. § 661c(b) and 
not the entire act, other provisions of FCRA and OMB Circular No. A-11 
presumably apply to the extent not inconsistent with the exemption. 

The pre-FCRA rules summarized in section B.1 of this chapter form the 
starting point with respect to obligational treatment and the application of 
the Antideficiency Act. A 1985 decision, 65 Comp. Gen. 4, reiterated these 
rules in the context of the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. GAO 
advised the Department of Education that (1) a guarantee itself is only a 
contingent liability and is not recordable as an obligation; (2) an obligation 
must be recorded upon occurrence of one of the contingencies specified in 
the program legislation which will require the government to honor the 
guarantee (in this case, loan default or the death, disability, or bankruptcy 
of the borrower); and (3) the Antideficiency Act does not require that 
sufficient budget authority be available at the time the obligation is 
recorded because, by virtue of the requirements of the program legislation, 
incurring the obligation is “authorized by law” for Antideficiency Act 
purposes. 

For fiscal year 2005, Congress appropriated to the program account for the 
veterans’ home loan program, for costs as defined in FCRA, “such sums as 

Page 11-25 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

may be necessary to carry out the program,” together with a definite 
(specific dollar amount) appropriation for administrative expenses.21 

d. Certain Insurance Programs Another provision of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA), 
2 U.S.C. § 661e(a)(1), exempts from the entire act— 
“the credit or insurance activities of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union 
Administration, Resolution Trust Corporation, Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, National Flood Insurance, 
National Insurance Development Fund, Crop Insurance, or 
Tennessee Valley Authority.” 

Thus, to the extent the rules discussed in section B.1 of this chapter would 
apply to any of the programs conducted by these entities to begin with, 
they continue to apply unaffected by FCRA. 

C. Extension of 
Guarantees 
1. Coverage of Lenders 
(Initial and Subsequent) 
a. Eligibility of Lender/Debt 
Instrument 
Program legislation may prescribe eligibility criteria for lending 
institutions, or may otherwise limit the types of lending institutions to 
which guarantees may be extended, either as the initial lender or as a 
subsequent transferee, or may address the manner in which the debt 
instrument covered by the guarantee may be treated. The safest 
generalization in this area, and the common strain throughout the cases, is 
that any proposed action must be consistent with the terms and intent of 
the agency’s statutory authority. 

21 Pub. L. No. 108-447, 118 Stat. 2809, 3286 (Dec. 8, 2004) (Veterans Housing Benefit Program 
Fund). The fiscal year 2005 appropriation language does include a cap on gross obligations 
for certain direct loans. 

Page 11-26 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

For example, in B-194153, Sept. 6, 1979, GAO considered a proposed pilot 
program in which the Economic Development Administration (EDA), an 
agency within the Department of Commerce, would guarantee loans made 
to private borrowers by participating lending institutions, with the 
guaranteed portion of the loan to be subsequently assigned to the city of 
Chicago and financed through the issuance of bonds. The statutory basis 
for the proposal, since repealed, authorized the Secretary of Commerce to 
guarantee up to 90 percent of the outstanding balance of loans for certain 
specified purposes “made to private borrowers by private lending 
institutions.” GAO concluded that allowing the guarantee to be assigned to 
an entity that was neither private nor a lending institution and could not 
have qualified for a guarantee initially, would exceed EDA’s statutory 
authority since EDA would be doing something indirectly—guaranteeing a 
loan by a nonprivate lender—that the statute would not permit it to do 
directly. 

GAO revisited the issue a few years later and reaffirmed the ineligibility of 
public lenders to participate as secondary market purchasers under the 
“private lending institution” requirement. Since a secondary market 
purchaser effectively becomes the lender, it makes no difference whether 
sale to the public lender is contemplated from the loan’s inception or 
merely occurs in the ordinary course of secondary market operations. 

61 Comp. Gen. 517 (1982). 

Another issue in B-194153 was whether EDA could legally allow a 
guaranteed loan to be evidenced by two notes, one to be fully guaranteed 
and the second with no guarantee. The Comptroller General found the 
proposed arrangement within EDA’s administrative discretion under the 
statute since the two-note arrangement would still conform to the statutory 
requirement that no more than 90 percent of a loan be guaranteed and 
furthermore was apparently intended to effectuate the basic legislative 
purpose. The decision pointed out, however, that since the two notes 
represented one loan, their substantive terms such as maturity dates and 
interest rates must be the same, and the two-note mechanism must not 
increase the government’s potential liability. This portion of the decision 
was later modified in 60 Comp. Gen. 464 (1981), to the extent that GAO 
approved use of a “split interest rate” in which the interest on the 
EDA-guaranteed note was lower than the interest rate on the 
nonguaranteed note. The split-interest scheme was consistent with 
programs by other agencies under similar legislation and would be more 
favorable to the government. 

Page 11-27 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


b. Substitution of Lender 
Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

A related type of question arose under the now defunct New Community 
Development Program authorized by the Urban Growth and New 
Community Development Act of 1970.22 The legislation authorized various 
forms of financial assistance to stimulate the development of new 
communities, including the guarantee of obligations of private new 
community developers and state development agencies. A question arose 
as to whether the Department of Housing and Urban Development was 
authorized or required to guarantee the indebtedness of a private developer 
to contractors and subcontractors who had supplied goods and services to 
the developer. Finding that the intent of the program legislation was that 
the Department guarantee only obligations issued to private investors, the 
Comptroller General concluded that the Department was neither required 
nor authorized to issue guarantees that would run to a developer’s 
contractors and subcontractors. B-170971, Aug. 22, 1975; B-170971, July 22, 
1975. 

As a general proposition, substitution of lenders is permissible as long as it 
is not prohibited by the program legislation or regulations and the 
“replacement lender” meets any applicable eligibility requirements. 

In 60 Comp. Gen. 700 (1981), GAO considered the effect of a change in 
lenders in the rural development loan guarantee program administered at 
that time by the then Farmers Home Administration (FmHA).23 The 
program operated under an annual ceiling, and the specific question was 
whether a guarantee could continue to be charged against the ceiling for 
the fiscal year in which it was initially approved, when a change in lenders 
took place in a subsequent fiscal year. As to the programmatic significance 
of the change, the decision stated: 

“[T]he basic purpose of the FmHA rural development loan 
guarantee program is to provide assistance to eligible 
borrowers to enable them to accomplish one or more of the 
statutory objectives. In other words, although the guarantee 
is extended to the lender, it is clear that the purpose of 
doing so is not to provide a Federal benefit to the lending 

22 Pub. L. No. 91-609, title VII, 84 Stat. 1770, 1791 (Dec. 31, 1970). 

23 The Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency now has administrative 
responsibility for the programs formerly carried out by the Farmers Home Administration. 
See 7 U.S.C. §§ 6932(a) and (b)(3).

Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

c. Existence of Valid 
Guarantee 
institution but to induce the lender to make the loan to the 
borrower. In this sense, the lender is just a conduit or 
funding mechanism through which FmHA provides 
assistance to an eligible borrower so that the statutory 
objectives can be realized. Thus, the particular lender 
involved is of relatively little consequence.” 

Id. at 708–09. Therefore, the decision held that where a guarantee is 
charged against the ceiling for a particular fiscal year, it can continue to be 
charged against the same ceiling notwithstanding a substitution of lenders 
in a subsequent fiscal year, provided that the other relevant terms of the 
agreement (borrower, loan purpose, and loan terms) remain substantially 
the same. Id. at 709. The statement that the particular lender is of little 
consequence presumes, as was in fact the case, that the program legislation 
does not contain any specific eligibility requirements for lenders. Any such 
requirements (for example, the “private lender” requirement in the 
Economic Development Administration cases discussed in section C.1.a of 
this chapter) would of course have to be followed. 

In order for a loan guarantee commitment to be valid and hence binding on 
the government, the government official making the commitment must be 
authorized to do so, and the guarantee must be made to an eligible lender 
extending credit to an eligible borrower for an authorized purpose. 
Questions as to whether a valid guarantee was ever created often do not 
arise until the lender calls upon the government to pay under the 
guarantee. The answer depends on the program statute and regulations, 
the terms of the guarantee instrument, and the conduct of the parties. 

In 54 Comp. Gen. 219 (1974), GAO considered the authority of the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) to reimburse three different lenders. In 
each case, the borrower had applied to SBA for financial assistance, the 
lender (at the request or with the approval of an SBA official) had provided 
interim funds to the borrower, but, for various reasons, the financial 
assistance was ultimately not extended. 

In the first case, an SBA official who was authorized to approve loan 
guarantees advised the bank in writing that the guarantee had been 
approved. SBA subsequently issued a formal loan authorization, but later 
canceled it because the bank did not comply with all of the terms and 
conditions of the guarantee agreement, one of which was that the bank 
disburse the loan within 3 months. Although the initial written approval 
created a valid guarantee, the bank’s noncompliance caused it to lapse. 

Page 11-29 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Therefore, SBA was not obligated to purchase the interim note, that is, to 
reimburse the bank for the advance. 

In the second case, an authorized SBA official had similarly advised the 
bank in writing that the guarantee had been approved. Here, however, SBA 
subsequently determined that the borrower was not eligible for the 
guarantee, and therefore never issued a formal loan authorization. Since 
the bank relied on the prior approval and was not legally required to 
comply with the conditions of the guarantee agreement (such as payment 
of the guarantee fee) until SBA issued the formal authorization, the bank 
was entitled to reimbursement for the interim loan. 

In the third case, SBA had formally approved a direct loan to a borrower 
and had issued a written loan authorization. Because of its inability to 
immediately disburse the funds, SBA requested a private lender to disburse 
the funds on an interim basis, with SBA’s assurance of repayment. SBA 
later refused to disburse the loan funds because the borrower had 
disappeared and his business had become defunct. Under the 
circumstances, SBA’s written commitment to reimburse the lender did 
constitute SBA’s “guarantee” of any advances the lender made in 
reasonable and justified reliance on it. Therefore, even though the direct 
loan by SBA was never disbursed, SBA was authorized to reimburse the 
lender. 

The decision discussed two earlier cases—B-178250, Aug. 6, 1973, and 
B-164162, Sept. 20, 1968—involving direct rather than guaranteed loans. 
GAO had concluded in these cases that, under the specific circumstances 
involved, SBA could not reimburse a lender for losses suffered on interim 
disbursements made after SBA had authorized loans to the borrower. In 
both cases, the claimant bank was unable to adequately establish that any 
SBA official had made a promise or commitment on which the bank could 
justifiably rely. 

Essentially, the primary theory of recovery in all of these cases, although 
not specifically identified as such, was estoppel—conduct by the 
government sufficient to later preclude it from denying the existence of a 
valid guarantee.24 Several similar cases specifically raised the estoppel 

24 As discussed later in this section, the continued viability of these cases is questionable in 
light of subsequent judicial decisions—particularly Office of Personnel Management v. 
Richmond, 496 U.S. 414 (1990). 

Page 11-30 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

theory. For example, the issue in B-187445, Jan. 27, 1977, was whether SBA 
was legally obligated for a $10,000 loss suffered by a bank on a loan made 
to a small business contractor under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 637(a). The bank alleged that the loan was made on the basis of 
assurances from an SBA official that the loan would be guaranteed. GAO 
found, however, that the loan was not in fact guaranteed since it was never 
approved in writing as required by the applicable provision in the guarantee 
agreement between SBA and the bank. Also, SBA had no liability to the 
bank under an estoppel theory since the bank was aware that the SBA 
official involved lacked authority to approve a loan guarantee or otherwise 
assure the bank of repayment. Further, the bank could not demonstrate 
that it had made the loan primarily in reliance on the alleged 
misrepresentations. 

In another 1977 case, a bank argued that SBA was liable under an estoppel 
theory to reimburse the bank for a loss suffered as a result of SBA’s 
approval of a direct disaster loan to the borrower. However, the facts did 
not support an estoppel since SBA made no misrepresentations to the 
bank, and the bank did not make the loan in reliance on the representations 
that SBA did make. B-181432, Feb. 4, 1977. A somewhat similar case 
involving the former Farmers Home Administration denied the claim of a 
creditor who alleged that he had advanced supplies and services to a 
borrower on the basis of assurances from a Farmers Home employee that 
the borrower’s obligation would be guaranteed by the government. Since 
the regulations then expressly prohibited employees from guaranteeing 
repayment of non-Farmers Home Administration loans, either personally 
or on behalf of the government, the creditor was necessarily on notice of 
the employee’s lack of authority to make such assurances. B-168300, 
Dec. 4, 1969; B-168300, Dec. 3, 1969. 

Another estoppel case is B-198310, Apr. 23, 1981. SBA had sent a letter to a 
borrower confirming approval of a direct handicapped assistance loan. 
Allegedly in reliance on this letter, the claimant bank advanced funds to the 
borrower. SBA then issued its formal loan authorization, but canceled it 
shortly thereafter based on the borrower’s failure to disclose all pertinent 
information on its loan application. The bank sought reimbursement on a 
theory of “promissory estoppel.” The Comptroller General held that SBA 
was under no obligation to reimburse the bank for two reasons. First, 
SBA’s letter had been to the borrower, not to the bank. Thus, SBA had 
made no representations to the bank. Second, the bank’s reliance on the 
letter was not reasonable because the letter contained no mention of the 
possibility that the loan might be used to obtain interim financing nor did 

Page 11-31 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

the bank attempt to obtain any assurance from SBA that the borrower 
would be required to use the proceeds of the SBA loan to repay the interim 
loan. 

The existence of a valid guarantee also was an issue in 60 Comp. 
Gen. 700 (1981) in a different context. The then Farmers Home 
Administration regulations required written notification to the lender of the 
approval or disapproval of a guarantee application. Based on these 
regulations, and citing B-187445, Jan. 27, 1977, discussed above, GAO 
concluded that oral notification of a loan guarantee approval was not 
sufficient to create a valid guarantee for purposes of charging that 
guarantee against the annual ceiling. 60 Comp. Gen. at 709–10. 

As the more recent decisions described above indicate, estoppel claims 
against the government can rarely succeed. Even those few earlier cases in 
which GAO has sanctioned them would have to be reassessed before being 
used as precedent in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Office of 
Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414 (1990), which held that 
estoppel against the government requires, in addition to the traditional 
elements such as reasonable and detrimental reliance, a showing of 
affirmative misconduct on the part of government officials.25 

A fairly recent judicial decision involving an SBA loan guarantee, 
Frillz, Inc. v. Lader, 104 F.3d 515 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 813 (1997), 
illustrates this point. The SBA approved a loan guarantee authorization for 
Frillz that contained a clause requiring receipt by the lender of “evidence 
satisfactory to it [the lender] in its sole discretion” that there had been no 
unremedied adverse change in condition subsequent to authorization that 
would warrant not disbursing the loan. Frillz suffered temporary business 
losses between the time of the authorization and the scheduled loan 
disbursement. The lender determined that the problem had been 
sufficiently resolved and was prepared to go ahead with the loan. However, 
SBA disagreed and declined to approve disbursement of the loan. Frillz 
then sued SBA for breach of contract on the basis that the guarantee 
authorization gave the lender—not SBA—sole discretion to determine 
whether there was an unremedied adverse change. The court ruled in favor 
of SBA, holding that, under the applicable program regulations, the SBA 
official who signed the guarantee authorization could not delegate the 

25 Estoppel claims arise in many contexts and are discussed further in Chapter 12 in 
volume III of the second edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations Law.

Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

determination regarding unremedied changes to the lender; thus, the clause 
was ineffective. Frillz, Inc., 104 F.3d at 517–18.26 The court also rejected 
Frillz’s estoppel argument: 

“A party seeking to invoke equitable estoppel against the 
federal government at a minimum must have reasonably 
relied on some affirmative misconduct attributable to the 
sovereign. Passing the point that even such reliance may be 
insufficient, there is absolutely no evidence of affirmative 
misconduct by the SBA which might arguably be sufficient 
to support an estoppel claim against the government in this 
case.” 

Id. at 518 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Wells Fargo 
Bank N.A. v. United States, 88 F.3d 1012 (Fed. Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 
520 U.S. 1116 (1997) is also relevant to the issue of whether a valid 
guarantee exists. While not an estoppel case, Wells Fargo involves facts 
somewhat similar to those in the Frillz case, discussed above. In Wells 
Fargo, officials of the then Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) issued a 
“conditional commitment” to guarantee a loan for construction of an 
ethanol plant under 7 U.S.C. § 1932 and another statute designed to 
promote biomass energy projects.27 Among the conditions was a 
requirement that before the guarantee was issued— 

“the Lender certif[y] that it has no knowledge of any 
adverse change, financial or otherwise, in the Borrower, 
his business, or any parent, subsidiaries, or affiliates 
since it requested a Loan Note Guarantee.” 

Wells Fargo, 88 F.3d at 1020. While Wells Fargo provided this certification, 
FmHA determined that adverse changes had occurred and refused to issue 
the guarantee. The court ruled in favor of Wells Fargo in its breach of 

26 The court noted that, pursuant to a statutory authorization, SBA had delegated certain 
creditworthiness determinations to lenders in its “Preferred Lenders Program”; however, 
the lender in this case was not in that program. The Preferred Lenders Program is discussed 
in GAO, Small Business Administration: Progress Made but Improvements Needed in 
Lender Oversight, GAO-03-90 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 9, 2002), and in B-300248, Jan. 15, 
2004.

Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

contract suit, holding that the conditional commitment constituted a 
unilateral contract on the part of the government contingent upon 
satisfaction of its conditions, and that all of the conditions were, in fact, 
satisfied. The court rejected several arguments advanced by FmHA to the 
effect that the conditional commitment was not legally binding: 

“The government . . . argues that no contract was formed 
because ‘[u]nder [Administration] regulations, no 
Government official, not even one having authority to sign 
the guarantee at the proper time, had the authority to bind 
the United States to a loan note guarantee prior to 
compliance with all the regulatory requirements for 
issuance of a loan note guarantee.’ As the Court of Federal 
Claims correctly stated, however, ‘the issue at this point is 
not whether these officials had the authority to grant a 
guarantee, but whether these officials had the authority to 
obligate the [Administration] to a Conditional Commitment.’ 
. . . Administration officials were authorized to execute 
conditional commitments under the regulations 
implementing the business and industrial loan guarantee 
program. . . . That the guarantee could not finally be 
executed until the conditions were fulfilled is irrelevant in 
determining the validity of the Conditional Commitment. 

“Although Administration regulations characterize the 
Conditional Commitment as mere ‘advice’ to the lender . . . 
the document itself shows that the government is making 
a binding promise: 

“[T]he United States of America acting 

through the Farmers Home Administration 

(FmHA) hereby agrees that . . . it will execute 

Form(s) FmHA 449-34 ‘Loan Note Guarantee’ 

subject to the conditions and requirements 

specified in said regulations and below.” 

Wells Fargo, 88 F.3d at 1018–19. Further, the court concluded that the 
adverse changes asserted by the government were beyond the scope of 
those covered by the conditions set forth in the commitment. Id. 
at 1020–21.

d. Small Business Investment 
Companies 
A “small business investment company” (SBIC) is a private company 
organized under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended 
(15 U.S.C. §§ 661–697g), and licensed by the Small Business Administration 
(SBA). Its purpose is to provide financial assistance to small business 
concerns. For background, see GAO, Small Business: Update of 
Information on SBA’s Small Business Investment Company Programs, 

GAO/RCED-97-55 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 21, 1997). 

A series of decisions in the 1960s upheld SBA’s authority to provide various 
forms of financial assistance to SBICs. First, SBA may guarantee loans 
made to SBICs by private financial institutions. 42 Comp. Gen. 146 (1962). 
While the guarantee authority was not explicit at the time of the 1962 
decision, it was later added and is now found at 15 U.S.C. § 683. SBA also 
has “secondary guarantee” authority, authority to sell to private investors, 
with recourse (SBA’s guarantee), debt instruments representing loans SBA 
had made to SBICs. 44 Comp. Gen. 549 (1965). The proposal considered in 
44 Comp. Gen. 549 involved loans with a maturity of 5 or 6 years. Later that 
same year, SBA proposed extending its program to loans with 15-year 
maturities. GAO again approved, noting that the difference in maturity did 
not affect the basic authority. 45 Comp. Gen. 253 (1965). The 15-year 
period also is now specified in 15 U.S.C. § 683(g)(1). See also 45 Comp. 
Gen. 370 (1965) (same holding for similar program under different 
provision of Small Business Investment Act). 

The Comptroller General concluded further in 45 Comp. Gen. 253 that SBA 
could make the sales through an agent or broker with reasonable 
compensation if administratively determined to be necessary or more 
economical. However, the broker’s compensation may not be paid from the 
proceeds of the loan sales but must be charged to SBA’s appropriation for 
administrative expenses. 

A small business investment company may be either a corporation or a 
limited partnership. 15 U.S.C. § 681(a). The scope of authorized SBA 
assistance includes nonrecourse loans to a limited partnership SBIC (by 
purchasing or guaranteeing its debentures). B-149685, Jan. 12, 1978. 
Nonrecourse in this context means that SBA would “waive” its right to 
recover, provided under the laws of most states, against the separate assets 
of the general partner. 

In B-149685, Mar. 25, 1971, GAO considered SBA’s authority to sell 
guaranteed SBIC debentures to a group of underwriters for resale to 
private investors. Under this program, SBA would first purchase 

Page 11-35 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

$30 million of newly issued debentures from SBICs and then immediately 
sell them to private investors, with SBA’s guarantee of payment of principal 
and interest according to the terms of the instrument. SBA would act as 
servicing agent for the holders, receiving payment on the debentures from 
the SBICs and then paying the holders in accordance with the terms of the 
debentures. The Comptroller General concluded that the proposed sale 
and guarantee of debentures in this manner was within the scope of SBA’s 
statutory authority, provided SBA did not exceed any existing statutory 
program level limitations. See also B-149685, June 3, 1969. 

Another issue is whether a small business investment company is eligible 
to participate, as a lending institution, in a government guaranteed loan 
program. In 49 Comp. Gen. 32 (1969), the Comptroller General held that 
SBICs were not eligible lenders for purposes of SBA’s guaranteed loan 
program under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. § 636(a). 
The decision relied heavily on the legislative history of the Small Business 
Investment Act. 

Some years later, GAO again considered the eligibility of SBICs to be 
guaranteed lenders in SBA’s section 7(a) guaranteed loan program as well 
as the then Farmers Home Administration’s business and industrial loan 
program (7 U.S.C. § 1932). SBA’s new proposal was somewhat different 
from the arrangement considered in 49 Comp. Gen. 32, because after 
originating the loan, the SBIC would then immediately sell the guaranteed 
portion to another lending institution and remain the servicing agent. 
GAO’s conclusion remained the same, again based on the legislative history 
of the Small Business Investment Act which indicated that Congress 
intended SBICs to operate independently of other federal loan programs. 
With respect to the then Farmers Home Administration program, nothing in 
either the Small Business Investment Act or the applicable program statute 
or their legislative histories supported a different conclusion. 56 Comp. 
Gen. 323 (1977). 

One type of small business investment company is the “minority enterprise 
small business investment company,” or “MESBIC.” As the name implies, 
an MESBIC is a small business investment company formed to aid 
minority-owned small businesses. In 59 Comp. Gen. 635 (1980), aff’d on 
reconsideration, B-197439, Nov. 26, 1980, GAO considered SBA’s authority 
to “leverage” against federal funds invested in MESBICs. “Leveraging” 
means investing on a partial matching basis through the purchase or 
guarantee of debentures or the purchase of preferred securities. The 
specific issue was whether SBA could leverage against Federal Railroad 

Page 11-36 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

e. The Federal Financing 
Bank 
Administration investments in MESBICs. Since the Small Business 
Investment Act authorizes SBA to leverage only against private money, the 
decision concluded that, absent specific statutory authority, SBA could not 
leverage against federal funds invested in MESBICs. The MESBICs took 
the case to court, arguing that “private” meant simply “non-SBA.” Based on 
the plain meaning of the statutory language, the court agreed with GAO. 
Inner City Broadcasting Corp. v. Sanders, 733 F.2d 154 (D.C. Cir. 1984). 
“[P]rivate means private and not governmental.” Id. at 157. 

GAO and the court had both recognized that leveraging against other 
federal funds would be permissible if authorized by the statute under which 
those other funds were provided. One such example is community 
development block grant funds provided under Title I of the Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5301–5321. 
See 60 Comp. Gen. 210 (1981). 

The Federal Financing Bank was created by the Federal Financing Bank 
Act of 1973.28 Its purpose is to coordinate federal credit programs with 
overall government economic and fiscal policies. It is a corporate 
instrumentality of the United States government, subject to the general 
direction and supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury. 12 U.S.C. § 2283. 
The Bank acts essentially as an intermediary. Its powers include 
purchasing agency debt securities and federally guaranteed borrowings. 
Specifically, it is authorized by 12 U.S.C. § 2285(a) to— 

“purchase and sell on terms and conditions determined 
by the Bank, any obligation which is issued, sold, or 
guaranteed by a Federal agency. Any Federal agency 
which is authorized to issue, sell, or guarantee any 
obligation is authorized to issue or sell such obligations 
directly to the Bank.” 

The Bank obtains funds by issuing its own securities, almost entirely to the 
Treasury. Id. §§ 2288(b), (c). The decisions summarized below illustrate 
the varying roles the Bank plays in the credit financing arena. 

In 58 Comp. Gen. 138 (1978), GAO considered the Small Business 
Administration’s (SBA) authority to issue certificates to the Federal 

28 Pub. L. No. 93-224, 87 Stat. 937 (Dec. 29, 1973), codified at 12 U.S.C. §§ 2281–2296.

Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Financing Bank evidencing transfer of title of a number of individual loans 
and setting forth SBA’s guaranteed assurance of payment, either in cash or 
by loan substitution. Even though this arrangement contemplated the sale 
of certificates evidencing ownership of a group of SBA loans rather than 
individual loans, it was sufficiently similar to the arrangement upheld in 
B-149685, Mar. 25, 1971, discussed above in connection with small business 
investment companies (SBICs), and was therefore permissible. Since the 
certificate did refer to specific loans and, when transferred to the Bank, 
would represent a transfer of ownership of the loans to the Bank, the plan 
would not constitute borrowing by SBA, which would have required 
specific statutory authority.29 

The same decision, while noting that SBA’s authority to sell loans to the 
Federal Financing Bank with its guarantee was “neither greater nor less” 
than its authority to sell loans to other purchasers (58 Comp. Gen. at 139), 
nevertheless concluded that SBA lacked the authority to sell direct disaster 
loans (15 U.S.C. § 636(b)) to the Federal Financing Bank on a guaranteed 
basis. Although SBA does have authority to guarantee disaster loans made 
to eligible borrowers by participating lending institutions, it is not 
authorized, in the absence of specific statutory authority or a clear 
expression of congressional intent, to sell and guarantee disaster loans that 
it had originally made directly. Since there was at the time no statutory 
ceiling on the type of loans in question, the proposal would enable SBA to 
“replenish its disaster loan revolving fund so as to enable it to make new 
disaster loans and repeat the process indefinitely,” potentially resulting in 
an unlimited contingent liability against the United States with no 
congressional restraint. 58 Comp. Gen. at 146. In addition, the proposal 
contemplated a 100 percent guarantee which would have violated the 
statutory 90 percent maximum guarantee of disaster loans. 

Another case involving the Federal Financing Bank as “guaranteed lender” 
is B-162373-O.M., July 31, 1979, finding that an agreement between the 
Department of Agriculture, acting through the then Rural Electrification 
Administration,30 and the Bank by which the Bank made loans to borrowers 
that the Department guaranteed under the authority of section 306 of the 
Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. § 936), was within the statutory 

29 SBA now has such borrowing authority in 15 U.S.C. § 633(c)(5). 

30 The Department’s Rural Utilities Service now performs the functions formerly carried out 
by the Rural Electrification Administration. See 7 U.S.C. § 6942. 

Page 11-38 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

authority of both agencies. The legality of the arrangement was considered 
from the perspectives both of the Department’s authority to guarantee 
loans made by a nonprivate entity such as the Bank and of the Bank’s 
authority to act as the initial lender, making loans directly to a private 
nongovernmental borrower with the Department’s guarantee. Since the 
Department has authority to guarantee loans made by “any legally 
organized lending agency,” it could guarantee loans made by the Federal 
Financing Bank. At the same time, the Bank was acting within its statutory 
authority to purchase obligations guaranteed by a federal agency, since the 
transaction was in the form of its purchasing the borrower’s note from the 
borrower with payment being guaranteed by the Department. Although the 
arrangement was legal, GAO was critical because it did not involve the 
private credit sector in the REA program as contemplated by the Rural 
Electrification Act. See GAO, Financing Rural Electric Generating 
Facilities: A Large and Growing Activity, CED-81-14 (Nov. 28, 1980), 
at 16–17. 

Congress subsequently confirmed the above arrangement by amending 
7 U.S.C. § 936 to provide that the loans, upon request of the borrower, “shall 
be made by the Federal Financing Bank.” Under the statute, loan servicing 
is the responsibility of the lender. Thus, the Department’s funds are 
available to perform the loan servicing function as the Bank’s agent only on 
a reimbursable basis. 62 Comp. Gen. 309 (1983). 

Two 1987 opinions discussed the Federal Financing Bank’s role in the 
foreign military sales program. As described in these opinions, the Bank 
finances credit sales under the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 
§§ 2751–2799aa-2, with the loans being guaranteed by the Defense Security 
Assistance Agency (DSAA). If the debtor nation defaults, DSAA pays the 
Bank. One opinion concluded that the Bank is not authorized to 
deliberately delay making demand on DSAA for payment upon default. 
B-226718.2, Aug. 19, 1987. The second advised that two refinancing options 
under consideration, one involving prepayment without penalty and one 
involving the partial capitalization of interest, would result in a financial 
loss to the United States or the substantial risk of one and should not be 
implemented without clear evidence of congressional approval. 66 Comp. 
Gen. 577 (1987). Congress subsequently approved a prepayment option. 
See GAO, Security Assistance: Foreign Military Sales Debt Refinancing, 
GAO/NSIAD-89-175 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 16, 1989); Federal Financing 
Bank: The Government Incurred a Cost of $2 Billion on Loan 
Prepayments, GAO/AFMD-89-59 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 22, 1989).

Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

In two later opinions, GAO held that the Federal Financing Bank was an 
appropriate source of financing for the Federal Triangle International 
Cultural and Trade Center-Federal Office Building (now known as the 
Reagan Building) since this was fundamentally a project being constructed 
by the federal government. B-248647, Dec. 28, 1992, aff’d, B-248647.2, 
Apr. 24, 1995. 

A 1985 transaction illustrates a very different role for the Bank. In October 
1985, the Treasury Department had reached its statutory public debt ceiling 
and was in danger of defaulting on its obligations pending congressional 
action to raise the ceiling. The Bank effectively borrowed $5 billion from 
the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund by issuing securities to the 
Fund and accepting Treasury obligations in payment. The Bank then used 
these securities to prepay part of its outstanding debt to Treasury. This in 
turn reduced Treasury’s outstanding debt, enabling it to borrow an 
additional $5 billion from the public to meet its obligations. Based on the 
Bank’s statutory authority and the conclusion that its obligations do not 
count against the public debt limit set by 31 U.S.C. § 3101(b), the 
Comptroller General found the transaction legally unobjectionable. 

B-138524, Oct. 30, 1985. 

The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel cited the above 1985 
GAO opinion in affirming the legality of similar transactions by the Bank 
that were designed to free up room under the debt limit. Memorandum for 
the General Counsel, Department of the Treasury, Transactions Between 
the Federal Financing Bank and the Department of the Treasury, OLC 
Opinion, Feb. 13, 1996. Among the transactions this opinion approved was 
the Bank’s sale of loan assets evidencing debts by the Postal Service and 
the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund in exchange for United States debt obligations. For further 
information on these transactions, see GAO, Debt Ceiling: Analysis of 
Actions During the 1995–1996 Crisis, GAO/AIMD-96-130 (Washington, 
D.C.: Aug. 30, 1996). For a description of more recent transactions along 
these lines, see GAO, Debt Ceiling: Analysis of Actions Taken during the 
2003 Debt Issuance Suspension Period, GAO-04-526 (Washington, D.C.: 
May 20, 2004), at 25–30. 

When the Federal Financing Bank was first created, its transactions were 
entirely off-budget. 12 U.S.C. § 2290(c) (“receipts and disbursements of the 
Bank . . . shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United 
States Government”). With the budget reforms of the Congressional 
Budget Act and subsequent legislation, this treatment came under 

Page 11-40 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

increasing criticism and GAO, among others, recommended that Bank 
transactions involving other government entities be reflected in the budget. 
E.g., 58 Comp. Gen. 138, 142–44 (1978); GAO, Government Agency 
Transactions With the Federal Financing Bank Should Be Included on the 
Budget, PAD-77-70 (Aug. 3, 1977). See also B-178726, Sept. 16, 1976 
(pointing out that purchase by the Bank of a loan guaranteed by another 
agency amounts to a direct loan). 

While not amending the Federal Financing Bank Act itself, Congress in 
1985 added 2 U.S.C. § 655(b) to the Congressional Budget Act: 

“All receipts and disbursements of the Federal 
Financing Bank with respect to any obligations 
which are issued, sold, or guaranteed by a Federal 
agency shall be treated as a means of financing such 
agency for purposes of section 1105 of title 31, 
United States Code [submission of President’s budget] 
and for purposes of [the Congressional Budget] Act.” 

Under this provision, direct loans of the Bank are accounted for as loans of 
the guaranteeing agency. See B-226718.2, Aug. 19, 1987. 

2. Coverage of Borrowers 
a. Eligibility of Borrowers Loan guarantee program legislation may or may not establish criteria for 
lender eligibility; it will almost invariably address borrower eligibility. This 
is because the primary purpose of a guarantee program is to enhance credit 
availability to a particular class of borrowers (farmers, veterans, small 
businesses, etc.). The significance of any such eligibility requirements is 
that an agency is not authorized to issue a guarantee or reimburse a lender 
on behalf of an ineligible borrower. 
For example, one portion of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1703, 
authorizes the insurance of loans made to finance repairs or improvements 
to real property by owners or lessees. Under this statute, it is the lending 
institution’s responsibility to determine borrower eligibility. Thus, a 
lending institution making a loan to someone who is neither the owner nor 
the lessee of the property involved is not entitled to be reimbursed for 
losses resulting from borrower default. B-180015, Nov. 28, 1973; B-174739, 
Jan. 19, 1972. 
Page 11-41 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


b. Substitution of Borrowers 
Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

While most eligibility requirements are found in the program statute itself, 
they may appear in other legislation. For example, the Military Selective 
Service Act provides that any person who is required to register for the 
draft and knowingly and willfully fails to do so shall be ineligible for 
guaranteed student loan assistance. 50 U.S.C. App. § 462(f). The 
Department of Education is authorized to issue implementing regulations, 
discussed in B-210733, Feb. 25, 1983. 

Generally, the substitution of borrowers within the same fiscal year will not 
present problems. However, as with contracts and grants, the substitution 
may or may not be proper when made in a subsequent fiscal year. Loan 
guarantee authority—whether it is an advance appropriation of budget 
authority under the Federal Credit Reform Act or a program level ceiling in 
a situation not governed by the Credit Reform Act—is granted on an 
annual, multiple year, or no-year basis. It thus has a period of availability 
analogous to a regular appropriation. Where the period of availability is a 
fixed time period, the authority ceases to be available when that period 
expires. 

The issue in B-164031.5, June 25, 1976, was the transferability of a loan 
guarantee and interest subsidy originally approved under a program of 
federal assistance for the construction and modernization of hospitals. The 
question was whether the guarantee could be transferred from one hospital 
to another in the following fiscal year, when the original hospital became 
unable to take advantage of the guarantee due to apparent financial 
difficulties. The Comptroller General found that, since the period of 
availability of the guarantee authority had expired, the transfer would be 
authorized only if it could be viewed as a “replacement.” Since the second 
hospital did not serve the same community as the first, the transfer of the 
loan guarantee to the new “borrower” was not merely a “replacement” and 
therefore could not be approved. 

A few years later, the then Farmers Home Administration asked whether it 
could continue to charge a guarantee to the annual ceiling for the fiscal 
year in which it was originally approved when a new borrower was 
substituted in a later fiscal year. As a general rule, the answer is no, and the 
substitution would have to be treated as a new undertaking. This is 
different from the substitution of lenders discussed previously in this 
chapter because the approval of a guaranteed loan to a particular borrower 
requires a specific eligibility determination. Thus, while the identity of the 
particular lender may be of relatively little consequence, the identity and 
eligibility of the borrower are essential to the transaction. However, the 

Page 11-42 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


c. Loan Purpose 
Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

substitution may be treated as a continuation of the original guarantee 
where the substituted borrower bears a “close and genuine relationship” to 
the originally approved borrower (for example, a corporation and 
partnership controlled by the same individuals), provided of course that 
the loan purpose remains substantially unchanged. 60 Comp. 
Gen. 700, 707 (1981).31 

The authority to make a loan guarantee commitment depends not only on 
the eligibility of the particular borrower, but also on whether the purpose 
for which the guaranteed loan is to be made is consistent with the 
applicable program statute and regulations. The analysis is essentially an 
application of the “necessary expense” doctrine used in other purpose 
availability contexts. 

A number of illustrative cases have arisen under section 301 of the Defense 
Production Act of 1950, 50 U.S.C. App. § 2091, which authorizes loan 
guarantees to finance the performance of contracts where deemed 
“necessary to expedite or expand production and deliveries or services 
under Government contracts for the procurement of industrial resources or 
critical technology items essential to the national defense . . . .” Id. 
§ 2091(a)(1). For example, B-115791-O.M., Sept. 3, 1953, concluded that 
section 301, ordinarily used to provide short-term working capital, could 
also be used to guarantee loans for the expansion of plant facilities if 
determined necessary to expedite production and deliveries or services 
under defense contracts. 

Contracts to purchase equipment for civil defense stockpiling purposes 
may be regarded as contracts for the national defense and therefore eligible 
for loan guarantees under section 301. 37 Comp. Gen. 417 (1957). The 
issue in that case was whether a 1953 amendment to the act, which 
narrowed the definition of “national defense,” had the effect of excluding 
civil defense which clearly would have been covered before the 
amendment. GAO found no evidence of congressional intent to exclude 
civil defense, and concluded therefore that the loans could be guaranteed. 

While section 301 was intended primarily to assist small and medium-size 
defense contractors, its language is not so limited and is sufficiently broad 

31 Both 60 Comp. Gen. 700 and B-164031(5) applied the basic principles of decisions on the 
substitution of grantees discussed in Chapter 10. 

Page 11-43 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

to permit guarantees to large-size defense contractors as well. B-170109, 
July 21, 1970 (large railroad carrier). 

GAO considered a different loan guarantee program in 38 Comp. Gen. 640 
(1959). The question in that case was whether the then Civil Aeronautics 
Board, under a statute authorizing the guarantee of aircraft purchase loans, 
could guarantee the indebtedness of an air carrier for the conversion of an 
existing aircraft. The case involved the conversion of piston engine aircraft 
to turbo-powered aircraft. GAO found that the conversion was such an 
extensive modification as to amount to a new type of aircraft for all 
practical purposes. Also, it was clear that if the manufacturer had 
performed the conversion and then sold the converted aircraft to the 
carrier, the purchase would have been eligible for the guarantee. The 
conversion was therefore within the statutory purpose and the guarantee 
was authorized. 

An analogous situation occurred in 34 Comp. Gen. 392 (1955), involving the 
Maritime Administration’s ship mortgage insurance authority under the 
Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended, 46 U.S.C. App. §§ 1271–1275. 
Noting that purchase plus reconstruction was the equivalent of new 
construction for purposes of the program, the Comptroller General held 
that the insurance could extend to the purchase money mortgage and 
reconstruction costs for a vessel acquired by purchase (in this case from 
the government) instead of under a construction contract. This decision 
was amplified in 35 Comp. Gen. 18 (1955), which held that the Maritime 
Administration could insure a second-lien reconstruction mortgage to a 
private lending institution where the first-lien (purchase money) mortgage 
was held by the United States. There was nothing in the statute limiting the 
insurance authority to first-lien mortgages. 

The Department of Agriculture’s rural electrification financial assistance 
programs have generated a number of purpose-related cases. Generally, 
the Department may make direct loans and loan guarantees to finance rural 
electrification facilities for persons not already receiving central station 
service. See 7 U.S.C. §§ 901–950bb.32 

32 The Department of Agriculture used to conduct these programs through the now defunct 
Rural Electrification Administration; thus, the decisions discussed here refer to that entity. 
The Department’s Rural Utility Service now administers these programs. For recent 
background on the programs, see GAO, Rural Utilities Service: Opportunities to Better 
Target Assistance to Rural Areas and Avoid Unnecessary Financial Risk, GAO-04-647 
(Washington, D.C.: June 18, 2004). 

Page 11-44 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


d. Change in Loan Purpose 
Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Several cases have established the proposition that the Department can 
include elements in a project that are arguably beyond a literal reading of 
the statutory language, where those elements are merely incidental to 
accomplishing the statutory purpose. Thus, early cases on the 
Department’s direct loan program held that the Department cannot make a 
loan where the only persons to be benefited are already receiving central 
service, but it can finance the acquisition of existing facilities which are to 
be incorporated into a larger system, where the acquisition is necessary for 
the effective operation of the overall system. B-48590, Apr. 3, 1945; 
B-32920, Mar. 12, 1943; B-29463, Dec. 1, 1942. This principle applies 
whether the acquisition is by direct purchase or the purchase of securities 
to be exchanged for the physical property. B-42486, July 25, 1944. 

Rural electrification loans are not intended to parallel existing facilities. 
Thus, where Plant A and Plant B are located less than 200 feet apart, and 
Plant A is receiving central service from a power supplier who has offered 
to provide adequate service to Plant B, Plant B cannot properly be 
considered a person not receiving central service for purposes of qualifying 
for financial assistance. B-134138, Oct. 15, 1958. 

In B-195437, Feb. 15, 1980, GAO applied the principles of the above direct 
loan cases to the rural electrification loan guarantee program. The issue 
was the Department of Agriculture’s authority to approve a loan guarantee 
to finance certain expenditures associated with the construction of a 
coal-fired electric generating plant, including cancellation charges if two 
contracts for components of the plant were terminated. The decision held 
that, since the contractors would not begin to build the components 
without a commitment that the cancellation costs would be paid, approval 
of a loan guarantee to assure funding to pay such charges was consistent 
with the basic statutory purpose of providing electricity to persons in rural 
areas and therefore authorized. 

Finally, loans and loan guarantees to provide housing for the elderly may 
include the purchase of related necessary equipment such as refrigerators 
and laundry equipment. 42 Comp. Gen. 528 (1963). 

A decision previously cited in the section C.1.b discussion of changes in 
lenders and borrowers, 60 Comp. Gen. 700 (1981), also addressed changes 
in loan purpose under the Farmers Home Administration rural 
development loan guarantee program. Again, the issue was when changes 
could be deemed a continuation of the original transaction, so that the 

Page 11-45 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

guarantee would remain chargeable to the annual ceiling for the fiscal year 
in which it was originally approved. 

Similar questions had arisen frequently in the grant context, and the 
Comptroller General applied the grant principles to loan guarantees, 
stating: 

“Applying these grant decisions to the area of loan 
guarantees, when a major change to the ‘character’ 
of the project supported by the guarantee is made, the 
revised loan guarantee must be charged against the 
ceiling in effect when the revision is made. We believe 
that just as a significant change in the terms and 
conditions under which a grant was made would be viewed 
as creating a new grant, a significant change in the terms 
and conditions under which a loan guarantee was approved 
would create a new loan.” 

Id. at 707. Thus, major changes will result in the treatment of the 
transaction as a new guarantee. However, less substantial changes where 
the purpose and scope of the revised agreement are consistent with the 
purpose and scope of the original agreement may be treated as a 
continuation as long as the need for the project continues to exist. This 
test must be applied on a case-by-case basis. 

3. Terms and Conditions 
of Guarantees 
a. Introduction Just as with any other contractual obligation, a loan guarantee has terms 
and conditions which the parties must follow. If a valid guarantee has been 
created, the borrower defaults, and the lender has complied with all 
applicable terms and conditions, the government is obligated to pay on the 
guarantee. Conversely, if the lender does not comply with applicable 
requirements, it may find that it has lost the benefit of the guarantee. The 
applicable terms and conditions are found in the program statute, agency 
regulations, and the guarantee agreement. 
This section will discuss the effect of noncompliance, especially by the 
lender. The cases fall into two broad categories. In one group, the loan 
may not have been eligible for the guarantee from its inception based on a 
Page 11-46 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II

Loans 

b. Property Insurance 
Programs under the 
National Housing Act 
failure to satisfy applicable requirements such as a statutory limitation on 
the maximum amount or maturity of the loan. The result will usually be 
that the guarantee itself was never valid. In the second group, the loan to 
be guaranteed complies with all pertinent statutory or regulatory 
requirements, but the guarantee never takes effect or is nullified as a result 
of the lender’s failure to comply with one or more of the terms and 
conditions upon which the government’s guarantee is contingent. 

To illustrate these concepts, we have selected two areas—property 
insurance programs under the National Housing Act and loan guarantee 
programs of the Small Business Administration. The specific requirements 
discussed are the more common ones and apply of course only to the 
particular program. Nevertheless, our selection is intended to illustrate 
types of issues, approaches to problem-solving, and the crucial role of 
agency regulations, and from this perspective is of more general relevance. 
Also, program details such as maximum loan amount, whether prescribed 
by statute or regulation, are subject to change from time to time. 
Accordingly, individual cases do not necessarily reflect current program 
requirements, but are intended to illustrate or support propositions of 
continuing validity with respect to requirements of that type. 

Title I of the National Housing Act, Pub. L. No. 73-479, 48 Stat. 1246 
(June 27, 1934), as amended and codified at 12 U.S.C. §§ 1701–1706d, 
authorizes a number of housing assistance programs. Several of the 
programs were formerly administered by the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) and were transferred to the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) upon its creation in 1965. The programs 
are still popularly known as “FHA programs.” GAO has issued numerous 
reports on these programs, some of the most recent being: Single-Family 
Housing: Progress Made, but Opportunities Exist to Improve HUD’s 
Oversight of FHA Lenders, GAO-05-13 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 12, 2004); 
Multifamily Housing: Improvements Needed in HUD’s Oversight of 
Lenders That Underwrite FHA-Insured Loans, GAO-02-680 (Washington, 
D.C.: July 19, 2002); Mortgage Financing: Changes in the Performance of 
FHA-Insured Loans, GAO-02-773 (Washington, D.C.: July 10, 2002). 

(1) Maximum amount of loan 
Under 12 U.S.C. § 1703, the Secretary of HUD is authorized to insure 
lenders against losses sustained in extending loans to borrowers for 
various purposes, including home construction, repair, and improvement, 
and the purchase of manufactured (mobile) homes. The statute establishes 

Page 11-47 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

the maximum amount of loans that may be insured for the various 
authorized purposes, for example, $25,000 for repairs and improvements to 
an existing single-family structure. Id. § 1703(b)(1)(A)(i). While the 
specific dollar amounts have changed over the years, the Congress has 
imposed maximum loan limits in one form or another since the program 
was established in 1934. 

Where a single loan is involved, its face amount cannot exceed the 
statutory limitation. If a loan which is reported by the lender to HUD for 
insurance exceeds the statutory limitation in effect when the loan was 
made, the lender cannot be reimbursed for any of its losses since the loan 
was ineligible for insurance from its inception. E.g., B-127167, July 15, 
1970; B-127243, May 21, 1956. 

In applying this limitation where more than one loan is involved, the 
approach of HUD’s program regulations is to consider whether the total 
amount of all outstanding insured loans made to a borrower under Title I of 
the Housing Act with respect to the same property or structure exceeds the 
maximum permissible amount. In this situation, for example, the ceiling 
for property improvement loans applies to the outstanding aggregate loan 
balance rather than the sum of the face amounts. 24 C.F.R. § 201.10(a)(2) 
(2005). Thus, for a second loan, the ceiling is compared with the face 
amount of the second loan (which represents the outstanding balance of 
that loan at the time the determination is made) plus the outstanding 
balance of the first loan. B-148894, June 29, 1962; B-137493, Nov. 20, 1958. 
The method used to compute the outstanding balance is within HUD’s 
discretion. In considering claims, GAO will apply the method prescribed in 
the regulations. The fact that other reasonable methods may exist is 
irrelevant. B-162961, Jan. 19, 1968. 

The ceiling applies only to loans for the same property. In B-148804, June 7, 
1962, the Comptroller General advised that a lender could be reimbursed 
for a loss it suffered when the borrower defaulted, even though the original 
loan of $4,000 exceeded the then-existing $3,500 limitation. Although only 
one application for a $4,000 loan had been made, the record revealed that 
two separate properties were involved, with $3,000 of the loan funds 
intended for the improvement of one property, and $1,000 for the other. 
Therefore, the limitation which applied only to loans for the same property 
was not violated. 

This decision points out another important provision of 12 U.S.C. § 1703. 
The Secretary of HUD is authorized to waive a requirement in the 

Page 11-48 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

regulations if in the Secretary’s judgment enforcement would impose an 
injustice on an insured lender, provided that the lender has substantially 
complied with the regulations in good faith and waiver would not increase 
the government’s obligation beyond what it would have been under full 
compliance. Id. § 1703(e). Thus, in B-148804, the regulations required 
separate applications for separate properties, but GAO advised that the 
Federal Housing Administration could waive the requirement. Prior to 
enactment of the waiver authority, GAO had applied the general rule that 
agencies have no authority to waive statutory regulations. 15 Comp. 
Gen. 869 (1936). The waiver provision was enacted 3 weeks after the 
decision. The authority has been applied in a variety of contexts. E.g., 
B-127026, Mar. 27, 1956 (bank disbursed loan after a change in regulations 
under which loan would have been ineligible, but had approved loan in 
good faith before receiving notice of the change). The Secretary of HUD 
may delegate the waiver authority to a “substantial compliance 
committee.” B-127167, Dec. 17, 1968. 

Several decisions have emphasized that the waiver authority applies only to 
regulations. It does not apply to a requirement imposed by statute, such as 
the maximum loan amount. A purported waiver of a statutory requirement 
is ineffective. E.g., B-127243, May 21, 1956. A waiver inconsistent with the 
statutory authority, for example, lack of good faith by the lender, is also 
unauthorized. B-127167, Dec. 5, 1957. 

Exercise of the waiver authority is up to HUD, not GAO. While GAO may 
find a waiver invalid if it violates one of the above principles, GAO cannot 
positively exercise the authority where HUD has chosen not to do so. As in 
B-148804, June 7, 1962, GAO can only advise HUD that in its opinion waiver 
is authorized. 

(2) Maximum loan maturity 
The Housing Act also prescribes, by category, the maximum maturity term 
of loans which may be insured under 12 U.S.C. § 1703. For example, the 
maturity of a loan for repairs and improvements to an existing single-family 
structure may not exceed 20 years and 32 days. Id. § 1703(b)(3)(A)(i). As 
with the maximum loan amount, maturity limitations have existed since the 
program’s inception. 

The maturity date is computed based on the payment due date indicated on 
the note. If the period exceeds the statutory maximum, the loan is not 
insurable. It is the responsibility of the lender rather than the government 

Page 11-49 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

to make certain that notes do not have maturities in excess of the statutory 
maximum. 55 Comp. Gen. 126 (1975); B-172121, Apr. 12, 1971. Thus, in 
55 Comp. Gen. 126, a bank’s claim for reimbursement was denied where a 
note submitted and accepted for insurance had a projected maturity date 
17 days in excess of the maximum in effect when the loan was made. 

The decision at 55 Comp. Gen. 126 also held that, since the statutory 
limitation applies to the maturity of the obligation or note underlying the 
loan, the date on the note is controlling and not the date on which the note 
was assigned or the funds disbursed. However, this is not an absolute and 
there are certain circumstances in which the date on the note has been 
found not controlling. For example, in B-162542, Oct. 24, 1967, GAO 
approved a lender’s claim even though the note stated a final payment due 
date after the existing statutory limitation. The holding was based on a 
letter from the lender to the borrower which agreed to move up the date of 
the first payment and, by implication, all of the others as well, including the 
final payment. As a result, the maturity date fell within the statutory 
period. 

Somewhat similarly, B-166521, Apr. 25, 1969, involved a 60-month note 
which, as written, would have exceeded the statutory maximum. The note 
was dated June 20, 1963, but provided that the first payment was not due 
until July 1, 1968. Based on the borrower’s actual payment record, it was 
obvious that the maturity date had been inadvertently entered on the note 
as the first payment due date. Thus, the maturity date was within the thenexisting 
statutory maximum and the lender could be paid. 

Again in B-191660, Mar. 5, 1979, GAO upheld a bank’s claim where the note 
had a projected maturity date 2 days in excess of the then-existing statutory 
limitation. The borrower’s payment record and other evidence supported 
the bank’s allegation that, due to inadvertence, the note as written did not 
reflect the intention of the parties at the time the loan was made. The 
decision emphasized that, where extraneous evidence is to be used to 
correct an alleged error on a note, merely changing the due date after 
default and after HUD has refused insurance is legally irrelevant. The 
extraneous evidence must establish that the allegedly correct due date is 
what the parties intended at the time the note was executed. 

Problems may also arise when the term of the initial insured loan is within 
the statutory maximum but a subsequent extension agreement results in 
exceeding the maximum maturity period. For example, in B-131963, 
July 17, 1957, the Federal Housing Administration could not reimburse a 

Page 11-50 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

bank for a loss suffered on a defaulted loan where the bank had agreed in 
writing to extend the maturity date of the note beyond the statutory 
maximum. 

In that decision, GAO held that while 12 U.S.C. § 1703(b)(6) permits a loan 
to be refinanced, this authority does not include a mere extension of 
payment. Thus, a lender may extend the time for paying a note beyond the 
maximum time limitation and still retain insurability only by actually 
refinancing the loan, that is, by executing a new note. Short of an actual 
refinancing, a mere extension of payment beyond the maximum will result 
in the loss of insurability. See also B-164118, Nov. 19, 1969; B-149800, 
Sept. 28, 1962; B-148816, May 21, 1962. Several cases have rejected 
arguments by the lender either that it had not intended to extend the final 
maturity date beyond the permissible maximum or that it should have been 
allowed to subsequently rescind or reform the extension agreement to 
conform to the statutory limitation. E.g., B-188240, Aug. 10, 1977; B-164118, 
Dec. 30, 1969; B-164118, Aug. 14, 1968. 

Insurability may be retained if the extension is merely a temporary deferral 
of certain payments, with the deferred payments to be made up prior to the 
original maturity date. However, if this is the case, it must be spelled out in 
the extension agreement. B-164118, Dec. 30, 1969. 

In 51 Comp. Gen. 222 (1971), the extension agreement was not merely an 
extension of time but also changed other terms such as the period of 
payment and the amount of the monthly installment. In these 
circumstances, the Comptroller General found that the terms of the 
extension agreement differed so substantially from those of the original 
note that it was “tantamount to a new note” and could be considered as a 
refinancing. Although the “refinancing” had not been accomplished in 
accordance with applicable regulations, GAO advised HUD that it could 
consider waiving those particular regulatory requirements under 12 U.S.C. 
§ 1703(e). 

(3) Owner/lessee requirement 
Another requirement of the Housing Act is that property improvement 
loans can be made only to borrowers who are owners of the property or 
who are lessees under a lease expiring not less than 6 months after the 
maturity of the loan or other advance of credit. 12 U.S.C. § 1703(a). A loan 
made to a borrower who is neither the owner nor the lessee of the property 
involved is not insurable. For example, where the property was owned by a 

Page 11-51 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

corporation and the loan application and note were signed by two 
individuals who were officers of the corporation, but with no indication 
that they were signing as representatives of the corporation, the loan was 
not made to the owner of the property and was ineligible for insurance. 
B-180015, Nov. 28, 1973. Similarly, where the same person was president of 
two different corporations and signed the note as president of corporation 
“A” but had signed the lease on the property involved as president of 
corporation “B,” the loan was not made to the lessee and was not insurable. 

B-174739, Jan. 19, 1972. 

The lease must expire “not less than six months after the maturity of the 
loan.” 12 U.S.C. § 1703(a). A loan to a lessee is not insurable where the 
lease expires before the maturity date (B-194145, Dec. 12, 1980) or on the 
maturity date (B-172965, July 16, 1971). Time “after” an event is 
traditionally computed by excluding the date of the happening. Thus, a 
loan with a maturity date of July 1, 1956, to a lessee whose lease was due to 
expire on December 31, 1956, was not insurable. “Not less than six months 
after” the maturity date would have been on or after January 1, 1957. 

B-129898, Dec. 28, 1956. 

In B-194145, Dec. 12, 1980, a loan was refinanced after the borrower, under 
a lease with option to purchase, had exercised the option. The bank argued 
that the loan should be insurable since the refinancing note had been 
executed to the owner. However, the Comptroller General held that a 
refinancing loan is insurable only where the prior loan being refinanced 
was itself validly insured. Since the original loans in that case were 
ineligible, the refinancing loan was equally ineligible. Also, the refinancing 
loan could not be considered an entirely new loan for purposes of 
insurability, since the statute authorizes insurance to finance 
improvements, not to repay outstanding uninsured loans. 

In B-124410, July 25, 1955, GAO allowed a bank’s claim on a loan to a 
borrower who was not the owner of the property. The decision was based 
on Federal Housing Administration (FHA) regulations which provided that 
a lender, acting in good faith, may in the absence of any information to the 
contrary rely on statements of fact in a credit application, and the credit 
application in that case had been misleading. Compare, however, 17 Comp. 
Gen. 604 (1938), in which a claim was denied for a loss suffered when a 
lender advanced funds to an individual other than the borrower upon a 
forged authorization, where a simple comparison with the signature on the 
note would have disclosed the forgery. 

Page 11-52 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

While a bank is generally entitled to rely on statements of fact in a credit 
application, it is nevertheless required to exercise good credit judgment. 
Thus, payment was denied in A-88143, Aug. 21, 1937, where the borrower 
had previously defaulted on a different loan with the same bank. The result 
applies equally to a bank with several branches where the contract of 
insurance is with the home office. 19 Comp. Gen. 92 (1939). An apparent 
exception occurred in B-124438, July 26, 1955, where a borrower listed on 
his credit application a prior loan with a branch of the same bank located 
110 miles away, but failed to note that it was in default. The bank checked 
several local credit references and received favorable reports, but did not 
check with its branch. Since the bank had diligently checked the local 
references, the borrower cured the default on the prior loan, and the FHA 
waived the bank’s violation of regulations which prohibited accepting a 
loan when a prior loan was in default, GAO concluded that the bank could 
be reimbursed for its losses on the second note.33 For cases on the 
requirement to approve the credit statement, see 16 Comp. Gen. 958 (1937) 
and A-71945, June 16, 1937. 

(4) Execution of the note 
Another requirement, found in the regulations implementing the Housing 
Act, is that the note evidencing the indebtedness bear the genuine signature 
of the borrower, be valid and enforceable against the borrower, and be 
complete and regular on its face. 24 C.F.R. § 201.12 (2005). In a number of 
cases where either signatures were forged or terms of the note were 
altered—potentially making the note ineligible for insurance under the 
regulations—GAO has allowed claims by a lender for reimbursement based 
on the lender’s apparent good faith and the previously discussed authority 
to waive regulatory requirements. B-127167, Dec. 17, 1968 (forged 
signature); B-127167, Dec. 5, 1957 (false representation as to age); 
B-130955, May 2, 1957 (alteration of amount); B-127167, Apr. 10, 1956 
(forged signature). Where HUD declines to exercise its waiver authority, it 
may treat the note as ineligible for insurance. United States v. deVallet, 
152 F. Supp. 313 (D. Mass. 1957). “The government had the right to make 
such limitations on its insurance undertaking as it saw fit.” Id. at 315. 

One court has held that the validity/regularity requirement applies “not at 
the point at which a bank submits its claim, but at the point at which the 
loan itself is being arranged.” Guardian Federal Savings and Loan 

33 The same facts in today’s computerized environment could well produce a different result. 

Page 11-53 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Association v. Harris, 441 F. Supp. 789, 791 (D.D.C. 1977). While this 
seems clear enough with respect to items such as the validity of the 
signature and the “regularity” of the note, subsequent events may affect the 
enforceability of a note, a situation implicitly recognized in the Harris 
case. In B-127483, Apr. 26, 1956, it was held that the enforceability 
requirement was not affected by a mistrial in a suit brought by the lender 
resulting in a dismissal without prejudice. In 37 Comp. Gen. 857 (1958), 
GAO held that a lender could be reimbursed where the note had become 
unenforceable due to the passage of time notwithstanding the lender’s 
diligent collection efforts. The result would at least arguably be different if 
a note became unenforceable through the fault or neglect of the lender. 

(5) Reporting requirement 
The four requirements discussed thus far relate to the eligibility of a loan 
for insurance from its inception. This one is different because the loan 
itself is eligible but the lender’s failure to comply may result in the loss of 
insurability. Program regulations require lenders to report loans to the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on a prescribed 
form within 31 days from the date of the note or the date the note was 
purchased. 24 C.F.R. § 201.30(a) (2005). HUD then accepts the loan for 
insurance or rejects it. The reporting requirement also applies to 
refinancing loans. Id. 

Under present regulations, HUD has discretion to accept a late report as 
long as the loan is not in default. Id. § 201.30(b). Once the loan has gone 
into default, that discretion no longer exists and it is too late to establish 
coverage. An illustrative case is B-194822, Sept. 24, 1980. A bank 
inadvertently failed to report a property improvement loan to HUD. More 
than a year later, after the loan was in default, the bank submitted its report 
along with its claim for indemnification. Concluding that the loan was 
never insured, HUD denied the claim, and GAO agreed. The fact that HUD 
had inadvertently billed the bank for the required premiums, which the 
bank paid, was not enough to establish coverage. Of course, refund of the 
premiums was appropriate. 

Prior to 1968, the regulations did not limit HUD’s discretion, and a late 
report could be accepted even after default. Cases addressing the exercise 
of discretion under this version of the regulations are B-165239, Oct. 4, 
1968, and B-153971, June 17, 1964. 

Page 11-54 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

(6) Payment of premiums 
The statute requires that HUD charge the financial institution a premium 
for the insurance. 12 U.S.C. § 1703(f). The premium is a prerequisite to 
insurability. Id. § 1703(b)(5). This is closely related to the reporting 
requirement discussed above in that it is the report that triggers HUD’s 
billing of the bank. The sequence is: (1) bank reports loan to HUD on 
manifest form; (2) HUD includes the loan on its monthly statement to the 
bank; (3) upon receipt of monthly statement, bank pays premium to HUD; 

(4)when HUD receives the premium, loan achieves insured status. 
Subsection 1703(f) further requires that the premium charge “shall be 
payable in advance by the financial institution.” Thus, advance payment of 
the premium is necessary for the loan to be eligible for insurance, at least 
where nonpayment is solely the fault of the bank. B-172965, July 16, 1971 
(loan not covered where bank failed to report the loan and was thus never 
billed by HUD). See also B-194822, Sept. 24, 1980 (no authority to accept 
premiums after default). For loans with a maturity in excess of 25 months, 
the insurance charge is payable in annual installments. 24 C.F.R. 
§ 201.31(b)(2) (2005). 

In 55 Comp. Gen. 891 (1976), the bank claimed that it had reported the loan 
to HUD. HUD, however, had no record of the report and consequently had 
neither requested nor received any premium payments from the bank prior 
to default. Apart from the fact that the advance payment requirement 
appears in a federal statute, the bank had actual notice that a loan is not 
insured until it appears on the monthly statement and the premium is paid. 
Adequate review of the monthly statements would have revealed that the 
particular loan was not listed and that therefore either HUD never received 
the report or failed to acknowledge it. Since it is the bank’s responsibility 
to assure payment of premiums in advance, its claim was denied. The 
decision once again reiterated that HUD’s waiver authority does not apply 
to statutory requirements. 

A related case, 55 Comp. Gen. 658 (1976), reaffirmed the proposition that 
timely payment of the insurance premiums is a prerequisite to continued 
insurance coverage. The decision also held that claims by a lending 
institution which is currently delinquent in its premium payments may be 
allowed if the borrower’s default occurred prior to the delinquency. 
However, if the lending institution was delinquent before the default 
occurred or became imminent, its claim may not be allowed.

Loans 

c. Small Business 
Administration Business 
Loan Program 
The decision in 55 Comp. Gen. 658 was expanded (and modified with 
respect to matters not relevant here) in 56 Comp. Gen. 279 (1977), holding 
that timely payment of insurance premiums under 12 U.S.C. § 1703 is a 
continuing obligation of the lender and cannot be voluntarily terminated by 
the lender before the end of the term of the underlying loan. Unpaid 
insurance premiums constitute a debt presently due and payable by the 
lender to the United States. Therefore, HUD may offset delinquent 
premiums against insurance claims otherwise payable to the lender. 
However, estimated future premiums may not be offset against currently 
payable claims because they are not certain in amount. (Under the 
program regulations, the premium may be abated after an insurance claim 
has been filed or if the loan is paid in full prior to maturity. 24 C.F.R. 
§ 201.31(e).) 

(1) Payment of guarantee fee 
Like the National Housing Act insurance programs, a loan guarantee under 
section 7(a) of the Small Business Act is not free to the lender. The Small 
Business Administration is required to charge a guarantee fee, based on a 
percentage of the amount guaranteed, on most loans guaranteed under 
15 U.S.C. § 636(a). Id. § 636(a)(18). The fee is payable by the participating 
lending institution, but may be passed through to the borrower. Id. 
SBA’s implementing regulations are found at 13 C.F.R. part 120 (2005). 

For many years prior to the enactment of 15 U.S.C. § 636(a)(18) in 1986,34 
SBA charged a guarantee fee under the authority of its program regulations 
and guarantee agreement. Thus, pre-1986 GAO decisions dealing with 
section 7(a) fees must be regarded as modified to the extent they were 
addressing a nonstatutory requirement. They, however, along with 
elements of the program regulations which pre-date the 1986 legislation, 
establish the proposition that an agency may charge a guarantee fee 
without specific statutory authority as long as it is not prohibited and 
outline the general parameters of a nonstatutory fee requirement. 

As with the Housing Act fees, a fundamental issue is the effect of 
nonpayment or late payment. Unlike the Housing Act, the SBA provision 
does not require that the fees be paid in advance. Thus, by itself, 15 U.S.C. 
§ 636(a)(18) neither makes payment of the fee an essential condition of 
guarantee eligibility, nor does it prohibit such treatment. Under SBA’s 

34 Pub. L. No. 99-272, § 18007, 100 Stat. 82, 366 (Apr. 7, 1986). 

Page 11-56 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

regulations, the fee is payable when the lender applies for a guarantee for 
loans with maturities of 12 months or less, and within 90 days after SBA’s 
approval for loans with maturities greater than 12 months. 13 C.F.R. 
§ 120.220(b). Absent statutory direction one way or the other, the effect of 
missing these deadlines is a matter within SBA’s discretion to establish by 
regulation or terms of the guarantee agreement. 

At one time, SBA’s guarantee agreement expressly provided that a loan is 
not guaranteed until the fee has been paid. Under this provision, payment 
of the fee was a condition precedent to coverage. SBA had the discretion 
to accept late payment provided the loan was not in default, but the loan 
was not protected by the guarantee until the fee was paid. B-181432, 
Nov. 12, 1975; B-181432, Mar. 13, 1975. In cases where the fee remained 
unpaid at the time the borrower defaulted, claims by lenders were 
consistently denied in the face of arguments such as estoppel (B-181432, 
May 21, 1979, and B-181432, Oct. 20, 1978), “constructive payment” 
(B-181432, July 7, 1978), or inexperience on the part of bank personnel 
(B-181432, Aug. 15, 1977). Since the requirement was explicitly stated in 
the guarantee agreement, virtually all of these cases reiterated the 
proposition that no government official may give away the government’s 
contractual rights without either statutory authority or adequate legal 
consideration. The courts reached the same result. See Union National 
Bank of Chicago v. Weaver, 604 F.2d 543 (7th Cir. 1979); Union State 
Bank v. Weaver, 526 F. Supp. 29 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). 

SBA’s current regulations provide that the agency may terminate the 
guarantee if the fee is not paid. 13 C.F.R. § 120.220 (introductory language 
and subsection (e)). Implicit in this language is the premise that the 
guarantee will be regarded as in effect until SBA terminates it. 

A 1983 decision considered similar issues under a different SBA program, 
the Surety Bond Guarantee Program established by 15 U.S.C. §§ 694a–694c. 
Since nothing in the legislation or implementing regulations made payment 
of the guarantee fee a condition precedent to the existence of the 
guarantee, and since the surety bond guarantee agreement contained no 
provision comparable to the provision then being used in the business loan 
guarantee agreement, the decision concluded that nonpayment of the fee 
prior to default would not void SBA’s obligation to honor the guarantee, 
although SBA should deduct the unpaid fee from the surety’s claim. 

B-206893, Mar. 18, 1983.

Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

A 1979 case considered the effect of another provision in the guarantee 
agreement. A bank, conceding that it had not paid the guarantee fee prior 
to default on the loan as originally written, argued that it had effectively 
modified the agreement by granting the borrower additional time to begin 
repayment. However, the guarantee agreement explicitly required SBA’s 
prior written approval of any change in the terms of the loan, which the 
bank had neither requested nor received. The modification was therefore 
not legally effective as against SBA. B-193134, July 27, 1979. 

The issue in 58 Comp. Gen. 693 (1979) was the effect of a refinancing loan. 
In view of SBA’s discretion to accept refinancing, GAO concluded that the 
effect of a bank’s failure to timely pay the fee on the original loan was 
terminated when the original loan was repaid by the refinancing loan. 
Thus, the fact that the guarantee on the original loan may have been 
extinguished will not necessarily defeat an otherwise valid guarantee on a 
subsequent refinancing loan. 

Cases involving late payment or nonpayment of the guarantee fee may be 
useful in analyzing the treatment and consequences of other terms and 
conditions of the guarantee agreement, but should not be blindly applied. 
For example, the court in Eastern Illinois Trust & Savings Bank v. 
Sanders, 826 F.2d 615 (7th Cir. 1987), drew a distinction between provisions 
expressly declared to be conditions precedent to SBA’s obligation, such as 
the fee provision, and those which are not so declared. If a lender violates 
a provision in the latter category, the issue becomes “whether the violation 
was a material breach of the agreement, or rather whether [the lender] 
substantially complied with the agreement.” Id. at 616. The lender’s 
violation in the cited case, making “side loans” to a borrower, was found 
not to constitute a material breach and therefore did not justify repudiation 
of SBA’s guarantee. By way of contrast, a lender who violates a provision in 
the “condition precedent” category cannot enforce the guarantee, and you 
never get to the material breach versus substantial compliance analysis. 
See, e.g., First National Bank of Louisa, Kentucky v. United States, 6 Cl. 
Ct. 241 (1984). 

(2) Notice of default 
Another type of provision an agency may include in its program regulations 
is a requirement that the lender notify the agency in writing within a 
specified time period after a default occurs. The Small Business 
Administration’s (SBA) regulations included such a requirement for many 
years. See, e.g., 13 C.F.R. § 122.10(a) (1980). The provision was dropped in 

Page 11-58 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

a 1985 revision of the regulations. Under current regulations, SBA’s 
obligation under a guarantee is extinguished if the lender fails to demand 
purchase of the unpaid guaranteed portion within 120 days after maturity 
of the note. 13 C.F.R. § 120.524(a)(8) (2005). 

Pre-1985 decisions on the notice requirement are no longer applicable to 
SBA under the current regulations. Nevertheless, we briefly note a few of 
them because they illustrate the scope of an agency’s authority to 
implement a guarantee program by regulation and may have relevance by 
analogy to similar requirements in other programs. Since the requirement 
itself is a creature of agency regulations, the agency has discretion to 
determine the consequences of noncompliance, ranging from an interest 
penalty (B-181432, Sept. 4, 1979) to termination of the guarantee 
commitment (B-201388, Sept. 23, 1981). The agency may also make the 
consequences contingent upon the extent to which noncompliance 
prejudices the interests of the government. See B-187945, Mar. 22, 1977. 
While the basic requirement may not be waived except to the extent 
permissible under the regulations (see B-181432, Feb. 19, 1976), the 
particular form of notice, a matter of procedure, is subject to waiver. 
B-188741, Jan. 25, 1978 (oral notice accepted and acknowledged by agency 
held to be substantial compliance). See also B-181432-O.M., Feb. 19, 1976 
(agency may waive requirement in guarantee agreement that lender 
provide it with a copy of the executed note and settlement sheet).35 

D. Rights and 
Obligations of 
Government upon 
Default 
1. Nature of the 
Government’s 
Obligation 
When a government agency guarantees a loan, it is promising to indemnify 
someone in case of default. The “someone” includes both the lending 
institution that originated the loan and subsequent purchasers of the 
guaranteed portion of the loan. The default results from the borrower’s 
failure to make payment when due or other breach of a material covenant 

35 For a detailed discussion of waiver of agency regulations in the context of Commodity 
Credit Corporation export assistance guarantees, see B-208610, Sept. 1, 1983.

Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

of the loan. In the simple situation, a borrower borrows money from a 
lender. The government guarantees the loan, with the commitments of the 
lender and the government usually reduced to writing in the form of a 
guarantee agreement. If the borrower defaults on his or her payments, the 
lender looks to the government to pay on the guarantee. 

In some instances, Congress has explicitly provided in the program 
legislation that the guarantee will be backed by the “full faith and credit” of 
the United States. Examples are 12 U.S.C. § 635k (guarantees and 
insurance issued by the Export-Import Bank), 15 U.S.C. § 683(b) 
(guarantees of debentures or securities issued by small business 
investment companies), and 20 U.S.C. § 1075(b)(4) (federally insured 
student loans).36 Language of this type has been held to be “the highest 
assurance the Government can give, its plighted faith.” Perry v. United 
States, 294 U.S. 330, 351 (1935). 

There is a long line of opinions of the Attorney General addressing the 
effect of statutory language pledging the “faith” or “credit” of the United 
States, or the absence of such language. While the opinions are not limited 
to loan guarantee commitments, almost all of the cases arose under loan 
guarantee programs. This is understandable because (1) lenders are being 
asked to extend credit to a somewhat riskier universe of borrowers which 
they most likely would not accommodate without the guarantee; and (2) at 
least prior to the Federal Credit Reform Act, the government’s commitment 
was not backed by enacted budget authority. To encourage lender 
participation in a variety of programs, the Attorney General was asked, in 
effect, “Does the government really mean it?” 

Perhaps the leading case is 41 Op. Att’y Gen. 363 (1958), dealing with ship 
mortgage and loan insurance under provisions of the Merchant Marine Act 
of 1936, subsequently amended and now codified at 46 U.S.C. App. §§ 1271– 
1275. The opinion makes several important points. First, what does the 
language mean? It means that the government’s obligation is to be 
considered on the same footing as the interest-bearing obligations of the 
United States such as Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. 41 Op. Att’y Gen. 
at 366 (citing 41 Op. Att’y Gen. 138 (1953)). 

36 This and similar language has, and is intended to have, connotations of constitutional 
significance, although the words “full faith and credit” appear in the U.S. Constitution only 
once, in the requirement that each state recognize the laws, records, and judicial 
proceedings of other states (art. IV, § 1). In addition, the U.S. Constitution empowers the 
Congress to borrow money “on the credit of the United States” (art. I, § 8, cl. 2). 

Page 11-60 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Second and more important, what is the language’s practical significance? 
None, answered the Attorney General. Although recognizing that Congress 
can establish such distinctions, the Attorney General stated that, in the 
absence of such congressional action, there is no “order of solemnity of 
valid general obligations of the United States,” nor does an obligation with 
the statutory faith and/or credit language have any legal priority over a 
valid general obligation of the United States without the language. 
41 Op. Att’y Gen. at 369. 

Finally, the Attorney General addressed the lack of advance budget 
authority: 

“If . . . the existence of an appropriation is not a 
condition of or limitation on the authority of an 
officer to contract on behalf of the United States, 
the need for appropriations to meet an obligation 
incurred under the contract does not affect the 
existence or validity of the obligation.” 


Id. at 370. The opinion noted that Congress expressly authorized the 
incurrence of obligations under the program in advance of appropriations. 
Id. The following year, the Attorney General made the same points with 
respect to Interstate Commerce Commission loan guarantees to rail 
carriers. 41 Op. Att’y Gen. 403 (1959). After emphasizing that the validity 
of the guarantee “is not affected by the absence from the act of any 
language expressly pledging the faith or credit of the United States,” the 
opinion states that “It is enough to create an obligation of the United States 
if an agency or officer is validly authorized to incur such an obligation on 
its behalf and validly exercises that power.” Id. at 405.37 

Thus, reading all of the opinions together, we may state that a loan 
guarantee is a valid obligation of the United States the same as any other 
valid obligation, regardless of the presence or absence of full faith and 
credit language and regardless of the presence or absence of advance 
budget authority, provided (1) the program statute is constitutional; 

37 Other opinions in this family are 42 Op. Att’y Gen. 327 (1966); 42 Op. Att’y Gen. 323 (1966); 
42 Op. Att’y Gen. 21 (1961); 41 Op. Att’y Gen. 424 (1959); and 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 262 
(1982). Since the opinions all said basically the same thing and seemed to arise under every 
program in sight, the Attorney General stopped issuing formal opinions on routine full faith 
and credit questions in this context in 1973. 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 262, at n.2.

Loans 

(2)Congress has not disclaimed liability at the time or before the 
commitment is made; (3) the guarantee is made by a federal agency or 
official with the legal authority to do so; and (4) the guarantee complies 
with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. 
In an opinion concerning guarantees issued by the former Federal Savings 
and Loan Insurance Corporation incident to its resolution of failed or 
failing savings and loan institutions, the Comptroller General expressly 
adopted the criteria and analysis of the Attorney General opinions. 

68 Comp. Gen. 14 (1988). 

2. Scope of the 
Government’s 
Guarantee 
As noted earlier, a loan guarantee statute will typically specify the 
permissible purpose(s) of the loans to be guaranteed, establish eligibility 
requirements, and give the administering agency considerable discretion to 
determine the terms and conditions of the guarantee. Subject to the terms 
of the program legislation, there is also an element of discretion in 
determining the permissible scope of a guarantee, that is, the types and 
degree of risk to which the agency may expose itself. This section presents 
a few issues GAO has considered regarding the limits of that discretion. 

As with any other payment situation, the government is not expected to 
close its eyes to indications of fraud or misrepresentation. For example, an 
agency should not make payment to a lender where it has knowledge of the 
possibility of fraud, negligence, or misrepresentation on the part of the 
lender. Making payment in the face of such knowledge exposes the 
certifying officer to potential liability. 51 Comp. Gen. 474 (1972); B-174861, 
Feb. 23, 1972. In these two cases, however, GAO advised that the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) could, upon default of the borrower, 
purchase the guaranteed portion of the loan from an innocent holder who 
had purchased it in the secondary market and who had no knowledge of 
the possible misconduct by the originating lender. Payment to the innocent 
holder in these circumstances would not waive any of SBA’s rights against 
the original lender, and, as a practical matter, would avoid a result adverse 
to the holder that could seriously jeopardize the secondary market. Thus, 
paying the innocent holder is an acceptable level of risk whereas paying the 
suspected wrongdoer is not. 

It follows that there is no objection to honoring the claim of an innocent 
lender who is the victim of fraud by the borrower. B-167329, Oct. 6, 1969. 

Page 11-62 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

Similarly, GAO held in 17 Comp. Gen. 604 (1938) that the Federal Housing 
Administration was not liable to reimburse a lender bank for a loss 
sustained as a result of a payment made, on the basis of a forged 
authorization, to an individual other than a bona fide borrower. This 
situation was distinguished from a case where a lender bank, in the 
exercise of due care, suffered a loss as a result of a forged note. 
A-94717-O.M., Aug. 12, 1938. The bank in 17 Comp. Gen. 604 already 
possessed a validly signed note but suffered the loss by accepting a forged 
authorization for payment. Comparison of the authorization with the note 
would have disclosed the forgery. 

A 1974 decision expanded somewhat on 51 Comp. Gen. 474. GAO 
determined in B-140673, Dec. 3, 1974, that the SBA has sufficiently broad 
statutory authority to repurchase the guaranteed portion of a loan from an 
innocent secondary-market holder where the borrower is not in default but 
the primary lender negligently or unlawfully withholds payments. (Under 
the arrangement in question, the primary lender was to continue servicing 
the loan and remit payments, minus a servicing fee, to the holder.) This 
decision clearly enlarged the scope of SBA’s guarantee since the “triggering 
event” could be something other than a default by the borrower in repaying 
the loan. However, the holding in that case was for the relatively limited 
purpose of allowing SBA to avoid the security registration requirements of 
the Securities Act of 1933, subsequently amended and now codified at 
15 U.S.C. §§ 77a–77aa. The Securities and Exchange Commission had 
determined that these requirements would apply to SBA-guaranteed loans 
that were resold in the secondary market, unless SBA’s guarantee was 
absolute and fully protected the purchaser of the guaranteed portion in all 
circumstances, including instances where the lender did not forward all 
payments received from the borrower. 

A few years later, B-181432, Aug. 11, 1978, explored what are perhaps the 
outer limits of the “risk discretion” recognized in B-140673. SBA proposed 
to contract with a private entity to serve as the centralized fiscal agent in 
the secondary market for SBA guaranteed loans. The fiscal agent would 
have responsibility for receiving payments from borrowers, remitting these 
payments to the holders, and certifying the amount of the outstanding 
balance each time a guaranteed loan was transferred. SBA further 
proposed to unconditionally guarantee all such actions and representations 
of the fiscal agent to the holder of the guaranteed portion of a loan. GAO 
agreed that SBA could contract with a fiscal agent and, consistent with 
B-140673, guarantee a holder against the agent’s failure to properly forward 
the borrower’s loan payments. However, to unconditionally guarantee 

Page 11-63 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

holders against certification errors by the fiscal agent would significantly 
enlarge SBA’s existing guarantee responsibility, would subject SBA to 
substantially new risks, and would therefore require additional legislative 
authority. The increased risk would include new types of events that could 
trigger SBA’s obligation to purchase a guaranteed loan, as well as the 
maximum amount of SBA’s liability (should the fiscal agent erroneously 
certify the outstanding balance of a loan to be larger than it actually was). 

3. Amount of 
Government’s Liability 
A program statute may or may not provide guidance on determining the 
amount the government is obligated to pay under a guarantee or the 
manner in which a loss is to be computed. If it does not, the agency’s 
discretion again comes into play. As long as they are consistent with 
whatever statutory guidance does exist, the agency’s regulations will 
generally be controlling. 

For example, the computation of claims under Title I of the National 
Housing Act is prescribed by regulation. See 24 C.F.R. § 201.55 (2005). In 
very simplified form, the claim is a specified percentage of the sum of 
several elements: the unpaid amount of the loan (subject to certain 
reductions), plus accrued interest, plus uncollected court costs, plus 
attorney’s fees actually paid, plus certain recording expenses. Claims by 
lenders using unauthorized computations have been disallowed. 
E.g., B-133924, Dec. 4, 1957. 

In another case involving the National Housing Act loan program, a lender 
claimed an amount representing partial reimbursement of attorney’s fees 
incurred in collecting on a defaulted note. Although the borrower’s 
obligation on the note was discharged and the note did not contain a 
stipulation for attorney’s fees in the event of default (which would have 
been ineffective under state law), payment of the claim was proper since it 
was specifically provided for in the regulations. B-163029, Feb. 16, 1968. 

Validly issued program regulations are controlling even though applying 
them in a particular case may produce an anomalous result to the lender’s 
advantage, at least where the lender has fully complied. For example, 
regulations governing defaulted mobile home loans provide that 
reimbursement is computed by deducting from the unpaid amount of the 
loan either the actual sales price upon repossession or the appraised value 
of the mobile home, whichever is greater. GAO has found this formula to 
be within the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) 
statutory authority. 71 Comp. Gen. 449 (1992). At one time, the regulations 

Page 11-64 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

also prohibited the filing of a claim until after default, repossession, and 
sale of the mobile home. These regulations occasionally produced a 
situation in which a particular model could not be found in current rating 
publications (such as the so-called “blue book”) and the mobile home was 
no longer available for appraisal by HUD because, in compliance with the 
regulations, it had already been sold. Since the impossibility of appraisal 
was due to the regulations and was through no fault of the lender, the 
Comptroller General held that the actual sales price could be used in 
computing the reimbursement, as long as it was administratively 
determined to be reasonable. 55 Comp. Gen. 151 (1975); B-184016, Sept. 16, 
1975. The solution, of course, was to amend the regulations. 

Several early decisions involved the language in 12 U.S.C. § 1703(a) which 
authorizes HUD to insure lending institutions against “losses which they 
may sustain” in making home improvement loans or other advances of 
credit. If the loan does not either provide for the automatic acceleration of 
maturity upon default or give the lender the option to accelerate which the 
lender in fact exercises, the government cannot pay the lender the full 
unpaid balance of an unmatured loan because payments not yet due do not 
represent a loss actually sustained by the lending institution. A-74701, 
May 22, 1936. While this result was consistent with the statutory language, 
it was not practical from an administrative standpoint. It meant that HUD 
was limited to paying the lender the monthly installments as they became 
due. Two later decisions effectively modified A-74701 and established that, 
if there is no acceleration provision (an event which would be unlikely 
today), or if exercising an acceleration option would be undesirable 
because of state law, HUD can nevertheless reimburse a lending institution 
for the entire unpaid balance of the loan if it is clear that the entire unpaid 
balance will be a claim of the lending institution against the government 
and if the lender assigns the note or other evidence of indebtedness to the 
government. 16 Comp. Gen. 723 (1937); 16 Comp. Gen. 336 (1936). 

4. Liability of the 
Borrower 
When the government guarantees a loan and the borrower defaults, the 
lender is not required to make special efforts toward collection. Rather, the 
lender may fall back on the government’s guarantee and leave the entire 
responsibility for collection to the government. See, e.g., 16 Comp. 
Gen. 336 (1936); B-134628, Jan. 15, 1958. Naturally, it is invariably to the 
lender’s advantage to do just that. Payment by the government, however, 
does not mean that the borrower is off the hook. Unless the program 
legislation provides otherwise, the government becomes subrogated to the 
rights of the lender, and the borrower is indebted to the government for the

Loans 

a. Veterans’ Home Loan 
Guarantee Program 
amount it has paid out. The government is not required to collect more 
than the amount it has actually paid out to the lender, plus interest and 
collection costs to the extent authorized. See 15 Comp. Gen. 256 (1935). A 
variety of issues relating to borrower liability can be illustrated by an 
examination of the Veterans’ Home Loan Guarantee Program. 

Title III of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended and 
codified at 38 U.S.C. §§ 3701–3751, authorizes the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) to guarantee loans to enable veterans to purchase or construct 
homes and for other specified purposes. This is the well-known “G.I. loan.” 
The guarantee is an entitlement in the sense that a loan meeting the 
statutory requirements and made for one of the statutory purposes is 
“automatically guaranteed.” Id. § 3710(a). For certain loans closed after 
December 31, 1989, the liability of the veteran-borrower to the government 
was considerably restricted by the Veterans Home Loan Indemnity and 
Restructuring Act of 1989.38 A description of the “old” rules is nevertheless 
useful to understand what has and has not been changed, and because 
loans under the old and new programs will exist side-by-side for many 
years into the future.39 

(1) Loans closed prior to 1990 
Upon proper payment of a guarantee, the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) acquires both the right of subrogation and an independent right of 
indemnity against the defaulting veteran. United States v. Shimer, 367 U.S. 
374 (1961); Vail v. Derwinski, 946 F.2d 589 (8th Cir. 1991); McKnight v. 
United States, 259 F.2d 540 (9th Cir. 1958). As the Supreme Court noted in 
Shimer, a contrary result would convert the guarantee into a grant. 
367 U.S. at 387. The right of indemnity is reinforced by the guarantee 
agreement and by a regulation in effect since the early days of the program 
which provides that any amount paid out by the VA under a guarantee by 
reason of default “shall constitute a debt owing to the United States by such 
veteran.” 38 C.F.R. § 36.4323(e) (2005). 

38 Pub. L. No. 101-237, title III, 103 Stat. 2062, 2069 (Dec. 18, 1989).

Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

In the simple situation, the veteran defaults, the bank forecloses, the VA 
pays the bank under the guarantee and then proceeds to attempt recovery 
from the defaulting veteran. E.g., McKnight, 259 F.2d 540. 

Sale of the property by the veteran does not automatically exonerate the 
veteran from liability. Where a veteran who bought a home under a 
VA-guaranteed loan sells the property to a purchaser who assumes the 
mortgage and subsequently defaults, the veteran may still be liable to the 
government for the amount VA is required to pay under the guarantee. 

B-155317, Oct. 21, 1964; B-131120, July 26, 1957; B-131210, Apr. 9, 1957. 

This result applies unless the transaction amounts to a novation, that is, 
unless the mortgagee releases the original mortgagor and extinguishes the 
old debt. B-108528, Dec. 3, 1952. Breach by the lender of an agreement to 
notify the veteran (original borrower) if the subsequent purchaser defaults 
does not affect the veteran’s liability to the United States. B-154496, July 9, 
1964. 

The potential harshness of the result in many of these cases is largely 
mitigated through statutory release and waiver provisions. When a veteran 
disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed loan, the veteran 
may be released at the time of the sale from all further liability to the VA 
resulting from the loan, including default by the transferee or subsequent 
purchaser, if (1) the loan is current, (2) the purchaser is obligated by 
contract to assume the full liability and responsibility of the veteran under 
the loan, and (3) the purchaser qualifies from a credit standpoint, that is, if 
the purchaser would qualify for a guarantee if he or she were an eligible 
veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 3714(a)(1). Issuance of the release is mandatory if the 
statutory conditions are met. Upon receipt of written notification by the 
veteran and a determination that the conditions in 38 U.S.C. § 3714(a) are 
met, the release is issued by the holder of the loan. In some cases, the VA is 
considered the loan holder. Id. § 3714(a)(2). The veteran has a right to 
appeal an adverse determination to the VA. Id. § 3714(a)(4). Even if the 
specified conditions are not met, the assumption may be approved in 
certain circumstances. Id. § 3714(a)(4)(B)(ii). Sale of the property without 
notifying the holder may result in acceleration of the loan. Id. § 3714(b). 

In addition, the VA is required to waive a veteran’s indebtedness arising 
from a loan upon determining that collection would be against equity and 
good conscience, and that there is no indication of fraud, 
misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of any interested person. 
38 U.S.C. § 5302(b). Waiver must be requested within 1 year from receipt of 
the notification of indebtedness. Id. This is a “mandatory” waiver statute, 

Page 11-67 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

imposing upon the VA a duty to actually exercise its discretion once waiver 
has been requested. See Beauchesne v. Nimmo, 562 F. Supp. 250 (D. Conn. 
1983) (discussing mandatory nature of 38 U.S.C. § 5302 dealing with waiver 
of benefit overpayments). 

As with many waiver statutes, 38 U.S.C. § 5302 eliminates the potential 
liability of certifying and disbursing officers with respect to any amounts 
waived. Id. § 5302(d). “Certifying officer” in this context means the 
authorized certifying officer of the VA who certified the payment in 
question, and has no reference to any official of any private institution 
involved in the transaction. Colorado v. Veterans Administration, 430 F. 
Supp. 551, 561 (D. Colo. 1977), aff’d, 602 F.2d 926 (10th Cir. 1979), cert. 
denied, 444 U.S. 1014 (1980). 

Adverse waiver determinations may be appealed to the Board of Veterans 
Appeals established by 38 U.S.C. § 7101. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.101(18)–(19) 
(2005); see also 38 C.F.R. § 1.958. Waiver determinations and the Board’s 
review of them are subject to further judicial review by the United States 
Court of Veterans Appeals under an “arbitrary and capricious” standard. 
E.g., Kaplan v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 116, 119 (1996) and cases cited. If 
waiver is granted, amounts previously paid may be refunded. 38 C.F.R. 
§ 1.967. GAO reviewed these regulations when they were first issued and 
agreed that they were within the VA’s authority. B-158337, Mar. 11, 1966. 

Absent either release or waiver, the VA may pursue recovery against the 
veteran. See, e.g., Davis v. National Homes Acceptance Corp., 523 F. Supp. 
477 (N.D. Ala. 1981); B-188814, Mar. 8, 1978; B-172672, June 22, 1971. In 
B-188814, for example, the veteran had failed to obtain a release, would not 
have been eligible for it anyway, and VA refused to waive the indebtedness. 
Therefore, the veteran was held liable even though the purchaser who 
subsequently defaulted had assured him that he would no longer be liable 
to VA. 

Most of the cases cited thus far concern the liability of the original 
borrower where a subsequent purchaser defaults. The purchaser of 
property for which VA has guaranteed a loan, whether or not the purchaser 
is a veteran, may also become liable to VA for amounts VA is required to 
pay out upon default. For example, in B-141888, July 21, 1960, a veteran 
purchased a home, obtained a VA guarantee, and later sold the home to a 
nonveteran who assumed the mortgage. The nonveteran purchaser 
defaulted. The lender foreclosed and obtained a deficiency judgment 
against both the veteran and the nonveteran, which VA paid. VA waived the 

Page 11-68 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

veteran’s indebtedness, but was still entitled to collect from the defaulting 
purchaser. See also B-155932, Feb. 23, 1971; B-155932, Oct. 13, 1970 (same 
case). 

Issues have arisen under the loan program concerning the availability of 
state law as a defense to a VA claim. For example, it is not uncommon for 
states to prohibit, or impose various restrictions on, lenders’ obtaining 
deficiency judgments against defaulting purchasers after a foreclosure sale. 
Since VA’s rights under subrogation are limited to the rights of lenders, 
these statutes would limit VA’s right to obtain deficiency judgments under a 
subrogation theory. However, VA’s regulations have been held to “create a 
uniform system” for administering the guarantee program, a system which 
displaces state law. Shimer, 367 U.S. at 377. These regulations, as noted 
earlier, include a provision giving the VA an independent right of indemnity. 
Thus, to avoid the possibility of being hampered by state law, VA has 
generally proceeded under its independent right of indemnity rather than 
under a subrogation theory. E.g., B-126500, Feb. 3, 1956; B-124724, 
Dec. 21, 1955. 

Consistent with Shimer, the courts generally hold that the VA’s right of 
indemnity prevails over state laws which flatly prohibit VA from obtaining 
deficiency judgments through subrogation. Jones v. Turnage, 699 F. Supp. 
795 (N.D. Cal. 1988), aff’d mem., 914 F.2d 1496 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 
499 U.S. 920 (1991); United States v. Rossi, 342 F.2d 505 (9th Cir. 1965); 

B-174343, Nov. 17, 1971; B-143844, Nov. 15, 1960; B-124724, Oct. 3, 1955. 

Other cases applied the same approach to dismiss other aspects of state 
deficiency laws. E.g., B-173007, June 29, 1971; B-162193, Sept. 1, 1967; 
B-122929, June 24, 1955. 

At one time, some courts viewed VA’s right of indemnity as secondary to its 
subrogation rights, and, therefore, held that VA could not invoke 
indemnification as a means of avoiding state law restrictions that would 
limit its recovery rights under a theory of subrogation. See, e.g., 
Whitehead v. Derwinski, 904 F.2d 1362 (9th Cir. 1990). However, this view 
has been abandoned. In its en banc decision in Carter v. Derwinski, 
987 F.2d 611 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied sub nom., 510 U.S. 821 (1993), the 
Ninth Circuit explicitly overruled Whitehead. The court held in Carter that 
the two remedies were equally available to VA: 

“. . . The regulation at issue plainly says the VA has 
a right of both subrogation and indemnity. There is no 
occasion for us to resolve any conflict between the 

Page 11-69 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

exercise of these two rights, because both can be fully 
enforced. Indeed, not only are the rights of subrogation 
and indemnity not in conflict, they are complementary 
and mutually reinforcing. Demoting the right of indemnity 
to second-class status amounts to a judicial rewriting of the 
regulation.” 

987 F.2d at 615. See also United States v. Davis, 961 F.2d 603 (7th Cir. 1992); 
Vail v. Derwinski, 946 F.2d 589 (8th Cir. 1991); Boley v. Principi, 144 F.R.D. 
305 (E.D.N.C. 1992), aff’d, 10 F.3d 218 (4th Cir. 1993); In re Silveous, 
174 B.R. 479 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1994). 

The defense of minority has also been raised on occasion. State law 
generally provides that a contract entered into by a minor is voidable at the 
minor’s option. Several states have statutes which expressly make the 
defense of infancy inapplicable to contracts under the Servicemen’s 
Readjustment Act, and the few cases GAO has considered have involved 
statutes of this type. See B-126500, Feb. 3, 1956; B-124750, Oct. 3, 1955; 
B-105429, Dec. 11, 1951. In addition, the United States has sovereign 
immunity from defenses arising under state statutes of limitations unless 
expressly waived. E.g., United States v. Summerlin, 310 U.S. 414 (1940) 
(claim under National Housing Act); Bresson v. Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue, 213 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir. 2000) (federal tax assessment); B-134523, 
Mar. 19, 1958 (Summerlin applied to VA claim). See also, United States v. 
California, 507 U.S. 746, 757–58 (1993) (reaffirming the rule in Summerlin 
where the government is proceeding in its sovereign capacity, but 
distinguishing Summerlin on the facts of that case). 

Another provision of the program legislation makes the “financial 
transactions” of the VA “incident to, or arising out of” the guarantee 
program “final and conclusive upon all officers of the Government.” 
38 U.S.C. § 3720(c). Thus, GAO will not review the amount of indebtedness 
determined by the VA. B-105551, Sept. 25, 1951. Similarly, apart from 
advising persons that the options exist, GAO will not review the VA’s 
exercise of its waiver and release authorities. B-108528, Oct. 6, 1952; 
B-216270, Sept. 25, 1984 (nondecision letter). 

(2) Loans closed after December 31, 1989 
Under 38 U.S.C. § 3729, the Department of Veterans Affairs will charge the 
veteran a loan fee based on a percentage of the loan amount. The fee may 
be included in the loan and paid from its proceeds. Payment of the loan fee 

Page 11-70 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


b. Debt Collection Procedures 
Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

is a prerequisite to the guarantee. Disabled veterans receiving 
compensation or their surviving spouses are exempt. Subsequent 
transferees assuming a loan are also charged a loan fee. 

A veteran who pays the loan fee or is exempt from paying it— 

“shall have no liability to the Secretary with respect 
to the loan for any loss resulting from any default of 
such individual except in the case of fraud, 
misrepresentation, or bad faith by such individual in 
obtaining the loan or in connection with the loan default.” 

Id. § 3703(e)(1). This provision was added by section 304(a) of the 
Veterans Home Loan Indemnity and Restructuring Act of 1989.40 An 
explanatory statement on the final House-Senate compromise (there was 
no conference report) emphasizes that “bad faith” is intended to include 
abandonment of a mortgage by one with the financial ability to make the 
payments. 135 Cong. Rec. 30292 (1989). The limited liability of 38 U.S.C. 
§ 3703(e)(1) does not apply to persons assuming a loan or to veterans who 
receive mobile home loans. Id. § 3703(e)(2). Apart from the limited 
liability of 38 U.S.C. § 3703(e), the VA’s right of subrogation is preserved. 
Id. § 3732(a)(1). 

Debt collection is governed by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966,41 
the Debt Collection Act of 1982,42 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act 
of 1996,43 as well as the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 C.F.R. 
parts 900–904 (2005). Authorities available to federal agencies in varying 
degrees include assessment of interest and penalties, offset, collection in 
installments, compromise, use of commercial collection agencies, and, if 
none of this works, referral to the Department of Justice for suit. Federal 
debt collection practices are explored in detail in Chapter 13 of volume III 
of the second edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations Law and, as 
a general proposition, are the same for a debt arising from a loan guarantee 
as for any other debt. The Office of Management and Budget set out 

40 Pub. L. No. 101-237, title III, 103 Stat. 2069, 2073 (Dec. 18, 1989).

general requirements for agencies to follow in managing receivables and 
collecting debts arising from federal credit activities, including guaranteed 
and insured loans in OMB Circular No. A-129, Policies for Federal Credit 
Programs and Non-Tax Receivables, Appendix A, §§ IV and V (November 
2000). Among other things, these requirements deal with asset sales. In 
this regard, two recent GAO reports address the asset sales program at the 
Small Business Administration: Small Business Administration: 
Accounting Anomalies and Limited Operational Data Make Results of 
Loan Sales Uncertain, GAO-03-87 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 3, 2003), and a 
follow-up report, SBA Disaster Loan Program: Accounting Anomalies 
Resolved but Additional Steps Would Improve Long-Term Reliability of 
Cost Estimates, GAO-05-409 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 14, 2005). 

The governmentwide authorities described above do not apply to the 
extent an agency has its own debt collection authority, either agencyspecific 
or program-specific. This may be in the form of positive authority 
or restrictions. We turn again to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
for several illustrations. 

The VA has the authority to compromise any claim arising from its 
guarantee or insurance programs, “[n]otwithstanding the provisions of any 
other law,” and, therefore, independent of the governmentwide 
compromise authority under the Federal Claims Collection Act and related 
statutes. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3720(a)(3) and(4). Exercise of this authority is 
entirely up to the VA. See B-153726, May 4, 1964. See generally 71 Comp. 
Gen. 449 (1992); 67 Comp. Gen. 271 (1988). 

Subject to its own implementing regulations and certain exceptions and 
procedures specified in the statute, the VA is required to offset debts 
arising from veterans’ benefit programs (for which recovery has not been 
waived) against future payments under any law administered by the VA. 
38 U.S.C. § 5314(a). However, offset against a veteran or his or her 
surviving spouse by any other agency to collect a debt owed to the VA 
under a guarantee program is prohibited except with the written consent of 
the debtor or under a judicial determination. Id. § 3726. Under this 
legislation, for example, the Defense Department may not deduct the 
amount of indebtedness to VA from the pay of active duty or retired 
military personnel absent either consent or a court determination. (The 
statutory definition of veteran includes certain active duty personnel.) 
B-167880, Jan. 28, 1970. This protection against setoff applies only where 
the veteran (debtor) has incurred the debt through use of his or her VA loan 
entitlement. Thus, setoff is not prohibited where a veteran, upon 

Page 11-72 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

purchasing a home, assumes a VA loan in the ordinary course of the real 
estate transaction without involving his or her own loan entitlement. 

B-167880, Dec. 2, 1969. 

The VA also has independent statutory authority (and a general obligation) 
to assess interest and reasonable administrative costs on debts arising from 
its benefit programs, including debts arising from guarantee programs to 
the extent not precluded by the terms of the loan instrument. 38 U.S.C. 
§ 5315. For debts within the scope of the statute, 38 U.S.C. § 5315, rather 
than 31 U.S.C. § 3717 (Federal Claims Collection Act), is the controlling 
provision. 66 Comp. Gen. 512 (1987). 

If reasonable administrative collection efforts fail, the VA may use its own 
attorneys to sue the debtor, subject to the direction and supervision of the 
Attorney General. 38 U.S.C. § 5316. 

The VA legislation cited above deals with specific debt collection tools. An 
example of more general authority is 7 U.S.C. § 1981(b)(4), which 
authorizes the Farmers Home Administration to “compromise, adjust, 
reduce, or charge-off debts or claims,” and, within certain limits, to release 
debtors, other than Housing Act debtors, “from personal liability with or 
without payment of any consideration at the time of the compromise, 
adjustment, reduction, or charge-off.” Under this law, for example, the 
Farmers Home Administration is authorized to terminate the accrual of 
interest on the guaranteed portion of defaulted loans. 67 Comp. Gen. 471 
(1988) (noting, however, that the agency had restricted its statutory 
discretion by its own regulations). 

5. Collateral Protection In administering a loan guarantee program, it may become desirable for an 
agency to make expenditures other than merely paying out on the 
guarantee. From a program or even economical standpoint, it may be 
desirable, for example, to make expenditures to protect and preserve the 
government’s interest in the collateral, such as custodial care, insurance 
costs, or the purchase of prior liens. For purposes of this discussion, we 
use the term “collateral protection” to cover two types of expenditure— 
preservation of the collateral itself and protection of the government’s 
interest in the collateral. 
Whether or not such expenditures are proper is essentially a question of 
“purpose availability.” The first step is to analyze the terms and intent of 
the agency’s program authority to determine whether the agency’s funds 

Page 11-73 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

are available for the contemplated expenditure either expressly or by 
necessary implication. If this does not provide the answer, the next step is 
to apply the “necessary expense” doctrine.44 

An example of specific authority is 38 U.S.C. § 3727, which authorizes the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to make expenditures to correct 
structural defects in certain homes encumbered by a VA-guaranteed 
mortgage. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has 
similar authority to use funds available under Title I of the National 
Housing Act to correct structural defects in housing insured by the Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA). 12 U.S.C. § 1735b; B-114860-O.M., Jan. 15, 
1974. An example of somewhat less specific authority is another provision 
of the Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1713(k), which authorizes HUD “to take 
such action and advance such sums as may be necessary to preserve or 
protect the lien of such mortgage.” In 54 Comp. Gen. 1061 (1975), GAO 
agreed that this provision authorizes HUD to advance money from its 
insurance fund to make repairs to multifamily projects covered by insured 
mortgages assigned to HUD upon default, until either the default is cured 
or HUD acquires title to the property. 

Absent specific authority, collateral protection expenditures may still be 
permissible under a “necessary expense” theory. As a general proposition, 
the authority to require collateral implies the authority to make reasonable 
expenditures to care for and preserve the collateral where administratively 
determined to be necessary. 54 Comp. Gen. 1093 (1975). 

The limits of the necessary expense approach are illustrated by B-170971, 
Jan. 22, 1976, a case involving the now-defunct New Community 
Development Program. The Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) questioned whether it could use the revolving fund 
established by the Urban Growth and New Community Development Act of 
1970 to make two types of collateral protection expenditures: 

(1)expenditures to repair, maintain, and operate the security and 
(2)payments to senior lienholders. The expenditures were intended to 
advance program objectives by preventing deterioration of the security 
pending possible acquisition by HUD, or perhaps in some cases enable a 
developer to regain financial health and successfully continue with the 
project. 
44 See section B of Chapter 4 for a discussion of the necessary expense doctrine. 

Page 11-74 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

The Comptroller General reviewed the program legislation and legislative 
history and concluded that the proposed expenditures would constitute a 
new and major type of financial assistance entirely beyond the intended 
scope of the statute, and were not authorized except in cases where HUD 
had made a bona fide determination to acquire the security. A later 
decision, B-170971, July 9, 1976, discussed HUD’s specific authority under 
the program legislation to make collateral protection expenditures after it 
had acquired the security. 

Where an agency acquires property through a loan or loan guarantee 
program it administers, it may not transfer the management and disposition 
of that property to another federal agency without specific statutory 
authority nor may it effect such a transfer under the Economy Act, 
31 U.S.C. § 1535. B-156010, Mar. 16, 1965 (concluding that VA could not 
transfer the management and disposition of acquired property to HUD 
without specific authority). 

A similar type of payment is one designed to protect the government’s 
interest in the transaction as opposed to maintaining the particular piece of 
property. Again, the question is one of purpose availability in light of the 
agency’s statutory authority. Thus, where FHA had acquired a second 
mortgage on real property through payment of a loss to an insured financial 
institution under Title I of the National Housing Act, it could use Title I 
funds to redeem the property to protect its junior lien, under a right of 
redemption conferred by state law, if it determined that redemption was in 
the best interests of the government and necessary to carry out the 
provisions of Title I. 36 Comp. Gen. 697 (1957). See also 34 Comp. 
Gen. 47 (1954). 

Collateral protection may take forms other than direct expenditures. For 
example, the Small Business Administration could subordinate a senior 
lien to enable a borrower to obtain necessary surety bonds upon an 
administrative determination that the action would be consistent with the 
statutory purposes and would improve the prospects for repayment of the 
loan. 42 Comp. Gen. 451 (1963). (Under the governing legislation, SBA had 
the discretion not to require security at all on loans sufficiently sound as to 
reasonably assure repayment.) Another 1963 case held that a statute 
authorizing the Maritime Administration to take necessary steps to protect 
or preserve collateral securing indebtedness authorized it to agree to 
reschedule payments under an insured ship mortgage to avert impending 
default. 43 Comp. Gen. 98 (1963). 

Page 11-75 GAO-06-382SP Appropriations Law—Vol. II 


Chapter 11 
Federal Assistance: Guaranteed and Insured 
Loans 

In 63 Comp. Gen. 465 (1984), a borrower defaulted on a loan guaranteed by 
the SBA. SBA purchased the guaranteed portion of the loan from the 
lending bank and proceeded to place the loan in liquidation. However, a 
prior lienholder scheduled a foreclosure sale. SBA was unable to get a 
Treasury check in time to submit a protective bid, and asked the lending 
bank to advance funds to purchase the property at the foreclosure sale, 
promising to reimburse the bank with interest. Obviously, a government 
agency does not normally have the authority to borrow money from a 
commercial bank to carry out its programs. Under the particular 
circumstances involved, however, GAO found that the transaction, 
including the commitment to pay interest, could be justified under SBA’s 
broad authority45 in 15 U.S.C. § 634(b)(7) to “take any and all actions” 
deemed necessary in liquidating or otherwise dealing with authorized loans 
or guarantees. The decision emphasized that it was nothing more than an 
interpretation of SBA’s legal authority under the “unique circumstances of 
this case,” and should not be regarded as establishing a “broad legal 
precedent.” 63 Comp. Gen. at 469. 

45 The Supreme Court has noted in another context that Congress has given the SBA 
“extraordinarily broad powers” to accomplish the objectives of the Small Business Act. 
Small Business Administration v. McClellan, 364 U.S. 446, 447 (1960).
