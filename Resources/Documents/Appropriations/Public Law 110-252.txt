service, and boost the United States economy, and has a positive 
effect on recruitment for the Armed Forces.

Forces. 
(5) The people of the United States greatly value military 
service and recognize the difficult challenges involved in readjusting 
to civilian life after wartime service in the Armed 
Forces.

to provide veterans who serve on active duty in the Armed 
Forces after September 11, 2001, with enhanced educational 
assistance benefits that are worthy of such service and are 
commensurate with the educational assistance benefits provided 
by a grateful Nation to veterans of World War II.
