department may waive the limitations in subsection (a), on a 
case-by-case basis, if the Secretary determines, and certifies

        public-private competition that includes a most 
        efficient and cost effective organization plan 
        developed by such activity or function;
            (2) the Competitive Sourcing Official determines 
        that, over all performance periods stated in the 
        solicitation of offers for performance of the activity 
        or function, the cost of performance of the activity or 
        function by a contractor would be less costly to the 
        Department of Defense by an amount that equals or 
        exceeds the lesser of--
                    (A) 10 percent of the most efficient 
                organization's personnel-related costs for 
                performance of that activity or function by

                insurance plan available to the workers who are 
                to be employed in the performance of that 
                activity or function under the contract; or
                    (B) offering to such workers an employer-
                sponsored health benefits plan that requires 
                the employer to contribute less towards the 
                premium or subscription share than the amount 
                that is paid by the Department of Defense for 
                health benefits for civilian employees under 
                chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.

                the blind or by a qualified nonprofit agency 
                for other severely handicapped individuals in 
                accordance with that Act; or

under the authority of, and in compliance with, subsection (h) 
of section 2304 of title 10, United States Code, for the 
competition or outsourcing of commercial activities.

Sheep and Bighorn Sheep Contact on National Forest System 
Land.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation 
(other than the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and regulations 
issued under such Act), none of the funds made available by 
this Act or made available by any other Act for fiscal year 
2012 only may be used to carry out--
            (1) any new management restrictions on domestic 
        sheep on parcels of National Forest System land (as 
        defined in the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources 
        Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1609(a))) with 
        potential domestic sheep and bighorn sheep (whether 
        native or nonnative) contact in excess of the 
        management restrictions that existed on July 1, 2011; 
        or
            (2) any other agency regulation for managing 
        bighorn sheep populations on any allotment of such 
        National Forest System land if the management action 
        will result in a reduction in the number of domestic 
        livestock permitted to graze on the allotment or in the 
        distribution of livestock on the allotment.
    (b) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the 
Secretary of Agriculture may make such management changes as 
the Secretary determines to be necessary to manage bighorn 
sheep if the management changes--
            (1) are consistent with the wildlife plans of the 
        relevant State fish and game agency and determined in 
        consultation with that agency; and
            (2) are developed in consultation with the affected 
        permittees.
    (c) Bureau of Land Management Lands.--In circumstances 
involving conflicts between bighorn sheep and domestic sheep 
grazing on public lands (as defined in section 103 of the 
Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 
1702)), the Bureau of Land Management may only modify or cancel 
domestic sheep grazing permits after consulting with the 
appropriate State fish and game agency. However, if the State 
in question has an approved State Wildlife Management Plan that 
addresses, with specificity, bighorn sheep management, then the 
Bureau of Land Management modification or cancellation of 
permits in that State shall conform to the bighorn sheep 
management objectives in the State Wildlife Management Plan, 
unless conformance would be inconsistent with Federal statute 
or regulation. The Bureau of Land Management shall be bound by 
the requirements of this subsection until September 30, 2012.
    (d) Voluntary Closure of Allotments.--Nothing in this 
section shall be construed as limiting the voluntary closure of 
existing domestic sheep allotments when the closure is agreed 
to in writing between the permittee and the Secretary of the 
Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture and is carried out for 
the purpose of reducing conflicts between domestic sheep and 
bighorn sheep.
    (e) Waiver of Grazing Permits and Leases.--The Secretary of 
the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture may accept the 
voluntary waiver of any valid existing lease or permit 
authorizing grazing on National Forest System land described in 
subsection (a) or public lands described in subsection (c). If 
the grazing permit or lease for a grazing allotment is only 
partially within the area of potential domestic sheep and 
bighorn sheep contact, the affected permittee may elect to 
waive only the portion of the grazing permit or lease that is 
within that area. The Secretary concerned shall--
            (1) terminate each permit or lease waived or 
        portion of a permit or lease waived under this 
        subsection;
            (2) ensure a permanent end to domestic sheep 
        grazing on the land covered by the waived permit or 
        lease or waived portion of the permit or lease unless 
        or until there is no conflict with bighorn sheep 
        management; and
            (3) provide for the reimbursement of range 
        improvements in compliance with section 4 of the Act of 
        June 28, 1934 (commonly known as the Taylor Grazing 
        Act; 43 U.S.C. 315c).

permitting for Outer Continental Shelf sources (as such term is 
defined in section 328(a)(4) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
7627(a)(4)) by the Department of the Interior with such 
permitting by the Environmental Protection Agency, taking into 
account the time elapsed between application and permit 
approval, the number of applications, and the experiences and 
assessments of the applicants.

under a new bilateral agreement governing the terms and

                reimbursement of such taxes; or
                    (B) the foreign policy interests of the 
                United States outweigh the purpose of this 
                section to ensure that United States assistance 
                is not subject to taxation.
            (2) The Secretary of State shall consult with the

        framework bilateral agreement between the Government of 
        the United States and the government of the country 
        receiving assistance that describes the privileges and

        assistance for such country generally, or an individual 
        agreement between the Government of the United States 
        and such government that describes, among other things, 
        the treatment for tax purposes that will be accorded 
        the United States assistance provided under that 
        agreement.
    (h) Report.--The Secretary of State shall submit a report 
to the Committees on Appropriations not later than 90 days

the USAID Administrator determines and reports promptly to the 
Committees on Appropriations that the termination of assistance 
to a country or a significant change in circumstances makes it 
unlikely that such designated funds can be obligated during the 
original period of availability:  Provided, That such 
designated funds that continue to be available for an 
additional fiscal year shall be obligated only for the purpose 
of such designation.
    (c) Ceilings and specifically designated funding levels

            (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the

        in the Middle East and North Africa;
            (2) the Arab League boycott, which was regrettably

        of Israel and find concrete steps to demonstrate that 
        opposition by, for example, taking into consideration 
        the participation of any recipient country in the 
        boycott when determining to sell weapons to said 
        country; and
            (5) the President should report to Congress

        States to encourage Arab League states to normalize 
        their relations with Israel to bring about the 
        termination of the Arab League boycott of Israel, 
        including those to encourage allies and trading

        other countries in the region to vigorously pursue 
        efforts to establish a just, lasting, and comprehensive 
        peace in the Middle East that will enable Israel and an 
        independent Palestinian state to exist within the 
        context of full and normal relationships, which should

       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and Senate at the 
conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2055) making 
appropriations for military construction, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2012, and for other purposes, submit the 
following joint statement to the House and Senate in 
explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the 
managers and recommended in the accompanying conference report.

       DIVISION A--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2012

      The conference agreement on the Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act, 2012, incorporates some of the provisions 
of both the House and the Senate versions of the bill. The 
language and allocations set forth in House Report 112-110 and 
Senate Report 112-77 shall be complied with unless specifically 
addressed to the contrary in the accompanying bill and 
explanatory statement.

              DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY

      The conferees agree that for the purposes of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 
99-177) as amended by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-119) and by 
the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), the 
terms program, project, and activity for appropriations 
contained in this Act shall be defined as the most specific 
level of budget items identified in the Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act, 2012, the related classified annexes and 
explanatory statements, and the P-1 and R-1 budget 
justification documents as subsequently modified by 
congressional action. The following exception to the above 
definition shall apply: for the military personnel and the 
operation and maintenance accounts, for which the term 
``program, project, and activity'' is defined as the 
appropriations accounts contained in the Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act.
      At the time the President submits the budget for fiscal 
year 2013, the Department of Defense is directed to transmit to 
the congressional defense committees budget justification 
documents to be known as the ``M-1'' and ``O-1'' which shall 
identify, at the budget activity, activity group, and 
subactivity group level, the amounts requested by the President 
to be appropriated to the Department of Defense for military 
personnel and operation and maintenance in any budget request, 
or amended budget request, for fiscal year 2013.
      In carrying out any Presidential sequestration, the 
Department of Defense and related agencies shall conform to the 
definition for ``program, project, and activity'' set forth 
above except that military personnel accounts will be exempt 
from sequestration per the notification made by the Director of 
the Office of Management and Budget on August 10, 2011.

                            CLASSIFIED ANNEX

      Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the 
accompanying classified annex.

                  CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

      Items for which additional funds have been provided as 
shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the 
phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' are congressional special 
interest items for purposes of the Base for Reprogramming (DD 
Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 
1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in these 
materials.

                         REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE

      The Department of Defense is directed to continue to 
follow the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts as 
specified in the report accompanying the House version of the 
fiscal year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill 
(H.R. 110-279). For operation and maintenance accounts, the 
Department of Defense shall continue to follow the 
reprogramming guidelines specified in the conference report 
accompanying H.R. 3222, the Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act, 2008, which are also expressed under title 
II of this statement. The dollar threshold for reprogramming 
funds shall remain at $15,000,000 for operation and 
maintenance; $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for 
research, development, test and evaluation.
      Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports 
for service and defense-wide accounts in titles I, II, III, and 
IV of this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with 
guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar 
threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, 
development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These 
thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value 
as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined 
value of transfers into or out of an operation and maintenance 
(O-1), a procurement (P-1), or a research, development, test 
and evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
Department of Defense must submit a prior approval 
reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
items are established elsewhere in this statement.

                           FUNDING INCREASES

      The funding increases outlined in the tables for each 
appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific 
purposes indicated in the tables.

                      TITLE I--MILITARY PERSONNEL

      The conference agreement provides $131,090,539,000 in 
Title I, Military Personnel, instead of $132,092,225,000 as 
proposed by the House and $131,000,559,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement on items addressed by either 
the House or the Senate is as follows: 

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

           MILITARY PERSONNEL ANTI-DEFICIENCY ACT VIOLATIONS

      Since 2001, the Department of Defense has had 11 
violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA) in its military 
personnel accounts. The conferees recognize the uncertainty 
that exists in the military personnel accounts due to their 
entitlement nature and the fact that resource requirements are 
driven by millions of individual and organizational personnel 
decisions. To further complicate management of these accounts, 
a significant number of obligations are incurred in the fourth 
quarter of the fiscal year. The conferees recognize the 
Department's efforts to improve the management and oversight of 
these accounts, but remain concerned over the Department's 
failure to adequately manage the military personnel budgets.
      Therefore, the recommendation includes a new general 
provision requiring the Inspector General of the Department of 
Defense to conduct a review of military personnel ADA 
violations and their causes. Based on the findings of the 
review, the Inspector General shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report examining the Department's 
budgeting and oversight of the military personnel accounts, 
including recommendations for corrective actions to avoid 
additional ADA violations going forward. This report should be 
submitted to the congressional defense committees not later 
than 180 days after enactment of this Act.

                   RESERVE COMPONENT BUDGET STRUCTURE

      The conferees direct each of the reserve components to 
provide a semi-annual detailed report to the congressional 
defense committees showing transfers between subactivities 
within the military personnel appropriation accounts. Reports 
shall be submitted not later than 30 days following the end of 
the second quarter and 30 days following the end of the fiscal 
year.

                 EXCESS BAGGAGE FEES FOR SERVICEMEMBERS

      The conferees are concerned by recent incidents in which 
servicemembers on military orders deploying to or returning 
from overseas contingency operations on commercial airlines 
have been charged excess baggage fees. In some instances, 
servicemembers were asked to pay out of their own pockets for 
charges placed on checked baggage carrying U.S. military 
equipment and not personal effects. Servicemembers make great 
sacrifices to serve their country in dangerous wartime 
conditions. They should not be asked to endure personal 
financial hardships as a result of traveling to and from 
overseas deployments.
      Although the Department of Defense states that it has the 
authority to pay for excess baggage fees and to reimburse 
servicemembers for any fees they have paid, the conferees 
firmly believe that servicemembers should not be burdened with 
out-of-pocket expenses at all. The conferees strongly encourage 
the Department to avoid entering into contract agreements with 
airlines that charge excess baggage fees to servicemembers who 
are traveling on military orders and are being deployed to or 
returning from overseas contingency operations. In addition, 
the Secretary of Defense is directed to submit a report to the 
congressional defense committees not later than 90 days after 
enactment of this Act on measures being taken that will prevent 
servicemembers from having to pay out-of-pocket costs on 
checked baggage in such instances.

as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement on items 
addressed by either the House or the Senate is as follows:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

                OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REPROGRAMMINGS

      The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base 
for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 
2012 appropriation accounts not later than 60 days after 
enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited 
from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any 
purpose other than originally appropriated until the 
aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate 
Appropriations Committees.
      The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal 
prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in 
the Services' operation and maintenance accounts between O-1 
budget activities in excess of $15,000,000. In addition, the 
Secretary of Defense should follow prior approval reprogramming 
procedures for transfers in excess of $15,000,000 out of the 
following budget subactivities:
      Army:
      Maneuver units
      Modular support brigades
      Land forces operations support
      Force readiness operations support
      Land forces depot maintenance
      Base operations support
      Facilities Sustainment, Repair, and Modernization
      Navy:
      Aircraft depot maintenance
      Ship depot maintenance
      Facilities Sustainment, Repair, and Modernization
      Marine Corps:
      Depot maintenance
      Facilities Sustainment, Repair, and Modernization
      Air Force:
      Primary combat forces
      Combat enhancement forces
      Combat communications
      Facilities Sustainment, Repair, and Modernization
      During fiscal year 2012, the Air Force is required to 
submit written notification and justification to the 
congressional defense committees not later than 30 days prior 
to implementing transfers in excess of $15,000,000 out of the 
following budget subactivities:
      Operating forces depot maintenance
      Mobilization depot maintenance
      Training and recruiting depot maintenance
      Administration and service-wide depot maintenance
      The transfer may be implemented 30 days after 
congressional notification unless an objection is received from 
a congressional defense committee.
      Finally, the Secretary of Defense should follow prior 
approval reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of 
$15,000,000 into the following budget subactivity:
      Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard:
      Other personnel support/recruiting and advertising
      With respect to Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide, 
proposed transfers of funds to or from the levels specified for 
defense agencies in excess of $15,000,000 shall be subject to 
prior approval reprogramming procedures.

       OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FUNDING FOR MILITARY TECHNICIANS

      The House recommendation included adjustments to Army and 
Air Force Reserve and National Guard operation and maintenance 
accounts based on discrepancies in the number of military 
technicians included in the request. The conference agreement 
does not include these adjustments; however, the Department is 
directed to ensure consistency in the number of military 
technicians included in the request between the military 
personnel appropriations in the PB-31R Personnel Summary 
exhibit and noted on the OP-5 exhibit in the operation and 
maintenance appropriations in the future.

     STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION OPERATIONS/MILITARY 
                     INFORMATION SUPPORT OPERATIONS

      The conference agreement includes $224,975,000 for 
Department of Defense information operations (IO)/military 
information support operations (MISO) programs, instead of 
$176,575,000 as proposed by the House and $300,570,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The budget request includes 
$120,570,000 in title II and $180,000,000 in title IX. The 
conference agreement includes all funds for these activities in 
title IX of this division as proposed by the House. Of the 
$120,570,000 requested in title II, the conference agreement 
includes program reductions totaling $16,795,000 and transfers 
the remaining $103,775,000 to title IX. The allocation of 
funding by combatant command and funding levels for certain 
programs is specifically delineated in the classified annex 
accompanying this Act. The conferees direct that these 
delineations shall be considered congressional special interest 
items and be subject to normal reprogramming procedures.
      The conferees agree that combatant commanders need the 
ability to effectively communicate in their respective areas of 
responsibility and provide adequate resources to support such 
military objectives. The conferees appreciate the progress made 
by the Office of the Secretary of Defense over the past three 
years to define and consolidate strategic communications (SC) 
and IO into a more accountable and transparent structure within 
the Department and improve interagency coordination. Even with 
this progress, concerns remain that some activities being 
funded under IO/MISO and SC are duplicative of, or operate at 
cross purposes with, other federal agencies' efforts. As the 
Secretary of Defense Memorandum dated January 25, 2011 
indicates, further refinements are necessary to identify IO-
related costs and develop standardized budgeting methodologies 
for SC and IO-related capabilities and activities, as well as 
MISO costs. In an era of declining budgets, Department of 
Defense funding for these activities must be fully captured and 
carefully reviewed to ensure that each request meets a primary 
military requirement.
      The conference agreement does not provide funds within 
the fiscal year 2012 base budget for these activities, but 
instead continues funding them within title IX of this 
division. The conferees will consider transitioning the funding 
for SC and IO/MISO programs to the base budget in fiscal year 
2013 after a review of the comprehensive budget requests for 
SC, IO/MISO, and IO-related capabilities and activities.
      The conferees reiterate the direction included in the 
House report requiring the Secretary of Defense to develop a 
format for improving the budget submission for these programs 
in fiscal year 2013. The submission shall include, at a 
minimum, a delineation of all programs and activities, and the 
funding associated with each, for all SC and IO/MISO programs 
within the Department of Defense. The conferees further direct 
the Secretary of Defense to follow the direction in the House 
report regarding execution reports for funds provided for these 
programs.

                  ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT

      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
(House Section 10011) on the Energy Independence and Security 
Act of 2007. The conferees note that the enforcement of section 
526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 may 
lead to higher fuel costs for federal fleets in the absence of 
competitively priced new generation fuels that emit fewer 
emissions. In carrying out this statute, the Secretary of 
Defense and the Service Secretaries should work to ensure that 
costs associated with fuel purchases necessary to carry out the 
missions of their respective departments and agencies should be 
minimized to the extent possible under the law.

                   OVERHEAD COSTS AT NAVAL SHIPYARDS

      One of the major themes of the Department of Defense's 
fiscal year 2012 budget submission has been the generation of 
efficiency savings through reduced overhead and improved 
business practices. However, the Navy's own budget materials 
indicate a plan to spend over $1,700,000,000 for overhead costs 
at Naval shipyards in fiscal year 2012, an amount equal to 33 
percent of Naval shipyard funding. The conferees believe there 
are opportunities to find Naval shipyard efficiency savings and 
direct the Secretary of the Navy to carefully assess shipyard 
overhead costs with a goal of identifying and eliminating all 
unnecessary overhead expenditures. The conferees recommend that 
funding garnered from overhead savings be reapplied to ship 
depot and intermediate maintenance in order to improve the 
readiness of the fleet.

      The conferees do not agree to the reporting requirements 
carried in the Senate report accompanying the Department of 
Defense Appropriations Act, 2012 regarding the Marine Corps' 
personal protective eyewear. However, the conferees remain 
committed to ensuring that the Marine Corps' acquisition 
program and its performance meet the standards and procedures 
required for these important protective devices.

                VISIBILITY OF DEPOT MAINTENANCE FUNDING

      All depot maintenance funding contained in the Air 
Force's fiscal year 2012 budget request has been identified, 
consolidated, and displayed in the Depot Maintenance 
Subactivity Group. In fiscal year 2013, all depot maintenance 
funds requested in the budget must be discretely visible and 
fully justified. Air Force officials have provided assurances 
that contracts will be modified as necessary to include 
specific accounting of depot maintenance costs and that 
implementation of the Air Force's Next Generation Contractor 
Logistics Support concept will provide needed data in the 
required format to achieve full cost visibility and proper 
accounting of depot maintenance funding in the future.

proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                       Environmental Restoration

      The conference agreement provides $1,517,363,000 for the 
Environmental Restoration program, as proposed by the Senate, 
instead of $1,467,363,000 as proposed by the House.

                  CONTRACT OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY

      The conferees are pleased that the adoption of 
performance-based contracting has led to increased efficiencies 
within the Department of Defense Environmental Restoration 
program. However, improved oversight and management would bring 
even greater benefits. The conferees direct the Secretary of 
Defense to implement measures to improve management of the 
program and to institute a process by which better oversight 
can be conducted of the contracting process and progress of 
cleanup.
      Additionally, included as part of the Defense 
Environmental Program's Annual Report to Congress, the 
Secretary of Defense is directed to provide the following 
information: the amount of environmental restoration funding 
provided to each installation during the previous year as well 
as the subsequent reduction in the projected cost-to-complete 
at that installation, a listing along with explanation of those 
installations where the cost-to-complete is not reduced by the 
corresponding amount of monetary investment, a detailed 
justification regarding any increase of ten percent or more in 
the projected cost-to-complete from the previous year at an 
installation, and a detailed justification for any installation 
in which the projected ``response complete'' date has been 
delayed by a year or more from the previous year.

                    Environmental Restoration, Army

      The conference agreement provides $346,031,000 for 
Environmental Restoration, Army, as proposed by both the House 
and the Senate.

                    Environmental Restoration, Navy

      The conference agreement provides $308,668,000 for 
Environmental Restoration, Navy, as proposed by both the House 
and the Senate.

                  Environmental Restoration, Air Force

      The conference agreement provides $525,453,000 for 
Environmental Restoration, Air Force, as proposed by both the 
House and the Senate.

                Environmental Restoration, Defense-Wide

      The conference agreement provides $10,716,000 for 
Environmental Restoration, Defense-Wide, as proposed by both 
the House and the Senate.

         Environmental Restoration, Formerly Used Defense Sites

      The conference agreement provides $326,495,000 for 
Environmental Restoration, Formerly Used Defense Sites, as 
proposed by the Senate, instead of $276,495,000 as proposed by 
the House.

           National Capital Region Environmental Health Study

      The conferees encourage the Secretary of Defense to 
support both new and ongoing public health scoping studies of 
densely populated residential communities located on or near 
formerly used defense sites that have conducted research and 
tested chemical agents, equipment, and munitions.

             Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid

      The conference agreement provides $107,662,000 for 
Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid, as proposed by 
both the House and the Senate.

                  Cooperative Threat Reduction Account

      The conference agreement provides $508,219,000 for the 
Cooperative Threat Reduction Account, as proposed by both the 
House and the Senate.

      Department of Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund

      The conference agreement provides $105,501,000 for the 
Department of Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund 
(DAWDF), as proposed by the House, instead of $175,501,000 as 
proposed by the Senate, a reduction of $200,000,000 below the 
request.
      Along with the funding reduction due to carryover from 
large unobligated balances for the past several years, the 
conferees believe the Department should reassess further growth 
of its acquisition workforce in light of two considerations. 
First, the goal of 147,000 personnel set forth in the 2010 
Human Capital Plan Update should be revisited considering 
today's uncertain fiscal environment and budgetary outlook. For 
example, 10 USC 1705 mandates annual funding floors for the 
DAWDF--floors that exceed $1,000,000,000 in the outyears. The 
conferees believe that these floors may need to be adjusted and 
direct the Secretary of Defense to provide recommendations for 
appropriate funding levels to the congressional defense 
committees not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act. 
Second, the conferees are aware that the Department has not yet 
completed competency assessments for all of the functional 
areas that compose this workforce, which suggests the ability 
to assess the full range of required competencies within the 
workforce may be limited. Having these assessments completed is 
essential to understanding how best to prioritize future hiring 
and to optimize workforce training. The conferees direct the 
Secretary of Defense to publish a revised strategic Human 
Capital Plan Update for the defense acquisition workforce not 
later than August 1, 2012, detailing future workforce needs. In 
so doing, the conferees expect the Secretary to ensure that 
competency assessments for all functional areas that make up 
the defense acquisition workforce are completed, using DAWDF 
resources to facilitate this task if necessary.
      To assist in the Human Capital Plan Update, the conferees 
direct the Comptroller General to report on the funding 
mechanisms and statutory limits established for the DAWDF 
through Section 852 of the National Defense Authorization Act, 
2008 and codified by 10 USC 1705 to the congressional defense 
committees not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act. 
The current statute should be revisited in the near term. 
Absent this, the Department will be forced either to over-
commit precious resources or violate the law, neither of which 
is an acceptable option. Therefore, the Comptroller General 
report should include recommendations to improve the overall 
funding process for the DAWDF.

                         TITLE III--PROCUREMENT

      The conference agreement provides $104,579,701,000 in 
Title III, Procurement, instead of $107,581,474,000 as proposed 
by the House and $102,118,282,000 as proposed by the Senate. 
The conference agreement on items addressed by either the House 
or the Senate is as follows:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

                         SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

      Items for which additional funds have been provided as 
shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the 
phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in this report are 
congressional special interest items for the purpose of the 
Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must 
be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount 
specifically addressed in the explanatory statement.

            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS

      The conferees direct the Department of Defense to 
continue to follow the reprogramming guidance specified in the 
report accompanying the House version of the fiscal year 2006 
Department of Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 109-119). 
Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming funds will 
remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and $10,000,000 for 
research, development, test and evaluation. The Department 
shall continue to follow the limitation that prior approval 
reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold 
or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test 
and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are 
cumulative. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into 
or out of a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test 
and evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
Department of Defense must submit a prior approval 
reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
items are established elsewhere in this statement.

                  REPROGRAMMING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

      The conferees direct the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Comptroller) to continue to provide the congressional defense 
committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports 
for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
this Act as required in the explanatory statement accompanying 
the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006.

                          JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER

      The conference agreement reduces the budget request by 
$151,000,000 for the procurement of one F-35A Conventional 
Take-off and Landing aircraft, by $94,500,000 for advance 
procurement of Conventional Take-off and Landing aircraft, and 
by $109,000,000 for advance procurement of Carrier Variant 
aircraft. Additionally, the conferees are concerned with the 
cost of concurrency changes on the Joint Strike Fighter program 
and provide $100,000,000 to help offset the cost of concurrency 
for lot six aircraft and previously procured aircraft. The 
conferees encourage the Joint Strike Fighter Team to review 
processes and oversight of concurrency changes and establish a 
process that will reduce the time it takes to discover a 
problem, develop a solution, and implement this solution to 
reduce future concurrency change costs.
      The conferees recognize that, for a variety of reasons, 
the Joint Strike Fighter program is burdened with what could be 
the highest level of concurrency ever seen in an acquisition 
program. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of 
Defense to provide a semi-annual report to the congressional 
defense committees that shows the actual concurrency costs for 
the Joint Strike Fighter program. The report showing these 
actual concurrency costs shall be made available to the 
Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation for the 
purposes of cost estimating and to develop lessons learned from 
allowing programmatic concurrency, so this cost can be 
considered when decisions are made regarding allowing such a 
high degree of concurrency in future programs.

                                M1 TANK

      The conferees are aware that the Army has been reviewing 
alternative courses of action for future tank production. 
Options have been studied ranging from a temporary shutdown and 
storage of facilities to adding funds to the tank program in 
order to maintain a steady flow of new tanks and a ready 
capacity in case of urgent need. Both the House and the Senate 
added funds for the Abrams Upgrade Program in fiscal year 2012. 
The House proposed a funding increase of $272,000,000 and the 
Senate proposed a funding increase of $240,000,000. The 
conference agreement provides an additional amount of 
$255,000,000 above the President's request to continue 
upgrading M1 tanks to the M1A2SEP variant. The additional 
funding supports production of 42 additional M1A2SEP tanks. The 
conferees direct the Secretary of the Army to provide a report 
not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act on the plan 
for the use of the additional funds, including the plan to 
sustain tank production.

procurement of 12 MQ-8 unmanned aerial vehicles and associated 
support equipment. Although the budget justification materials 
provided by the Navy were unclear about the MQ-8 model to be 
procured, the conferees understand that the Navy will actually 
procure the longer range MQ-8C variant. The conferees fully 
support this decision as the longer range will provide greater 
operational flexibility for the various missions the aircraft 
is expected to conduct.

                       RETIREMENT OF B-1 AIRCRAFT

      The fiscal year 2012 budget request includes a proposal 
to retire six B-1 bomber aircraft. The conferees understand 
that the B-1 fleet continues to operate almost constantly over 
Afghanistan in support of troops on the ground and that the B-1 
is a critical component of the Nation's long-range strike 
capabilities. The Air Force proposed to reinvest less than 40 
percent of the savings from aircraft retirements in the B-1 
modernization program across the Future Years Defense Program. 
The conferees are concerned that premature retirement of six B-
1 aircraft could negatively impact long-range strike 
capabilities. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of 
the Air Force to reinvest a larger portion of savings realized 
from B-1 aircraft retirements, to the extent authorized by law, 
in the sustainment and modernization of the B-1 fleet.

SPACE ACQUISITION AND THE EVOLUTIONARY ACQUISITION FOR SPACE EFFICIENCY 
                               ACTIVITIES

      The conferees continue to support block buys of 
satellites that are evolved from previous designs as described 
in the ``Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (EASE)'' 
concept. However, the conferees remain concerned that the 
details associated with the technology insertion program are 
missing in the budget justification material. Therefore, the 
conferees direct that of the funds appropriated for the 
Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system Capabilities/
Affordability Insertion Program (CAIP), no more than 50 percent 
shall be available for obligation until the Secretary of the 
Air Force submits a report to the congressional defense 
committees on the individual CAIP efforts with a description of 
the technology insertion plans being pursued. Further, the 
conferees direct the Secretary of the Air Force to include the 
detailed budget definition for each of the CAIP efforts in the 
R-3 documents for the fiscal year 2013 and future budget 
submissions. The conferees also direct that not more than the 
specified amounts shall be obligated for the AEHF CAIP/Space 
Modernization Initiative unless the Secretary of the Air Force 
notifies the congressional defense committees in writing 15 
days prior to the obligation of funds which exceeds the 
following amounts: $28,300,000 for cryptology parts 
obsolescence; $20,000,000 for radiation hardened parts 
technologies; $3,200,000 for remotely piloted aircraft concept 
definition; $58,700,000 for protected military satellite 
communications (MILSATCOM) designs for affordability; 
$7,000,000 for hosted payloads; and $25,000,000 for MILSATCOM 
architecture and support.
      In addition, the conferees reiterate their opposition to 
using advance appropriations for procurement of satellites and 
recommend that an alternative concept be proposed in future 
budget submissions.
      Finally, the conferees are disappointed that it took the 
Department of Defense over two years to develop a 15-year space 
strategic plan. It is the intention of the conferees that such 
plans be regularly developed and updated; therefore, the 
conferees direct that the next 15-year space strategic plan be 
delivered with the fiscal year 2014 budget submission.

                         SM-3 BLOCK IB MISSILE

      The fiscal year 2012 budget request includes $565,393,000 
for the procurement of SM-3 Block IB missiles in support of 
Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense. The conferees have been 
informed by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) that following a 
recent flight test failure, those funds are partially ahead of 
need. The conferees have also been informed that funding is 
required for a failure review of the SM-3 Block IB, sustainment 
of the industrial base, and the procurement of SM-3 Block IA 
missiles before SM-3 Block IB missiles will be procured. The 
conferees understand that the details of the specific funding 
requirements are currently being analyzed by MDA and direct MDA 
to submit a prior approval reprogramming request prior to 
executing funds from this line.

      SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND AVIATION FOREIGN INTERNAL DEFENSE

      The conferees are aware of ongoing reviews of the 
proposed expansion of the Aviation Foreign Internal Defense 
(AvFID) mission in the Special Operations Command. While these 
reviews are not yet complete, the conferees believe that the 
rapid expansion of this mission, as proposed in the fiscal year 
2012 budget request, must be tempered. The agreement contains 
reductions of $45,000,000 from procurement of AvFID fixed-wing 
aircraft, $10,000,000 from procurement of an AvFID rotary-wing 
aircraft simulator, and $17,607,000 from operation and 
maintenance for aircraft that will not deliver until fiscal 
year 2013. The agreement fully funds the procurement of two 
AvFID rotary-wing aircraft and associated support equipment.
      The conferees direct that no funds provided for fixed-
wing Aviation Foreign Internal Defense aircraft may be 
obligated until 30 days after submission of a report by the 
Commander, Special Operations Command to the congressional 
defense committees describing how the funds will be used to 
support the AvFID or the non-standard aviation (NSAV) missions, 
a summary of AvFID and NSAV funding contained in the fiscal 
year 2013 budget request and the Future Years Defense Program, 
and an analysis of alternatives used to justify the described 
program. The report shall be submitted not later than February 
15, 2012.

                          LONG TERM CONTRACTS

      The conferees believe that the time and money being 
invested by the Department of Defense in biofuels and 
alternative energy will reap dividends not only for the 
Nation's armed forces, but eventually for the Nation itself. 
The conferees want the Department to be in the best position 
possible to take advantage of the expected breakthroughs in 
this area and encourage the Department to eventually pursue 
extended multi-year contracts, pursuant to the Financial 
Management Regulation, for biofuels products in order to 
maximize efficiencies of scale for the best purchase price.

                           ADDITIONAL FUNDING

      The conferees recognize the critical role the Defense 
Production Act program serves in strengthening the Nation's 
industrial base. Therefore, the conferees provide $150,000,000 
over the budget request to supplement this important program. 
As stated in the Senate report, the conferees direct the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) to 
award this funding to multiple projects using full and open 
competition and to notify the congressional defense committees 
not later than 30 days in advance of this funding being 
obligated.

          TITLE IV--RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION

      The conference agreement provides $72,420,675,000 in 
Title IV, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, instead 
of $72,983,469,000 as proposed by the House and $71,033,956,000 
as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement on items 
addressed by either the House or the Senate is as follows:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

                         SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

      Items for which additional funds have been provided as 
shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the 
phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in this report are 
congressional special interest items for the purpose of the 
Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must 
be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount 
specifically addressed in the explanatory statement.

            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS

      The conferees direct the Department of Defense to 
continue to follow the reprogramming guidance specified in the 
report accompanying the House version of the fiscal year 2006 
Department of Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 109-119). 
Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming funds will 
remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and $10,000,000 for 
research, development, test and evaluation. The Department 
shall continue to follow the limitation that prior approval 
reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold 
or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test 
and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are 
cumulative. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into 
or out of a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test 
and evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
Department of Defense must submit a prior approval 
reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
items are established elsewhere in this statement.

                  REPROGRAMMING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

      The conferees direct the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Comptroller) to continue to provide the congressional defense 
committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports 
for service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
this Act as required in the explanatory statement accompanying 
the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006.

           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND SERVICE CYBER ACTIVITIES

      The conferees acknowledge the threat to and from the 
cyber realm has been well documented; however, the resources 
being expended against the threat have not. In order to better 
evaluate the planning and resourcing for Department of Defense 
cyber activities, the conferees direct the Commander, United 
States Cyber Command, in coordination with the Secretary of 
Defense and each of the Service Secretaries, to provide the 
congressional defense committees separate budget justification 
material, in the form of the budget documents as defined in the 
Department's own Financial Management Regulation, that details 
the year-to-year budgets, schedule, and milestone goals over 
the Future Years Defense Program for the individual programs 
that support the goals of the cyber initiative. The programs 
detailed must include cyberspace operations, computer network 
operations, information assurance, and full spectrum cyber 
operations for the Department of Defense and the Services.
      The conferees suggest that the Department continue to 
refine what activities, budget lines, and programs should be 
considered cyber in order to better coordinate and track these 
budgets.

            Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Army

      The conference agreement on items addressed by either the 
House or the Senate is as follows:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

                   ARMY MODERNIZATION AND ACQUISITION

      The conferees agree with the Army's steps to improve 
acquisition processes through implementation of the Decker-
Wagner Army Acquisition Review findings as well as introducing 
other metrics and monthly reports to enable and strengthen 
senior civilian oversight across all Army modernization 
portfolios. The conferees believe continued acquisition 
improvement is only achievable with a strong, stable 
acquisition workforce and therefore urge the Secretary of the 
Army and the Secretary of Defense to guard against misguided 
efforts that shrink the acquisition workforce as was done in 
the 1990s with disastrous results. The conferees also believe 
that even with improvements in acquisition processes and a 
stable workforce, these steps alone will not ensure that the 
Army will achieve its modernization objectives.
      After both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees 
completed their reviews of the fiscal year 2012 budget request, 
the Army provided additional information for its top-ten 
priority programs. Of these top-ten programs, six programs had 
undergone significant acquisition strategy modifications 
causing schedule and programmatic perturbations. As a result of 
these changes, the Army identified over $1,000,000,000 from its 
original fiscal year 2012 budget request as excess to its 
funding requirements in fiscal year 2012. Additionally, the 
Army notified the congressional defense committees of over 
$309,000,000 in excess funds from its budget request due to 
program terminations and requested transfers of over 
$282,000,000 among ten different programs. This magnitude of 
change in funding across a multitude of programs, identified 
after submitting the budget only ten months prior, indicates a 
pervasive instability in Army programs.
      While the conferees recognize that ten years of 
continuous war can force out-of-cycle changes, the Army's 
acquisition challenges precede the post-September 11, 2001 war 
efforts. Since 1995, the Army has spent $32,000,000,000 on 
development of 22 programs that were eventually cancelled. The 
conferees believe this history of programmatic instability 
indicates a lack of focus and discipline in the requirements 
generation process that must be corrected before the Army will 
see any improvement in its ability to successfully modernize. 
Improvement must begin with clearly documented, stable, and 
affordable requirements. The conferees are aware that Army 
acquisition has taken on the responsibility of vetting each 
requirement for technical maturity and affordability prior to 
initiating a contract action, but the conferees are concerned 
that this is a short-term correction to a larger institutional 
problem with the requirements generation process.
      Furthermore, while the conferees congratulate the Army on 
the success of the newly implemented Network Integration 
Evaluations, which ensure new equipment is interoperable, 
effective, and adds benefit to deployed troops, the process has 
revealed that a handful of programs would not be effective if 
deployed. The evaluations are causing the Army to reevaluate, 
restructure, and even terminate several programs that began 
years ago with established requirements. Thus, the conferees 
question the long-standing requirements process that serves as 
the foundation for Army modernization. Therefore, in addition 
to implementing changes identified in the Decker-Wagner Army 
Acquisition Review, the Secretary of the Army is encouraged to 
undertake a similar examination of the requirements generation 
process.

   FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS' SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PROGRAM 
             MANAGEMENT AND NETWORK INTEGRATION EVALUATION

      The conference agreement provides $298,872,000 for the 
Future Combat Systems' System of Systems Engineering and 
Program Management, instead of $311,872,000 as proposed by the 
House and $283,872,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees 
note that this line now funds the Army's bi-annual Network 
Integration Evaluations (NIE). The conferees support the NIE 
and direct the Army to regularly update the congressional 
defense committees on the cost, schedule, scope, and methods 
for the tests and other associated reviews to be accomplished 
in the NIE, as well as outcomes and findings. Additionally, the 
conferees are aware of the savings the Army has achieved in 
Future Combat Systems termination costs and the lower costs 
projected for the fiscal year 2012 NIE. The conferees note that 
the continued use of the former ``Future Combat Systems'' 
terminology has become a counter-productive distraction and 
recommend updating program descriptions to improve 
communications among those who review and shape defense 
appropriations and to more accurately reflect the purpose for 
which appropriations are requested. The conferees believe that 
funding requirements for the NIE should be presented distinctly 
and separately in future budget submissions.

          ACTIVE AND SEMI-ACTIVE VEHICLE SUSPENSION COMPONENTS

      The conferees are aware that the Army has begun the 
testing and development of active and semi-active vehicle 
suspension components with regenerative capabilities. The 
conferees understand that this technology may improve vehicle 
fuel efficiency and reduce maintenance. Accordingly, the 
conferees encourage the Army to continue the testing and 
development of this technology and to fully explore the 
potential benefits for application across vehicle programs.

         SUPPORT FOR BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE 2005 ACTIONS

      The conferees support actions taken by the Army and the 
Defense Logistics Agency to fully fund the integration of their 
information technology systems in a timely manner to support 
the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's 
mandate to transfer re-procurement of depot level repairables. 
The conferees are aware that although the BRAC Commission 
determined the transfer has the potential to save millions of 
dollars, the Government Accountability Office has recently 
concluded that the savings are jeopardized by inadequate up-
front funding for BRAC implementation. The conferees note that 
the Army's Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and 
Engineering Command (TARDEC) manages the repository of all 
ground vehicle technical data for the Army, and has built 
infrastructure for use by all Army programs to store weapons 
system technical information, drawings, and specifications. The 
conferees urge that the TARDEC use funds available for this 
effort to assist in meeting the 2005 BRAC recommendation for 
depot-level repairable transfer.

                     ARMORED MULTI-PURPOSE VEHICLE

      The conferees recommend $14,300,000 for the Armored 
Multi-purpose Vehicle instead of $31,400,000 as proposed by the 
House and no funding as proposed by the Senate. The conferees 
note that the requirement to find a replacement for the M113 
series of vehicles has received scant attention for too long. 
The conferees believe that prompt and decisive action is needed 
to select and advance a near-term solution rather than 
continuing a long-term search for the perfect solution. The 
conferees note that the recommendation fully funds the Analysis 
of Alternatives, as requested by the Army. Subsequently, after 
notification to the congressional defense committees, available 
funds may be applied to expedite the acquisition effort.

                         GROUND COMBAT VEHICLE

      The conferees recommend $449,387,000 for the Ground 
Combat Vehicle, instead of $768,053,000 as proposed by the 
House and $240,387,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees 
have been informed of a change to the acquisition strategy and 
note that the recommendation fully funds this revised strategy.

                         ARMED SCOUT HELICOPTER

      The conferees recommend no funding for technology 
development of the Armed Scout Helicopter (ASH), instead of 
$63,690,000 as proposed by the House and $4,761,000 as proposed 
by the Senate, because contrary to plans submitted with the 
fiscal year 2012 budget submission, the Army does not plan to 
award a technology development contract in fiscal year 2012. 
The conferees recommend $15,000,000 for a flight demonstration 
of ASH capabilities, as requested by the Army. The conferees 
understand that this flight demonstration will occur in the 
spring of 2012, and direct the Army to brief the congressional 
defense committees in detail on the outcome of this 
demonstration not later than 30 days after its completion.

                      JOINT LIGHT TACTICAL VEHICLE

      The budget request includes $243,940,000 within Army and 
Marine Corps accounts for the development of the Joint Light 
Tactical Vehicle (JLTV). The JLTV program has undergone 
significant changes since its inception and the submission of 
the fiscal year 2012 budget request. The principal reason for 
the changes is the discovery that the plan to acquire multiple 
variants of a limited number of vehicles with demanding 
performance specifications would result in an unaffordable 
program for both the Army and Marine Corps. As a result, the 
program will now pursue a competitively-selected single vehicle 
with a less complex design on a significantly accelerated 
timeline.
      The conferees are encouraged to see the Army and Marine 
Corps taking definitive action to change their approach in 
evaluating requirements, technology, key performance 
parameters, and costs as they apply to this acquisition 
program. Continuing on the nine year path of studies, 
development, and testing to field a lightweight tactical 
vehicle that will carry four passengers and 3,500 pounds of 
cargo onto the battlefield was unacceptable.
      Recognizing the renewed focus and approach, the 
conference agreement provides $87,300,000 in Research, 
Development, Test and Evaluation, Army and $46,700,000 in 
Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy for continued 
JLTV development, in accordance with revised estimates for the 
program. The conferees strongly encourage the Army and Marine 
Corps, in conjunction with the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), to examine the 
feasibility of accelerating a competition for production 
through more efficient testing and acquisition practices and by 
embracing off-the-shelf technology demonstrated by industry so 
that improved vehicles are delivered to the warfighter as soon 
as possible. Accordingly, the Army and Marine Corps are 
encouraged to acquire, test, and evaluate, as necessary, 
available off-the-shelf systems that meet the essential program 
requirements.

                      INTEGRATED AIRCREW ENSEMBLE

      The conference agreement provides $3,980,000 for the 
Integrated Aircrew Ensemble (IAE), a decrease of $2,000,000 
below the request. The conferees understand that the IAE will 
provide more fully integrated upgrades to various flight safety 
gear and special protections in unique threat environments and 
is not a redesign of the current flight suit. Given existing 
and prospective budget constraints, the conferees urge the Air 
Force to proceed with the program in a requirements-focused and 
fiscally sustainable manner.

                                 KC-46A

      The conferees direct the Secretary of the Air Force to 
submit the reports regarding the KC-46A required in House 
Report 112-110 on a quarterly basis, with the first report to 
be submitted not later than March 30, 2012.

               DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY

      The conferees recommend a total of $166,122,000 in 
undistributed reductions throughout the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The conferees direct the 
Director of DARPA to provide a report to the congressional 
defense committees, not later than 60 days after enactment of 
this Act, detailing by program element and project the 
application of each undistributed reduction.

                          PROMPT GLOBAL STRIKE

      The fiscal year 2012 budget request includes $204,824,000 
to continue the Prompt Global Strike program. The conferees 
recommend $179,824,000, a reduction of $25,000,000, based on 
program delays caused by two consecutive flight test failures 
of the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2. The conferees remain 
supportive of the Prompt Global Strike program and direct that 
the reduction not be applied to the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon 
program, which just completed a successful flight 
demonstration.

         SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND UNDERSEA MOBILITY CONCEPTS

      The fiscal year 2012 budget request includes $92,242,000 
for several programs that are designed to collectively fill the 
capability gap that remains following termination of the 
Advanced SEAL Delivery System and its successor, the Joint 
Multi-Mission Submersible. The conferees note that unobligated 
prior year appropriations, combined with funds provided in the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2012, would allow the 
Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to award several commercial 
contracts to develop a Family of Systems to meet its 
requirement. The conferees direct the Commander, SOCOM to 
provide separate cost estimates for the Technology Development 
and Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases for each 
of the projects in support of Undersea Mobility, as well as the 
estimated procurement costs, with the fiscal year 2013 budget 
submission.

                      ISRAELI COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS

      The fiscal year 2012 budget request includes $106,100,000 
to continue Israeli Cooperative Programs, a decrease of over 
$100,000,000 from amounts appropriated in fiscal year 2011. The 
conferees find the request insufficient and provide an 
additional $129,600,000 to address Israel's security 
requirements. Within this amount, $15,000,000 shall be used 
only for the Low Rate Initial Production activities as included 
in the David's Sling Weapon System project agreement between 
the two governments.

                   MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES INITIATIVE

      The conferees recommend $101,670,000, instead of 
$151,670,000 as proposed by the House and no funding as 
proposed by the Senate, for the Medical Countermeasures 
Initiative (MCMI) System Development and Demonstration. The 
conferees support the purpose of the MCMI program but are 
concerned that synergies with other government programs have 
not been sufficiently explored and that the government is 
creating slightly distinct, yet largely redundant capabilities. 
Therefore, the conferees direct the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense (Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs) to 
continue efforts to reduce costs and program overlap.

                      90NM NEXT GENERATION FOUNDRY

      The recommendation includes no funding for the requested 
90nm Next Generation Foundry, due to the lack of justification 
in support of the budget submission. However, the conferees 
recognize the criticality of ensuring a safe and stable supply 
of microchips to the Department of Defense and will revisit 
this issue in the future.

                         Defense Health Program

conference agreement on items addressed either by the House or 
the Senate is as follows:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

            DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM REPROGRAMMING PROCEDURES

      The conferees remain concerned over the transfer of funds 
from Direct (or In-house) Care to pay for contractor-provided 
medical care. To limit such transfers and continue oversight 
within the Defense Health Program operation and maintenance 
account, the conferees include bill language which caps the 
funds available for Private Sector Care under the TRICARE 
program subject to prior approval reprogramming procedures. The 
bill language and accompanying statement language included by 
the conferees should not be interpreted by the Department of 
Defense as limiting the amount of funds that may be transferred 
to the Direct Care System from other budget activities within 
the Defense Health Program. In addition, the conferees continue 
to designate the funding for the Direct Care System as a 
special interest item. Any transfer of funds from the Direct 
(or In-house) Care budget activity into the Private Sector Care 
budget activity or any other budget activity will require the 
Department of Defense to follow prior approval reprogramming 
procedures.
      The Department shall also provide written notification to 
the House and Senate Appropriations Committees of cumulative 
transfers in excess of $15,000,000 out of the Private Sector 
Care budget activity. The conferees further direct the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to provide 
quarterly reports to the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees on budget execution data for all of the Defense 
Health Program accounts and to adequately reflect changes to 
the budget activities requested by the Services in future 
budget submissions.

                               CARRYOVER

      For fiscal year 2012, the conferees recommend one percent 
carryover authority for the operation and maintenance account 
of the Defense Health Program. The conferees direct the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to submit a 
detailed spending plan for any fiscal year 2011 designated 
carryover funds to the congressional defense committees not 
fewer than 15 days prior to executing the carryover funds.

                 PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM

      The conference agreement provides $12,800,000 for a Peer-
Reviewed Cancer Research Program that would research cancers 
not addressed in the breast, prostate, ovarian, and lung cancer 
research programs currently executed by the Department of 
Defense, and specifically by the U.S. Army Medical Research and 
Materiel Command.
      The funds provided are directed to be used to conduct 
research in the following areas: melanoma and other skin 
cancers, pediatric brain tumors, genetic cancer research, 
pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, blood cancer, colorectal 
cancer, mesothelioma, and listeria vaccine for infectious 
disease and cancer.
      The funds provided under the Peer-Reviewed Cancer 
Research Program shall only be used for the purposes listed 
above. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is 
directed to provide a report not later than 60 days after 
enactment of this Act to the congressional defense committees 
on the status of the Peer-Reviewed Cancer Research Program. For 
each research area, the report should include the funding 
amount awarded, the progress of the research, and the relevance 
of the research for servicemembers and their families.

               JOINT WARFIGHTER MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM

      The conference agreement provides $50,000,000 for the 
Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program. Funds shall be used 
to augment and accelerate high priority Department of Defense 
and Service medical requirements and to continue prior year 
initiatives that are close to achieving their objectives and 
yielding a benefit to military medicine. The funds shall not be 
used for new projects or for basic research. The funding shall 
be awarded at the Department's discretion following a review of 
medical research and development gaps, as well as unfinanced 
medical requirements of the Services. Further, the conferees 
direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to 
provide a report not later than 120 days after enactment of 
this Act to the congressional defense committees, which lists 
the projects that receive funding. The report should include 
the amount of funding provided to each project and a thorough 
description of each project's research.

                 PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM

      The conference agreement provides $50,000,000 for a Peer-
Reviewed Medical Research Program. The conferees direct the 
Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the Service Surgeons 
General, to select medical research projects of clear 
scientific merit and direct relevance to military health. 
Research areas considered under this funding are restricted to: 
arthritis, composite tissue transplantation, drug abuse, 
dystonia, epilepsy, food allergies, Fragile X syndrome, 
hereditary angioedema, inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial 
cystitis, lupus, malaria, nanomedicine for drug delivery 
science, neuroblastoma, osteoporosis and related bone disease, 
Paget's disease, polycystic kidney disease, post-traumatic 
osteoarthritis, scleroderma, tinnitus, and tuberculosis. The 
conferees emphasize that the additional funding provided under 
the Peer-Reviewed Medical Research Program shall be devoted 
only to the purposes listed above.

               TITLE IX--OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS

      The conference agreement provides $115,082,635,000 in 
Title IX, Overseas Contingency Operations, instead of 
$118,669,277,000 as proposed by the House and $117,583,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement on items 
addressed by either the House or the Senate is as follows:

                         REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

      The conferees direct that the Department continue to 
report incremental contingency operations costs for Operation 
New Dawn and Operation Enduring Freedom on the monthly basis in 
the Cost of War Execution report as required by Department of 
Defense Financial Management Regulation, Chapter 23, Volume 12. 
The conferees further direct the Department to continue 
providing Cost of War reports to the congressional defense 
committees that include the following information by 
appropriation account: funding appropriated, funding allocated, 
monthly obligations, monthly disbursements, cumulative fiscal 
year obligations, and cumulative fiscal year disbursements.
      The conferees expect that in order to meet unanticipated 
requirements, the Department of Defense may need to transfer 
funds within these appropriations accounts for purposes other 
than those specified in this report. The conferees direct the 
Department of Defense to follow normal prior approval 
reprogramming procedures should it be necessary to transfer 
funding between different appropriations accounts in this 
title.

                      MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN LIBYA

      General provisions 10003 and 10017, included in the House 
version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill, 
restricted the use of Department of Defense funding for certain 
activities in or against Libya. The conference agreement does 
not include those provisions. Since the House passage of the 
Department of Defense Appropriations bill, political conditions 
in Libya have changed and power has transferred to a new 
regime.
      As part of a greater NATO force, the United States 
participated in, and took direct forceful action against the 
country of Libya to topple its former regime. The action was 
successful and fortunately no American lives were lost during 
this incursion. However, the conferees insist that when 
determining that military engagements are necessary, the 
President is subject to the terms of the War Powers Resolution 
(50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.).

                        EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS

      The conferees are aware that certain governments and 
organizations such as the Government of Iran, Hamas, and 
Hizbullah have policies and practices counter to the best 
interests of the United States. The conferees reiterate that 
extremist governments and organizations should not be funded by 
this Act and that the conferees will closely monitor the 
expenditure of funds by the Department of Defense regarding 
such matters.

                          HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

      The House included language directing reports on human 
rights abuses. The conferees direct the initial report be 
completed not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act 
and quarterly throughout the fiscal year.

                           Military Personnel

      The conference agreement provides $11,639,252,000 for 
Military Personnel, instead of $10,813,624,000 as proposed by 
the House and $11,657,252,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement on items addressed by either the House or 
the Senate is as follows: 

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

                       Operation and Maintenance

      The conference agreement provides $89,016,326,000 for 
Operation and Maintenance, instead of $89,780,293,000 as 
proposed by the House and $90,546,851,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement on items addressed by either 
the House or the Senate is as follows: 

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

                    PAKISTAN COUNTERINSURGENCY FUND

      The House version of the Department of Defense 
Appropriations bill included $1,100,000,000 for the Pakistan 
Counterinsurgency Fund. The Senate included an appropriation 
for this fund in the State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Agencies Appropriations bill. The fund is addressed in the 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Division of 
this Act.

                AFGHANISTAN RESOURCES OVERSIGHT COUNCIL

      The conferees have modified Section 9009 of the Senate 
version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill to 
include revised thresholds for contracts requiring approval of 
the Afghanistan Resources Oversight Council (AROC) and other 
responsibilities of the AROC. As outlined in this section, the 
AROC is responsible for approving all financial and activity 
plans for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF). The 
conferees direct the AROC to establish policies, regulations, 
and processes to include consideration of the extent of 
competition and the relevant qualifications and eligibility of 
contractors as part of the acquisition plan for major purchases 
of goods and services. The conferees further direct the AROC to 
establish business rules and criteria for reviewing ASFF 
construction and sustainment plans for infrastructure and to 
establish a plan for the oversight of contractor performance 
and services and goods rendered. These are critical steps in 
ensuring that proper oversight is conducted on one of the 
largest Department of Defense programs.

                              Procurement

      The conference agreement provides $13,633,461,000 for 
Procurement, instead of $13,375,288,000 as proposed by the 
House and $15,518,701,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement on items addressed by either the House or 
the Senate is as follows:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

for the Air National Guard; $145,000,000 is for the Army

for the Marine Corps Reserve; and $75,000,000 is for the Air

this fiscal year.
      This funding will allow the Guard and reserve components 
to procure high priority equipment that may be used by these 
units for both their combat missions and their missions in 
support of State governors. The conferees direct that the 
National Guard and Reserve Equipment account shall be executed 
by the Chiefs of the National Guard and reserve components with

address Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle and 
MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) requirements, as identified by 
the Department of Defense. The request was reduced by an amount 
previously provided by the Department of the Army to the MRAP 
Joint Program Office to support operations and maintenance from 
within funds available to the Army. The Department shall

      The conference agreement provides funding for the Joint 
Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) in 
title IX. The conferees believe that the requirements are war 
related and should be funded through Overseas Contingency 
Operations funding.
      The conferees direct JIEDDO to submit to the 
congressional defense committees monthly commitment, 
obligation, and expenditure data by line of operation and by 
year of appropriation. Further, the conferees direct JIEDDO to 
submit to the congressional defense committees monthly reports 
of obligation data on a project by project basis by line of 
operation. The conferees also continue the direction that 
JIEDDO follow standard reprogramming procedures when 
transferring a cumulative amount of $20,000,000 or more between 
lines of operation.

                    Office of the Inspector General

      The conference agreement provides $11,055,000 for the 
Office of the Inspector General, as proposed by both the House 
and the Senate.

DIVISION B--ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2012 JOINT 
          EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

    The language and allocations set forth in House Report 112-
118 and Senate Report 112-75 should be complied with unless 
specifically addressed to the contrary in the conference report 
and statement of managers. Report language included by the 
House which is not contradicted by the report of the Senate or 
the conference, and Senate report language which is not 
contradicted by the report of the House or the conference is 
approved by the committee of conference. The statement of 
managers, while repeating some report language for emphasis, 
does not intend to negate the language referred to above unless 
expressly provided herein. In cases where both the House report 
and Senate report address a particular issue not specifically 
addressed in the conference report or joint statement of 
managers, the conferees have determined that the House report 
and Senate report are not inconsistent and are to be 
interpreted accordingly. In cases in which the House or Senate 
have directed the submission of a report, such report is to be 
submitted to both the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations.
    Funds for the individual programs and activities within the 
accounts in this Act are displayed in the detailed table at the 
end of the explanatory statement for this Act. Funding levels 
that are not displayed in the detailed table are identified in 
this explanatory statement.

                                TITLE I


                       CORPS OF ENGINEERS--CIVIL


                         DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY


                       Corps of Engineers--Civil

    The summary tables included in this title set forth the 
dispositions with respect to the individual appropriations, 
projects, and activities of the Corps of Engineers. The 
conference agreement includes no new starts as proposed by the 
House and Senate. Additional items of the Act are discussed 
below.

                             INVESTIGATIONS

    The conference agreement provides $125,000,000 for 
Investigations as proposed by the Senate, instead of 
$104,000,000 as proposed by the House. The Act does not include 
language regarding expenditure of funds as proposed by the 
House.
      The allocation for projects and activities within the 
Investigations account is shown in the following table:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.--The fiscal year 2012 
budget request does not reflect the extent of need for project 
studies funding. The Corps has numerous continuing studies that 
will be suspended under the limits of the budget request. These 
studies could lead to projects with significant economic 
benefits, particularly by increasing national competitiveness 
through marine transportation improvements and by avoiding 
damages caused by flooding and coastal storms. The conference 
agreement includes additional funds to continue ongoing 
studies. While this additional funding is shown in the 
feasibility column, the Corps should utilize these funds in any 
applicable phase of work. The intent of these funds is for 
ongoing work that either was not included in the 
Administration's request or was inadequately budgeted. In no 
case shall funds be used to initiate new studies within this 
account.
    A study shall be eligible for this funding if it has 
received funding, other than through a reprogramming, in at 
least one of the previous three fiscal years. Funding 
associated with each category may be allocated to any eligible 
study within that category; funding associated with each 
subcategory may be allocated only to eligible studies within 
that subcategory. The list of subcategories is not meant to be 
exhaustive. The conferees direct that priority in allocating 
these funds be given to completing or accelerating ongoing 
studies which will enhance the nation's economic development, 
job growth and international competitiveness, or are for 
projects located in areas that have suffered recent natural 
disasters.
    Within 45 days of enactment of this Act, the Corps shall 
provide to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations a 
work plan delineating how these funds are to be distributed and 
in which phase the work is to be accomplished. A document 
providing the Administration's criteria for justifying the 
funding decisions made shall accompany this work plan. No funds 
shall be obligated for any project under this program which has 
not been justified in such a report.
    Water Resources Principles and Guidelines.--No funds are 
provided for the line item proposed for Water Resources 
Principles and Guidelines, as this is considered a new start. 
No funds provided to the Corps shall be used to develop or 
implement rules or guidance if an update or replacement to the 
document dated March 10, 1983, and entitled ``Economic and 
Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related 
Land Resources Implementation Studies'' is finalized during the 
fiscal year period covered by the Energy and Water Development 
Act for 2012. The Corps shall continue to use the Water 
Resources Principles and Guidelines in effect as of the date of 
enactment of this Act during that same period.

                              CONSTRUCTION

    The conference agreement provides $1,694,000,000 for 
Construction, instead of $1,565,191,000 as proposed by the 
House and $1,610,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The Act 
does not include a rescission of $50,000,000 as proposed by the 
House. The Act does not include language regarding expenditure 
of funds as proposed by the House.
      The allocation for projects and activities within the 
Construction account is shown in the following table:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Napa River, Salt Marsh Restoration, California.--The 
conferees support language in the Senate report regarding this 
project.
    Savannah Harbor Expansion, Georgia.--The budget request for 
this item that was proposed in the Investigations account has 
been moved to this account where it has been funded for the 
past 3 fiscal years.
    Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Dispersal Barrier, 
Illinois.--The budget request includes funding for this project 
in both the Construction and Operation and Maintenance 
accounts. Since the submission, however, the Corps informed the 
Committees that the entire amount is required in the 
Construction account and no funding is needed in the Operation 
and Maintenance account. The conference agreement accommodates 
this shift in funding.
    Norfolk Harbor, Craney Island, Virginia.--The conferees 
support language in the Senate report regarding this project.
    Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.--The Corps has 
ongoing, authorized Construction projects that would cost tens 
of billions of dollars to complete, yet the Administration 
continues to request a mere fraction of the funding necessary 
to complete those projects. The conference agreement includes 
additional funds to continue ongoing projects and activities to 
enhance the nation's economic growth and international 
competitiveness. The intent of these funds is for ongoing work 
that either was not included in the Administration's request or 
was inadequately budgeted. None of these funds may be used to 
start new projects. None of these funds shall be used for 
projects in the Continuing Authorities Program. Funding 
associated with each category may be allocated to any eligible 
project within that category; funding associated with each 
subcategory may be allocated only to eligible projects within 
that subcategory. The list of subcategories is not meant to be 
exhaustive.
      The Corps shall evaluate all ongoing projects that have 
received funding, other than through a reprogramming, in at 
least one of the previous three fiscal years. Priority in 
allocating these funds should consider the following: number of 
jobs created directly by the funded activity; the benefits of 
the funded work to the national economy; ability to obligate 
the funds allocated within the fiscal year, including 
consideration of the ability of the non-federal sponsor to 
provide any required cost-share; ability to complete the 
project, separable element, or project phase within the funds 
allocated; for flood and storm damage reduction, population at 
risk and economic activity or public infrastructure at risk; 
and for navigation, number of jobs or level of economic 
activity to be supported by completion of the project, 
separable element, or project phase.
    Within 45 days of enactment of this Act, the Corps shall 
provide to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations a 
work plan delineating how these funds are to be distributed. A 
document detailing the Administration's specific criteria and 
project evaluations used to justify the funding decisions shall 
accompany this work plan. No funds shall be obligated for any 
project under this program which has not been justified in such 
a report.
    Continuing Authorities Program.--The conferees believe the 
various sections of the Continuing Authorities Program provide 
a useful tool for the Corps to undertake small localized 
projects without the lengthy study and authorization process 
typical of most larger Corps projects. The conference agreement 
rejects the Administration's proposal to reprogram prior-year 
appropriations to fund only sections 111, 204, 206, and 1135 in 
fiscal year 2012. Instead a total of $49,430,000 is provided 
for eight CAP sections. The management of the program should 
continue consistent with the guidelines outlined in the Senate 
report.
    Inland Waterways Users Board.--The conferees note that the 
terms of all members of the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) 
have expired and no appointments to reconstitute the Board have 
been forthcoming from the Secretary of the Army. The IWUB was 
created by Congress in the 1986 Water Resources Development Act 
for the express purpose of providing expert advice to the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers and to the Congress on the 
implementation of the inland waterways navigation 
infrastructure modernization programs. This aging system is 
vital to the movement of commerce. The conferees direct the 
Secretary of the Army to act on the appointments to the IWUB as 
expeditiously as possible.

                   MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES

    The conference agreement provides $252,000,000 for 
Mississippi River and Tributaries, instead of $210,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $250,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The Act does not include language regarding expenditure 
of funds as proposed by the House.
    The allocation for projects and activities within the 
Mississippi River and Tributaries account is shown in the 
following table: 

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.--After a flood such as 
was experienced this year on the Mississippi River, the value 
of prior investments in the Mississippi River and Tributaries 
Project cannot be disputed. Yet considerable work remains to 
complete this vital project in the heart of our nation. The 
budget request reflects neither the need nor the importance of 
this project. Therefore, the conferees provide additional funds 
to continue ongoing studies, projects or maintenance. The 
conferees direct that these funds be used for flood control, 
navigation, water supply, ground water protection, waterfowl 
management, bank stabilization and environmental restoration 
work. The intent of these funds is for ongoing work primarily 
along the Mississippi River tributaries that either was not 
included in the Administration's request or was inadequately 
budgeted. While this additional funding is shown under 
remaining items, the Corps should utilize these funds in any 
applicable phase of work. None of these funds may be used to 
start new projects or activities.
    The conferees direct that priority in allocating these 
funds be given to completing or accelerating ongoing work which 
will enhance the region and Nation's economic development, job 
growth and international competitiveness, or is located in 
areas that have suffered recent natural disasters. Within 45 
days of enactment of this Act, the Corps shall provide to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations a work plan 
delineating how these funds are to be distributed. A document 
providing the Administration's criteria for justifying the 
funding decisions made shall accompany this work plan. No funds 
shall be obligated for any project under this program which has 
not been justified in such a report.

                       OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

    The conference agreement provides $2,412,000,000 for 
Operation and Maintenance, instead of $2,368,925,000 as 
proposed by the House and $2,360,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The Act includes legislative language proposed by the 
House directing the Corps to allocate no more than 99 percent 
of the funds provided in this Act for Operation and Maintenance 
prior to the fourth quarter. This measure is intended to allow 
Headquarters flexibility to respond to national emergencies. 
The Act does not include language regarding expenditure of 
funds as proposed by the House.
    The allocation for projects and activities within the 
Operation and Maintenance account is shown in the following 
table:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.--The fiscal year 2012 
budget request does not fund operation, maintenance, and 
rehabilitation of our nation's aging infrastructure 
sufficiently to ensure continued competitiveness in a global 
marketplace. Federal navigation channels maintained at only a 
fraction of authorized dimensions, and navigation locks and 
hydropower facilities well beyond their design life result in 
economic inefficiencies and risks infrastructure failure, which 
cause substantial economic losses. The conferees believe that 
investing in operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of 
infrastructure today will save taxpayers money in the future.
      The conference agreement includes additional funds to 
continue ongoing projects and activities. The intent of these 
funds is for ongoing work that either was not included in the 
Administration's request or was inadequately budgeted. None of 
these funds may be used to start new projects or programs. The 
conferees direct that priority in allocating these funds be 
given to completing ongoing work maintaining authorized depths 
and widths of harbors and shipping channels, including where 
contaminated sediments are present, and for addressing critical 
maintenance backlog. Particular emphasis should be placed on 
projects where there is a U.S. Coast Guard presence; that will 
enhance national, regional, or local economic development; or 
that will promote job growth or international competitiveness.
      The conferees are concerned that the Administration's 
criteria for navigation maintenance does not allow small, 
remote, or subsistence harbors and waterways to properly 
compete for scarce navigation maintenance funds. The conferees 
urge the Corps to revise the criteria used for determining 
which navigation maintenance projects are funded in order to 
develop a reasonable and equitable allocation under this 
account. The criteria should include the economic impact that 
these projects provide to local and regional economies, in 
particular, those with national defense or public health and 
safety importance.
      Funding associated with each category may be allocated to 
any eligible project within that category; funding associated 
with each subcategory may be allocated only to eligible 
projects within that subcategory. The list of subcategories is 
not meant to be exhaustive. Priority in allocating these funds 
should consider the following: number of jobs created directly 
by the funded activity; benefits to the local, regional or 
national economy; ability to obligate the funds allocated 
within the fiscal year; ability to complete the project, 
separable element, or project phase within the funds allocated; 
and risk of imminent failure or closure of the facility.
      Within 45 days of enactment of this Act, the Corps shall 
provide to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations a 
work plan delineating how these funds are to be distributed. A 
document providing the Administration's criteria for justifying 
the funding decisions made shall accompany this work plan. No 
funds shall be obligated for any project under this program 
which has not been justified in such a report.
      Coastal and Ocean Systems Data.--The conferees have 
provided funding to ensure the maintenance of wave observations 
and the expansion of the national wave monitoring network as 
outlined in the National Operational Wave Observation Plan. 
Funds are also included for continuation of integrated long-
term beach surveys to monitor shoreline risk.

                           REGULATORY PROGRAM

      The conference agreement provides $193,000,000 for the 
Regulatory Program as proposed by the Senate, instead of 
$196,000,000 as proposed by the House. The Act includes 
language making funds available until September 30, 2013, as 
proposed by the Senate.

            FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAM

      The conference agreement provides $109,000,000 for the 
Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program as proposed by 
the House and Senate. The Corps is directed to prioritize sites 
that are nearing completion. Within the funds provided in 
accordance with the budget request, the Corps is directed to 
complete the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study of the 
former Sylvania nuclear fuel site at Hicksville, New York, and, 
as appropriate, to proceed expeditiously to a Record of 
Decision and initiation of any necessary remediation in 
accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).

                 FLOOD CONTROL AND COASTAL EMERGENCIES

      The conference agreement provides $27,000,000 for Flood 
Control and Coastal Emergencies as proposed by the House and 
Senate.

                                EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $185,000,000 for 
Expenses as proposed by the Senate, instead of $177,640,000 as 
proposed by the House. The Act includes language making funds 
available until September 30, 2013, as proposed by the Senate. 
Within the funds provided, the Institute for Water Resources is 
directed to submit to the Senate and House Committees on 
Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a 
report on how the Congress should address the critical need for 
additional port and inland waterway modernization to 
accommodate post-Panamax vessels. This study will not impede 
nor delay port or inland waterway projects already authorized 
by Congress. Factors for consideration should include costs 
associated with deepening and widening deep-draft harbors; the 
ability of the waterways and ports to enhance the nation's 
export initiatives benefitting the agricultural and 
manufacturing sectors; the current and projected population 
trends that distinguish regional ports and ports that are 
immediately adjacent to population centers; the availability of 
inland intermodal access; and the environmental impacts 
resulting from the modernization of inland waterways and deep-
draft ports.

     OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS

    The conference agreement provides $5,000,000 for the Office 
of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works as 
proposed by the House and Senate. The Act includes language 
making funds available until September 30, 2013, as proposed by 
the Senate.

                        ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION

    The conference agreement includes a provision relating to 
the replacement and hire of passenger motor vehicles as 
proposed by the House and Senate.

             GENERAL PROVISIONS--CORPS OF ENGINEERS--CIVIL

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

    The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate relating to reprogramming. The House proposed a 
similar provision.
    The conference agreement does not include a provision 
proposed by the Senate regarding implementation of competitive 
sourcing or High Performance Organizations. The House proposed 
no similar provision.
    The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the House prohibiting the use of funds to carry out any 
contract that commits funds beyond the amounts appropriated for 
that program, project, or activity. The Senate proposed no 
similar provision.
    The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the House relating to continuing contracts and the Inland 
Waterway Trust Fund. The Senate proposed a similar provision.
    The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate relating to report notifications. The House proposed 
a similar provision.
    The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate providing the Corps of Engineers authorization for 
emergency measures to exclude Asian carp from the Great Lakes. 
The House proposed a similar provision. The conferees do not

                       DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

                          Central Utah Project

                CENTRAL UTAH PROJECT COMPLETION ACCOUNT

    The conference agreement provides a total of $28,704,000 
for the Central Utah Project as proposed by the House, instead 
of $28,991,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                         Bureau of Reclamation

                      WATER AND RELATED RESOURCES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

    The conference agreement provides $895,000,000 for Water 
and Related Resources, instead of $822,300,000 as proposed by 
the House and $885,670,000 as proposed by the Senate. The Act 
does not include a restriction on projects carried out by the 
Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) as proposed by the House, but 
the conferees direct the Bureau of Reclamation to report to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by January 1, 
2015, on the use of the YCC for carrying out Reclamation 
projects. The Act does not include language regarding 
expenditure of funds as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement for Water and Related Resources 
is shown in the following table:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

      Indian Water Rights Settlements.--The conference 
agreement includes funds for these activities in the Water and 
Related Resources account as proposed by both the House and 
Senate, instead of in a separate account as proposed in the 
budget request.
      San Joaquin River Restoration.--The conference agreement 
does not include a separate account for this item. Funding is 
included in the Water and Related Resources account as a 
separate line item under the Friant Division of the Central 
Valley Project. The conferees note that the San Joaquin River 
Restoration Settlement Act has two goals: to restore and 
maintain fish populations in good condition and to reduce or 
avoid adverse water supply impacts to long-term contractors and 
other water users. The conferees direct the Bureau of 
Reclamation to continue to work with all relevant state and 
federal agencies, settlement parties, and third party interests 
to address all concerns so the mutual goals of the Settlement 
Act can be achieved.
      Arthur Bowman Dam.--The conference agreement includes 
House direction regarding hydropower development at Arthur 
Bowman Dam located in Crook County, Oregon.
      Buried Metallic Water Pipe.--The conferees are aware of 
several concerns regarding implementation and review of 
Reclamation's Technical Memorandum 8140-CC-2004-1 (``Corrosion 
Considerations for Buried Metallic Water Pipe''). Specifically, 
the conferees are concerned that Reclamation's use of this 
memorandum may be holding different materials to different 
standards of reliability and increasing project costs 
unnecessarily. Therefore, Reclamation should not use the 
memorandum as the sole basis to deny funding or approval of a 
project or to disqualify any material from use in highly 
corrosive soils. Additionally, the conferees direct Reclamation 
to follow the recommendation of the National Academy of 
Sciences to assemble data on pipeline reliability for all types 
of pipe specified in Table 2 of Technical Memorandum 8140-CC-
2004-1 along with the specified corrosion protection applied in 
the various soil types (``Review of the Bureau of Reclamation's 
Corrosion Prevention Standards for Ductile Iron Pipe'' (2009)) 
and to conduct an analysis of the performance of these types of 
pipe installed in the same or similar conditions. This review 
should also include an analysis of the economics, cost-
effectiveness and life-cycle costs associated with the various 
materials under evaluation.
      Additional Funding for Water and Related Resources 
Work.--The conference agreement includes additional funds as 
proposed by the Senate. The conferees direct that priority in 
allocating these funds should be to advance and complete 
ongoing work, improve water supply reliability, improve water 
deliveries, enhance regional or local economic development, 
promote job growth or for critical backlog maintenance and 
rehabilitation activities. Within 30 days of enactment, 
Reclamation shall provide to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations a report delineating how these funds are to be 
distributed, in which phase the work is to be accomplished, and 
an explanation of the criteria and rankings used to justify 
each allocation. This report shall also include the 
reassessment of allocation among rural water systems as 
directed by the House.

                CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT RESTORATION FUND

      The conference agreement provides $53,068,000 for the

                               TITLE III

                          DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

      The summary tables at the end of this title set forth the 
dispositions with respect to the individual appropriations, 
programs, and activities of the Department of Energy. 
Additional items in the Act are discussed below.
      The conference agreement provides $25,748,081,000 for the 
Department of Energy, instead of $24,722,046,000 as proposed by 
the House and $25,548,976,000 as proposed by the Senate, to 
fund programs in its five primary mission areas: science, 
energy, environment, nuclear non-proliferation and national 
security.
      Contractor Pensions and Benefits.--The conferees support 
actions taken to improve headquarters oversight of contractor 
pensions and other post-retirement benefits. Given the 
government has assumed the long-term liability for pension 
costs, the conferees encourage the Department to evaluate 
alternatives to contractually formalize requirements for the 
management of pension and other post-retirement benefits. 
Instead of the House direction on reporting requirements for 
pensions and prohibition on contribution amounts, the conferees 
direct the Department to report current plan status, funding 
ratios, reimbursement levels, projected plan status at budgeted 
levels, and any updates to funding ratios and contributions 
with or as supplemental information to the budget request. This 
information should be updated in April and September of each 
year. Changes to expected contribution levels should be clearly 
explained and the Department should note any changes in plan 
management that have impacted contribution amounts. Any funding 
request which proposes a contribution in excess of the minimum 
ERISA or Pension Protection Act requirements should include a 
detailed justification.
      Nuclear Safety.--Instead of the House direction for a 
safety review of all cleanup sites, the conferees direct the 
Secretary of Energy to review all Department of Energy nuclear 
facility construction projects with a total project cost 
greater than $1,000,000,000 to determine if those projects are 
being managed in a way which could pressure contractors or 
Department managers to disregard nuclear safety in order to 
demonstrate acceptable project performance. The review should 
investigate contract management, including the award of 
contractor fee, project management practices, and the framing 
of program and policy goals to evaluate if Department practices 
have complicated efforts to foster a positive nuclear safety 
culture or resolve nuclear safety-related design issues. The 
Secretary shall report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations no later than May 1, 2012, on improvements to 
contracting and other management practices which will assist 
Department managers in ensuring that design flaws and safety 
issues do not go ignored or unrecognized.
      H-Canyon.--Instead of the House requirement to provide 
funding to the National Academy of Sciences, the Department 
shall conduct its own review to explore the full range of 
potential uses for the chemical processing areas of H-Canyon at 
the Savannah River Site and report back to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations within 3 months of enactment of 
this Act. The options considered should not be limited to uses 
by the Office of Environmental Management, but should 
incorporate uses which may contribute to meeting the goals of 
other program offices within the Department of Energy and the 
National Nuclear Security Administration.
      Exascale Computing.--The conferees support the 
Department's initiative to develop exascale computing as a 
crucial component of long-term U.S. leadership, but are 
concerned that the Department has not yet developed an 
integrated strategy and program plan. The Department is 
directed to submit to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, not later than February 10, 2012, a joint, 
integrated strategy and program plan for the crosscutting 
effort to develop exascale computing that includes:
          --a target date for developing an operational 
        exascale platform;
          --interim milestones toward reaching that target;
          --minimum requirements for an exascale system, 
        including power consumption efficiency goals;
          --multi-year budget estimates for the exascale 
        initiative and costs of meeting each interim milestone;
          --clear roles and responsibilities for each office 
        involved in exascale research and development; and
          --a complete listing of exascale activities included 
        in the fiscal year 2013 budget request broken out by 
        program, project and activity with comparisons to the 
        current year's funding levels.
      Energy Innovation Hubs.--For each Energy Innovation Hub 
funded in this Act, the Department is directed to deliver to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, not later 
than 120 days after enactment of this Act, a report detailing 
milestones and performance goals for the end of each of the 
Hub's five fiscal years, and specific milestones and 
performance criteria the Hub must meet to be considered for a 
second five-year term. For Hubs established in prior fiscal 
years, the report shall include current performance against 
planned milestones, and a summary of progress against plans for 
staffing and facilities. For new Hubs, the report shall include 
a plan and timeline for selecting an awardee.
      PCAST Recommendations.--The conferees direct the 
Secretary of Energy, within 6 months of enactment of this Act, 
to submit a report detailing how the Department has or will 
implement in all Energy Programs the following features that 
have been used successfully in ARPA-E and highlighted by the 
President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology:
          --a rigorous review process;
          --contract or grant negotiations completed in just a 
        few months;
          --co-location within the program offices of such 
        support functions as procurement, contracts, human 
        resources, and information technology services; and
          --an agile and innovative workforce.

                       Reprogramming Requirements

      The conference agreement carries the Department's 
reprogramming authority in statute to ensure that the 
Department carries out its programs consistent with 
congressional direction, as proposed by the House. This 
modified provision includes reprogramming authority internal to 
each account, as long as no program, project or activity is 
increased or decreased by more than $5,000,000 or 10 percent, 
compared to the levels included in the ``Conference'' column in 
the ``Department of Energy'' table included under the heading 
``Title III--Department of Energy'' in this joint explanatory 
statement. No new transfer authority between accounts other 
than that explicitly granted in this Act is included or 
implied. The conferees expect the Department to use this 
additional flexibility to improve budget execution, meet 
emergent program needs, and reduce program costs. For 
reallocations above the $5,000,000 or 10 percent cumulative 
threshold, a reprogramming request must be submitted to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for consideration 
and may not be implemented prior to approval by the Committees. 
Any reallocation of new or prior-year budget authority or 
prior-year de-obligations, or any request to implement a 
reorganization which includes moving previous appropriations 
between appropriations accounts must be submitted to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations in writing and may not 
be implemented prior to approval by the Committees.
      Definitions.--A reprogramming includes the reallocation 
of funds from one program, project or activity to another 
within an appropriation.
      The conferees are concerned the Department is over-
committing future budgets by announcing multi-year awards 
subject to future appropriations for a substantial portion of 
activities within Energy Programs. The Department is directed 
to transition to a model in which it fully funds multi-year 
awards with appropriated funds, except in the cases of major 
capital projects, management and operating contracts, and large 
research centers which require multi-year awards subject to 
appropriations. As part of that transition, the conference 
agreement includes a provision requiring that any multi-year 
award must be subject to appropriations and the Department must 
notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations at 
least 14 calendar days prior to public announcement of the 
award. The Department shall deliver each notification as a 
cumulative list of all notifications under this subsection, to 
include: recipient; appropriations account, program, and 
activity; award date; total amount of award; amount awarded 
from fiscal year 2012 appropriations; amount awarded from prior 
appropriations; amount awarded subject to future 
appropriations; and an explanation of the special circumstances 
justifying commitment of future funds. The conferees do not 
include a House provision prohibiting the use of multi-year 
awards, but will reconsider this legislative prohibition in 
future years depending on the Department's performance in 
transitioning to fully funding its multi-year awards.

      The conference agreement includes a rescission of funds 
in the amount of $500,000,000 from existing balances within 
this account, rather than direction included in the House and 
Senate bills to sell an additional $500,000,000 of Reserves to 
enable operational maintenance of the caverns. A sale in 
calendar year 2011 unanticipated by the Administration's fiscal 
year 2012 budget request provides the necessary flexibility to 
address the infrastructure needs. The conference agreement 
includes no repeal or modification of royalty-in-kind 
provisions, as proposed by the Senate and House, respectively.

                   Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve

proposed by the House and $219,121,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Small Sites.--The conference agreement provides 
$67,430,000 for Small Sites. In response to a lack of progress 
on addressing existing contamination and seismic deficiencies 
within buildings that are located in heavily used areas at some 
Department national laboratories, the Department is directed to 
use additional funds above the amount requested to improve 
health and safety by cleaning up existing contamination and 
improving the seismic standards of buildings within Department 
laboratory grounds. The conference agreement directs the 
Department to provide a report on Small Sites as directed in 
the House and Senate reports within 3 months of enactment of

      Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund

      The conference agreement provides $472,930,000 for 
activities funded from the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination 
and Decommissioning Fund, instead of $449,000,000 as proposed 
by the House and $429,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. This 
amount includes post closure contract liabilities, pensions, 
and community and regulatory program support. The conference 
agreement does not include the House provision restricting the 
Department's use of up to $150,000,000 in proceeds from the 
barter, transfer, or sale of uranium to carry out uranium 
enrichment facility decontamination and decommissioning and 
remedial actions.
      The conferees are aware that the Department has yet to 
alter the contractual mechanism by which it has been 
transferring uranium to a contractor in exchange for additional 
cleanup services at Portsmouth in order to correct the 
violations of federal law cited in the Government 
Accountability Office's report ``Clarifying DOE's Disposition 
Options Could Help Avoid Further Legal Violations'' (GAO-11-
846). This type of arrangement continues to be off-budget and 
inappropriately bypasses the congressional appropriations 
process. There is also considerable concern that the increasing 
amount of uranium being transferred could destabilize the 
uranium market and thereby adversely impact our domestic 
uranium mining industry.
      The conferees request the Comptroller General to report 
to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate, not later than March 15, 2012, 
on the progress the Department has made in resolving the 
concerns raised in GAO-11-846. To increase transparency into 
Department of Energy actions, the Department shall fully adhere 
to the reporting requirements in this Act and have a current 
determination by the Secretary that any barter, transfer or 
sale of uranium carried out by the Department will not have an 
adverse material impact on the domestic uranium mining, 
conversion, or enrichment industry. The Department is further 
directed to provide the full details of any proposed barter, 
transfer or sale of uranium in its fiscal year 2013 budget 
request.

      Warhead Life Extensions.--The NNSA is directed to fully 
adhere to the new reporting requirements for early life 
extension activities contained in the House report beginning 
with submission of the fiscal year 2013 budget request, and to 
the reporting requirement for the B61 Life Extension Program in 
the Senate report within 3 months of enactment. In lieu of the 
JASON B61 study directed in the Senate report, if the NNSA's 
selected option for the B61 Life Extension Program includes any 
nuclear scope, the JASON group of scientific advisors shall 
submit an assessment by September 1, 2012, to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations on the extent to which the 
nuclear scope is needed to enhance the safety, security, and 
maintainability of a refurbished B61 and whether changes to the 
weapon will affect its long-term safety, security, reliability, 
and military characteristics.
      Maintenance and Operations.--The conferees support the 
guidance in the House and Senate reports to establish 
standardized direct reporting for facility and infrastructure 
maintenance costs at each site and to identify separate 
maintenance funding by site in the fiscal year 2014 budget 
request for Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities.
      Human Capital.--In order to meet human capital 
requirements for the NNSA sites and to support the NNSA's 
strategic efforts to strengthen its science, technology, 
management and engineering base, the NNSA should provide 
incentives for its management and operations contractors, 
including those at the production sites, to work with 
universities and other institutions of higher education to 
develop programs that support graduate research assistantships, 
implement educational programs that meet NNSA technical needs, 
and implement workforce development initiatives.

                           Weapons Activities

      The conference agreement provides $7,233,997,000 for 
Weapons Activities, instead of $7,091,661,000 as proposed by 
the House and $7,190,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Directed Stockpile Work.--The conference agreement 
provides $1,879,527,000 for Directed Stockpile Work. The NNSA 
is directed to use $175,000,000 within Stockpile Systems and 
$64,000,000 within Stockpile Services for surveillance 
activities. If the NNSA accomplishes the planned scope of 
surveillance activities more efficiently than estimated, up to 
10 percent of the $175,000,000 and $64,000,000 may be 
reallocated to other activities. The NNSA is directed to 
provide full funding within amounts provided for Management, 
Technology, and Production to implement JASON Surety Study 
recommendations to counter current and future threats to the 
stockpile. The NNSA is further directed to adhere to the 
guidance in the Senate report to provide a report on 
maintaining a pit manufacturing capability to meet stockpile 
needs to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
within 3 months of enactment of this Act.
      The conference agreement provides $223,562,000 for the 
B61 Life Extension Program, as requested. Of these funds, 
$134,137,000 shall not be made available for the B61 Life 
Extension Program until the NNSA submits to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations the outcome of the Phase 
6.2/2A design definition and cost study. The conferees remain 
concerned about the NNSA's ability to execute its planned scope 
for the B61 under an affordable life extension program that 
will meet the requirement to refurbish the first unit by 2017.
      The conference agreement provides $99,518,000 for W78 
Stockpile Systems as proposed by the House, which includes 
$37,087,000 for a life extension study of the W78 because of 
delays in commencing the Phase 6.1 study. The conference 
agreement provides $75,728,000 for W88 Stockpile Systems, which 
includes $30,000,000 to commence a conceptual study for a minor

      Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities.--The 
conference agreement provides $2,009,155,000 for Readiness in 
Technical Base and Facilities. No funding is provided for 
Institutional Site Support. Historically, the NNSA has used 
this funding line to mask underfunding in the request for 
individual site facility operations. More recently, it has 
pushed the costs of contractor pensions into this activity. 
Since the conference agreement fully funds operations and 
maintenance at each site and separately budgets for legacy 
pensions, this activity is no longer required. Infrastructure 
activities that are not site specific, such as headquarters 
contractor support and assessments, may be funded under Program 
Readiness.
      TRU Waste Facility.--The conferees provide $9,881,000 for 
Phase A of the TRU Waste Facility project, which consists of 
site infrastructure preparatory work. No Phase B activities are 
permitted until a project baseline is completed and provided to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.

atmospheric detonation detection. The request included 
$55,823,000 for legacy contractor pensions that are provided 
separately, as well as an additional $15,625,000 above program 
needs to meet anticipated growth in contractor defined benefit 
pension plan costs that are no longer needed.
      Nonproliferation and International Security.--The 
conference agreement provides $155,305,000 for Nonproliferation 
and International Security. Within this amount, the conferees 
provide $14,972,000 for the Global Initiative for Proliferation 
Prevention.
      Fissile Materials Disposition.--The conference agreement 
provides $685,386,000 for Fissile Materials Disposition. The 
conferees provide no construction funding for the Pit 
Disassembly and Conversion (PDCF) project because the NNSA has 
not completed a study of alternatives or a conceptual design 
report with a cost and schedule estimate that is required under 
Department of Energy guidance. Instead of the Senate 
requirement for an update of the costs for the PDCF and the MOX 
Fuel Fabrication Facility, the conferees direct the NNSA to 
provide a report on the status of plans to provide adequate 
plutonium feedstock to operate the MOX facility to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 3 months of 
enactment of this Act. The conferees direct the use of 
$20,500,000 in prior-year uncommitted balances within U.S. 
Plutonium Disposition to prepare plutonium feedstock at H-
Canyon in fiscal year 2012 and to identify funding for both H-
Canyon and ARIES within the fiscal year 2013 budget request.
      Global Threat Reduction Initiative.--The conference 
agreement provides $500,000,000 for the Global Threat Reduction 
Initiative. The conference agreement does not include House 
direction which restricts funding for Domestic Radiological 
Material Removal.

conference agreement does not include House language directing 
a transition to budgeting by ship system. Funding for Naval 
Reactors Operations and Maintenance is provided under the 
following control points starting in fiscal year 2012, in order 
to improve the transparency of the major multi-year initiatives 
and to distinguish the cost of operations and infrastructure 
from the cost of research and development.

      The conference agreement provides $410,000,000 for the 
Office of the Administrator, instead of $400,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $404,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement includes the requested amount 
of $6,000,000 for Weapons, $3,000,000 for Defense Nuclear 
Nonproliferation, and $1,000,000 for Naval Reactors to engage 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and further 
directs the engagement of Hispanic Serving Institutions and 
minority outreach at other colleges and universities.
      The conferees are concerned with overlap and duplication 
between the NNSA Office of Congressional Affairs, the 
Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Congressional Affairs, and 
the DOE Chief Financial Officer's External Coordination office 
(CFO ExCo). The conferees believe that the CFO ExCo can provide 
appropriate liaison support to the Committees on Appropriations 
and that one consolidated Congressional Affairs office can 
provide adequate support to the rest of the legislative branch. 
The conferees direct the Department to propose a consolidation 
of the NNSA Congressional Affairs functions into DOE's CFO 
ExCo, Office of Congressional Affairs, or a combination of 
both, within 60 days of enactment of this Act. Such 
consolidation should provide $1-2 million in budgetary savings.

directing a rulemaking.
      The conferees are aware of significant local concerns 
with the process for developing, reviewing and approving 
shoreline management plans at Smith Mountain Lake and Lake of 
the Ozarks. As the licensees develop and FERC reviews and 
approves shoreline management plans, both parties must not only 
ensure the continued unimpeded operation of the project, but 
also recognize the rights and concerns of private property 
owners and local communities. The parties should develop 
innovative and mutually agreeable solutions to resolve 
conflicts among project purposes and private property, which 
should be implemented without delay. The conferees note that 
several options already exist for resolving such conflicts--
such as realigning project boundaries, grandfathering non-
conforming structures, or conveying the disputed property--and 
that the removal of private structures should only be required, 
if at all, when all other options are inadequate. The conferees 
direct FERC to review the shoreline management plan process to 
identify any improvements that could be made to address local 
concerns at each stage of the process and to submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees a report detailing any 
administrative changes to be undertaken as well as any 
recommended legislative changes that may be necessary.

progress towards that end.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
proposed by the House prohibiting development of a proposal to 
expand the authorized uses of the Harbor Maintenance Trust 
Fund. The Senate proposed no similar provision. The conferees 
support language in the House report opposing the diversion of 
revenue from existing authorized purposes, namely maintenance

regulations implementing the ``Volcker Rule,'' and the U.S. 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission is expected to propose a

requires the Secretary of the Treasury to develop an annual 
Capital Investment Plan, to be submitted to the Committees on 
Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives 
within 30 days following submission of the President's annual

salaries and expenses of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax 
Administration as proposed by the House and the Senate.

    SPECIAL INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $41,800,000 for 
salaries and expenses of the Office of the Special Inspector 
General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) as 
proposed by the Senate, instead of $41,801,000 as proposed by 
the House.

                  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $110,788,000 for 
salaries and expenses of the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network (FinCEN), as proposed by the House and the Senate.
      The conferees reiterate the House and Senate language 
rejecting the Administration's proposed $3 million in 
reductions for State and local and intelligence community 
access to Bank Secrecy Act information and the Senate language 
rejecting the Administration's proposal to fund a portion of 
FinCEN's needs in fiscal year 2012 using proceeds from the 
Treasury Forfeiture Fund.

                        Treasury Forfeiture Fund

                              (RESCISSION)

      The conference agreement includes a rescission of 
$950,000,000 of the unobligated balances in the Treasury 
Forfeiture Fund.
      The funds collected, disbursed and rescinded out of the 
Treasury Forfeiture Fund (the Fund) are incidental to law 
enforcement priorities that led to the seizures and 
forfeitures. Disrupting and dismantling criminal organizations 
that pose the greatest threat to public safety and security is 
the highest priority of any law enforcement agency. The Fund 
can ensure resources are managed efficiently to cover the costs 
of an effective asset seizure and forfeiture program, including 
the costs of seizing, evaluating, inventorying, maintaining, 
protecting, advertising, forfeiting and disposing of property, 
but it must not be used to augment agency funding or to 
circumvent the appropriations process. Reliance on the Fund to 
offset the day-to-day operations, or to pay for new activities, 
creates an incentive to pursue cases suspected of high valued 
forfeitures rather than to target individuals or organizations 
that perpetrate the worst crimes against society.
      In addition to the Department of Treasury, the Department 
of Homeland Security is the other primary participant in the 
Fund since it does not have the authority or expertise to 
operate its own forfeiture fund. In fiscal year 2010, the 
Department of Homeland Security activities resulted in 
approximately 30 percent of the collections to the Fund and 
accounted for approximately 50 percent of the costs incurred by 
the Fund. In recent years, the available balances in the Fund 
have increased as the Federal Government has taken enforcement 
actions against large banks, increasing the surplus funding 
available. This surplus funding can either be used to fund law 
enforcement expenses to enhance forfeiture capabilities, be 
held in reserve or be rescinded. In considering the allocation 
of super surplus balances or rescission of resources in the 
Fund, the conferees direct the Administration not to use a 
formulaic approach where agencies that conduct seizures 
automatically get to spend or rescind surplus balances. The 
resources in the Fund should not be considered a ``bounty'' for 
the collecting agencies. Future proposed rescissions and super 
surplus spending requests should be based on programmatic need 
and funding priorities not a predetermined formula. Using a 
formulaic approach, such as distributing super surplus funds 
and rescissions in proportion to an agency's collections, would 
distort the role of the Fund.

                      Financial Management Service

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $217,805,000 for 
salaries and expenses of the Financial Management Service as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $216,617,000 as proposed by 
the House.

                                TITLE II

    EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE 
                               PRESIDENT

                     Compensation of the President

      The conference agreement provides $450,000 for 
compensation of the President as proposed by the Senate. The 
House proposed funding this mandatory cost as a general 
provision.

                            The White House

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $56,974,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the White House, instead of 
$55,513,000 as proposed by the House and $57,851,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees note that a lengthy clearance process at 
the Executive Office of the President (EOP) often delays 
submission of information requested by the Committees on 
Appropriations. The conferees expect EOP to respond to such 
requests in a timely manner because such information is 
critical to the Committees' ability to make informed budgetary 
decisions. In that regard, the conferees have encountered 
particular difficulty in receiving timely and comprehensive 
responses to requests for information from the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and therefore, direct EOP 
to remedy this issue. Language has also been included on this 
topic in the ONDCP section.

                 Executive Residence at the White House

                           OPERATING EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $13,425,000 for the 
Executive Residence at the White House, instead of $12,989,000 
as proposed by the House and $13,536,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.

                   White House Repair and Restoration

      The conference agreement provides $750,000 for repair, 
alteration and improvement of the Executive Residence at the 
White House, instead of $1,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$990,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                      Council of Economic Advisers

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $4,192,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Council of Economic Advisers as 
proposed by the Senate, instead of $3,982,000 as proposed by 
the House.

        National Security Council and Homeland Security Council

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $13,048,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the National Security Council and 
Homeland Security Council as proposed by the Senate, instead of 
$12,396,000 as proposed by the House.

                        Office of Administration

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $112,952,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Office of Administration, instead 
of $109,297,000 as proposed by the House and $114,908,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement includes 
$10,403,000, to remain available until expended, for 
information technology modernization.

                    Office of Management and Budget

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $89,456,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), instead of $82,575,000 as proposed by the House and 
$90,833,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees direct OMB to submit a report to the 
Committee within 120 days of enactment of this Act detailing 
current capabilities of and deficiencies in the Federal 
Government's core budgeting system.
      In light of increased efforts to identify government-wide 
efficiencies and anticipate the cost of major infrastructure 
projects, the Committee instructs OMB to examine Circular A-94. 
The Committee expects OMB's review of Circular A-94 to include 
an examination of the potential to incorporate life-cycle cost 
analysis. Moreover, this analysis should be as accurate, 
complete and reflective of the real costs and lifespans of 
materials as possible, including the use of material-specific 
discount rates and maintenance scheduled cost. OMB is directed 
to report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this 
Act on the status of reviewing Circular A-94. OMB should 
include appropriate experts in the field of life-cycle cost 
analysis, as well as appropriate industry experts and research 
centers.
      The conferees believe that agency staffing decisions 
should be based on agency workload and the level of funds made 
available, rather than pre-determined formulaic reductions. 
Decisions to backfill vacant positions should be based on the 
number of staff with the combination of skills and 
qualifications necessary to carry out the agency's mission 
within available funding levels. The OMB Director shall report 
in February annually to the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees on any agencies not adhering to the policies 
mentioned above.
      The conferees direct OMB to issue guidance, consistent 
with section 735 of division D of the Omnibus Appropriations 
Act, 2009, Public Law 111-8, and section 739(a)(1) of division 
D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-
161), and section 327 of the 2008 National Defense 
Authorization Act (Public Law 110-181), regarding use of direct 
conversions to contract out, in whole or in part, activities or 
functions last performed by Federal employees.
      The conferees expect OMB to honor the terms and 
conditions of appropriations Acts by not only reviewing 
reprogramming requests submitted to the Committees on 
Appropriations pursuant to the reprogramming conditions of this 
or any other Act, but also by reviewing agency activities for 
compliance with reprogramming conditions. With regard to 
section 608 of this Act, the conferees find that reimbursable 
agreements and other similar funding mechanisms utilized for 
the purpose of reallocating funding shall be considered a 
reprogramming of funds under such section. When determining the 
applicability of section 608, OMB and the agencies should 
consult with the Committees on Appropriations.

                 Office of National Drug Control Policy

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $24,500,000 for 
salaries and expenses of the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy (ONDCP), instead of $23,000,000 as proposed by the House 
and $26,125,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees note that a lengthy clearance process at 
the Executive Office of the President (EOP) often delays 
submission of information requested by the Committees on 
Appropriations. The conferees have encountered particular 
difficulty in receiving timely and comprehensive responses to 
requests for information from ONDCP. The conferees expect ONDCP 
to respond to such requests in a timely manner because such 
information is critical to the Committees' ability to make 
informed budgetary decisions. The conferees expect EOP to 
remedy this issue and improve ONDCP's responsiveness. Language 
has also been included on this topic under the White House 
Office account.

                     FEDERAL DRUG CONTROL PROGRAMS

             HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS PROGRAM

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides $238,522,000 for the 
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program as proposed by 
the House and the Senate.

                  OTHER FEDERAL DRUG CONTROL PROGRAMS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides $105,550,000 for Other 
Federal Drug Control Programs, instead of $101,978,000 as 
proposed by the House and $105,950,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The agreement allocates funds among specific programs 
as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign.................              $0
Drug-Free Communities Program...........................      92,000,000
    (Training...........................................      2,000,000)
Drug court training and technical assistance............       1,400,000
Anti-Doping activities..................................       9,000,000
World Anti-Doping Agency (U.S. membership dues).........       1,900,000
Discretionary Grants as authorized by PL 109-469,              1,250,000
 section 1105...........................................
Performance Measures Development........................               0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The conference agreement provides no funding for the 
media campaign, as proposed by the House and the Senate. The 
conferees are supportive of a plan to preserve the substantial 
federal investment in anti-drug messaging and direct ONDCP to 
report to the Committees on Appropriations on the planned uses 
of the remaining unobligated balances for the media campaign 
not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act.
      The conferees expect grant funding provided under ONDCP's 
Other Federal Drug Control Programs be awarded through a 
competitive process.
      The conferees are troubled by ONDCP's decision-making in 
the management of unobligated balances. The President's budget 
proposed rescinding $11,328,000 from the Counterdrug Technology 
Assessment Center. Despite this, ONDCP obligated $6,083,361 of 
those balances. The conferees believe that ONDCP's decision to 
obligate funds that the President's budget proposed to rescind 
demonstrates an inability to effectively manage their funds.

   Integrated, Efficient and Effective Uses of Information Technology

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides $5,000,000 for this 
activity as proposed by the House, instead of no funds as 
proposed by the Senate. The conferees direct that information 
technology reform initiatives shall not be a substitute for 
consideration of agency requirements and the Executive Office 
of the President shall keep the Committees on Appropriations 
informed of changes in information technology spending plans.

                          Unanticipated Needs

      The conference agreement provides $988,000 for 
unanticipated needs as proposed by the Senate. The House 
provided no funding for this activity.

                  Special Assistance to the President

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $4,328,000 for salaries 
and expenses to enable the Vice President to provide special 
assistance to the President as proposed by the Senate, instead 
of $4,322,000 as proposed by the House.

                Official Residence of the Vice President

                           OPERATING EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides $307,000 for operating 
expenses for the official residence of the Vice President as 
proposed by the House and the Senate.

                     Appropriated to the President

             (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS AND RESCISSIONS)

      The conference agreement provides the following 
Administrative Provisions under this title:
      Section 201 provides transfer authority among various 
Executive Office of the President accounts.
      Section 202 requires OMB to submit a report on the 
implementation of Executive Order 13563 relating to improving 
regulation and regulatory review.
      Section 203 requires OMB to report on the costs of 
implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (Public Law 111-203).
      Section 204 requires a detailed narrative and financial 
plan for Office of National Drug Control Policy funds.
      Section 205 provides transfer authority among Office of 
National Drug Control Policy accounts.
      Section 206 governs reprogramming of Office of National 
Drug Control Policy funds.
      Section 207 rescinds $5,244,639 in unobligated prior year 
balances from the Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center.
      Section 208 rescinds $359,958 in unobligated prior year 
balances from Other Federal Drug Control Programs for a chronic 
users study and $5,723,403 in unobligated prior year balances 
from Other Federal Drug Control Programs for a national youth 
anti-drug media campaign.
      Section 209 extends the availability of funds under the 
Partnership Fund for Program Integrity Innovation. The 
conferees do not recommend additional funding for the 
Partnership Fund in fiscal year 2012 and direct the 
Administration to continue to leverage funds provided in fiscal 
year 2010 to continue the initiative during fiscal years 2012 
and 2013.

                               TITLE III

waste, fraud, and abuse in federal spending. Within 90 days of

and planned spending.

                   Securities and Exchange Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $1,321,000,000 for the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), instead of 
$1,185,000,000 as proposed by the House and $1,407,483,130 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement provides that 
$1,321,000,000 be derived from offsetting collections resulting 
in no net appropriation.
      The conference agreement provides that the SEC Office of 
Inspector General shall receive no less than $6,795,000 as 
proposed by the Senate, instead of $6,790,000 as proposed by 
the House.
      The conferees do not adopt the Senate designation of 
$483,130 specifically for the strengthening of the acquisition 
workforce. However, while not designating funding, the 
Committee remains concerned about the SEC's acquisition 
processes and expects the SEC to dedicate sufficient resources 
to strengthening the agency's capacity and capabilities of the 
acquisition workforce.
      The conferees remain seriously concerned with the SEC's 
lack of judgment in its past leasing practices, most notably 
the mismanagement of the agency's Constitution Center lease. 
The conferees are unconvinced that the SEC's efforts to reform 
their leasing practices have fully addressed the problems. The 
agency's leasing and budgetary recording practices over the 
last 20 years of independent leasing authority have led the SEC 
to experience budget deficiencies. The conferees consider this 
unacceptable and expect the SEC to carefully evaluate all 
prospective leases and renewals of existing leases going 
forward in relation to the budget resources. The conferees are 
aware of the SEC's arrangement with the General Services 
Administration, which the conferees believe is a good first 
step. The conferees intend to closely monitor how the SEC 
exercises its leasing authority to ensure that the SEC has 
adequately reformed its leasing practices.
      The conferees are also highly concerned about the 
unauthorized destruction of documents by the SEC which spanned 
a decade and remained ongoing even after the National Archives 
and Records Administration asked for an explanation. The 
preservation of agency documents is critical to the record 
keeping of every agency and Federal rules have been established 
in the interest of transparency and disclosure. As the agency 
tasked with monitoring companies' disclosures, this latest 
chapter of mismanagement at the SEC contravenes the agency's 
own mission and distracts SEC management from focusing on the 
critical work of protecting investors.
      Due to the above concerns, the conferees direct the SEC 
to provide the House and Senate Appropriations Committees with 
corrective action reports, submitted to the SEC Inspector 
General, related to lease agreements and document destruction 
no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act.

salaries and expenses of the Selective Service System as 
proposed by the Senate, instead of $23,620,000 as proposed by 
the House.

salaries and expenses account of the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), instead of $422,296,000 as proposed by 
the House and $404,202,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Of the amount provided under this heading, $245,000,000 
is for the operating expenses of the SBA and $172,348,000 is

    Total, non-credit programs..........................     172,348,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The conferees direct that the SBA shall not reduce these 
non-credit programs from the amounts specified above and the 
SBA shall not merge any of the non-credit programs without 
advance written approval from the Committees on Appropriations.
      Although set-aside funding for the Emerging Leaders 
program is not specified, the conferees note that in prior 
years SBA derived funds for the Emerging Leaders program from 
base resources in the Salaries and Expenses account.
      The conferees adopt Senate report language regarding 
veterans' business outreach centers.

            TITLE I--DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

            Office of the Secretary and Executive Management

      A total of $133,159,000 is provided for ``Office of the 
Secretary and Executive Management.'' Not to exceed $51,000 of 
this funding shall be for official reception and representation 
expenses, including $17,000 for the Office of Policy to support 
Visa Waiver Program negotiations in Washington, DC, and for 
other international activities. This Act also includes a 
provision requiring that funds made available for ``Immediate 
Office of the Secretary'' and ``Immediate Office of the Deputy 
Secretary'' shall be used to pay costs associated with use of 
government aircraft by DHS personnel in support of official 
travel of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary.
      The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immediate Office of the Secretary......................       $5,000,000
Immediate Office of the Deputy Secretary...............        1,918,000

    Total, Office of the Secretary and Executive             133,159,000
     Management........................................
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Biometric Exit

      Congress has long sought the Department's determination 
on the path forward for implementing biometric exit, and the 
conferees have asked for a detailed plan to include costs. On 
October 17, 2011, the Secretary sent a letter to the chairmen 
and ranking members of relevant appropriations and 
authorization committees outlining general concerns about 
implementation, particularly the cost of such an undertaking, 
and proposing legislative changes to existing law. While the 
Secretary states, ``DHS remains committed to introducing a 
biometric component to the exit process'', the letter does not 
constitute a detailed plan for implementation. Therefore, 
statutory language is included in this Act withholding funds 
from the Office of the Secretary until the plan is submitted, 
to include identifying associated costs.

                 Office of Counternarcotics Enforcement

      A total of $1,800,000 is provided for ``Office of 
Counternarcotics Enforcement'' (CNE), which is available until 
March 30, 2012, to continue CNE operations while the Department 
conducts an orderly termination of the Office. This funding may 
be transferred to the Office of Policy, which is expected to 
assume policy development and coordination responsibilities 
currently assigned to CNE, and any such funds transferred will 
be available until September 30, 2012. The Assistant Secretary 
for Policy shall provide, as part of the requirement for an 
expenditure plan for the Office of Policy, a detailed 
description of any such transfers.
      The termination of CNE reflects the need to streamline 
Executive Branch efforts to carry out the counternarcotics 
enforcement mission. Allowing the funds to be transferred to 
the Office of Policy will ensure the Department can integrate 
the existing CNE policy planning and coordination activities 
within the broader Department enforcement and security missions 
and make optimum use of the existing planning and operations 
elements of its key law enforcement agencies. It will also 
enable the Department, through the Office of Policy, to 
coordinate DHS policy and programs that are carried out with 
the Office of National Drug Control Policy and other Federal, 
State, local, and international government partners. As CNE 
will be terminated, the GAO is neither required to submit an 
assessment of progress in implementing OIG recommendations 
concerning CNE, nor to assess DHS counternarcotics 
coordination, as required in the House report.

                           Expenditure Plans

      The Department shall prepare expenditure plans for fiscal 
year 2012 for the agencies funded under this appropriation as 
specified in the Senate report, with the exception of CNE which 
is being terminated. The plans shall be submitted to the 
Committees no later than March 30, 2012. The plan for the 
Office of Policy shall list planned projects for each sub-
office within the Office of Policy, with their associated 
funding and staffing requirements. In addition, should the 
funds made available for either counternarcotics or risk 
management and analysis functions be transferred to the Office 
of Policy, as permitted by this Act, those resources should be 
delineated in the manner specified for each sub-office in the 
expenditure plan, including missions, planned expenditures, and 
activities. In addition to expenditure plans described above, 
the Act requires additional fiscal year 2012 expenditure plans, 
including a plan for TSA passenger screening and checked 
baggage technology programs, the Office of Infrastructure 
Protection and the National Cyber Security Division, the Office 
of Health Affairs, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      The Department has failed to deliver a number of 
statutorily required fiscal year 2011 expenditure plans, or has 
delivered them unacceptably late. The Department is expected to 
comply with Congressional direction and demonstrate the 
priority it places on these programs and submit required 
expenditure plans as directed and in accordance with the 
specified deadlines. The Department should already have these 
expenditure plans as part of its routine management activities; 
therefore, it is notable, and entirely inexcusable, that the 
Department did not, for example, submit fiscal year 2011 
expenditure plans for the Office of Policy or US-VISIT--and it 
is well past the end of the fiscal year.

                           Quarterly Reports

      The Department is directed to continue submitting the 
quarterly Secure Border Initiative (SBI) reports, now to be 
called the Border Security Status Report. The new reports shall 
continue to include all performance metrics and resource data 
from past reports in their current format, with the exception 
that they no longer should include resource data on SBI total 
budget obligations and outlays and budget execution reports. 
That information already is contained in the annual Border 
Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology expenditure 
plan. Additionally, the Department shall include the following 
in the report: (a) estimates of the impact of programs (such as 
Operation Streamline) that are intended to reduce the rate of 
recidivism of illegal border crossers; (b) for ports of entry, 
the maritime domain, and between the ports of entry: (1) 
estimates of total attempted border crossings; (2) the rate of 
apprehension of attempted border crossings; and (3) the inflow 
into the United States of illegal entrants that evade 
apprehension; and (c) data on the subsequent enforcement 
actions associated with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
apprehensions, such as voluntary return, expedited removal, 
transfer to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, 
transfer for criminal prosecution, Mexican Interior 
Repatriation Program, and other categories necessary to provide 
an accurate accounting of such actions.
      The Department is directed to submit quarterly reports on 
operations in a timely manner, including the overdue SBI 
Quarterly Status reports, the new Border Security Status 
Reports, the Secure Communities Quarterly Reports, and the 
Detention and Removal Operations Quarterly Reports. These 
reports present critical operational statistics, readily 
available to the Department, which are necessary for 
appropriate oversight. However, in many instances, the 
Department has failed to provide these reports in accordance 
with specified deadlines, with submissions being so late that 
these reports limit the Committees' ability to ensure timely 
oversight.

                          Working Capital Fund

      The Department shall include a separate justification in 
its fiscal year 2013 budget request for the Working Capital 
Fund (WCF), as specified in the House report. This 
justification shall identify and explain cross-cutting 
initiatives or activities that benefit multiple organizations 
and are not included in the WCF. The Department shall notify 
the Committees promptly of any changes made to the WCF during 
the fiscal year and should not use the WCF to support 
activities for which funding requests were previously 
disapproved by the Committees.

            Official Reception and Representation Allowances

      The Department is directed to submit quarterly reports to 
the Committees listing obligations for all DHS Reception and 
Representation Expenses by purpose and dollar amount, at a 
level of detail provided in fiscal year 2011, or in greater 
detail if that is required to explain how funds were used. The 
Department shall review the level of reception and 
representation allowances for its agencies and components to 
assure they align with missions and responsibilities and submit 
any proposed changes as part of the fiscal year 2013 budget 
request.

           Coordination of Federal Chemical Security Efforts

      The Department is expected to execute a Memorandum of 
Agreement between the National Protection and Programs 
Directorate and the Coast Guard regarding harmonization of 
chemical security responsibilities established by Chemical 
Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards regulations and Maritime 
Transportation Security Act regulatory programs no later than 
March 30, 2012. The Deputy Secretary is directed to submit 
reports on chemical security efforts to the Committees on 
Appropriations as directed in the Senate report. However, the 
reports shall be submitted on a semi-annual basis instead of 
quarterly with the first report due no later than March 30, 
2012.

           Federally Funded Research and Development Centers

      The Department is directed to report semi-annually to the 
Committees on Appropriations on projects tasked to Federally 
Funded Research and Development Centers as directed in the 
Senate report and to immediately submit reports for fiscal 
years 2010 and 2011, which are unacceptably late.

                             Cybersecurity

      Both the Department of Homeland Security and the National 
Guard have capabilities, in conjunction with the private 
sector, to respond to issues related to cybersecurity. In an 
effort to improve coordination between the Federal government 
and the private sector and to exploit and enhance the 
capabilities of both sectors, the conferees direct the Deputy 
Secretary of DHS, jointly with the Deputy Secretary of Defense, 
to submit a report to the Committees no later than May 1, 2012, 
regarding the capabilities for a coordinated response to a 
cyber attack. The report shall evaluate the costs and benefits 
of deploying the National Guard, or other equivalent civilian 
teams, to supplement current abilities to prevent and recover 
from a cyber attack. The report shall also include: a 
description of current activities of both DHS and the National 
Guard related to the deployment of teams to help prevent or 
recover from a cyber attack; the authorities of each 
Department, including the boundaries of such authorities and 
statutory changes that may be necessary to use joint 
authorities in a domestic response; a description of training 
and education efforts; and a discussion of how critical 
relationships can be established across the agencies to fulfill 
cybersecurity responsibilities.

                       Freedom of Information Act

      The Privacy Officer is directed to report to the 
Committees on Appropriations no later than 30 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act on measures put in place to 
implement the OIG's recommendations to fix problems identified 
with the Department's Freedom of Information (FOIA) activities 
(OIG-11-67), including whether and how recent adjustments to 
DHS FOIA policies and procedures have improved the processing 
of inquiries, such as decreasing wait times for approval of 
significant requests.

                     Departmental Integrity Efforts

      Since Congress initiated significant increases in funding 
for border security and immigration enforcement in 2005, CBP 
has hired more than 19,176 new employees, a 46 percent 
increase, and ICE has hired over 4,747 new personnel, a 31 
percent increase. Since 2007, in an effort to reduce the 
potential for increased corruption, the Congress has provided 
over $11,000,000 more than Presidents have requested for 
program integrity efforts. It is expected that the President 
will join Congress in the effort to get ahead of this problem 
by including increased resources in the fiscal year 2013 budget 
request.

              Office of the Under Secretary for Management

      A total of $235,587,000 is provided for ``Office of the 
Under Secretary for Management,'' of which not to exceed $2,500 
shall be for official reception and representation expenses. 
Within this amount, $5,000,000 shall be available until 
September 30, 2016, solely for costs of facilities alteration 
and improvement, tenant improvements, and relocations to 
consolidate DHS headquarters operations at the Nebraska Avenue 
Complex.
      Pursuant to section 560, a total of $55,979,000 is 
provided for ``Office of the Under Secretary for Management'' 
for costs associated with headquarters consolidation and 
mission support consolidation. These funds shall be prioritized 
towards the completion of phase I of the headquarters 
consolidation project at the St. Elizabeths site in order to 
avoid further increases to cost and schedule. The Under 
Secretary shall submit an expenditure plan no later than 90 
days after the date of enactment of this Act detailing how 
these funds will be allocated, including a revised schedule and 
cost estimates for headquarters consolidation. Quarterly 
briefings are required on headquarters and mission support 
consolidation activities, including any deviation from the 
expenditure plan.
      The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
follows:

                        Polar Icebreaker Program

      None of the requested funding is provided for a new study 
of the need for Coast Guard icebreakers. Given the findings of 
previous reports and analyses of this issue, the Department is 
urged to develop a concept of operations and resource plan to 
meet national icebreaking needs, including leveraging expertise 
within the Coast Guard and Science and Technology Directorate. 
The Under Secretary shall brief the Committees on the status of 
this plan no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act.

         Comprehensive and Quarterly Acquisition Status Reports

      Senate Report 111-31 directed the submission of quarterly 
acquisition reports for major acquisitions. The quarterly 
reports for fiscal year 2010 were not submitted to Congress at 
the end of each quarter as directed, but instead all four 
quarterly reports were combined into one report and submitted 
on April 12, 2011--over six months after the end of fiscal year 
2010. This lack of responsiveness is unacceptable, especially 
since the information requested is already required by the 
Department as part of its own acquisition oversight process.
      In order to obtain the information necessary for in-depth 
congressional oversight, statutory language is included in this 
Act under ``Office of the Under Secretary for Management'' that 
requires a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report to be 
included as part of the submission of the President's fiscal 
year 2013 budget, with quarterly updates to be submitted 30 
days after the completion of each quarter. The requirements for 
both reports are addressed below.
      The Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report shall include 
programs identified for Major Acquisition Oversight as defined 
in the Department memorandum titled ``Department of Homeland 
Security Major Acquisition Oversight List'' dated January 25, 
2011, and programs that have been classified for major 
acquisition oversight subsequent to the referenced memorandum.
      The Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report shall include 
for each major acquisition:
      1. A narrative description to include current gaps and 
shortfalls, the capabilities to be fielded, and the number of 
planned increments and/or units;
      2. Acquisition Review Board (or other board designated to 
review the acquisition) status of each acquisition, including 
the current acquisition phase, the date of the last review and 
a listing of the required documents that have been reviewed 
with the dates reviewed and/or approved;
      3. The most current approved Acquisition Program Baseline 
(to include project schedules and events);
      4. A comparison of the original Acquisition Program 
Baseline, the current Acquisition Program Baseline, and the 
current estimate;
      5. Whether or not an Independent Verification and 
Validation has been implemented, with an explanation for the 
decision and a summary of any findings;
      6. A rating of cost risk, schedule risk, and technical 
risk associated with the program (including narrative 
descriptions and mitigation actions);
      7. Contract status (to include earned value management 
data as applicable);
      8. A life-cycle cost of the acquisition, and time basis 
for the estimate;
      9. A planned procurement schedule, including the best 
estimate of the annual cost and increments/units to be procured 
annually until procurement is complete;
      10. A table delineated by appropriation that provides 
(for prior years; past year; current year; budget year; budget 
year plus one; budget year plus two; budget year plus three; 
budget year plus four and beyond; and total cost) the actual or 
estimated appropriations, obligations, unobligated authority, 
and planned expenditures;
      11. The reason for any significant changes (from the 
previous comprehensive report) in acquisition quantity, cost, 
or schedule;
      12. Key Events/Milestones from the prior fiscal year; and
      13. Key Events/Milestones for the current fiscal year.
      Quarterly reports shall include:
      1. An updated status report on any major acquisition for 
which there has been an approved or a new acquisition program 
baseline, a new acquisition decision memorandum, or where there 
has been significant deviation from the prior report with 
respect to acquisition cost, quantity, or schedule (a 
significant change is any deviation in cost or quantity that 
exceeds eight percent or any change in schedule that exceeds 
six months).
      2. A table depicting the title of the program, quantity 
and cost based on the original Acquisition Program Baseline, 
quantity and cost based on the most current acquisition program 
baseline, the quantity and cost of the most current estimate, 
and the explanation for any change in quantity and cost from 
prior reports.
      3. If applicable, a copy of the acquisition decision 
memorandum, together with a copy of the Letter of Assessment 
signed by the Director of Testing and Evaluation.
      The requirements described under this heading shall 
replace those included in Senate Reports 111-31 and 112-74.

                Office of the Chief Procurement Officer

      A total of $78,000,000 is provided for ``Office of the 
Chief Procurement Officer'' (OCPO), including an increase of 
$3,403,000 to enhance DHS acquisition capabilities.
      OCPO shall brief the Committees no later than February 
15, 2012, on its acquisition workforce initiative, as directed 
in the House and Senate reports, including: a baseline analysis 
of its workforce and requirements used in defining the gaps in 
DHS acquisition capacity and determining the skill sets and 
positions needed to fill those gaps; risks of not filling 
needed positions; and the long-term strategy to close 
competency gaps. In cases where component requests for the 
Federal Acquisition Workforce Initiative were not funded at the 
requested amount, components should use existing appropriations 
and fee authority to hire and train highly qualified 
acquisition personnel for which there are clearly defined 
requirements.

               Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer

      A total of $39,337,000 is provided for ``Office of the 
Chief Human Capital Officer'' (OCHCO), including an increase of 
$688,000 for salaries and expenses to enhance the Balanced 
Workforce Program Office, workforce training, and leadership 
development. A total of $14,172,000 is included for the Human 
Resources Information Technology program.

  Secretary's Efficiency Review and the Balanced Workforce Initiative

      The Under Secretary for Management and the Chief Human 
Capital Officer are directed to brief the Committees on 
Appropriations no later than February 15, 2012, on the results 
of the Secretary's Efficiency Review and the ongoing Balanced 
Workforce Initiative. The briefing should cover, by priority, 
efficiencies identified through the Review and progress in 
implementing them; components and specific procurements where 
additional oversight personnel are required and where they are 
being or are planned to be deployed; and how reforms in 
headquarters structure and function are improving support and 
management for Department field operations. The briefing should 
cover the status of the ongoing Balanced Workforce Initiative; 
provide the most current list of positions DHS plans to convert 
from contractor to Federal positions, and progress against that 
list; and discuss estimated savings from that effort and the 
methodology used to calculate those savings.
      The Department is directed to arrange for an independent 
evaluation of its efficiency review and provide the results to 
the Committees on Appropriations no later than 30 days after 
its completion.

                 Office of the Chief Financial Officer

      A total of $50,860,000 is provided for ``Office of the 
Chief Financial Officer.'' The amount provided includes a 
decrease from the budget request of $11,000,000 for the 
Transformation and Systems Consolidation (TASC) project due to 
the Department's decision to cancel acquisition plans for TASC.

                      Annual Budget Justifications

      Both Senate and House reports call for improvements in 
the content, detail, and format of annual Congressional Budget 
Justifications submitted by the Department and its components. 
It is essential to the work of Congress that such information 
be timely, accurate, concise, and organized in such a way that 
facilitates the comparison of current with proposed 
appropriations for programs, projects, and activities. 
Developing comprehensive and clear justifications not only 
disciplines the planning and resource allocation process but 
could also reduce the need for ancillary budget explanations 
and program and project expenditure plans and the associated 
withholding of funding necessitated by the Department's failure 
to submit these in a complete or timely manner.
      Current budget presentation materials, while lengthy and 
containing a wide range of program data, do not uniformly 
provide the information the Committees need to assess the 
impact of the funding being proposed, how it compares to prior 
year actual appropriations and funded FTE levels, or to 
evaluate activities proposed to be continued, terminated, or 
initiated. Terminology is sometimes ambiguous, or used 
inconsistently, including terms such as interagency transfers 
or ``transfers'' between PPAs; adjustments to base; 
``authorized'' rather than ``funded'' position and FTE levels; 
or unspecified references to ``technical adjustments'' or 
``administrative savings.''
      Current services descriptions of agency activity and 
accomplishments, while providing a context for agency 
operations and budgets, should be consolidated and presented 
separately from the core justification for appropriations.
      To address the concerns described above, the Chief 
Financial Officer is directed to ensure that fiscal year 2013 
budget justifications for classified and unclassified budgets 
of all Department components are submitted on February 6, 2012, 
concurrent with the President's budget submission to Congress. 
The justifications shall include:
      1. Detailed data and explanatory descriptions for each 
appropriations request, and for each PPA reflected in the table 
accompanying this statement, including offices that have been 
identified as PPAs. Information regarding actual and planned 
accomplishments should be in quantifiable terms and demonstrate 
a direct relationship to funding;
      2. Tables that reflect actual and estimated funding by 
PPA for fiscal years 2011 and 2012; identify each increase, 
decrease, transfer, and staffing change proposed in fiscal year 
2013; and explain such year-to-year changes in terms that are 
clear and unambiguous, and exclude nonspecific terms such as 
``technical adjustment'' or ``administrative savings'' unless 
accompanied by a detailed explanation. To establish a common 
baseline reference, the fiscal year 2012 discretionary data 
shall tie to the fiscal year 2012 discretionary total in the 
table accompanying this statement or have a table identifying 
each change. Explanations of adjustments to base funding, 
whether increases or decreases, should be specific, and 
programmatic changes and initiatives should be clearly 
identified and justified;
      3. For each PPA that is comprised of acquisition and 
procurement activity, the justification should address all 
proposed spending using a zero-based budget description;
      4. Information by appropriations account and PPA on all 
reimbursable agreements and significant uses of the Economy Act 
for each fiscal year;
      5. A detailed table identifying the last year that 
authorizing legislation was enacted into law for each PPA, 
including the amount of the authorization and the appropriation 
in the last year of authorization;
      6. The text and citation of all Department appropriations 
provisions enacted to date that are permanent law;
      7. Explanations and justifications for all proposed 
legislative language changes, whether they are new or amend 
existing law, whether they are substantive or technical in 
nature, with an annotated comparison of proposed versus 
existing language; and
      8. A report on the status of overdue Committee reports, 
plans, and briefings for each of fiscal years 2011 and 2012.
      Consistent with section 874 of Public Law 107-296, the 
Department shall submit a Future Years Homeland Security 
Program budget as part of the fiscal year 2013 budget 
justification, reflecting anticipated spending for fiscal years 
2013-2017. It shall be in unclassified form so as to be 
accessible to the general public.

                    Financial Management Improvement

      The Office of the Chief Financial Officer is directed to 
keep the Committees fully informed on financial management 
improvement plans for the Department, as required in the House 
and Senate reports, including any centralized or decentralized 
solutions that would fulfill the objectives originally set for 
the TASC project and any plans for integrating the Department's 
remaining management systems for acquisitions and assets. 
Balances remain available for TASC from prior-year 
appropriations, which may be obligated for TASC closeout costs 
or obligated for additional financial management plans in 
fiscal year 2012 if a new strategy is approved by the DHS 
Acquisition Review Board and if the Department completes an 
independent evaluation to validate that strategy prior to 
obligation of any of these funds. In order to maintain other 
Department-wide management initiatives, $5,000,000 is rescinded 
from unobligated balances related to this effort. This 
rescission is from funds appropriated in fiscal years 2005 and 
2006.

                Nuclear Detection Technology Acquisition

      The Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation is directed 
to undertake an evaluation of the Department's current approach 
to acquisition of technology and systems for its nuclear 
detection mission, which is presently conducted through the 
Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and an analysis of 
alternative approaches, including assigning acquisition 
responsibilities and resources to component agencies that own 
and operate the technology. The evaluation shall include a 
cost-benefit analysis of the relevant options. The results of 
this review shall be submitted to the Committees no later than 
120 days after the date of enactment of this Act.

                               User Fees

      The Department is directed to continue submitting user 
fee collections and balances on a semi-annual basis rather than 
quarterly, including steps taken to mitigate any shortfalls in 
collections.

                Office of the Chief Information Officer

      A total of $257,300,000 is provided for ``Office of the 
Chief Information Officer.''
      The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as

                    ____________________________________________________
    Total, Office of the Chief Information Officer......    $257,300,000

                         Salaries and Expenses

      A total of $105,500,000 is provided for ``Salaries and 
Expenses.'' Within the funding provided for this appropriation, 
$253,000 is provided to strengthen acquisition workforce 
capabilities.

                 Infrastructure and Security Activities

      A total of $69,000,000 is provided for ``Infrastructure 
and Security Activities.'' The multi-year investment and 
management plan shall include details on how the activities 
under this heading are to be funded.

                         Data Center Migration

      Section 556 provides $70,000,000 for data center 
migration. The CIO shall notify the Committees on the initial 
allocation of this funding within 45 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act. The CIO shall continue to provide 
quarterly briefings to the Committees on the progress of data 
center development and migration. Given that component data 
center migration schedules may shift during the course of the 
fiscal year based on changing circumstances and priorities the 
general provision includes authority for the Secretary to 
transfer funds made available for data center migration, as 
necessary, among components based on revised schedules and 
priorities with 15 days prior notice to the Committees.

                        Analysis and Operations

      A total of $338,068,000 is provided for ``Analysis and 
Operations,'' of which $141,521,000 shall remain available 
until September 30, 2013. No funding is provided for the C2 Gap 
Filler Technology initiative. The Department's Chief 
Intelligence Officer is directed to submit an expenditure plan 
no later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act 
to the Committees, as required in the Senate report. Additional 
information on funding levels and reporting requirements are 
detailed in the classified annex accompanying this statement.

                 State and Local Fusion Center Program

      The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) is directed 
to develop robust programmatic justification to better identify 
and quantify the Federal benefit and return on investment from 
the State and Local Fusion Center (SLFC) program. I&A shall 
submit such justification at the time the President's fiscal 
year 2013 budget is submitted and provide semi-annual briefings 
on the fusion center program, in lieu of a quarterly reporting 
requirement in the House report and quarterly briefing 
requirements in the Senate report. The first briefing shall 
occur no later than February 15, 2012, conform to the 
requirements outlined in the Senate report, and include metrics 
to judge the success of the SLFC program.

                      Office of Inspector General

      A total of $141,000,000 is provided for ``Office of 
Inspector General,'' including $117,000,000 in direct 
appropriations and $24,000,000 transferred from the Disaster 
Relief Fund (DRF) for audits and investigations related to that 
funding. The OIG is directed to submit a plan for expenditure 
of all funds no later than 30 days after the date of enactment 
of this Act, in lieu of the 90 day requirement in the Senate 
report. The Office is further directed to notify the Committees 
of all transfers from the DRF by including them in the 
Department of Homeland Security Chief Financial Officer's 
monthly budget execution reports submitted to the Committees, 
in lieu of the 15-day advance notification required in the 
Senate report. These reports shall satisfy the requirements for 
notification of DRF transfers under section 503 of this Act.

                        Integrity Investigations

      Within the funding provided for this appropriation, an 
increase of no less than $4,000,000 is provided for integrity 
investigations. In lieu of the 45-day requirement in the Senate 
report OIG is directed to submit, no later than 30 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act, a plan for expenditure of 
integrity oversight funds in coordination with CBP and ICE. 
This plan shall be submitted along with the overall expenditure 
plan for OIG.

          TITLE II--SECURITY, ENFORCEMENT, AND INVESTIGATIONS

                   U.S. Customs and Border Protection

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      A total of $8,680,118,000 is provided for ``Salaries and 
Expenses.'' The request for Headquarters, Management, and 
Administration is reduced by $3,452,000 for the Acquisition 
Workforce Initiative, the data center migration funds, and 
$10,400,000 in additional administrative savings. Data center 
migration is funded through a general provision. The funding 
level also reflects an additional $5,000,000 for integrity 
programs.
      Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation is 
funded at $2,484,235,000, including the following for requested 
initiatives: $44,407,000 for the adjustment for law enforcement 
journeyman pay costs; $86,109,000 for prior year annualization 
of 963 CBP officers; $20,692,000 for an additional 300 CBP 
officers at new and expanded ports of entry; $2,212,000 for 
additional canine units at ports of entry; and $7,499,000 to 
expand the Immigration Advisory Program to four additional 
locations. Funds provided for the following critical operations 
include increases above the request:
      $74,557,000 for International Cargo Screening, including 
$3,287,000 for the Secure Freight Initiative and $71,270,000 
for the Container Security Initiative;
      $41,400,000 for Automated Targeting Systems which will 
enable enhancements to one of the Department's most effective 
counter-terrorism and security capabilities;
      $51,950,000 for the National Targeting Center, including 
the requested increase of $16,400,000 for 45 new CBP officers 
and 20 new analysts, as well as an additional $5,000,000 to 
ensure operations are appropriately staffed; and
      $151,298,000 for trade compliance and enforcement efforts 
in the Office of Trade, including an increase of $5,000,000 for 
personnel, enhanced targeting, and strategy development.
      The enacted funding level has been adjusted to reflect 
the passage of Public Law 112-42, which removed the exemption 
from COBRA fee collections for certain travelers. This will 
result in additional revenue of $110,000,000 annually and 
$83,000,000 in fiscal year 2012, to support CBP inspection 
services. Such revenue is to directly support 21,186 CBP 
officers.
      Border Security and Control between Ports of Entry is 
funded at $3,619,604,000, which reflects an increase of 
$191,459,000 for prior year annualization of 1,000 additional 
agents along with support personnel funded in the fiscal year 
2010 Border Security Supplemental, as well as $184,717,000 for 
the adjustment for law enforcement journeyman pay costs, as 
requested. This overall level will support a Border Patrol 
agent force of 21,370 (compared to 12,349 in fiscal year 2006), 
including 2,212 deployed to the Northern Border and 18,415 
deployed to the Southwest Border.
      The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
follows:

        Total, CBP Salaries and Expenses................  $8,680,118,000

                        Revised Budget Structure

      CBP is directed to propose a subdivision of the 
Inspections, Trade, and Travel Facilitation at Ports PPA and 
the Border Security and Control PPA within the ``Salaries and 
Expenses'' appropriation in conjunction with the budget 
submission for fiscal year 2013. At funding levels of 
$2,484,235,000 and $3,530,994,000, respectively, the PPAs and 
the accompanying budget justifications have not provided 
adequate detail for appropriate oversight of these funds. CBP 
shall brief the Committees on its proposed structure prior to 
submission of its budget request. For instance, each PPA could 
be subdivided into budget activities, such as: officer or agent 
pay, civilian pay, equipment, operations and maintenance, and 
procurement. CBP should provide a crosswalk from the 2012 
budget structure to the new 2013 budget structure so that the 
Committees can easily compare funding levels for the activities 
within these new PPAs.
      Further, CBP is directed to comply with the direction 
included under the heading ``Office of Chief Financial 
Officer'' with respect to improved budget justifications.

                 Financial Plan by Office Requirements

      CBP is directed to provide the financial plan by office 
as required by the Senate report. In addition, CBP shall 
include its estimate by office with the budget justification 
material for fiscal year 2013.

       Staffing and Fees Supporting CBP Port of Entry Operations

      CBP is directed to submit its staffing model for Field 
Operations no later than February 15, 2012. In addition, CBP 
shall address the reporting requirements related to manpower 
and innovation in the House report and considerations related 
to the staffing model in the Senate report.

                          Outbound Inspections

      CBP shall brief the Committees no later than February 15, 
2012, on its plans for outbound operations, as outlined in the 
House report, and its 3-year strategy to improve and deploy 
technology for outbound inspections, as discussed in the Senate 
report.

                Entry Process Improvements for Travelers

      CBP shall submit a report no later than February 15, 
2012, on actions taken to improve the entry process, as 
discussed in the Senate report.

                       Trusted Traveler Programs

      The Department shall brief the Committees on all DHS 
trusted traveler programs, as discussed in the Senate report, 
no later than February 15, 2012.

                       Cargo Screening Activities

      As discussed in the House and Senate reports, CBP shall 
brief the Committees no later than February 15, 2012, on its 
guidelines regarding low risk shipments and how it is improving 
trade processing and coordination.

       Non-Intrusive Inspection and Radiation Detection Equipment

      CBP is required to provide an investment and management 
plan for CBP's Non-Intrusive Inspection and Radiation Detection 
Equipment needs. The plan shall address all funds from all 
sources, not just the Inspection and Detection Technology PPA, 
including funding within the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office 
``Systems Acquisition'' appropriation.

       Automated Targeting Systems and National Targeting Center

      CBP shall brief the Committees no later than January 13, 
2012, on the use of the additional funds provided for these 
critical activities.

                     Maritime Supply Chain Security

      No funds are provided for the 100 percent scanning pilots 
proposed in the President's budget request. DHS has failed to 
provide any details or plans regarding how the proposed 
$7,500,000 would be used. Furthermore, while the Administration 
has been working on a supply chain security strategy to address 
this mandate, it has still not been submitted to the 
Committees. For that reason, these funds have been applied to 
address shortfalls in the request for the Container Security 
Initiative, a key supply chain security layer.

        Border Patrol and Border Security between Ports of Entry

      CBP shall submit a report to the Committees no later than 
90 days after the date of enactment of this Act on its five-
year staffing and deployment plan for the Border Patrol. In 
addition, the budget justification for fiscal year 2013 shall 
include a plan detailing staffing and funding for the Northern 
Border. CBP and ICE shall provide semi-annual briefings on 
assaults on personnel, threats to the border, and progress made 
on addressing the threats as required in the Senate report, 
with the first briefing no later than February 15, 2012. At the 
first briefing, CBP also shall brief on funds allocated for the 
health, welfare, and safety of Border Patrol agents, as 
directed in the House report.

                        Access to Federal Lands

      As provided in the House report, the Departments of 
Homeland Security, Agriculture, and Interior are directed to 
brief the Committees no later than February 15, 2012, on their 
plan to address the Border Patrol's access to Federal lands, as 
appropriate and necessary, to ensure the border security of the 
United States. DHS shall also brief the Committees no later 
than February 15, 2012, on its implementation of GAO's 
recommendations for border security coordination on Southwest 
Federal lands contained in GAO-11-38 and GAO-11-177.

                     Joint Field Command Structure

      While CBP allocated funds within its budget for the Joint 
Field Command (JFC), it is important to understand the cost-
benefit for establishing the JFC and whether CBP intends to 
establish this concept in other areas along the border. As 
discussed in the House and Senate reports, CBP is directed to 
brief the Committees no later than February 15, 2012.

                           Integrity Programs

      An additional $5,000,000 above the amount requested is 
provided for CBP's integrity programs, for a total of 
$165,681,000. CBP is directed to provide the briefing required 
in the House report by January 13, 2012.

                          Detention Statistics

      CBP is directed to review how it collects and manages 
information about individuals arrested and detained in CBP 
custody for less than 72 hours, including the facilities used 
for detaining such individuals. The review shall include ways 
to address data quality, standardize definitions, and utilize 
current reporting systems to routinely report on short-term 
detention. In a briefing to occur no later than 120 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the 
Committees on its review and on its policies and procedures 
relating to conditions of facilities and what standards govern 
the conditions and duration of custody.

                    Trade Compliance and Enforcement

      An additional $5,000,000 above the amount requested is 
provided for trade compliance and enforcement efforts. CBP is 
directed to submit to the Committees the reports specified in 
the Senate report, including the 3-year trade compliance 
strategy and the antidumping and countervailing duty reports, 
within the timeframes detailed in that report. In addition, CBP 
shall submit the reports under the headings ``Textile 
Transshipment Enforcement'' and ``Circumvention of Customs 
Duties--Imports from China,'' as discussed in the House report, 
within the timeframes detailed in that report.

               Multi-Year Investment and Management Plans

      As provided in section 568, CBP is required to submit a 
multi-year investment and management plan with the 
congressional budget justification materials for all 
appropriated funds from all sources executed by the Office of 
Information Technology (OIT) to provide a full picture of CBP's 
information technology activities. It is expected that the 
acquisition program baselines for Level I and II programs under 
OIT will be provided as part of the comprehensive acquisition 
status reports provided by the Under Secretary for Management.
      A similar requirement is also included for funds in the 
``Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology'' 
(BSFIT) appropriation.

                        Transportation of Aliens

      In response to OIG inquiries and OIG 11-27, CBP has taken 
great strides to streamline its costs associated with 
transportation and removal of aliens between Field Operations 
and Border Patrol. ICE has also made progress in analyzing and 
more efficiently managing its transportation costs. The next 
step, however, has not been taken in a comprehensive manner--
exploring options for coordination of transportation locally, 
regionally, and nationally, or sharing of transportation 
resources between CBP and ICE given constrained resources 
across DHS. CBP and ICE are directed to brief the Committees no 
later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act on 
the results of their joint efforts to take advantage of such 
efficiencies.

            Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition

      There is no clear plan for the Office of Technology 
Innovation and Acquisition (OTIA), including staffing and 
financing. CBP does not have authority to use funds provided to 
the ``Automation Modernization'' or the BSFIT appropriations 
for OTIA expenses. If additional funding from appropriations 
outside of ``Salaries and Expenses'' can be justified, a 
transfer request must be submitted pursuant to section 503 of 
this Act. All funds for OTIA shall be requested within the 
``Salaries and Expenses'' appropriation for fiscal year 2013.

                            Invasive Species

      CBP is directed to fund activities associated with 
control of invasive species, such as Carrizo cane, from within 
the BSFIT appropriation.

                        AUTOMATION MODERNIZATION

      A total of $334,275,000 is provided for ``Automation 
Modernization.'' Of that amount, not less than $140,000,000 is 
for the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). As provided in 
a general provision, CBP is required to submit a multi-year 
investment and management plan with the congressional budget 
justification materials for all funds executed by OIT to 
provide a full picture of CBP's information technology 
activities.

                ACE and International Trade Data System

      CBP shall brief the Committees on a quarterly basis on 
ACE progress, including the same information they have 
previously provided in quarterly reports. CBP shall use funds 
as necessary for the International Trade Data System (ITDS). 
Furthermore, prior year balances for ITDS are available for 
other priorities, such as ensuring completion of Cargo Release 
as planned. At the second quarterly briefing of fiscal year 
2012, CBP shall provide its plans for use of these prior year 
balances.

                                  TECS

      CBP and ICE are directed to jointly brief the Committees 
on the status of modernization efforts, including their 
progress and plans forward, on a semi-annual basis.

        BORDER SECURITY FENCING, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND TECHNOLOGY

      A total of $400,000,000 is provided for BSFIT. Within the 
total provided under this heading, $20,000,000 is for Northern 
Border technology, $40,000,000 is for tactical communications, 
and $3,000,000 is for environmental assessment and mitigation, 
as requested. When the amount made available under this heading 
is combined with unobligated balances, a total of $774,874,359 
is available for this function in fiscal year 2012.
      While it is clear that the Border Patrol requires 
additional tools and technology to execute its critical 
mission, concerns remain about the proposed Arizona Border 
Technology Plan and the Administration's slow execution of 
funds provided in this appropriation. The prolonged delay in 
procurements, particularly for purchase and upgrade of Remote 
Video Surveillance Systems, is extremely concerning. Further, 
the fact that the President's request includes a plan to 
procure three off-the-shelf integrated fixed tower systems 
after the Secretary's decision to terminate SBInet, despite the 
benefits now being realized by the Border Patrol from the 
system, raises questions. Under the best of circumstances, the 
contract for two of these towers would not be awarded until the 
summer of 2012, delaying the execution of the associated funds 
into fiscal year 2013. As a result, $60,000,000 is withheld for 
obligation from this appropriation until a detailed expenditure 
plan is provided to the Committees, no later than 90 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act. The expenditure plan shall 
clearly specify how DHS proposes to allocate funds among the 
BSFIT PPAs.

               Multi-Year Investment and Management Plan

      A new multi-year investment and management plan for BSFIT 
funds is required to be submitted by the Commissioner with the 
fiscal year 2013 budget request. To the extent possible, CBP is 
encouraged to incorporate requirements from the multi-year 
investment and management plan into the fiscal year 2012 
expenditure plan.

                            Invasive Species

      CBP is directed to fund activities associated with 
control of invasive species, such as Carrizo cane from within 
the BSFIT appropriation.

                  Review of Contracts and Task Orders

      The Inspector General is no longer required to review 
contracts and task orders on SBInet pursuant to conference 
report 109-699 accompanying P.L. 109-295.

                    Communications Along the Border

      DHS is encouraged to explore the establishment of public-
private partnerships with cellular carriers, residents, and 
State and local governments to extend mobile communications 
capabilities in isolated border areas with limited cellular 
coverage for the purposes of public safety.

 AIR AND MARINE INTERDICTION, OPERATIONS, MAINTENANCE, AND PROCUREMENT

      A total of $503,966,000 is provided for ``Air and Marine 
Interdiction, Operations, Maintenance, and Procurement.'' The 
funding includes $365,087,000 for operations and maintenance 
and $138,879,000 for procurement. The procurement funds include 
an additional $6,900,000 for UH-60 Black Hawk conversions (to 
ensure completion of two conversions) and $22,500,000 for 
purchase of an additional multi-enforcement aircraft (a high 
priority for CBP, particularly important given the increasing 
aircraft retirements CBP expects). Given the increasing 
reliance by CBP on unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for 
patrolling our borders, $4,000,000 is provided above the 
request for UAS operations and maintenance. It is imperative 
that sufficient funds be included in the fiscal year 2013 
budget to operate and sustain these systems over multiple 
shifts.

                            Civil Air Patrol

      As directed in the House report, the Comptroller General 
shall provide a report regarding the functions and capabilities 
of the civil air patrol in homeland security. The report shall 
be submitted no later than November 1, 2012.

                           Aircraft Upgrades

      CBP is required to update its 5-year strategic 
recapitalization plan, which should also include direction 
outlined in the Senate report. Strong support for CBP's service 
life extension program (SLEP) for the P-3 fleet is reiterated. 
Further, CBP is directed to brief the Committees on its 
decision regarding the inclusion of the last two P-3's in the 
SLEP no later than the submission of the President's fiscal 
year 2013 budget request.

                      Unmanned Aircraft Operations

      CBP is directed to brief the Committees on its efforts 
with the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation 
Administration on ways to increase effective use of CBP air 
assets, including UAS. Further, the briefing shall include 
information regarding any restrictions on UAS operations 
related to availability of air traffic control.

                 CONSTRUCTION AND FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

      A total of $236,596,000 is provided for ``Construction 
and Facilities Management.'' The funding includes $182,500,000 
for Facilities Construction and Sustainment and $54,096,000 for 
Program Oversight and Management. Statutory language is 
included directing the Commissioner to submit annually a real 
property inventory and requiring submission with the budget 
request of an annually-updated 5-year plan for all port of 
entry projects.

             Future Land Border Port of Entry Requirements

      As detailed in the Senate report, the Department shall 
work with the General Services Administration and the Office of 
Management and Budget on a multi-year strategy to address land 
border port of entry construction requirements and financing 
options, including the use of public-private partnerships.

                U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      A total of $5,528,874,000 is provided for ``Salaries and 
Expenses'' to ensure robust enforcement of our Nation's 
immigration laws. Within this amount, no less than 
$1,600,000,000 is allocated to finance ICE's various efforts to 
identify aliens with criminal records who are incarcerated or 
at-large, and to remove those who are deportable. Of this 
amount, $189,064,000 is provided for continued expansion of the 
Secure Communities program, $5,000,000 above the President's 
budget request, to digitize paper fingerprint cards and enroll 
them into DHS's Automated Biometric Identification System 
(IDENT). An additional $4,400,000 is provided for the Visa 
Security Program above the request to support expansion. The 
request for Headquarters, Management, and Administration was 
reduced by $3,591,000 for the Acquisition Workforce Initiative, 
the data center migration funds, and $1,000,000 in additional 
administrative savings. Data center migration is funded through 
a general provision.
      In addition, ICE is directed to comply with the direction 
included under the heading ``Office of Chief Financial 
Officer'' with respect to improved budget justifications.
      The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
follows:

        Total, ICE Salaries and Expenses................   5,528,874,000

                      ICE Domestic Investigations

      For ICE Domestic Investigations, $1,725,234,000 is 
provided. ICE is directed to continue to provide quarterly data 
on investigative activities and expenditures on a timely basis. 
Of the funds above the request, $4,000,000 is for enhancing 
investigations of antidumping/countervailing duty (AD/CVD) 
violations, intellectual property rights (IPR) investigations, 
and severe forms of human trafficking and smuggling activities. 
ICE is directed to submit to the Committees a plan for 
expenditure of these additional, targeted resources within 90 
days after the date of enactment of this Act. The conferees 
also direct ICE to submit by February 13, 2012, a 3-year 
strategy to improve AD/CVD enforcement, per the Senate report, 
and the information required on the National IPR Coordination 
Center in the House report.

              Improving Immigration Enforcement Activities

      A total of $12,000,000 above the request is provided to 
improve immigration enforcement activities, of which $5,000,000 
is included in Secure Communities for digitization of paper 
fingerprint cards from legacy immigration files. Both the House 
and Senate reports outlined areas for focus, such as: 
Developing a comprehensive strategy to address the visa 
overstay problem, modernizing the Alien Criminal Response 
Information Management System (ACRIMe) to support the 
identification of criminal aliens and individuals attempting to 
overstay a visa, enhancing ICE capabilities for law enforcement 
support for immigration-related inquiries from State and local 
law enforcement, and digitizing old fingerprint records. ICE is 
directed to brief the Committees, with US-VISIT and other DHS 
components as appropriate, on its plan for utilization of these 
funds, no later than 60 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act. ICE is also directed, in conjunction with US-VISIT 
and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), 
to report to the Committees no later than 120 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act on the methodology of 
prioritizing files for the digitization effort as well as the 
overall projected cost of the project to ensure electronic 
availability of appropriate biometrics in IDENT.

                     Law Enforcement Support Center

      The Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) is the national 
entity which provides, among other things, immigration status 
information about individuals encountered by State and local 
law enforcement agencies. The significant expansion of Secure 
Communities has increased the status inquiries submitted by law 
enforcement. Recently, the LESC has been reorganized and the 
functions split between the Office of Investigations and 
Detention and Removal Operations. Prior to the reorganization, 
the LESC had the flexibility to move personnel between the 
functions depending on workload, but it now appears that 
flexibility has been lost. Additionally, as Secure Communities 
has matured, some of the early resource allocation decisions 
would benefit from further review, specifically regarding the 
creation of the Interoperability Response Centers. ICE is 
directed to review the separation of LESC functions and the 
requirements of the Interoperability Response Centers and brief 
the Committees 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act. 
In addition, concerns have been raised about the progress of 
modernization of the information technology systems that 
sustain the Law Enforcement Support Center, such as ACRIMe. ICE 
is directed to brief the Committees no later than 30 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act on the current status of 
ACRIMe modernization and any revised development timelines.

                         Visa Security Program

      A total of $33,889,000 is provided for the ICE Visa 
Security Program, an increase of $4,400,000 above the amount 
requested for expansion of the program to two additional 
overseas consular posts. ICE is directed to brief the 
Committees in a classified format no later than 60 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act on its plan for utilizing 
these additional funds.

                        Investigative Resources

      ICE is directed to brief the Committees no later than 
February 15, 2012, on its efforts throughout the Caribbean 
basin, as outlined in the House report.

                              Intelligence

      ICE is encouraged to ensure the Office of Intelligence 
supports investigations into AD/CVD violations, IPR violations, 
and human trafficking and smuggling organizations.

                    Detention and Removal Operations

      A total of $2,750,843,000 is provided for ICE Detention 
and Removal Operations, $26,718,000 more than the request to 
raise the minimum number of detention bed spaces that ICE must 
maintain on a daily basis to 34,000. ICE is directed to 
intensify its enforcement efforts, fully use these resources, 
and manage detention and removal costs as efficiently as 
possible. As outlined in the House report, ICE is directed to 
provide comprehensive, regular briefings to the Committees on 
all steps being taken to reduce the costs of detention and 
removal, including: strategies to minimize transportation costs 
and house detainees at the lowest cost facilities; working with 
the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) to speed 
processing consistent with due process; continuing to review 
contracts to ensure maximum flexibility and lowest cost to ICE; 
and considering the cost-benefits of public and private 
providers for all services, including food and medical 
services. As required in the House and Senate reports, ICE is 
directed to brief the Committees on its detention bed space 
funding model, providing details on its bed space costs across 
the country and on the components of those costs, including 
food, medical, mental health, dental, pharmacy, and electronic 
health record services by location, and whether these 
components are provided by public agencies or private contract 
services. Such services must be aligned to humanitarian needs 
and should be provided in a cost-effective manner. The first 
comprehensive briefing shall take place no later than 30 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act.
      Additionally, ICE is encouraged to look at ways to 
increase the short-term detention capacity in certain regions 
of the United States while minimizing the loss of existing 
detention capacity, personnel, and contracts at other 
facilities. ICE shall brief the Committees semi-annually on its 
efforts regarding detention space alternatives, as discussed in 
the Senate report.

                           Secure Communities

      A total of $189,064,000 is provided to continue 
implementation of the Secure Communities program. ICE is 
directed to continue quarterly reports on the Secure 
Communities program, submit those reports within 45 days of the 
close of the quarter, and provide briefings within 45 days of 
the close of the quarter. Further, ICE is directed to develop 
analyses, for inclusion in these reports, to track the effect 
Secure Communities is having on ICE detention facilities, the 
EOIR docket, and the speed with which ICE is able to remove 
criminal aliens and high-risk detainees from the country once 
they are judged deportable. The reports shall also provide 
statistics on results of the program, including the number of 
individuals administratively arrested by ICE in each 
jurisdiction by the crime for which they are charged and the 
crime for which they have been convicted (if applicable); the 
number of individuals whom ICE identifies each quarter and 
intends to administratively arrest but must await the 
adjudication of the individual's criminal charges and/or the 
completion of a sentence as well as identify the crimes for 
which they are charged and crimes for which they have been 
convicted (if applicable); and the number of removals achieved 
as a result of the program, as outlined in the Senate report. 
Additionally, the briefings shall include quarterly data on the 
number of instances in which Secure Communities identifies when 
someone who is arrested is in this country illegally, the 
number of times ICE issues a detainer on such individuals 
(delineated by categories stipulating the reasons why a 
decision is made to issue or not issue a detainer), and the 
number actually deported.
      Secure Communities is an effective and significant law 
enforcement tool; its deployment and use should not be hampered 
by any jurisdiction or official. It is important to remember 
that Secure Communities is applied to everyone booked into a 
jail. All individuals are treated the same, and no profiling 
occurs. Through the use of biometrics, ICE is able to determine 
not only an individual's immigration status, but also if the 
individual has committed more serious crimes in the past.
      ICE is directed to brief the Committees no later than 
February 15, 2012, on any considerations associated with 
realigning the Secure Communities program under the Criminal 
Alien Program after interoperability has been accomplished.

             ICE Support to State and Local Law Enforcement

      ICE is directed to update the Committees on its progress 
toward closing all OIG recommendations on the 287(g) program no 
later than January 13, 2012. The Department is directed to 
immediately provide the status of all pending memoranda of 
agreement for 287(g) participation.

                      Hiring and Staffing Reports

      ICE shall submit quarterly staffing and hiring reports. 
Further, as directed in the House report, ICE shall brief the 
Committees on appropriate staffing levels.

                          Worksite Enforcement

      Of the funds provided for Domestic Investigations, 
$134,626,000 is for worksite enforcement activities, as 
requested. ICE is directed to brief the Committees quarterly on 
how it is meeting this level of effort no later than 30 days 
after the end of each quarter. Further, ICE shall provide an 
annual report on worksite enforcement activities as directed in 
the Senate report.

                    Detention and Removal Reporting

      Statutory language is included, as requested, ensuring 
that all illegally present or otherwise removable aliens 
encountered when enforcing our immigration laws are 
apprehended. However, the Department does not collect or report 
comprehensive statistics on all of its encounters with 
inadmissible and deportable aliens by source as well as the 
disposition of all such encounters. For that reason, ICE, in 
conjunction with CBP and USCIS, is directed to develop a 
methodology and a means of collecting and reporting such 
information on a quarterly basis for fiscal year 2013. In the 
most transparent, concise manner possible, the reporting should 
cover all actions in the reporting period for all stages of the 
immigration enforcement process: encounters by identification 
source (i.e., Fugitive Operations, Criminal Alien Program, 
Border Patrol Southwest border between ports); subsequent 
enforcement action by agency (i.e., expedited removal, arrest, 
detention, release); detention/non-detention by program (i.e., 
ICE detention, bond, alternatives to detention); and 
processing/removal outcome (i.e., deferred action, relief, 
removal, administrative closing). The reporting shall clearly 
provide the number of aliens who received deferred action, 
including a renewal or extension of previously-granted deferred 
action. ICE, CBP, and USCIS shall brief the Committees no later 
than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act on the 
developed methodology and means of collecting and reporting, 
including any information technology issues. Additionally, the 
agencies shall note where this comprehensive reporting could 
supersede other reports currently provided.
      For fiscal year 2012, ICE is directed to continue 
reporting quarterly on detention and removal, including the 
number of deportation, exclusion, and removal orders sought and 
obtained by ICE. The first fiscal year 2012 quarterly report is 
to be submitted no later than February 15, 2012. ICE shall 
include ``policy closure'' reporting subdivided to clearly 
report where deferred action has been granted.

                        Personnel Recovery Units

      ICE is directed to brief the Committees no later than 
February 15, 2012, on its interest in establishing a trained 
unit to handle abduction or evacuation of ICE personnel.

               Multi-Year Investment and Management Plan

      As provided in Section 568, ICE is required to submit a 
multi-year investment and management plan with the 
congressional budget justification materials for all funds 
executed by the Office of Information Technology (OIT) to 
provide a full picture of ICE's information technology 
activities. It is expected that the acquisition program 
baselines for Level I and II programs under OIT will be 
provided as part of the comprehensive acquisition status 
reports provided by the Under Secretary for Management.

                        Transportation of Aliens

      In response to OIG inquiries and OIG Report 11-27, CBP 
has taken great strides to streamline its costs associated with 
transportation and removal of aliens between Field Operations 
and Border Patrol. ICE has also made progress in analyzing and 
more efficiently managing its transportation costs. The next 
step, however, has not been taken in a comprehensive manner--
exploring options for coordination of transportation locally, 
regionally, and nationally, or sharing of transportation 
resources between CBP and ICE given constrained resources 
across DHS. CBP and ICE are directed to brief the Committees no 
later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act on 
the results of their joint efforts to take advantage of such 
efficiencies.

                    Unexpended Construction Balances

      ICE is directed to brief the Committees no later than 
February 15, 2012, on the unexpended balances in the ICE 
Construction appropriation.

                        AUTOMATION MODERNIZATION

      A total of $21,710,000 is provided for ``Automation 
Modernization.'' CBP and ICE are directed to jointly brief the 
Committees on the status of TECS modernization efforts, 
including their progress and plans forward, on a semi-annual 
basis.

                 Transportation Security Administration

                           AVIATION SECURITY

      A total of $5,253,956,000 is provided for ``Aviation 
Security.'' In addition to the amounts appropriated, a 
mandatory appropriation totaling $250,000,000 is available 
through the Aviation Security Capital Fund. Statutory language 
reflects the collection of $2,030,000,000 from aviation 
security fees, as authorized.
      The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
follows:

                     Impact of Checked Baggage Fees

      As noted in the Senate report, TSA checkpoint screening 
costs have risen significantly as a result of the growth in the 
volume of carry-on baggage transported by passengers in 
response to the imposition of checked baggage fees by most 
airlines. This increase in checkpoint screening costs, however, 
comes at the expense of other TSA security programs, and none 
of the air carrier revenue collected from the checked baggage 
fees has been used to offset the additional TSA workload. The 
Department is encouraged to work with the relevant authorizing 
Committees to find ways to recoup these costs, and ensure the 
best alignment between resources needed to achieve and sustain 
both security and efficient checkpoint operations.

                          Privatized Screening

      A total of $144,193,000 is provided for ``Privatized 
Screening.'' TSA is to give full and fair consideration to 
applicants for participation in the Screening Partnership 
Program that can demonstrate their capacity to undertake 
passenger and baggage screening in a manner more cost effective 
than TSA and to provide a level of security comparable to that 
of Federal screening. If TSA approves the applications, it is 
authorized, and expected, to finance the transition to 
privatized operations using funding within ``Screening 
Operations''.

                    Screener Personnel and Training

      A total of $3,025,771,000 is provided for the ``Screener 
Personnel, Compensation, and Benefits'' PPA, and a total of 
$249,796,000 is included for the ``Screener Training and 
Other'' PPA. Language is included that limits TSA's use of 
funds to recruit or hire more than 46,000 full-time equivalent 
screeners. The limitation does not apply to screeners hired as 
part-time employees. Statutory language is included that

      Funding is included for 145 new behavioral detection 
officers (BDO). TSA is directed to brief the Committees no 
later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act on 
its plans and actions to implement recommendations rising from 
the study of Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques 
(SPOT) that was sponsored by the Science and Technology 
Directorate. In addition, the briefing should cover how TSA is 
addressing issues raised in recent Government Accountability 
Office reviews of the program. These include validation, 
management, and communications issues identified in GAO-10-763 
and recommendations for approaches to BDO assignment and cost-
benefit analysis included in GAO-11-461T and GAO-10-157. 
Finally, the briefing should describe what TSA is doing to 
ensure its standardization testing of the SPOT program is 
carried out at airports with a frequency that will support 
consistent program execution and optimal BDO training.

                           Checkpoint Support

      A total of $204,768,000 is provided for ``Checkpoint 
Support,'' including funding for 250 new AIT systems and other

         Comprehensive and Quarterly Acquisition Status Reports

      To strengthen oversight for all Departmental acquisition 
programs, a statutory requirement is included for the 
Department of Homeland Security Under Secretary for Management 
to submit to the Committees a comprehensive acquisition status 
report in tandem with the fiscal year 2013 budget request with 
quarterly updates on any deviations. Because the Department-
wide comprehensive report will encompass Coast Guard 
acquisition data, a duplicative effort to submit Coast Guard 
specific quarterly reports is no longer necessary or required. 
In addition, acquisition specific information is required in 
the Coast Guard Capital Investment Plan (CIP), which has been 
expanded for the purpose of in-depth oversight. GAO shall 
review the CIP and brief the Committees on the results of the 
review.
      In lieu of separate briefings on individual acquisitions, 
as required in the Senate report, the Coast Guard shall brief 
the Committees quarterly on all major acquisitions. These 
briefings shall include: the objective for operational hours 
the Coast Guard expects to achieve; the gap between that 
objective, current capabilities, and stated mission 
requirements; and how the acquisition of the specific asset 
closes the gap. The information presented at these required 
briefings shall also include a discussion of how the Coast 
Guard calculated the operational hours, an explanation on risks 
to mission performance associated with the current shortfall, 
and the operational strategy to mitigate such risks.

                           Fleet Mix Analysis

      The Coast Guard is directed to submit to the Committees 
phases one and two of the Fleet Mix Analysis and the Cutter 
Fleet Mix Analysis, as specified by the Senate report.

                        National Security Cutter

      A total of $77,000,000 is repurposed from the budget 
request and provided for the acquisition of long-lead time 
materials necessary for production of the sixth National 
Security Cutter (NSC). In addition, statutory language 
specifies immediate availability of these funds, 
notwithstanding the availability of funds for production costs 
or post-production activities. The funding to support long-lead 
time materials along with the statutory direction is intended 
to enable a contract award approximately 90 days after the date 
of enactment of this Act. As noted in both the House and Senate 
reports, the Committees disagree with the Administration's 
current acquisition policy towards the NSC since it will result 
in substantially higher costs to the Coast Guard and the 
taxpayer, extension of the NSC acquisition program baseline, 
significant engineering inefficiencies, and an increased strain 
on the Coast Guard's legacy assets, including escalation of 
maintenance costs. By contrast, the funding of long-lead time 
materials in fiscal year 2012 will accelerate NSC production 
and result in not only direct savings of $45,000,000 to 
$60,000,000 per cutter, but also expedite completion of the NSC 
acquisition program baseline of eight NSCs. The conferees 
strongly support the acquisition of the planned eight NSCs in 
the most cost effective manner within the guidelines of proper 
program oversight and governance.

                         Offshore Patrol Cutter

      Notwithstanding the direction of the Senate report, the 
Coast Guard is directed to include updated information on the 
acquisition of the Offshore Patrol Cutter within the required 
comprehensive and quarterly acquisition status reports, as 
described in this statement under the Departmental Management 
and Operations ``Under Secretary for Management'' heading.

                          Fast Response Cutter

      As requested, a total of $358,000,000 is provided for the 
acquisition of six Fast Response Cutters (FRCs) and the re-
procurement data and licensing rights package (RDLP). Funding 
for six cutters is provided to maximize production capabilities 
and to realize a total savings of $30,000,000, or $5,000,000 
per FRC. Funds provided for the RDLP should sustain the 
acquisition program baseline and enable the planned re-
competition of the next FRC contract award.

                          Response Boat-Medium

      As requested, $110,000,000 is provided to acquire 40 
Response Boat-Mediums (RB-Ms). The acquisition of 40 RB-Ms will 
enable the Coast Guard to complete the RB-M acquisition program 
baseline one year ahead of schedule and achieve programmatic 
savings of approximately $6,000,000.

                                 C4ISR

      An additional $4,000,000 above the amount requested is 
provided to support the costs of installation of modernized 
communications systems on legacy cutters. The Coast Guard shall 
notify the Committees no later than February 15, 2012, on the 
planned expenditure of these additional funds as well as its 
deployment plan for C4ISR upgrades to the NSC fleet.

                         In-Service Sustainment

      The Coast Guard shall develop a long-term plan of 
investments to address its in-service cutter sustainment 
requirements, as described in the Senate report.

                       Rotary Wing Aircraft Reset

      As requested, $18,300,000 is provided for a replacement 
HH-60 helicopter.

                    Long-Range Surveillance Aircraft

      A new PPA combining HC-130J acquisition and HC-130H 
refurbishment is established, as directed by the House, in 
order to allow the Coast Guard to leverage its limited funding 
for the most cost effective budgeting for Long Range 
Surveillance Aircraft. The Coast Guard is directed to brief the 
Committees by February 15, 2012, on its evaluation of options 
presented in the recently completed Naval Air Systems Command 
business case analysis of the optimal mix of refurbished HC-
130Hs and new HC-130Js.

                       Unmanned Aircraft Systems

      Funding for unmanned aircraft systems is addressed under 
the Coast Guard ``Research, Development, Testing, and 
Evaluation'' heading and is not provided in this appropriation.

                    Program Oversight and Management

      A total of $26,000,000 is provided for Program Oversight 
and Management, a reduction of $9,000,000 from the request due 
to budgetary constraints. This PPA is renamed from, 
``Government Program Management'' to more accurately reflect 
the nature of the activities supported by the funding provided. 
The Coast Guard shall provide a more detailed budget 
justification, by activity, for this PPA in the fiscal year 
2013 budget justification materials.

  Major Shore Construction, Aids to Navigation, and Survey and Design

      As requested, $92,900,000 is provided for Major Shore 
Construction, Aids to Navigation, and Survey and Design. The 
Coast Guard is directed to submit a prioritized list of shore 
construction projects, as directed in the Senate report, which 
includes all unfunded and backlogged projects, to the 
Committees no later than 45 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act.

  Infrastructure Improvement Plan for the Coast Guard Training Center

      The Coast Guard shall submit to the Committees a plan to 
upgrade the barracks at the Coast Guard Training Center to 
include fire suppression systems and gender-equivalent 
facilities, as specified in the Senate report.

                Major Acquisition Systems Infrastructure

      A total of $81,500,000 is provided for Major Acquisition 
Systems Infrastructure, a reduction of $13,000,000 from the 
amount requested due to revised cost estimates. The Coast Guard 
is directed to submit a current expenditure plan on selected 
homeports to the Committees no later than 45 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act. Furthermore, the Coast Guard is 
directed to include within its annual budget justification 
materials the associated infrastructure costs of each 
operational asset proposed to be acquired.

                            Military Housing

      As requested, $20,000,000 is provided for military 
housing. The Coast Guard is directed to provide an exhaustive, 
prioritized listing of all military housing needs to the 
Committees no later than 45 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act.

                         Acquisition Personnel

      A total of $110,192,000 is provided for the direct costs 
of acquisition personnel. However, these funds do not support 
the costs of the requested enhancement to acquisition staffing 
due to: (1) an inadequate budget justification that does not 
fully explain baseline capabilities and how existing gaps in 
skills and capabilities will be addressed by the requested 
enhancement; and (2) the fact that the Coast Guard has not 
adequately budgeted to support the existing acquisition 
workforce. Therefore, the funds provided are intended to 
annualize the full costs of supporting acquisition personnel 
and related support to include resources that were reprogrammed 
at the request of the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2011. The 
Coast Guard is directed to brief the Committees on acquisition 
personnel management, as required by the Senate report, no 
later than February 15, 2012. This briefing shall also include 
a proposal for incorporating funding for acquisition staffing 
within the Coast Guard ``Operating Expenses'' appropriation and 
a method for tracking the budget for this function if it were 
to be merged with the funds that currently support personnel 
within the ``Operating Expenses'' appropriation.

              RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST, AND EVALUATION

      A total of $27,779,000 is provided for ``Research, 
Development, Test, and Evaluation'' (RDT&E). The Coast Guard is 
directed to revise its annual budget justification for this 
function, as per the standards and direction contained in this 
statement under the Departmental Management and Operations 
``Office of the Chief Financial Officer'' heading. This revised 
justification shall also include a prioritized listing of 
planned RDT&E activities relative to stated mission needs and 
goals.

                       Unmanned Aircraft Systems

      Within the amount provided under this heading, $8,000,000 
is provided for cutter-based unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). 
This funding, in addition to amounts previously appropriated, 
is provided for the purposes of procurement of shipboard 
integration equipment and to support an advanced concept 
technology demonstration.

                              RETIRED PAY

      A total of $1,440,157,000 is provided for ``Retired 
Pay''. The Coast Guard's ``Retired Pay'' appropriation is a 
mandatory budgetary activity.

                      United States Secret Service

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      A total of $1,661,237,000 is provided for ``Salaries and 
Expenses.'' Within this total, the following amounts are 
provided for requested initiatives: $57,300,000 for Operational 
Mission Support enhancements (within ``Protection of Persons 
and Facilities''); $113,462,000 for 2012 Presidential Campaign 
costs; $19,307,000 for ``National Special Security Events''; 
$371,000 for enhanced acquisition management support; and 
$43,843,000 for ``Information Integration and Technology 
Transformation'' (IITT). Of the funds provided for IITT, 
$20,000,000 is withheld from obligation for the purchase or 
installation of information technology equipment until the DHS 
Chief Information Officer submits a report to the Committees 
certifying that all plans for integration and transformation 
are consistent with the Department's data center migration and 
enterprise architecture requirements. In addition, the Secret 
Service is directed to submit an updated, prioritized plan for 
the execution of Operational Mission Support that reflects the 
funding provided.
      The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
follows:

                           Account Structure

      The current PPA structure does not provide visibility 
into the management of funding provided for information 
technology and system investments, or identify costs associated 
with the site-specific, critical protective physical 
infrastructure, which merits ongoing investment and 
refreshment. The Secret Service is directed to adjust its PPA 
structure to align to the tables at the end of this statement 
and to build this revised structure into its fiscal year 2013 
budget request. Costs associated with protective mission 
operations and support, including those based on unit cost 
elements for staffing and operational activities, excluding 
facilities and significant infrastructure investments, should 
continue to be reflected in the existing PPA for protection of 
persons and facilities. However, the Secret Service is directed 
to include a new PPA in its fiscal year 2013 budget submission 
which better captures the costs associated with investment and 
sustainment requirements for protective infrastructure, for 
which a substantial increase in funding was requested for 
fiscal year 2012 under ``Protection of Persons and 
Facilities.''

                            Overseas Offices

      Within the funding provided for this appropriation, 
$2,000,000 above the request is provided for the Secret Service 
to open and staff a new office in Lima, Peru. In lieu of the 
briefings on field operations required in the House and Senate 
reports, the Secret Service is directed to provide a briefing 
on the establishment of the office in Lima, Peru, as well as 
current and future funding requirements for a permanent office 
in Beijing, China, no later than February 15, 2012.

     ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, IMPROVEMENTS, AND RELATED EXPENSES

      A total of $5,380,000 is provided for ``Acquisition, 
Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses.''

      TITLE III--PROTECTION, PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE, AND RECOVERY

              National Protection and Programs Directorate

                     MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

      A total of $50,695,000 is provided for Management and 
Administration of the National Protection and Programs 
Directorate (NPPD).
      This includes $7,326,000 for management, planning, and 
administration activities in the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Infrastructure Protection and $5,494,000 for the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and 
Communications that were previously funded in ``Infrastructure 
Protection and Information Security''.
      As discussed under Departmental Management and 
Operations, ``Office of the Chief Financial Officer,'' NPPD 
shall provide, with the submission of the fiscal year 2013 
budget request, a fully justified budget by PPA and line item. 
Further, the budget request shall be submitted in the PPA 
structure provided in this statement. The budget justification 
shall also include a full explanation of any funds that are 
requested with availability in excess of one year including a 
program description, the reason for the additional required 
availability, and a schedule for execution of the funding.

                      Risk Management and Analysis

      A recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report 
highlighted several shortcomings in the NPPD Office of Risk 
Management and Analysis (RMA) program. While the NAS study 
concluded that the basic risk framework used by RMA is a sound 
approach to assessing risk, it identified other significant 
deficiencies in the Office's risk analysis approach, limiting 
the level of confidence with which it can be used to support 
DHS decision-making. The NAS recommended major reforms to the 
current approach, but to date the Department has not submitted 
a plan to reform RMA. Such lack of needed reforms is 
unacceptable in the current fiscally constrained environment. 
Therefore, the Secretary has been provided the authority to 
transfer up to $4,241,000 to the DHS Office of Policy, subject 
to notification, in order to reform and improve oversight of 
the Department's risk management and analysis functions. A 
transfer is also designed to elevate the importance of a strong 
risk modeling, analysis, and strategic planning function within 
the Department. If the Secretary does not submit a notification 
to transfer the risk management function to the Office of 
Policy, the funds shall be used to effect the orderly 
termination of RMA by March 30, 2012.
      The Committees must receive the notification for such a 
transfer no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act. Further, no later than the date upon which the 
notification is submitted, the Secretary shall provide to the 
Committees a plan identifying and justifying the specific risk 
modeling, analysis, and strategic planning functions of value 
and use to the Department and its individual components. The 
plan is to include the funding and personnel being allocated to 
each function and any reforms being made, including those 
undertaken in response to the NAS findings.

           INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY

      A total of $888,243,000 is provided for ``Infrastructure 
Protection and Information Security'' (IPIS), of which 
$200,000,000 is available until September 30, 2013. A total of 
$93,348,000 is provided for Infrastructure Security Compliance. 
This amount combined with the carryover balance of $19,705,120 
provides $113,053,120 for program implementation in fiscal year 
2012.
      Statutory language is included requiring expenditure 
plans for the Office of Infrastructure Protection and the 
National Cyber Security Division. The plans shall include a 
description by PPA and line item with the associated costs 
subdivided by quarter. The plan shall provide sufficient detail 
on the items and services procured and the outcomes of those 
services or items. As requested in the President's budget, 
$28,927,000 is included for Control Systems Security; 
$14,876,000 is included for cyber education; and $8,012,000 is 
included for cybersecurity outreach and awareness. Any funding 
used for acquisition of workforce improvements shall be clearly 
identified. Funding levels for all Information, Sharing and 
Analysis Centers, the National Infrastructure Simulation and 
Analysis Center, and for vulnerability assessments shall also 
be clearly identified.
      A provision that requires an investment and management 
plan is not included for the National Cybersecurity Protection 
System as directed in the House report. Additionally, a 
separate report for Next Generation Network Priority Services 
is not required as directed in the Senate report. NPPD shall 
instead comply with the requirements for the Comprehensive and 
Quarterly Acquisition Status Reports in Departmental Management 
and Operations under the heading ``Under Secretary for 
Management.''
      With respect to sector cooperation, the Under Secretary 
for NPPD is to provide a report regarding the results of a 
review to streamline the processes for coordination and 
information sharing with industry partners, and GAO is to 
conduct an evaluation of the effort, as directed in the Senate 
report.
      The Under Secretary is directed to provide a report that 
details the Department's definition of inherently safer 
technology as it relates to chemical facilities under the 
purview of the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards 
program.

                       FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE

      A total of $1,261,537,000 is provided for the ``Federal 
Protective Service'' (FPS), as requested, for fiscal year 2012. 
This amount is fully offset by collections of security fees. A 
provision is included requiring the Secretary and the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget to certify, no later 
than December 31, 2011, that FPS will collect a sufficient 
amount in fees to cover the total number of FTE requested in 
the budget, or adjust the fee to cover all costs.
      The Director of FPS shall provide an expenditure plan by 
PPA for fiscal year 2012 no later than 60 days after the date 
of enactment of this Act. The plan shall include a description 
by line item and distinct activity with the expenditures 
subdivided quarterly. With the submission of the fiscal year 
2013 budget, the Director of FPS shall comply with the 
requirements as detailed in Departmental Management and 
Operations, ``Office of the Chief Financial Officer'' with 
respect to fiscal year 2013 budget justifications. The 
justification provided in fiscal year 2013 shall include all 
funding sources, including reimbursables.
      FPS is directed to provide a strategic human capital plan 
and a plan to assume security and protection responsibilities 
from agencies that currently hold delegated authority to the 
Committees and GAO as directed in the Senate report. Further, 
GAO is directed to comply with the directions with respect to 
reviewing such plans.

    UNITED STATES VISITOR AND IMMIGRANT STATUS INDICATOR TECHNOLOGY

      A total of $306,802,000 is provided for US-VISIT. No 
funds are included for the Acquisition Workforce Initiative. 
Statutory language is included to require a multi-year 
investment and management plan. In addition, US-VISIT is 
directed to comply with the direction included under the 
heading ``Office of the Chief Financial Officer'' with respect 
to improved budget justifications.

                      Overstay Backlog Elimination

      Given the current budgetary environment, security 
requirements that must be met immediately, and the lack of an 
implementation plan for biometric air exit, unobligated 
balances from US-VISIT are rescinded for distribution to other 
security priorities across the Department for which funds can 
be more quickly executed. An increase of $9,400,000 is provided 
for US-VISIT to prepare a comprehensive plan for implementation 
of biometric air exit, as well as for improvement of biographic 
entry-exit matching capabilities and to prevent future overstay 
backlogs. DHS is encouraged to identify additional funds to 
enhance funding for its biographic efforts. The Department is 
directed to brief the Committees no later than January 13, 
2012, on its plan for use of these funds, to include 
elimination of the backlog of ``unvetted'' overstay records and 
the prevention of reoccurrence of backlogs.

                         Semi-Annual Briefings

      US-VISIT shall continue to provide briefings to the 
Committees on biometric exit planning; interoperability in 
conjunction with its interagency counterparts; hirings and 
conversions; and other operations. The briefings will be on a 
semi-annual rather than a quarterly basis.

               Identity Management and Screening Services

      As required in the House report, US-VISIT shall brief the 
Committees quarterly on its workload and service levels, 
including any backlogs that may result from an influx of 
transactions or new users.

                              US-VISIT 1.0

      Funds are not provided for ``US-VISIT 1.0'' due to 
insufficient justification regarding the use of such funds. US-
VISIT is encouraged to continue planning efforts for 
modernization of IDENT, including ensuring that it can operate 
efficiently to meet the growing and evolving needs of its users 
and provide the critical capabilities necessary for our 
Nation's security. IDENT modernization should be outlined in 
the US-VISIT investment and management plan.

and Operations, ``Office of the Chief Financial Officer'' with 
respect to improved budget justifications.
      A total of $12,013,000 is provided for the National 
Biosurveillance Integration System (NBIS), $5,000,000 above the 
budget request, including funds to diversify DHS's 
biosurveillance capabilities. OHA is not required to collocate 
the National Biosurveillance Integration Center as directed in 
the Senate report.
      A total of $5,439,000 is provided for the Chemical 
Defense Program, of which $3,000,000 is provided above the 
request for at least two additional demonstration projects, to

                    ____________________________________________________
        Total, Salaries and Expenses....................    $895,350,000

      FEMA shall provide an expenditure plan no later than 90 
days after the date of enactment of this Act. The plan shall be 
detailed by the PPA structure as detailed in this statement and 
by office. It shall include actual funding from the prior year, 
the current fiscal year, and deviations between the two years. 
Each year shall include the number of positions, the number of 
FTE, the amount for salaries and benefits, and the amount for 
the program, showing all sources of funding. Specific 
information regarding the transfer of funding from other 
appropriations should be included, with the same level of 
detail currently provided to the Committees.
      For fiscal year 2013, the budget request for FEMA shall 
comply with the direction included in Departmental Management 
and Operations under the ``Office of the Chief Financial 
Officer'' with respect to improved budget justifications. 
Further, the budget request shall be detailed by office and 
under the new PPA structure provided and submitted in the same 
format as the required expenditure plan for fiscal year 2012.
      FEMA is directed to study the feasibility to, on a 
quarterly basis, post on the FEMA website a summary of the 
financial status of funds appropriated under ``State and Local 
Programs.''
      FEMA is provided the authority to reprogram funds within 
``Salaries and Expenses,'' notwithstanding the requirements of 
section 503 of this Act. This temporary authority shall expire 
on April 16, 2012.
      A provision is included requiring the Administrator to 
submit the National Preparedness Report and a comprehensive 
plan to implement a system to measure the effectiveness of 
grants to State and local communities to the Committees in 
fiscal year 2012. Further, $1,400,000, 25 percent of the funds 
for the Office of the Administrator, is withheld from 
obligation until the Report and the plan are submitted.
      Within 90 days of the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of FEMA, in consultation with the Commander 
of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), shall provide a 
report on the cost of debris removal. Specifically, the report 
shall address the disparity between the cost factors for the 
USACE as compared to other options communities have for debris 
removal services.

              Program, Project, and Activity Restructuring

      In order to provide additional visibility, the FEMA 
``Salaries and Expenses'' account, formerly the ``Management 
and Administration'' account, has been subdivided into PPA 
lines. The Administrative and Regional Offices PPA includes the 
Office of the Administrator, Office of Policy and Program 
Analysis, Office of External Affairs, Disability Integration 
and Coordination, Office of Equal Rights, Office of Chief 
Counsel, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of 
National Capital Region Coordination, Regional Operations, 
Federal Coordinating Officers, and Evaluations and Assessments. 
The Preparedness and Protection PPA includes the Office of 
Preparedness and National Protection, National Continuity, 
National Preparedness Directorate, Grants Programs Directorate, 
and Technical Assistance. The Response PPA includes the Office 
of Response and Recovery, Response Programs, and Logistics 
Programs. The Recovery PPA includes Recovery Programs. The 
Mitigation PPA includes Mitigation Programs. The Mission 
Support PPA includes the Office of the Associate Administrator, 
Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Security Officer, Chief 
Information Officer, Chief Human Capital Officer, Chief 
Procurement Officer, and Regional Support. The Centrally 
Managed Accounts PPA includes centrally managed functions in 
the Office of the Chief Financial Officer as well as the 
Enterprise Operations in the Office of the Chief Administrative 
Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Security Officer. 
The Emergency Management Institute is funded under the ``State 
and Local Programs'' account.

          Technical Assistance and Evaluations and Assessments

      Funding for activities under Technical Assistance and 
Evaluations and Assessments has been provided under this 
heading instead of under the ``State and Local Programs'' 
account as in previous years. A total of $10,000,000 is 
provided for Technical Assistance within the new Preparedness 
and Protection PPA, and $10,000,000 is provided for Evaluations 
and Assessments within the new Administrative and Regional 
Offices PPA.

                         Facilities Management

      A total of $12,000,000 is provided for capital 
improvements at Mount Weather, as requested. Additionally, 
$5,000,000 above the requested amount is provided to address 
unfunded repairs and capital improvement on priority projects 
across FEMA. None of these funds may be obligated until five 
days after the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of FEMA briefs the 
Committees on an execution plan for these funds.

                        Automation Modernization

      A total of $13,662,000 is provided for FEMA to address 
automation modernization requirements. None of these funds may 
be obligated until five days after the CFO and the Chief 
Information Officer (CIO) of FEMA brief the Committees on the 
execution plan for these funds. A provision is included 
requiring FEMA to provide a strategic plan within 180 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act to modernize its 
automation and information systems. As noted in both the Senate 
and House reports, a recent OIG report (OIG-11-69) highlighted 
a systemic information management and systems problem within 
FEMA which leaves the Agency less able to efficiently and 
effectively accomplish its mission. FEMA relies on a time 
consuming and manual process to estimate its needs for disaster 
relief funding. Further, FEMA has been unable to quantify 
National preparedness capabilities, and gaps in capabilities, 
despite Congress's call to do so since before 2007. Lastly, 
FEMA is unable to efficiently work with partners in homeland 
security and emergency management due to a lack of comparable 
technology capability.
      The lack of a comprehensive approach and needed 
investments to modernize systems has also left FEMA less able 
to integrate the preparedness, prevention, response, 
mitigation, and recovery missions with which it is charged. The 
funding and planning requirement established in the Act is to 
provide the means and the direction for FEMA to modernize for 
better performance and future cost savings. FEMA shall include 
the DHS CIO in planning efforts to ensure compatibility with 
DHS systems where practicable. Further, the needs of the Office 
of National Capital Region Coordination (ONCRC) shall be 
considered in the automation and information systems strategy. 
The Deputy Administrator is directed to brief the Committees 
within 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act 
regarding the implementation of the findings of OIG report OIG-
11-69, and the initial effort to formulate the modernization 
plan for each major component within FEMA. These requirements 
are in lieu of separate requirements addressed in Senate and 
House reports with respect to the information technology and 
modernization within the CIO, Preparedness and Protection, 
Recovery, Mission Support, and the ONCRC.
      Funding for data center migration is not included in this 
account but is instead addressed under General Provisions in 
Title V.

            Disaster Relief Fund Financial Management Policy

      Within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Administrator and the CFO of FEMA shall develop a 
policy and issue guidance on the implementation of the 
restriction to immediate needs funding, or any other spending 
restrictions administratively imposed in the Disaster Relief 
Fund (DRF). This policy shall include thresholds for when a 
restriction will be implemented and identify which programs are 
impacted under the restriction. FEMA shall brief the Committees 
within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act on 
the completed policy. Further, FEMA is directed to notify the 
Committees no later than 15 days prior to the implementation of 
immediate needs funding restrictions, to the extent 
practicable.
      To improve the validity and veracity of requests for 
disaster relief funding in future budgets, the Administrator 
and the CFO of FEMA shall develop policy and guidance that 
defines the methodology used to formulate the budget estimate 
for the DRF. The policy shall be consistent with the Budget and 
Control Act and shall include a clear description of the data 
used as a basis for the request, the office responsible for 
providing the data, and the source(s) of data used. The Office 
of the Administrator and the CFO of FEMA shall brief the 
Committees within 90 days of the date of the enactment of this 
Act on the proposed policy and guidance. Using this policy and 
guidance, the CFO of FEMA shall work with a qualified third 
party organization to review the methodology and create 
estimating tools that will enable rigorous and more consistent 
forecasting of the requirements for the Disaster Relief Fund. 
Up to $500,000 is provided for this effort. The Committees 
shall be regularly briefed by the CFO on the status of the 
project.
      Further, to improve the management of the DRF and 
assistance programs, FEMA needs to improve the quality and 
timeliness of project worksheets for public assistance grants, 
as well as the process for sharing that information with 
regional offices, FEMA headquarters, and the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB). Therefore, FEMA shall work with 
the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute, or an 
independent organization with expertise in grants management, 
to review the project worksheet process and flow of 
information, and provide a report to the Committees no later 
than May 1, 2012. The organization shall provide 
recommendations to FEMA and the Committees on how to improve 
the collection and sharing of grant information between the 
regions, FEMA headquarters, and OMB. The review shall include a 
delineation of the time an application, or an application 
appeal, currently spends at each office and stage of the 
process including the joint field office, FEMA regional office, 
FEMA headquarters, DHS, and OMB; and ways to streamline the 
information and reduce the time needed to adjudicate 
applications.

           Office of the National Capital Region Coordination

      A total of $5,493,000 is provided for the ONCRC. The 
ONCRC was created to oversee and coordinate Federal programs 
for and relationships with State, local, and regional 
authorities in the National Capital Region. Strides have been 
made in coordinating efforts, especially among the State and 
local partners, however, there is much more to do, especially 
in regard to coordination and communication among Federal 
entities in the area. The Office of the Administrator of FEMA, 
in conjunction with ONCRC, shall provide a briefing within 60 
days after the date of enactment of this Act, on a clear 
strategy and an action plan to ensure that ONCRC activities are 
focused in the most efficient and effective manner. The 
briefing shall provide an understanding of specific outcomes of 
the ONCRC for fiscal year 2012, and the timeframe in which they 
will be completed. Further, the Administrator of FEMA is 
directed to comply with section 882 of the Homeland Security 
Act of 2002 with respect to the submission of the ONCRC annual 
report. The annual report shall be submitted within 60 days of 
the date of enactment of this Act.
      A provision is continued requiring the inclusion of the 
Governors of the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania in the National Capital Region decision-making and 
planning process for mass evacuation.

                        Urban Search and Rescue

      A total of $41,250,000 is for the Urban Search and Rescue 
Response System, an increase of $6,070,000 over fiscal year 
2011. The increase provides for updating the chemical, 
biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosives equipment for 
existing teams and to add an additional team, if warranted, to 
ensure adequate response times and coverage across the Nation. 
None of the additional funds provided may be obligated until 
five days after FEMA briefs the Committees on the requirements 
and justification for the expenditure of funds. FEMA is 
directed to provide the details of the complete review of the 
System without delay.

                     Unaccompanied Minors Registry

      A total of no less than $500,000 is provided to automate 
the unaccompanied minors registry and call center as directed 
in the Senate report.
      

                    Presidential Policy Directive--8

      The conferees are pleased the National Preparedness Goal 
was submitted this past September, in accordance with the 
Presidential Policy Directive--8, and expect to receive a 
report describing the National Preparedness System before 
January 2012. Within 15 days after receiving the report, FEMA 
shall brief the Committees on the recommendations of the 
report, timelines for their implementation, and their budgetary 
impacts.

                        STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      A total of $1,349,681,000 is provided for State and Local 
programs. The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is 
as follows:

State and Local Programs Grants.........................  $1,118,000,000
Education, Training, and Exercises:
    Emergency Management Institute......................      16,181,000
    Center for Domestic Preparedness....................      62,500,000
    National Domestic Preparedness Consortium...........      93,000,000
    National Exercise Program...........................      34,000,000
    Continuing Training.................................      26,000,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
        Subtotal, Education, Training, and Exercises....     231,681,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
            Total, State and Local Programs.............  $1,349,681,000

      The funds provided for State and Local Program grants are 
to be allocated according to threat, vulnerability, and 
consequence to assist high-risk urban areas, States, local and 
Tribal governments, and other homeland security partners in 
preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding 
to acts of terrorism. Congress has appropriated over 
$34,000,000,000 to homeland security grants to date to build 
first responder capabilities and secure infrastructure. Given 
the current fiscal climate, the Department should work with the 
appropriate Committees of jurisdiction to clearly define the 
Federal role and reassess the most effective delivery of 
support and resources to sustain and improve homeland security 
capabilities.
      The Secretary and the Administrator of FEMA are directed 
to study the current grant programs in order to make them the 
most effective and to reduce impediments to the timely 
expenditure of homeland security grant funds. The results of 
such study shall be provided to the Committees in conjunction 
with the required comprehensive plan to implement a system to 
measure the effectiveness of grants.
      Several provisions are included related to grant 
administration. Grant guidance shall be issued within 60 days, 
applicants shall apply within 80 days, and award decisions 
shall be made within 65 days. Grantees may not use more than 5 
percent of a grant for grant administration and shall provide 
reports on the use of funds as determined necessary by the 
Secretary. The installation of communications towers is not 
considered construction under State Homeland Security Grants 
and the Urban Area Security Initiative.
      A provision is included allowing the Center for Domestic 
Preparedness to train certain emergency personnel provided it 
does not interfere with the primary mission to train state and 
local emergency response providers.
      Funding for the Emergency Management Institute is 
provided under this heading, instead of under ``Salaries and 
Expenses'' (formerly ``Management and Administration'') as in 
previous years.
      The Department shall brief the Committees on steps taken 
to ensure community leaders and grantees have the same threat, 
vulnerability, and consequence information that is available to 
the Department to ensure applications reflect true risk.
      The GAO is no longer required to monitor the development 
of any system to measure the effectiveness of the grant 
programs as directed in the House report.
      FEMA is required to provide a report on the 
accomplishments of the Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant 
Program, including how successes can be transitioned to and 
sustained through future catastrophic planning efforts.
      As addressed in both the Senate and House reports, the 
continued slow expenditure of funds is concerning. FEMA is 
directed to brief the Committees no later than 90 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act on plans to expedite the 
expenditure of funds for interoperable emergency 
communications, port security, and transit security grants. 
Particular attention should be placed on funds that were 
appropriated prior to fiscal year 2008.

                     FIREFIGHTER ASSISTANCE GRANTS

      A total of $675,000,000 is provided for Firefighter 
Assistance Grants including $337,500,000 for firefighter 
assistance grants and $337,500,000 for firefighter staffing 
grants. FEMA is directed to continue the present practice of 
funding applications according to local priorities and those 
established by the United States Fire Administration, to 
maintain an all-hazards focus, and to grant funds for eligible 
activities in accordance with the authorizing statute. FEMA is 
required to continue the current grant application and review 
process as specified in the House report.

                EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE GRANTS

      A total of $350,000,000 is provided for Emergency 
Management Performance Grants.

              RADIOLOGICAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM

      Statutory language is included providing for the receipt 
and expenditure of fees collected, as authorized by P.L. 105-
276.

                   UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION

      A total of $44,038,000 is provided for the United States 
Fire Administration.

                          DISASTER RELIEF FUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      A total of $700,000,000 is provided in this conference 
agreement for the Disaster Relief Fund formerly called 
``Disaster Relief.'' The conferees anticipate that an 
additional $6,400,000,000 that is designated for major 
disasters pursuant to 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be provided in 
legislation that is being considered in parallel to this 
conference agreement. Therefore, a total amount of 
$7,100,000,000 will be provided for the Disaster Relief Fund 
for fiscal year 2012 consistent with estimates provided by the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget in a letter 
dated October 19, 2011, and by the Secretary of Homeland 
Security in the report titled ``Disaster Relief Funding 
Requirements'' dated October 21, 2011, pursuant to the 
legislative requirement in Section 125 of H.R. 2017 (Public Law 
112-36). Of the funds provided in this conference agreement, 
$24,000,000 shall be transferred to the DHS OIG for audits and 
investigations related to disasters.
      A provision is included amending Public Law 110-161 which 
exempts FEMA from the permanent requirement to submit a monthly 
``Disaster Relief'' report. A new provision is included 
updating the timeframes and information which FEMA must report 
to the Committees on the Disaster Relief Fund. This provision 
reduces the burden of reporting by FEMA and allows for better 
oversight of funding requirements by the Committees. There are 
several previous reporting requirements which are deleted 
altogether. FEMA is cautioned that such data could be required 
in the future after a catastrophic event, and FEMA should 
therefore not lose the capacity to track and provide such 
information including: Mission Assignment obligations and 
expenditures by Federal agency; credit card costs and purchases 
by DHS agencies; and sole source contracts.
      A report on the expenditure of funds for disaster 
readiness and support, including quarterly updates, is 
required, as in previous years.
      A requirement is included in this statement under FEMA 
Salaries and Expenses to improve DRF budget estimates.

            DISASTER ASSISTANCE DIRECT LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      A total of $295,000 is provided for the cost of direct 
loans.

                 FLOOD HAZARD MAPPING AND RISK ANALYSIS

      A total of $97,712,000 is provided for flood hazard 
mapping and risk analysis.
      FEMA is directed to provide no less than 20 percent of 
the funds provided under this heading for map updates and 
maintenance conducted by Cooperating Technical Partners (CTPs) 
that provide at least a 25 percent cash match and have a strong 
record of working effectively with FEMA on floodplain mapping 
activities.

                     NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE FUND

      A total of $22,000,000 is provided for salaries and 
expenses and $149,000,000 for flood plain management and 
mapping. Further, $10,000,000 is provided for the severe 
repetitive loss program.

                  NATIONAL PREDISASTER MITIGATION FUND

      A total of $35,500,000 is provided for the National 
Predisaster Mitigation Fund. The unobligated balance from 
previous years is $173,259,000.

                       EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER

      A total of $120,000,000 is provided for the Emergency 
Food and Shelter program.

       TITLE IV--RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND SERVICES

           United States Citizenship and Immigration Services

      A total of $102,424,000 is provided in discretionary 
appropriations for USCIS for E-Verify.

                          Fee Funded Programs

      USCIS operations that have been funded through fee 
revenue should continue to be funded in that manner, including 
the processing of refugee and asylum claims, Systematic Alien 
Verification for Entitlements (SAVE), and immigrant integration 
activities. USCIS is directed to include these costs in its 
revised fee schedule in recognition of the fact that no 
additional appropriations will be available to cover the costs 
of these activities. Further, the table at the end of this 
statement is updated to reflect these activities as funded 
through fee collections and includes new projections from 
USCIS. The requirement in the House report regarding quarterly 
briefings on fee revenues and obligations is incorporated into 
the user fee report requirement addressed in this statement 
under the heading ``Office of the Chief Financial Officer.''

                          Digitization Efforts

      USCIS, ICE, and the Executive Office of Immigration 
Review are directed to brief the Committees on use of digitized 
records, as required in the House report, no later than March 
1, 2012. USCIS is also directed to provide no less than 
$29,000,000 to continue conversion of immigration records to 
digital format.

             Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements

      Due to current budgetary constraints, the SAVE program 
must continue to be funded through user fees and other USCIS 
fee revenues. USCIS shall explore all opportunities to reduce 
the burden on State and local benefits agencies that serve as a 
disincentive to participation. Additionally, USCIS shall ensure 
that improvements to the Verification Information System 
benefit both E-Verify and SAVE users.

                                REAL ID

      The Department is directed to brief the Committees no 
later than April 13, 2012, on the steps being taken to 
encourage the States to draw down these funds, the progress on 
draw down, and the specific reasons by jurisdiction for the 
delay in draw down, as directed in the House report.

                      Immigrant Integration Grants

      Section 551 is included providing $10,000,000 for 
immigrant integration grants from fee revenue. No more than 
five percent of the amount of funds utilized for immigrant 
integration grants can be used to administer the program.

                Federal Law Enforcement Training Center

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      A total of $238,957,000 is provided for ``Salaries and 
Expenses,'' as requested. Within the funds provided,

Administration,'' including not to exceed $8,500 for official 
reception and representation expenses.

           RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, ACQUISITION, AND OPERATIONS

      A total of $533,000,000 is provided for ``Research, 
Development, Acquisition, and Operations,'' including 
$265,783,000 for a new consolidated ``Research, Development, 
and Innovation'' (RDI) PPA in lieu of the previous, more 
detailed program areas. Funding is available for three years, 
except Laboratory Facilities funding, which is available for 
five years.
      The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
follows:

                 Research, Development, and Innovation

      The new PPA for RDI will enable S&T to more quickly shift 
resources, if necessary, between research activities without 
formal reprogramming or transfer actions. In some instances, 
research activity may straddle several different missions and 
thrust areas. S&T and the Department must prioritize this 
consolidated research budget, which is substantially reduced 
from recent fiscal years, to focus on areas with the greatest 
promise for delivering material improvements or tangible 
contributions to homeland security missions in the near term. 
This flexibility in funding should facilitate that effort and 
partially offset the impact of an overall funding reduction.
      However, it remains important for accountability and 
visibility into the S&T research program that a more detailed 
reporting of research activity be available. Therefore, S&T is 
directed to submit to the Committees a detailed breakout of RDI 
funding by research thrust areas and by project, based on the 
categories presented in the budget justification materials, no 
later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and 
to submit quarterly updates thereafter.

                         Apex Research Projects

      The Apex initiative focuses on high-priority, high-value 
projects expected to produce results to solve a homeland 
security challenge in the near term. To provide the best 
oversight over these programs, S&T is directed to brief the 
Committees before initiating any new Apex projects, as 
specified in the House report. S&T and the Secret Service shall 
brief the Committees no later than 60 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act on the protective technology project, to 
include a progress report and a schedule for test and 
evaluation under operational conditions.

                      Resilience and Cybersecurity

      S&T is encouraged to continue to support competitively 
awarded research into disaster resilience with universities and 
Federal research centers, as well as cybersecurity research and 
development, as discussed in the Senate report.

Agro-defense Facility (NBAF), and of which $18,200,000 shall be 
for infrastructure upgrades at the Transportation Security 
Laboratory as requested. Section 550 in the Act restricts funds 
appropriated in this Act for NBAF construction until the 
Department of Homeland Security completes 50 percent design 
planning for the NBAF, submits a revised site-specific 
biosafety and biosecurity mitigation risk assessment, and 
submits the National Academy of Sciences' review of the revised 
risk assessment. In addition, the revised site-specific 
biosafety and biosecurity mitigation risk assessment is to

                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      Section 501. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
is continued that no part of any appropriation shall remain 
available for obligation beyond the current year unless 
expressly provided.
      Section 502. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
is continued that unexpended balances of prior appropriations 
may be merged with new appropriation accounts and used for the 
same purpose, subject to reprogramming guidelines.
      Section 503. A provision proposed by the Senate is 
continued that provides authority to reprogram appropriations 
within an account and to transfer up to 5 percent between 
appropriations accounts with 15-day advance notification to the 
Committees. The House proposed a similar provision. A detailed 
funding table identifying programs, projects, and activities is 
included at the end of this statement. This table along with 
funding levels specified in the report shall serve as the 
control level for all reprogrammings. These reprogramming 
guidelines shall be complied with by all agencies funded by 
this Act.
      The Department shall submit reprogramming requests on a 
timely basis and provide complete explanations of the 
reallocations proposed, including detailed justifications of 
the increases and offsets, and any specific impact the proposed 
changes will have on the budget request for the following 
fiscal year and future-year appropriations requirements. Each 
request submitted to the Committees should include a detailed 
table showing the proposed revisions at the account, program, 
project, and activity level to the funding and staffing (full-
time equivalent position) levels for the current fiscal year 
and to the levels requested in the President's budget for the 
following fiscal year.
      The Department shall manage its programs and activities 
within the levels appropriated. The Department should only 
submit reprogramming or transfer requests in the case of an 
unforeseeable emergency or situation that could not have been 
predicted when formulating the budget request for the current 
fiscal year. When the Department submits a reprogramming or 
transfer request to the Committees and does not receive 
identical responses from the House and Senate, it is the 
responsibility of the Department to reconcile the House and 
Senate differences before proceeding, and if reconciliation is 
not possible, to consider the reprogramming or transfer request 
not approved.
      The Department is not to submit a reprogramming or 
transfer of funds after June 30 except in extraordinary 
circumstances, which imminently threaten the safety of human 
life or the protection of property. If a reprogramming or 
transfer is needed after June 30, the notice should contain 
sufficient documentation as to why it meets this statutory 
exception.
      Subsection (e), added in the fiscal year 2011 year-long 
continuing resolution, is included to ensure that funds that 
are deobligated by the Department are also subject to the 
reprogramming and transfer guidelines and requirements set 
forth in this section.
      Section 504. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
is continued that prohibits funds appropriated or otherwise 
made available to the Department to make payment to the 
Department's Working Capital Fund, except for activities and

Funds provided to the WCF are available until expended. The 
Department can only charge components for direct usage of the 
WCF and these funds may be used only for the purposes 
consistent with the contributing component. Any funds paid in 
advance or reimbursed must reflect the full cost of each 
service. The WCF shall be subject to the requirements of 
section 503 of this Act.
      Section 505. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
is continued that not to exceed 50 percent of unobligated 
balances remaining at the end of fiscal year 2012 from 
appropriations made for salaries and expenses shall remain 
available through fiscal year 2013 subject to section 503 
reprogramming guidelines.
      Section 506. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
is continued that funds for intelligence activities are deemed 
to be specifically authorized during fiscal year 2012 until the 
enactment of an Act authorizing intelligence activities for 
fiscal year 2012.
      Section 507. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
is continued and modified requiring notification of the

regarding butane lighters. The House proposed a similar 
provision.
      Section 523. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
is continued that precludes DHS from using funds in this Act to 
carry out reorganization authority. This prohibition is not 
intended to prevent the Department from carrying out routine or 
small reallocations of personnel or functions within 
components, subject to Section 503 of this Act. This language 
prevents large scale reorganization of the Department, which 
should be acted on legislatively by the relevant Congressional 
committees of jurisdiction.
      Section 524. A provision proposed by the Senate is 
continued prohibiting the Secretary from reducing operations 
within the Coast Guard's Civil Engineering Program except as 
specifically authorized by a statute enacted after the date of 
enactment of this Act. The House proposed no similar provision.
      Section 525. A provision proposed by the House and Senate

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

   DIVISION E--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED 
                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2012

      The following statement is an explanation of the effects 
of Division E, which makes appropriations for the Department of 
the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the 
Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, and related agencies 
for fiscal year 2012. Language contained in House Report 112-
151 providing specific guidance to agencies regarding the 
administration of appropriated funds and any corresponding 
reporting requirements carries the same emphasis as the 
language included in this explanatory statement and should be 
complied with unless specifically addressed to the contrary 
herein.
      In instances where the House report speaks more broadly 
to policy issues or offers views that are subject to 
interpretation, such views remain those of the House and do not 
reflect the views of the conferees unless otherwise repeated in 
this statement. In cases where the House report or the 
statement of managers directs the submission of a report, such 
report is to be submitted to both the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations. Where this explanatory statement 
refers to the Committees or the Committees on Appropriations, 
unless otherwise noted, this reference is to the House 
Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies and 
the Senate Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related 
Agencies.
      The conferees expect that each department and agency 
funded in this Act will follow the directions set forth in this 
Act and the accompanying statement, and will not reallocate 
resources or reorganize activities except as provided herein or 
otherwise approved by the Committees through the reprogramming 
process as described in this report. Funding levels for 
appropriations by account, program, and activity, with 
comparisons to the fiscal year 2011 enacted level and the 
fiscal year 2012 budget request, can be found in the table at 
the end of this division.
      Unless expressly stated otherwise, any reference to 
``this Act'' or ``at the end of this statement'' shall be 
treated as referring only to the provisions of this division.
      Oversight--The EPA, Forest Service, and Department of the 
Interior are directed to report to the Committee no later than 
60 days following enactment of this Act on steps taken to 
address management weaknesses and implement reforms identified 
by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and each agency's 
IG during House oversight hearings held on March 1, 2011 
(Department of the Interior); March 2, 2011 (EPA); and March 
10, 2011 (U.S. Forest Service).
      Making Litigation Costs Transparent--The EPA, Forest 
Service, and Department of the Interior are directed to provide 
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, and make 
publicly available no later than 60 days after enactment, 
detailed Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) fee information as 
specified in House Report 112-151.
      Reprogramming Guidelines--The following are the 
procedures governing reprogramming actions for programs and 
activities funded in the Department of the Interior, 
Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.
      Definitions.--``Reprogramming,'' as defined in these 
procedures, includes the reallocation of funds from one budget 
activity, budget line-item or program area, to another within 
any appropriation funded in this Act. In cases where the House 
Committee report displays an allocation of an appropriation 
below that level, that more detailed level shall be the basis 
for reprogramming.
      For construction, land acquisition, and forest legacy 
accounts, a reprogramming constitutes the reallocation of 
funds, including unobligated balances, from one construction, 
land acquisition, or forest legacy project to another such 
project.
      A reprogramming shall also consist of any significant 
departure from the program described in the agency's budget 
justifications. This includes proposed reorganizations, 
especially those of significant national or regional 
importance, even without a change in funding. Any change to the 
organization table presented in the budget justification shall 
be subject to this requirement.
      General Guidelines for Reprogramming.--
      (a) A reprogramming should be made only when an 
unforeseen situation arises, and then only if postponement of 
the project or the activity until the next appropriation year 
would result in actual loss or damage.
      (b) Any project or activity, which may be deferred 
through reprogramming, shall not later be accomplished by means 
of further reprogramming, but instead, funds should again be 
sought for the deferred project or activity through the regular 
appropriations process.
      (c) Except under the most urgent situations, 
reprogramming should not be employed to initiate new programs 
or increase allocations specifically denied or limited by 
Congress, or to decrease allocations specifically increased by 
the Congress.
      (d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations for approval shall be 
considered approved 30 calendar days after receipt if the 
Committees have posed no objection. However, agencies will be 
expected to extend the approval deadline if specifically 
requested by either Committee.
      Criteria and Exceptions.--A reprogramming must be 
submitted to the Committees in writing prior to implementation 
if it exceeds $1,000,000 annually or results in an increase or 
decrease of more than 10 percent annually in affected programs, 
with the following exceptions:
      (a) With regard to the tribal priority allocations of the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs, there is no restriction on 
reprogrammings among these programs. However, the Bureau shall 
report on all reprogrammings made during a given fiscal year no 
later than 60 days after the end of the fiscal year.
      (b) With regard to the EPA, State and Tribal Assistance 
Grants account, the Committee does not require reprogramming 
requests associated with States and Tribes Partnership Grants.
      Assessments.--``Assessment'' as defined in these 
procedures shall refer to any charges, reserves, or holdbacks 
applied to a budget activity or budget line item for costs 
associated with general agency administrative costs, overhead 
costs, working capital expenses, or contingencies.
      (a) No assessment shall be levied against any program, 
budget activity, sub-activity, budget line item, or project 
funded by the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act unless such assessment and the basis 
therefore are presented to the Committees on Appropriations in 
the budget justifications and are subsequently approved by the 
Committees. The explanation for any assessment in the budget 
justification shall show the amount of the assessment, the 
activities assessed, and the purpose of the funds.
      (b) Proposed changes to estimated assessments, as such 
estimates were presented in annual budget justifications, shall 
be submitted through the reprogramming process and shall be 
subject to the same dollar and reporting criteria as any other 
reprogramming.
      (c) The conferees direct that each agency or bureau which 
utilizes assessments shall submit an annual report to the 
Committees which provides details on the use of all funds 
assessed from any other budget activity, line item, sub-
activity, or project.
      (d) In no case shall contingency funds or assessments be 
used to finance projects and activities disapproved or limited 
by Congress, or to finance programs or activities that could be 
foreseen and included in the normal budget review process.
      (e) New programs requested in the budget should not be 
initiated before enactment of the bill without notification to, 
and the approval of, the Committees on Appropriations. This 
restriction applies to all such actions regardless of whether a 
formal reprogramming of funds is required to begin the program.
      Quarterly Reports.--All reprogrammings between budget 
activities, budget line-items, program areas, or the more 
detailed activity levels shown in the Statement of the 
Managers, including those below the monetary thresholds 
established above, shall be reported to the Committees within 
60 days of the end of each quarter and shall include cumulative 
totals for each budget activity, budget line item, or 
construction, land acquisition, or forest legacy project.
      Land Acquisitions, Easements, and Forest Legacy.--Lands 
shall not be acquired for more than the approved appraised 
value (as addressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91-646), 
unless such acquisitions are submitted to the Committees on 
Appropriations for approval in compliance with these 
procedures.
      Land Exchanges.--Land exchanges, wherein the estimated 
value of the Federal lands to be exchanged is greater than 
$1,000,000, shall not be consummated until the Committees have 
had a 30-day period in which to examine the proposed exchange. 
In addition, the Committees shall be provided advance 
notification of exchanges valued between $500,000 and 
$1,000,000.
      Budget Structure.--The budget activity or line item 
structure for any agency appropriation account shall not be 
altered without advance approval of the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations.

                  TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

                       BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT

                   MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES

      The bill provides $961,900,000 for Management of Lands 
and Resources. The conferees also provide the following 
directions:
      Wild Horse and Burro Management.--The bill provides 
$75,008,000 for wild horse and burro management. The Bureau of 
Land Management is encouraged to take all necessary steps to 
keep costs under control for this program.
      Range Management.--The bill increases funding to address 
numerous challenges including completion of grazing permit 
renewals; hiring of seasonal employees to ensure timely turn-
out of livestock; annual and trend monitoring of grazing 
allotments; and improving the quality of Bureau work on 
environmental and other documents related to livestock grazing, 
among other range management activities.
      Native Plant Program.--The conferees are supportive of 
the Bureau of Land Management's existing plant conservation and 
native plant materials program and expect the Bureau to 
continue to support a robust program through resources provided 
under various accounts, including land management, wildlife 
management and threatened/endangered species.
      Wildlife and Fisheries.--Funding is included throughout 
Bureau of Land Management line items for sage grouse habitat 
monitoring and updating Resource Management Plans to conserve 
the sage grouse. The Bureau should prioritize research related 
to White Nose Syndrome in bats and the inventory and monitoring 
of bat resources on Bureau-administered lands.
      Energy and Minerals.--The conferees are concerned by 
rising energy prices and believe domestic energy production 
must increase while also being mindful of the environment and 
other competing land uses. To better track royalty payments, 
the Department should consider integrating systems that would 
allow for remote monitoring and third party verification of 
Bureau production. The conferees recommend that the Bureau of 
Land Management continue its policy of keeping renewable energy 
projects off lands that were donated for conservation 
regardless of deed status.
      Resource Protection and Maintenance.--The bill provides 
$101,707,000 for resource protection and maintenance. Within 
resource management planning, the Bureau should allocate at 
least $5,000,000 toward revisions of the Resource Management 
Plans that contain sage grouse habitat.
      In coordination with the Desert Renewable Energy 
Conservation Plan process, the Secretary is instructed to 
complete a report evaluating the possible Solar Energy Study 
Areas in the West Mojave that respect designated off-road 
vehicle routes and provide the report to the Committee on 
Appropriations within ninety days of enactment of this Act.
      In the case of any land exchange involving public land 
carried out directly or through a third-party, the Bureau of 
Land Management is directed to provide written notice of the 
proposed land exchange to each owner of non-Federal land 
adjoining a parcel of public land proposed for exchange and 
each owner of non-Federal land adjoining the non-Federal land 
proposed to be acquired in the exchange. The Secretary shall 
determine adjoining landowners using the most recent available 
tax records.

                              CONSTRUCTION

      The bill provides $3,576,000 for Construction of which 
$2,019,000 is for line item projects. The amount provided will 
fully fund construction projects as prioritized by the Bureau 
pursuant to the Administration's revised request list provided 
to the Committees on June 24, 2011. Requests for reprogramming 
will be considered pursuant to the guidelines in the front of 
this statement.

                            LAND ACQUISITION

      The bill provides $22,380,000 for Land Acquisition, of 
which $1,880,000 is for Acquisition Management; $1,500,000 is 
for Inholdings, Emergencies, and Hardships; and $19,000,000 is 
for Acquisitions.
      This amount will fully fund projects 1 through 5 as 
prioritized by the Bureau pursuant to the Administration's 
revised request list provided to the Committees on June 24, 
2011. Requests for reprogramming will be considered pursuant to 
the guidelines in the front of this statement.

                   OREGON AND CALIFORNIA GRANT LANDS

      The bill provides $112,043,000 for Oregon and California 
Grant Lands.

                           RANGE IMPROVEMENTS

      The bill provides $10,000,000 to be derived from public 
lands receipts and Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act lands grazing 
receipts.

               SERVICE CHARGES, DEPOSITS, AND FORFEITURES

      The bill provides an indefinite appropriation estimated 
to be $32,125,000 for Service Charges, Deposits, and 
Forfeitures.

                       MISCELLANEOUS TRUST FUNDS

      The bill provides an indefinite appropriation estimated 
to be $19,700,000 for Miscellaneous Trust Funds.

                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

      The bill includes the administrative provisions as 
proposed by the conferees.

                UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE

                          RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

      The bill provides $1,228,142,000 for Resource Management. 
The detailed allocation of funding by activity and program 
element is included in the table at the end of this statement. 
The conferees have assumed administrative savings proposed in 
the budget request but have not provided requested funding 
increases for fixed costs or general program increases. In 
addition to the guidance and reporting requirements included in 
the House report, as noted in the front of this joint 
explanatory statement, the conference agreement includes the 
following directions:
      Ecosystem Initiatives.--The conferees are aware that the 
budget request includes new funding for a number of regional 
restoration initiatives, including the Chesapeake Bay, Gulf 
Coast, Bay Delta, and the Everglades. Due to funding 
limitations, the conferees are not able to include new funding 
for these initiatives within the program levels below. However, 
subject to reprogramming limitations, the conferees do not 
object to these initiatives being funded within the levels 
provided if the Service is able to identify funding offsets 
from lower priority items.
      Endangered Species.--The bill includes $176,237,000 for 
Endangered Species. Listing and Critical Habitat is funded at 
the fiscal year 2011 enacted level of $20,902,000; however, the 
conferees have agreed to combine the funding for activities 
within this program element in order to provide the Service 
with additional flexibility to target funding to its highest 
priorities. Consultation and HCPs are funded at $61,041,000, of 
which $2,000,000 is for renewable energy as requested. Recovery 
is funded at $82,939,000, of which $2,000,000 is for the 
declining species initiative instead of the requested 
$4,000,000.
      The conferees direct the Service to fund white nose 
syndrome research and response activities at no less than 
$4,000,000 from within Recovery. Funds should be used to: (1) 
increase research capacity to fund basic and applied research 
to stop the spread of the disease; (2) provide funding for 
States to implement response activities; and (3) increase FWS 
capacity for surveillance, monitoring and coordination 
activities. The conferees expect these activities to be 
coordinated with other Federal partners.
      The conferees direct the Service to provide $1,000,000 
from within Recovery to reinstate a livestock loss 
demonstration program as authorized by Public Law 111-11. 
States with de-listed wolf populations shall continue to be 
eligible for funding, provided that those States continue to 
meet the eligibility criteria contained in Public Law 111-11.
      The conferees recommend that the Service and Federal 
action agencies take into account economic impacts when 
formulating actions and conducting all section 7 consultations 
pursuant to the Santa Ana Sucker Critical Habitat designation, 
to the extent authorized under the Endangered Species Act. The 
economic impacts to be considered by the Service and Federal 
action agencies should include the costs of local water supply 
development and imported water costs, infrastructure needs, 
water conservation efforts, and efforts to increase employment 
in the region affected by the Santa Ana Sucker Critical Habitat 
designation.
      The conferees are concerned that the Service's region 6 
has a backlog of Endangered Species Act section 7 consultations 
on long-term planning documents to assess grizzly bears, bull 
trout and their habitats. The conferees urge the Service to 
assign appropriate resources and staff, including filling any 
current vacancies, to support timely completion of those 
consultations.
      Northern Rocky Mountain Multispecies Conservation 
Agreements Initiative.--The conferees recommend that the Fish 
and Wildlife Service convene a regional policy coordination and 
outreach effort to improve upon and increase the use of 
Endangered Species Act conservation agreements between the 
agency, the States, and private landowners. Nearly two-thirds 
of the nation's land is privately owned, and the Service cannot 
accomplish its conservation goals without the help of private 
landowners. Conservation agreements between non-Federal 
landowners and the Service help to conserve listed or at-risk 
species while offering a level of protection from certain 
Endangered Species Act actions. The conferees recognize the 
challenges that private landowners often face when confronted 
with working with a Federal regulatory agency such as the 
Service, and believe that the States can play a strong 
intermediary role. The conferees recommend that the Service 
work with the northern Rocky Mountain States and a diverse 
coalition of private landowners to find innovative, 
multispecies, multi-partner approaches to utilizing 
conservation agreements that simplify the process for private 
landowners; that empower the States to work directly with 
private landowners to set up the agreements; and that recognize 
the Service's final authority. The conferees request that the 
States and the coalition report to the Committees with 
recommendations as to how to improve upon and increase the use 
of conservation agreements.
      Habitat Conservation.--The bill provides $110,814,000 for 
Habitat Conservation. Partners for Fish and Wildlife is funded 
at $54,856,000, of which $6,000,000 is for the climate change 
initiative instead of the requested $8,000,000. Conservation 
Planning Assistance is funded at $35,837,000, of which 
$2,000,000 is for renewable energy as requested.
      In carrying out its renewable energy consultations, the 
conferees direct the Service to continue coordinating with 
other agencies within the Department of the Interior, as well 
as with the Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, and 
other Federal and State agencies, to ensure that the 
investments support the further development of the renewable 
energy industry, including the creation of an offshore wind 
manufacturing industry and related jobs in the United States.
      The conferees support the Secretary's decision to 
establish an office that will be focused on Endangered Species 
Act compliance for renewable energy projects. In order to 
facilitate better species protection and stewardship of public 
resources, the conferees expect that this office will develop 
permitting policies that make it less difficult and time-
consuming to permit projects on disturbed private lands than on 
pristine public lands. The conferees are aware that the Service 
has begun work on a rule under section 4(d) of the Endangered 
Species Act to address this concern, but the Service has not 
yet released a draft. The conferees expect the Service to 
publish its draft and final rules to address this issue during 
fiscal year 2012. The conferees are aware that the Service is 
exploring opportunities to expedite the permitting of renewable 
energy projects and support efforts by the Service to establish 
a pilot fee program using the Service's existing authorities. 
The Service is expected to provide a report within 120 days of 
enactment of this Act that details how and where the Service 
plans to institute fees in fiscal year 2012 to improve program 
delivery and customer service.
      National Wildlife Refuge System.--The bill includes 
$486,469,000 for the National Wildlife Refuge System. Wildlife 
and Habitat Management is funded at $223,797,000, of which 
$1,000,000 is for a pilot program to eradicate feral swine on 
national wildlife refuges; and $20,000,000 is for climate 
change inventory and monitoring, as requested. Conservation 
Planning is funded at $11,723,000, which is an increase of 
$3,440,000 above the request in order to maintain funding for 
land protection planning within this program element instead of 
within Land Acquisition, as was proposed.
      The conferees are concerned about particular restrictions 
on overnight houseboat accommodations at concessionaire-
operated marinas. In keeping with Executive Order 12866, the 
conferees direct the Service to carefully consider the impact 
to concessionaires of such operational changes.
      The conferees are aware of local concerns regarding the 
implementation of certain management activities on the Willapa 
National Wildlife Refuge and direct the Service to postpone the 
implementation of those sections of the Final Comprehensive 
Conservation Plan and Environmental Impact Statement for the 
refuge that deal with the removal of the dikes at the Porter 
Point Unit, Reikkola Unit, and Lewis Unit of the refuge until 
at least April 1, 2012, in order to give the Service more time 
to work with stakeholders to address the concerns.
      Migratory Birds, Law Enforcement and International 
Conservation.--The bill includes $126,769,000 for Migratory 
Birds, Law Enforcement, and International Conservation. 
Migratory Bird Management is funded at $51,535,000, which 
includes a decrease of $1,366,000 from the request for the 
North American Waterfowl Management Plan and a general program 
decrease of $1,522,000.
      Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Conservation.--The bill 
includes $135,534,000 for Fisheries and Aquatic Resource 
Conservation. National Fish Hatchery System Operations is 
funded at $46,149,000. The conferees have restored the proposed 
$3,388,000 shortfall in the budget for mitigation hatchery 
operations and critical supplies. An additional $3,800,000 is 
appropriated elsewhere in this consolidated Act for the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers to reimburse the Service. Together, 
these amounts fully fund mitigation hatcheries operated by the 
Service for the Corps, Tennessee Valley Authority, Bureau of 
Reclamation's Central Utah Project and the Bonneville Power 
Administration. The conferees support efforts by the Service to 
recover costs of programs that are conducted to mitigate the 
environmental effects of other Federal partners. However, 
future budget requests must ensure that Federal partners have 
committed to make sufficient funding available to reimburse the 
Service before the Service proposes to eliminate funding for 
mitigation hatcheries so that operations at these hatcheries 
are not disrupted.
      Aquatic Habitat and Species Conservation is funded at 
$71,325,000. The bill includes $1,000,000 towards the 
implementation of mandatory operational inspection and 
decontamination stations at Federally-managed or 
interjurisdictional water bodies considered to be of highest 
risk, as called for in the February 2010 Quagga-Zebra Mussel 
Action Plan for Western U.S. Waters. An additional $1,000,000 
is included to continue and expand funding for the control and 
eradication of zebra and quagga mussels and other aquatic 
invasive species, including funding for State aquatic invasive 
species management plans. Also included is a $2,000,000 
increase above the fiscal year 2011 enacted level for Asian 
carp monitoring and eradication activities.
      Cooperative Landscape Conservation and Adaptive 
Science.--The bill includes $32,250,000 for Cooperative 
Landscape Conservation and Adaptive Science. The conferees 
recognize that fish and wildlife conservation organizations are 
facing increasingly complex ecological and fiscal challenges 
that require resource threats to be addressed in a more 
efficient and effective way. In light of these challenges, the 
Service has established a network of Landscape Conservation 
Cooperatives (LCCs) with other Federal, State, local and tribal 
partners to better leverage conservation resources and better 
prioritize and coordinate research and program delivery. The 
conferees support these efforts but also expect the Service to 
establish clear goals, objectives and measurable outcomes for 
LCCs that can be used as benchmarks of success of the program. 
Further, the conferees direct the Service to clearly articulate 
how it plans to integrate its LCCs with other successful 
regional partnerships, including its Joint Ventures and Fish 
Habitat Partnerships programs, as well as with other Federal 
and non-Federal partners, including the U.S. Geological 
Survey's regional Climate Science Centers, the Cooperative Fish 
and Wildlife Research Units, and the Cooperative Ecosystem 
Studies Units.
      Bill Language.--The bill includes language to cap 
expenditures at $7,472,000 for critical habitat designations; 
$1,500,000 for listing species that are indigenous to the 
United States; and $1,500,000 for listing foreign species. The 
bill includes language providing for fiscal year 2012 and 
hereafter: $400,000 for certain law enforcement activities; and 
$1,000,000 for certain environmental contaminant activities.

                              CONSTRUCTION

      The bill includes $23,088,000 for Construction, as 
requested, of which $12,149,000 is for line item projects. The 
amount provided will fully fund the projects as prioritized by 
the Service pursuant to the Administration's revised request 
list provided to the Committees on June 24, 2011. Requests for 
reprogramming will be considered pursuant to the guidelines in 
the front of this statement.

                            LAND ACQUISITION

      The bill provides $54,720,000 for Land Acquisition. The 
conference agreement includes $5,000,000 for the Highlands 
Conservation Act; $10,555,000 for Acquisition Management; 
$2,000,000 for User Pay Cost Share; $2,500,000 for exchanges; 
$4,500,000 for Inholdings, Emergencies, and Hardships; and 
$30,165,000 for Acquisitions. The conferees have rejected the 
proposal to transfer land protection planning funds from the 
Resource Management account.
      The amount provided for Acquisitions will fully fund 
projects 1 through 13 as prioritized by the Service pursuant to 
the Administration's revised request list provided to the 
Committees on June 24, 2011. Requests for reprogramming will be 
considered pursuant to the guidelines in the front of this 
statement.
      The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture are 
directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations within 
180 days of enactment of this Act on potential exchange 
proposals for approximately 1,700 acres currently managed by 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and generally depicted on a 
map titled ``The Sharkey Restoration Research Site, Delta NF,'' 
for lands of equal or approximate value managed by the U.S. 
Forest Service in Mississippi.
      Bill Language.--The bill includes language allowing the 
Service to fund limited administrative costs for the Highlands 
Conservation Act program administration. Also included is 
language providing that no funds appropriated for specific 
projects may be used for overhead, planning or other management 
costs.

            COOPERATIVE ENDANGERED SPECIES CONSERVATION FUND

      The bill provides $47,757,000 for the Cooperative 
Endangered Species Conservation Fund. The detailed allocation 
of funding by activity is included in the table at the end of 
this statement.
      Bill Language.--The bill includes language deriving 
$22,757,000 from the Cooperative Endangered Species 
Conservation Fund and $25,000,000 from the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund.

                     NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE FUND

      The bill provides $13,980,000 for payments to counties 
authorized by the National Wildlife Refuge Fund.

               NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS CONSERVATION FUND

      The bill provides $35,554,000 for the North American 
Wetlands Conservation Fund.

                NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION

      The bill provides $3,792,000 for Neotropical Migratory 
Bird Conservation.

                MULTINATIONAL SPECIES CONSERVATION FUND

      The bill provides $9,481,000 for the Multinational 
Species Conservation Fund. The detailed allocation of funding 
by activity is included in the table at the end of this 
statement.

                    STATE AND TRIBAL WILDLIFE GRANTS

      The bill provides $61,421,000 for State and Tribal 
Wildlife Grants, of which $51,405,000 is for State formula 
grants, $5,741,000 is for State competitive grants, and 
$4,275,000 is for tribal competitive grants. The Service is 
directed to report to the Committees within 90 days of 
enactment of this Act on the amounts of unobligated and 
reapportioned funds, by State and Territory, for fiscal years 
2008, 2009, and 2010. The conferees encourage the Service and 
the program partners to complete the Wildlife TRACS database so 
that the program can better demonstrate its ability to prevent 
at-risk species from having to be listed under the Endangered 
Species Act.
      Bill Language.--The bill includes language requiring a 25 
percent non-Federal cost share for planning grants and a 35 
percent non-Federal cost share for implementation grants. Bill 
language is included allowing unobligated balances to be 
reapportioned.

                         NATIONAL PARK SERVICE

                 OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM

      The bill provides $2,240,152,000 for the Operation of the 
National Park System account.
      Civil War Sesquicentennial.--In observances marking the 
150th anniversary of the Civil War, the Service is urged to 
recognize the historic, social, legal, racial, cultural and 
political forces that caused the Civil War and influenced its 
course and outcomes.
      Technical Assistance.--The Service is encouraged to 
support the effort of NPS retirees to provide volunteer 
technical assistance to national parks in other countries.
      Historic Leases.--The Service is encouraged to pursue the 
use of cost-effective, innovative solutions like historic 
leases when practical and when the arrangement comports with a 
park unit's enabling legislation.
      Flight 93 Memorial.--The conferees remain firmly 
committed to the timely completion of the Flight 93 Memorial 
and direct the Service to devote the resources necessary to 
properly archive, maintain, and preserve the invaluable 
collections, including 50,000 personal tributes and 2,000 hours 
of audio interviews, associated with this memorial.
      National Capitol Area Performing Arts Program.--The 
conferees direct the Service to maintain funding for the 
National Capital Area Performing Arts Program and have included 
$612,000 for the summer concert series staged on the U.S. 
Capitol grounds.
      Cuyahoga Valley National Park.--The Service is encouraged 
to continue its work with surrounding communities to support 
the local road systems and establish maintenance priorities.
      Statue of Liberty and Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial 
and Visitor Center.--The conferees have provided an increase of 
$1,100,000 as requested within Park Protection for additional 
Park Police protection at the Statue of Liberty and Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Memorial.
      Sequoia National Park.--The conference agreement does not 
include report language contained in the House report nor bill 
language proposed by the Senate directing the Department of the 
Interior to report on the methodology used in calculating 
hydropower fees on National Park Service lands. The conferees 
understand that this issue has been settled and the need for 
the report no longer exists.
      Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and Middle 
Delaware National Scenic and Recreational River, Appalachian 
National Scenic Trail.--The conferees are concerned about 
delays in completing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
announced by the National Park Service and the Department of 
the Interior regarding improvement of electric transmission 
lines partially lying within the boundaries of the Delaware 
Water Gap National Recreation Area. The National Park Service 
and the Department are directed to adhere to the previously 
announced schedule and publish a final Record of Decision (ROD) 
by October of 2012.
      Historic Properties.--The conferees are concerned that a 
proposal to remove the Fresnel lens currently installed at the 
Block Island Southeast Lighthouse in Rhode Island will have an 
adverse impact on this historic property. As such, the 
conferees direct the Service to report to and consult with the 
Committees on Appropriations prior to facilitating the transfer 
of the lens or accepting the lens for display at any unit 
within the System.
      Point Reyes National Seashore.--The conferees are aware 
that the Service will shortly be issuing a Draft Environmental 
Impact Statement (DEIS) regarding a possible 10-year extension 
for oyster operations at Point Reyes National Seashore. Because 
of concerns relating to the validity of the science underlying 
the DEIS, the conferees direct the National Academy of Sciences 
to assess the data, analysis, and conclusions in the DEIS in 
order to ensure there is a solid scientific foundation for the 
Final Environmental Impact Statement expected in mid-2012.

                  NATIONAL RECREATION AND PRESERVATION

      The bill provides $59,975,000 for the National Recreation 
and Preservation account with the following specific directive:
      Heritage Partnership Program.--The bill provides an 
increase of $8,408,000 above the request to maintain funding at 
the fiscal year 2011 enacted level.

                       HISTORIC PRESERVATION FUND

      The bill provides $56,000,000 for the Historic 
Preservation Fund account with the following specific 
directive:
      State and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices.--The bill 
provides $47,000,000 for State Historic Preservation Offices 
and $9,000,000 for Tribal Historic Preservation Offices.

                              CONSTRUCTION

                    (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

      The bill provides $159,621,000 for the Construction 
account.
      Line Item Construction. The bill provides $77,847,000 in 
funding for line item construction projects. The amount 
provided will fully fund NPS construction projects as 
prioritized by the Service pursuant to the Administration's 
revised request list provided to the Committees on June 24, 
2011. Requests for reprogramming will be considered pursuant to 
the guidelines in the front of this statement.
      Washington Monument Stabilization and Repair, National 
Capital Region.--The bill provides a total of $7,500,000 for 
the stabilization and repair of the Washington Monument. The 
conferees understand these funds will be matched on a 1:1 basis 
by a private citizen. The conferees have also included language 
allowing the National Park Service to enter into a single 
procurement for repairs to the Washington Monument.
      Special Resource Studies.--The conferees urge the Service 
to complete previously authorized studies before initiating any 
new studies.

                    LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND

                              (RESCISSION)

      The bill rescinds $30,000,000, as in previous years, in 
annual contract authority. There are no plans to use this 
authority in fiscal year 2012.

                 LAND ACQUISITION AND STATE ASSISTANCE

      The bill provides $102,060,000 for Land Acquisition and 
State Assistance, of which $9,000,000 is for the American 
Battlefield Protection Program; $9,500,000 is for Acquisition 
Management; $5,000,000 is for Inholdings and Exchanges; 
$3,000,000 is for Emergencies and Hardships; and $30,560,000 is 
for Federal Acquisitions. The State Assistance Grant Program is 
funded at $45,000,000, of which $2,794,000 is for 
Administrative Expenses.
      The amount provided for Federal Acquisitions will fully 
fund the first two projects as prioritized by the Service 
pursuant to the Administration's revised request list provided 
to the Committees on June 24, 2011. Requests for reprogramming 
will be considered pursuant to the guidelines in the front of 
this statement.

                    UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY

                 SURVEYS, INVESTIGATIONS, AND RESEARCH

      The bill provides $1,069,744,000 for Surveys, 
Investigations, and Research of the U.S. Geological Survey. The 
detailed allocation of funding by activity and sub-activity is 
included in the table at the end of this statement and comports 
with the requested budget structure realignment. Unless 
otherwise indicated below, the conferees have accepted the 
proposals for reductions resulting from Department-wide 
efficiencies, administrative savings, and Enterprise Publishing 
Network savings. A decrease of $2,172,000 to the request has 
been assumed to reflect changes in the final fiscal year 2011 
operating plan, which was not available at the time the request 
was submitted. Support for ecosystem restoration activities 
throughout the Survey's programs is maintained at the fiscal 
year 2011 enacted level. Additional changes to the request are 
specified below.
      Ecosystems.--The bill provides $161,536,000 for 
Ecosystems activities. Increases above the enacted level 
include $1,500,000 for The Chesapeake Bay Executive Order and 
$2,500,000 for the Great Lakes Asian Carp Control Framework. 
The conferees support the President's budget proposal to 
conduct an in-depth analysis of the extent and sources of 
endocrine disrupting chemicals impacting fish and wildlife in 
the Chesapeake basin.
      Climate and Land Use Change.--The bill provides 
$144,320,000 for Climate and Land Use Change programs. Within 
Climate Variability, changes to the request include decreases 
of $2,000,000 from Research and Development, and $6,460,000 
from Science Support for DOI Bureaus. Carbon Sequestration is 
funded at $9,000,000.
      Within Land Use Change, an increase of $11,500,000 is 
provided to complete funding for Landsat 8 ground operations 
development. The conferees have not agreed with the proposal to 
create a separate ``Land Imaging'' account and have instead 
maintained funding for all satellite operations within this 
subactivity. Estimated administrative savings assumed in the 
proposed new account have been assumed within the Land Use 
Change account instead.
      The conferees have not agreed to transfer budgetary 
authority for the launch of Landsat satellites 9 and 10 from 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to the 
Survey. Of the requested $48,000,000 increase for its 
implementation, the conferees have provided $2,000,000 for 
program development only. The conferees note that future 
requests for the project are estimated by the Administration to 
escalate to over $400,000,000 by fiscal year 2014. There is 
little doubt that resources will not be available within the 
Interior Appropriations bill to support these very large 
increases without decimating all other Survey programs. The 
conferees note that the launch of Landsat 9 is not scheduled 
until 2018. This allows time in the year ahead for all 
interested parties to re-examine how to proceed with future 
Landsat missions. In the conferees' view this would be a 
prudent step, inasmuch as the current budget proposal is based 
on a report from the Office of Science and Technology Policy 
issued in 2008, and both technological advances and a vastly 
different economic environment may point to other, less costly, 
options for obtaining Landsat data.
      Energy, Minerals, and Environmental Health.--The bill 
provides $96,368,000 for Energy, Minerals, and Environmental 
Health. The following amounts have been restored to ongoing 
programs that were proposed to be reduced in the request: 
$250,000 for the Minerals External Research Program; $5,000,000 
for Minerals Resources; $1,000,000 for Energy Resources; 
$500,000 for Contaminants; and $2,500,000 for Toxic Substances 
Hydrology. An increase of $1,000,000 is provided for the New 
Energy Frontier initiative.
      Natural Hazards.--The bill provides $134,696,000 for 
Natural Hazards. The conferees have not agreed to proposed 
reductions in the request and have restored funds to the 
following programs: $2,000,000 for Earthquake Grants; 
$1,800,000 for the 2012 Multi-Hazards Initiative; and 
$1,500,000 for the National Volcano Early Warning System. 
Decreases from the request include $800,000 from the 2011 
Multi-Hazards Initiative, and $3,000,000 from Coastal and 
Marine Spatial Planning.
      Water Resources.--The bill provides $214,996,000 for 
Water Resources. Funding has been restored for the following 
programs that were proposed to be reduced in the request: 
$2,000,000 for Groundwater Resources; $6,049,000 for the 
National Water Quality Assessment Program; $1,963,000 for the 
Cooperative Water Program; and $6,500,000 for the Water 
Resources Research Act Program. A program increase of 
$2,846,000 above the request is provided for the National 
Streamflow Information Program. Decreases from the request 
include $2,500,000 from the WaterSMART initiative within 
Hydrologic Networks and Analysis. The conferees encourage the 
Survey to include with its fiscal year 2013 budget request a 
proposal to establish a national groundwater monitoring network 
as authorized by the Secure Water Act.
      Core Science Systems.--The bill provides $106,849,000 for 
Core Science Systems. Increases to the request include $998,000 
for the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation 
Program to continue funding at the current year enacted level, 
and $1,500,000 for National Cooperative Geologic Mapping 
Federal and State Partnerships to partially restore the 
proposed reduction to that program. Decreases from the request 
include $500,000 from WaterSMART.
      Administration and Enterprise Information.--The bill 
provides $110,397,000 for Administration and Enterprise 
Information. There is a decrease from the request of $5,920,000 
for separation costs. This amount is significantly below what 
the Survey would need to implement its proposed reduction in 
force. If a similar plan is put forward in future budget 
requests, the conferees expect that sufficient funds will be 
requested for its implementation.
      Facilities.--The bill provides $100,582,000 for 
Facilities. The conferees do not agree with the 
administration's proposal to create a separate ``Construction'' 
line item within the budget and consequently have maintained 
those funds within the ``Deferred Maintenance and Capital 
Improvement'' subactivity. In the conferees' view, the Survey 
has the authorities it requires to manage its facilities and 
space requirements within the current structure.

                   BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT

                        OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT

      The bill provides $59,792,000 for Ocean Energy Management 
to be partially offset with the collection of offsetting rental 
receipts and cost recovery fees totaling $101,082,000. This new 
account funds the activities of the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management, including leasing, environmental studies, economic 
analysis and the Renewable Energy Program. The conferees also 
provide the following directions:
      Renewable Energy.--The bill provides $22,697,000 for 
renewable energy leasing activities, including program 
development, environmental analysis, consultation with Federal, 
State, and local stakeholders, and development of a 
multipurpose marine cadastre. The Director should work with the 
Secretary of Energy and States to exchange information about 
the development of new technology related to the structural 
material, environmental, and design safety criteria, as well as 
design and performance standards, of transitional depth and 
floating wind turbines. The Bureau is expected to continue 
working with coastal States and other stakeholders to study new 
wind energy areas, including in shallow, transitional, and deep 
(over 200 feet) waters.
      Conventional Energy.--The bill provides $47,283,000 for 
conventional oil and gas leasing activities, including planning 
of the Five-year Oil and Gas Leasing Program, surveying Outer 
Continental Shelf boundaries, implementing the lease sale 
process, administering leases, and reviewing exploration and 
development plans.
      Environmental Assessment--The bill provides $62,041,000 
for environmental assessment activities.
      The Bureau is encouraged to continue its efforts in 
working with partners to collect information about methane 
hydrates on the sea floor and the relationships between gas 
hydrates and episodes of sediment instability that may pose a 
threat to the petroleum industry's infrastructure and safety of 
operations.
      Bill Language.--The bill includes in Title IV a general 
provision that amends Sec. 328 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
7627(a)(1)) to transfer air quality permitting authority, as of 
the date of enactment of this Act, from the Environmental 
Protection Agency to the Department of the Interior, giving 
regulatory parity for the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning 
areas with the Western and Central Gulf of Mexico planning 
areas. Paragraph (c) ensures that this change in the issuance 
and administration of air quality requirements will not 
invalidate or stay any permit, or proceeding related thereto, 
which is existing or pending as of the date of enactment of 
this Act.

             BUREAU OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT

             OFFSHORE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT

      The bill provides $61,473,000 for Offshore Safety and 
Environmental Enforcement to be partially offset with the 
collection of offsetting rental receipts, cost recovery fees 
and inspection fees totaling $121,081,000. The conferees also 
provide the following directions:
      Funding has been increased with the expectation that 
much-needed inspectors and engineers will be hired and that 
permits will be processed expeditiously. The highest priority 
for BSEE with the funding appropriated is ensuring safety and 
prompt consideration of permits. Appropriated dollars should 
not be used for expanding regulation of non-lease holders, with 
the exception of those involved in the Deepwater Horizon 
accident, unless approved through reprogramming pursuant to the 
guidelines in the front of this statement.
      Environmental Enforcement.--The bill provides $4,110,000 
for environmental enforcement actions, as requested. Activities 
include environmental compliance activities related to issuing 
permits associated with plans, inspections of environmental 
measures and enforcement of incidences of noncompliance, and 
monitoring industry compliance with mitigation and other 
environmental requirements through office and field 
inspections. With the additional resources provided, 
applications for permits to drill should be processed with all 
due speed.
      Operations, Safety, and Regulation.--The bill provides 
$132,139,000 for operations, safety, and regulation.
      Inspection Fees.--The bill includes in Title IV a general 
provision that provides for the collection of $62,000,000 in 
inspection fees.
      Bill Language.--The bill includes new language requiring 
that at least fifty percent of collected inspection fees are 
dedicated to mission related costs including the review of 
applications for permits to drill.
      The report requested in House Report 112-151 on Deepwater 
Horizon recommendations is no longer required.

                           OIL SPILL RESEARCH

      The bill provides $14,923,000 for Oil Spill Research.

          OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING RECLAMATION AND ENFORCEMENT

                       REGULATION AND TECHNOLOGY

      The bill provides $122,950,000 for Regulation and 
Technology. Within this amount, the bill funds regulatory 
grants at $68,700,000, equal to the fiscal year 2011 enacted 
level. The conferees find the proposal to reduce regulatory 
grants would undermine the State-based regulatory system. It is 
imperative that States continue to operate protective 
regulatory programs as delegation of authority to the States is 
the cornerstone of the surface mining regulatory program. 
Further, the conference agreement does not provide funds to 
expand and enhance Federal oversight activities of State 
programs.
      On October 26, 2011 the Secretary of the Interior issued 
an order to consolidate the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) 
within the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The conferees are 
deeply concerned about the lack of coordination and 
consultation prior to the issuance of this order. Subsequently, 
the Department of the Interior initiated discussions with 
employees, Members of Congress, and stakeholders. Significant 
issues have been identified with this proposed reorganization, 
including questions of the wisdom of attempting to combine 
statutorily created agencies that have responsibilities in law 
that cannot be combined with or transferred to another agency. 
The conferees are aware that on November 28, 2011, the 
Secretary suspended the effective date of his directive in 
order to gather further information on this potential 
restructuring. The conferees expect the Department to enhance 
its consultation and coordination with employees, Members of 
Congress and stakeholders on this matter and to consult with 
the appropriate committees of jurisdiction before any final 
decisions are made.

                    ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION FUND

      The bill provides $27,443,000 for the Abandoned Mine

        BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND BUREAU OF INDIAN EDUCATION

                      Operation of Indian Programs

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The bill provides $2,371,532,000 for the Operation of 
Indian Programs. The detailed allocation of funding by program 
area and activity is included in the table at the end of the 
statement. Specific changes to the request and direction are 
the following:
      Tribal Government.--The bill provides $520,163,000 for 
Tribal Government. Contract Support Costs are funded at the 
fiscal year 2011 enacted level of $219,560,000. Small and Needy 
Tribes are funded at $1,950,000.
      Human Services.--The bill provides $136,579,000 for Human 
Services. Social Services are funded at $34,379,000.
      Trust--Natural Resources Management.--The bill provides 
$157,496,000 for Trust--Natural Resources Management. Rights 
Protection Implementation is funded at $29,022,000, and the 
Tribal Management/Development Program is funded at $7,717,000; 
increases to the fiscal year 2011 enacted level should be 
distributed proportionally across all program elements within 
these two subactivities. Forestry is funded at $43,644,000. 
Water Resources is funded at $10,150,000. Fish, Wildlife, and 
Parks is funded at $11,340,000.
      Trust--Real Estate Services.--The bill provides 
$126,963,000 for Trust--Real Estate Services. Trust Services--
General is funded at $11,000,000. The increase above the 
request is for continued implementation of the Klamath Basin 
Restoration Agreement.
      Education.--The bill provides $796,753,000 for Education. 
Elementary and Secondary Programs (Forward Funded) are funded 
at $523,083,000, of which $391,333,000 is for ISEP Formula 
Funds; $5,286,000 is for ISEP Program Adjustments; $12,051,000 
is for Education Program Enhancements; $52,716,000 is for 
Student Transportation; $15,370,000 is for Early Childhood 
Development; and $46,327,000 is for Administrative Cost Grants. 
Post-Secondary Programs (Forward Funded) are funded at 
$67,401,000. Post-Secondary Programs are funded at $61,533,000, 
of which $18,527,000 is for Haskell and SIPI--an increase of 
$1,153,000 over the request that is to be divided 
proportionally between the two schools.
      Public Safety and Justice.--The bill provides 
$346,778,000 for Public Safety and Justice, an increase of 
$12,688,000 above the fiscal year 2011 enacted level. Law 
Enforcement is funded at $322,460,000, of which $185,315,000 is 
for Criminal Investigations and Police Services; and 
$81,941,000 is for Detention/Corrections. The requested 
increase for Conservation Law Enforcement is not agreed to.
      Indian Employment, Training and Related Services.--The 
bill does not include section 430 of the House bill pertaining 
to Indian employment, training, and related services pursuant 
to Public Law 102-477. This provision was intended to block the 
Administration from continuing with new, unauthorized and 
retroactive policies which run counter to how ``477'' funds 
have been transferred to tribal governments and how funds have 
been audited since the program's inception 19 years ago. The 
conferees have dropped this provision in order to give the 
Administration time to honor its recent commitments to suspend 
new policies while working with Tribes to find alternative 
solutions.
      The conferees understand that recent Administration 
commitments to the Tribes and the Congress include but are not 
limited to the following: that it has engaged the Tribes in a 
new consultative process to address agency and tribal concerns; 
that it has halted any effort to alter the manner and 
conditions under which ``477'' funds have historically been 
transferred to Tribes; that it has indefinitely suspended its 
2009 supplemental audit requirements for any ``477'' program 
audits, covering fiscal years 2009 through 2012, that were not 
completed on or before September 30, 2011; and that annual 
``477'' program audits will continue to comply with the Single 
Audit Act of 1984.
      The conferees expect the Administration to consult with 
Tribes on a government-to-government basis, and to only proceed 
with improvements that reflect general consensus among the 
impacted Tribes and agencies. The P.L. 102-477 Tribal Work 
Group shall be consulted on the precise content of all guidance 
documents and similar issuances prior to their finalization. 
The House and Senate Appropriations Committees will be closely 
monitoring the progress of the consultation process, and will 
expect regular updates from the Administration. If issues 
concerning the transfer and audit of ``477'' funds are not 
permanently resolved administratively, the Committees intend to 
address this issue in the fiscal year 2013 process.
      Other Matters.--The conferees are aware of a lack of 
local support for two recent off-reservation gaming projects in 
Yuba, California, and Madera, California, which received 
Secretarial Determinations on September 1, 2010. The 
evidentiary record provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
indicates that only two of the 33 elected officials or bodies 
that were consulted on these projects expressed support for 
them. The conferees are also concerned that in one case, the 
Department appears to have largely ignored a popular vote which 
indicated a majority of the county was opposed to the 
construction of a casino on the site which was approved by the 
Department. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary to 
review these applications to verify the claim of ``strong local 
support'' and report those findings to the Committees within 60 
days of enactment of this Act.

                              CONSTRUCTION

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The bill provides $123,828,000 for Construction. The 
detailed allocation of funding by program area and activity is 
included in the table at the end of the statement. Specific 
changes to the request are the following:
      Education.--The bill provides $70,940,000 for Education. 
Replacement Schools are funded at $17,836,000, which funds the 
next school on the 2004 priority list. Facilities Improvement 
and Repair is funded at $48,669,000.

 INDIAN LAND AND WATER CLAIM SETTLEMENTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PAYMENTS TO 
                                INDIANS

      The bill provides $32,855,000 for Indian Land and Water 
Claim Settlements and Miscellaneous Payments to Indians, as 
requested. The detailed allocation of funding by subactivity 
and program element is included in the table at the end of the 
statement.

                 INDIAN GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      The bill provides $7,114,000 for the Indian Guaranteed 
Loan Program Account, an increase of $4,000,000 above the 
request. The conferees are aware that there is strong interest 
among tribally owned construction contractors to have the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs offer supplemental surety bond 
guarantees in an effort to increase economic opportunity in 
Indian county, particularly in the construction trades. In an 
effort to begin to respond to this interest, the conferees 
request that the Bureau present a plan within 90 days of 
enactment of this Act detailing the need for such supplemental 
surety bond guarantees, how the Bureau would implement such a 
program, whether or not the Bureau currently has the personnel 
to implement such authorities, and an analysis of how much 
additional activity would be generated through the offering of 
supplemental surety bond guarantees.

                          DEPARTMENTAL OFFICES

                        Office of the Secretary

                        DEPARTMENTAL OPERATIONS

      The bill provides $262,317,000 for Departmental Offices, 
Office of the Secretary, Departmental Operations.
      The bill includes the proposed restructuring of 
Departmental Offices, reflecting the incorporation of the 
Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) and alignment of the 
budget with the Department's organization. The increase over 
the fiscal year 2011 enacted level reflects the move of the 
ONRR from the former Minerals Management Service. The conferees 
direct the Department to continue providing the Committees with 
the level of budget detail that has historically been provided 
(at the office level). Further, the Department is directed to 
provide to the Committees within 120 days of enactment of this 
Act a report on the organization, funding, staffing, and status 
of reforms with the ONRR.
      The conferees direct the Department to work 
collaboratively with interested parties, including the 
Congress, States, local communities, Tribal governments and 
others in making national monument designations.

                            INSULAR AFFAIRS

                       ASSISTANCE TO TERRITORIES

      The bill provides $87,997,000 for Assistance to 
Territories. Within that amount, the bill provides the 
requested increase for staffing, which shall be used by the 
Department to fill positions at current Office of Insular 
Affairs locations rather than at a new location as proposed in 
the request. At least one of the positions shall be dedicated 
to working on Compact impact issues as detailed below. Within 
the resources provided, the conferees urge the Secretary to 
fill the current staffing vacancy in the Federated States of 
Micronesia.
      The bill includes $3,000,000 for insular community 
infrastructure improvements including $791,000 for water 
infrastructure projects and $2,209,000 for the Empowering 
Insular Communities initiative. That amount includes the 
proposed funding levels for Guam infrastructure and $1,089,000 
for sustainable energy strategies projects that will reduce the 
islands' over-dependence on imported oil and high electricity 
prices. Projects shall be chosen based on plans specific to 
each jurisdiction and which are developed and approved in 
conjunction with the Department of Energy and island 
stakeholders, with priority given to energy efficiency projects 
that result in immediate energy savings. The Department is 
directed to report annually to Congress on the status of 
activities funded under this program, including data on oil 
savings and utility rates.
      The bill also provides $5,000,000 to fund discretionary 
grants to jurisdictions that are affected by Compact migration, 
as authorized by section 104(e) of Public Law 108-188. The 
Department shall allocate these grants in conjunction with 
other currently authorized mandatory grants to help offset 
educational costs incurred by these jurisdictions. The 
Department is directed to follow the guidance detailed in 
Senate Report 112-74 related to the Compact of Free Association 
agreements with the governments of the Federated States of 
Micronesia [FSM], the Republic of the Marshall Islands [RMI], 
and the Republic of Palau. The Department shall also meet 
regularly with officials from the Freely Associated States, 
other Federal agencies and affected jurisdictions, and develop 
and implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate the costs of 
Compact migration within 90 days of enactment of this Act. This 
plan shall establish specific goals and action items that 
include: (1) expanding the education of migrants and potential 
migrants in order to reinforce that the primary purpose of the 
Compact migration benefit is to provide educational and 
employment opportunities to FAS citizens, not for migrants to 
develop an over-reliance on public services; (2) improving FAS 
capacity to provide dialysis and other medical services to 
prevent citizens from needing to seek treatment abroad; and (3) 
improving screening procedures to identify and restrict 
migration of individuals who have communicable diseases or who 
have been convicted of serious crimes. The Department is 
directed to monitor the progress of meeting these goals and 
action items and report to Congress every 6 months. The 
Department is also directed to ensure that the new position 
dedicated to Compact impact issues will work closely with 
officials of Compact nations, other Federal areas and affected 
areas to implement Compact impact priorities identified in the 
plan detailed above.
      The conferees urge the Department to continue funding for 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands Initiative on 
Labor, Immigration and Law Enforcement at no less than the 
enacted level.

                      COMPACT OF FREE ASSOCIATION

      The bill provides $17,318,000 which includes $3,318,000 
for obligations related to the Compact of Free Association. The 
conferees have also included language in the Title I general 
provisions section to extend the eligibility for the Republic 
of Palau to receive Federal aid while a new Compact of Free 
Association is enacted by Congress. The amount provided is 
equal to the fiscal year 2011 appropriation.

                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The bill does not include the requested language that 
would provide the Secretary with new authority to redistribute 
capital improvement funds in fiscal year 2012. The conferees 
are similarly focused on the slow spending rates in the 
territories and urge all territories to increase expenditure of 
previously awarded funds. The conferees intend to revisit the 
issue in fiscal year 2013 if expenditure rates have not 
substantially increased.

                        OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The bill provides $66,296,000 for the Office of the 
Solicitor, including the requested increase for the 
Department's ethics office.

General. The detailed allocation of funding by program and 
activity is included in the table at the end of the statement.

           OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL TRUSTEE FOR AMERICAN INDIANS

                         Federal Trust Programs

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The bill provides $152,319,000 for the Office of the 
Special Trustee for American Indians, as requested.
      Bill Language.--The bill includes language, as in 
previous years, limiting the amount of funding that can be used 
for historical accounting.

                        DEPARTMENT-WIDE PROGRAMS

                        Wildland Fire Management

             (INCLUDING TRANSFERS AND RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

      The bill provides $566,495,000 for Department of the 
Interior Wildland Fire Management. The Department is directed 
to use $189,577,000 in carryover emergency fire suppression 
funds before obligating fiscal year 2012 suppression funds. The 
bill includes a rescission of $82,000,000 in suppression carry-
over funds. The amount provided, combined with $92,000,000 in 
the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund, fully funds the 
Department's 10-year average expenditure for fire suppression. 
The bill also terminates the Rural Fire Assistance program. The 
detailed allocation of funding for these accounts is included 
in the table at the end of this statement. The conferees also 
provide the following directions:
      The Department is directed to complete an assessment of 
all Department Wildland Fire programs to determine the most 
cost effective and efficient means of providing comprehensive 
fire management services in support of Department and bureau 
missions and to better direct scarce resources from duplicative 
administrative management organizations. As provided in the 
House Report, the Department is directed to report to the 
Committees on Appropriations no later than 180 days after 
enactment of this Act.
      The Department is directed to remove the requirement that 
ninety percent of hazardous fuels funding be spent in the 
Wildland Urban Interface and instead the conferees direct 
hazardous fuels funding be spent on the highest priority 
projects in the highest priority areas. The Department must 
also work more closely with the Forest Service in developing a 
strategy for the replacement of the current air tanker fleet.
      To reduce the cost of fighting fires in Alaska caused by 
transporting crews from the continental United States, the 
Office of Wildland Fire Coordination and the Bureau of Land 
Management are strongly encouraged to develop a program to 
train crews in Alaska, particularly the existing native crews 
that might not now be qualified as type I or type II wildland 
firefighting crews.

                FLAME WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION RESERVE FUND

Damage Assessment Fund. The detailed allocation of funding by 
activity is included in the table at the end of this statement. 
The conferees are aware that the program is conducting an 
internal review of the status of restoration funds and options 
for enhanced implementation of restoration projects. The 
conferees direct the program to report back to the Committees 
upon completion of this review.

                          WORKING CAPITAL FUND

      The bill provides $62,019,000 for the Department of the

support the Department's ongoing IT transformation. Further, 
the bill provides $2,500,000 for the Department's effort to 
identify operating efficiencies and achieve savings across 
bureaus through consolidation of services, facilities, and

                                TITLE II

                    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

      Budget Restructuring.--The conferees note that the Agency 
has proposed major changes to its budget structure in order to 
better align program goals and outcomes. The conferees have 
accepted the proposed budget restructuring, as reflected in the 
program levels below.
      Congressional Budget Justification.--In addition to the 
three directives provided in the fiscal year 2010 House report 
111-80, the conferees direct the Agency to include in future 
Justifications: a comprehensive, detailed explanation of all 
changes within a program project; a table showing 
consolidations, realignments or other transfers of resources 
and personnel from one program project to another such that the 
outgoing and receiving program projects offset and clearly 
illustrate a transfer of resources; and, a table listing the 
budgets and FTE by major office within each National Program 
Management area with pay/non-pay breakouts. The conferees note 
that the Congressional Justification includes the bill language 
for each account. The conferees direct the Agency to highlight 
and explain any changes to the proposed bill language in the 
Congressional Justification.
      Reprogramming.--The Agency is held to the reprogramming 
limitation of $1,000,000 and should continue to follow the 
reprogramming directives as provided in the fiscal year 2010 
House report 111-80. Further, the Agency may not use any amount 
of deobligated funds to initiate a new program, office, or 
initiative, without the prior approval of the Committees. The 
conferees note that the Agency's reprogramming procedures allow 
the Agency to seek funding to implement its highest-priority 
items if it identifies offsetting funding reductions during the

Agency's real property footprint. The conferees encourage the 
Office of Research and Development (ORD) to institute 
efficiency improvements that will result in long term savings 
using the amounts provided.
      Additional Guidance.--The conferees include the following 
additional guidance with respect to funding provided under this 
account:
      Biocrude Research.--The conferees encourage the Agency to

recommendations of Chapter 7 of the National Research Council's 
Review of the Environmental Protection Agency's Draft IRIS 
Assessment of Formaldehyde into the IRIS process.
      (3) The Agency shall issue a progress report to House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations and relevant Congressional 
authorizing committees no later than March 1, 2012, describing 
its implementation of the National Research Council's Chapter 7 
recommendations for ongoing and new assessments.
      (4) For draft assessments released in fiscal year 2012, 
the Agency shall include documentation describing how the 
Chapter 7 recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences 
(NAS) have been implemented or addressed, including an 
explanation for why certain recommendations were not 
incorporated.
      (5) The Agency shall contract with NAS to conduct up to 
three reviews of IRIS assessments that EPA seeks to make final. 
Reviews shall include an evaluation of whether the 
recommendations it made in previous reviews, including in 
Chapter 7 of the National Research Council's Review of the 
Environmental Protection Agency's Draft IRIS Assessment of 
Formaldehyde, have been implemented. Reviews are not intended 
to unduly delay the Agency's risk assessment process. The 
conferees further direct NAS to complete any reviews authorized 
by this paragraph by no later than 18 months after the date 
that EPA and the NAS have agreed to the terms of the review. 
One of these NAS reviews shall be a study of the cancer and 
non-cancer hazards from oral exposure to inorganic arsenic. The 
NAS review of inorganic arsenic shall incorporate the direction 
provided in House Report 112-151 regarding parameters of the 
study. Additional reviews will be chosen by NAS from a 
representational sample of IRIS assessments and NAS will notify 
Congress directly of these choices.
      (6) Further, the conferees strongly believe any current 
and future IRIS assessments must not only be grounded in sound, 
objective, and peer-reviewed science and methodologies but 
should also provide risk managers with realistic values that 
will result in enhanced protection of human health.

                 ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND MANAGEMENT

      The bill provides $2,682,514,000 for Environmental 
Programs and Management and includes following specific funding 
levels and direction:
      Brownfields.--The bill provides $23,680,000 and funds the 
Smart Growth program as requested.
      Clean Air and Climate.--The bill provides $286,568,000. 
Within this amount the bill provides $99,642,000 for the 
Climate Protection Program.
      The conferees believe EPA may not rely on broad user fee 
authority as the basis for charging Energy Star fees and 
therefore lacks such authority. If EPA wishes to collect user 
fees to offset the costs of the program, such fees should be 
tied to increased performance or service-related goals, and the 
Administration should send a legislative proposal to the 
committees of jurisdiction for consideration in the same manner 
as they have requested for the electronic manifest system and 
pesticide user fees.
      The conferees note that the SmartWay transportation 
program has successfully established a partnership among 
government, businesses, and consumers to reduce fuel 
consumption and improve air quality and supports a robust 
funding level.
      The bill provides $27,343,000 for Federal Stationary 
Source Regulations. From within this amount, EPA is directed to 
spend $5,412,000 on New Source Performance Standards. The 
conferees note that the Administration delayed the issuance of 
new Ozone NAAQS as urged by House Report 112-151.
      The bill provides $123,666,000 for Federal Support for 
Air Quality Management. EPA is directed to spend $3,408,000 of 
this amount on greenhouse gas permitting of stationary sources. 
No new funds have been provided for requested compliance 
monitoring activities.
      Lastly, the bill provides $5,578,000 for Stratospheric 
Ozone. The conferees direct that $1,000,000 shall be for the 
Sunwise program. Other than provided herein, the agreement does 
not include further directives regarding allocation of funds 
for Clean Air and Climate programs, but instead directs the 
Agency to submit an allocation of funds at the program project 
level as part of the operating plan.
      Enforcement.--The bill provides $249,965,000 for 
enforcement activities, with funding for environmental justice 
maintained at the fiscal year 2011 enacted level. The agreement 
does not include further directives regarding allocation of 
funds but instead directs the Agency to submit an allocation of 
funds at the program project level as part of the operating 
plan.
      Environmental Protection: National Priorities.--The bill 
provides $15,000,000 for a competitive grant program to provide 
rural and urban communities with technical assistance to 
improve water quality and provide safe drinking water. EPA 
shall award grants on a competitive basis and give priority to 
not-for-profit organizations that: conduct activities that are 
national in scope; can provide a 10 percent match, including 
in-kind contributions; and are supported by a majority of small 
community water systems, currently provide multi-state regional 
technical assistance, or currently provide assistance to 
private well owners. The Agency is directed to allocate funds 
to grantees within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
      Geographic Programs.--The bill provides $410,375,000, as 
distributed in the table at the end of this division. No funds 
have been provided for the proposed Mississippi River program 
or to continue the Community Action for a Renewed Environment 
program. The bill includes the following direction:
      Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.--The bill provides 
$300,000,000 and EPA shall follow the direction provided in 
House Report 112-151 for fiscal year 2012. EPA may distribute 
the funds provided among the five focus areas but shall not 
spend less than the fiscal year 2011 enacted level for Toxic 
Substances and Areas of Concern and for the Invasive Species 
focus areas. The conferees direct the agency to provide a 
revised spending plan for the Great Lakes program that includes 
funding levels for the five focus areas at the same time the 
Agency submits its operating plan. Once submitted, changes to 
the funding amounts for the focus areas are subject to a 
reprogramming threshold of $5,000,000, and the Agency is 
further directed to report quarterly to the Committees on 
Appropriations on changes below the threshold.
      Chesapeake Bay.--The conference agreement includes 
$57,391,000 for the Chesapeake Bay program. Within the amount 
provided, $8,000,000 is for nutrient and sediment removal 
grants and $2,000,000 is for small watershed grants. The 
conferees do not provide additional directives regarding the 
allocation of funds for this program but instead direct the 
Agency to report a proposed allocation of the remaining funds 
as part of its operating plan. EPA is further directed to 
support the local government study through the small watershed 
grant program as discussed in House Report 112-151.
      Puget Sound.--The bill provides $30,000,000 to manage and 
implement Washington State's Puget Sound Action agenda, an 
approved Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) 
under Section 320 of the Clean Water Act. The conferees direct 
that funding to restore Puget Sound be allocated consistent 
with the near-term priorities established in the CCMP and the 
existing Lead Organization and Tribal capacity agreements 
funded in prior years. EPA is directed to expeditiously 
obligate funds, in a manner consistent with the authority and 
responsibilities under Section 320 and the National Estuary 
Program. Not more than 4 percent shall be used for EPA 
intramural costs to manage the cooperative and interagency 
agreements to restore and protect Puget Sound.
      Information Exchange.--The bill provides $130,896,000 for 
the Information Exchange program. From within this amount, 
$3,285,000 has been provided for the Administrator's Immediate 
Office. Funding for Children and Other Sensitive Populations 
and for Environmental Education programs shall be maintained at 
the enacted level. The agreement does not include further 
directives regarding allocation of funds or FTE but instead 
directs the Agency to submit an allocation of funds at the 
program project level as part of the operating plan.
      International Programs.--The bill provides $17,632,000 
for international programs. The agreement does not include 
further directives regarding allocation of funds but instead 
directs the Agency to submit an allocation of funds at the 
program project level as part of the operating plan.
      Legal/Science/Regulatory/Economic Review.--The bill 
provides $110,946,000 and maintains the enacted level for the 
SmartGrowth program. The bill provides no more than $15,286,000 
for Regulatory/Economic Management and Analysis. The agreement 
does not include further directives regarding allocation of 
funds but instead directs the Agency to submit an allocation of 
funds at the program project level as part of the operating 
plan.
      Operations and Administration.--The bill provides 
$487,880,000, including requested funding for rent, security 
and utilities. The agreement does not include further 
directives regarding allocation of funds but instead directs 
the Agency to submit an allocation of funds at the program 
project level as part of the operating plan.
      Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.--The bill 
provides $112,643,000 for the RCRA program. The bill does not 
provide the $2,000,000 request to develop the e-manifest system 
despite the conferees' strong support for the establishment of 
this system because EPA lacks the legal authority to collect 
user fees to offset system costs as expressed in the House 
report.
      Water: Ecosystems.--The bill provides $48,257,000 for 
Water: Ecosystems. Within this amount the bill provides the 
requested amount for the National Estuary Program and Section 
320 grants. The bill provides $21,199,000 for the Wetlands 
program and eliminates previously reprogrammed funds for work 
on the Enhanced Coordination Procedures with the Army Corps of 
Engineers, and the Office of Surface Mining. The conferees have 
not included bill language addressing the enhanced coordination 
procedures given the U.S. District Court's recent ruling that 
set aside the procedures.
      Water: Human Health Protection.--The bill provides 
$101,256,000 and directs the reduction below the fiscal year 
2011 enacted level to the drinking water regulatory program. 
The agreement does not include further directives regarding 
allocation of funds but instead directs the Agency to submit an 
allocation of funds at the program project level as part of the 
operating plan.
      Water Quality Protection.--The bill provides 
$217,101,000, of which up to $4,738,000 is for the urban waters 
program. The agreement does not include further directives 
regarding allocation of funds but instead directs the Agency to 
submit an allocation of funds at the program project level as 
part of the operating plan.
      Additional Guidance.--The conferees include the following 
additional guidance with respect to funding provided under this 
account:
      Administrator Priorities.--Funding for Administrator 
priorities shall not exceed the fiscal year 2011 enacted level. 
The conferees direct the Agency to submit a report within 90 
days of enactment that identifies how the fiscal year 2010 and 
2011 funding was used, by account, program area and program 
project and include a description of the activities and any 
anticipated results. Future congressional justifications should 
identify funding in each program project that has been set 
aside for Administrator priorities, and include a justification 
for the effort and any anticipated results.
      Arsenic Reporting.--Not later than 180 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Agency is directed to: (1) 
Promptly submit to Congress an overdue report--requested as 
part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-
447)--on the extent to which communities are being affected by 
the arsenic rule, and proposing compliance alternatives and 
making recommendations to minimize costs; (2) convene a working 
group composed of representatives from States, small publicly 
owned water systems, local public health officials, drinking 
water consumers and treatment manufacturers to provide input 
and recommendations on barriers to the use of point-of-use and 
point-of-entry treatment units, package plants, (including 
water bottled by the public water system), and modular units, 
as well as alternative affordability criteria that give extra 
weight to small, rural, and lower income communities, and (3) 
based upon input from the working group submit to the 
Committees a report on actions to make alternative compliance 
methods (such as point of use, point of entry and package 
plants) more accessible to water systems and a report on 
alternative affordability criteria.
      Boiler MACT.--The conferees are encouraged by the outcome 
of EPA's reconsideration of the Boiler MACT rule and offer no 
directives regarding Boiler MACT standards. The proposed rule 
addresses substantive concerns by including additional 
flexibility with respect to compliance costs, and a biomass 
exemption.
      Eastern Long Island Sound Supplemental Environmental 
Impact Study.--The conferees are concerned by the lack of 
progress at the Agency in completing a Supplemental 
Environmental Impact Statement for eastern Long Island Sound, 
which has been slated since 2002 and is necessary to ensure 
that significant military installations do not lose access to 
dredged disposal sites. The conferees direct the Agency to 
submit a report no later than 90 days after enactment of this 
Act outlining its plan to carry out the Supplemental 
Environmental Impact Statement for the eastern Long Island 
Sound, including the possible use of existing appropriated 
funds to begin the study. The conferees also urge the Agency to 
work collaboratively with appropriate stakeholders, including 
the Army Corps of Engineers and State partners, to 
expeditiously determine a dredging solution for eastern Long 
Island Sound.
      Economic Analysis of Reciprocating Engine Rule.--The 
conferees are aware that EPA has initiated a reconsideration 
process which the conferees expect will address the concerns 
expressed in House Report 112-151. Amendments to the 
reciprocating engine rule are expected in early 2012. The 
conferees fully expect that EPA will include an analysis of the 
economic impacts of the rule on small government jurisdictions 
per the direction in the House report. Therefore the bill does 
not provide a directive to initiate a separate analysis of the 
economic impacts of the rule on small government jurisdictions 
within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
      Personnel and Full Time Equivalents.--While the statement 
does not cap FTE levels for EPA, the conferees do not expect 
EPA's actual utilization levels will exceed the 2010 
utilization levels given that EPA's 2012 budget has been 
reduced. The conferees remain concerned about the growing 
disparity between regional and headquarters personnel as well 
as how EPA develops its personnel requests in its annual budget 
proposal.
      Recycling Programs.--The conferees direct that the Agency 
submit the report requested in House Report 112-151 within 90 
days of enactment of this Act.
      Refrigerant Gas Containers.--Within 90 days of enactment 
of this Act, the conferees direct the agency to initiate a 
study on the environmental impacts of using disposable 
containers to transport and store refrigerant gasses, compared 
to refillable containers, and to submit the study to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations upon completion.
      Regional Haze.--States have raised legitimate concerns 
about the costs and compliance deadlines within EPA federal 
implementation plans to address regional haze issues. The Clean 
Air Act offers substantial flexibility with regard to how 
States may choose to mitigate regional haze impacts. The 
conferees are aware that EPA released a court-ordered schedule 
for finalizing Regional haze rules in November 2011. Therefore, 
the agreement does not include the specific directives 
contained in House Report 112-151 but instead directs EPA to 
work with the States as partners in order to resolve compliance 
and cost differences while adhering to the schedule.
      Southern New England Estuaries.--The conferees recommend 
that the Agency convene and lead a comprehensive regional 
policy coordination and outreach effort to protect, enhance, 
and restore the coastal watersheds of southern New England. No 
entity or consortium exists to meet these challenges, and there 
is an urgent and immediate need for such an effort. For 
example, in Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, there are 
documented extensive areas of pollution severely degrading fish 
and wildlife habitat and water quality; problems that are 
compounded by the effects of warmer water temperatures and 
milder winters. The conferees recommend that EPA establish 
goals for the regional effort, emphasizing water quality and 
habitat restoration as well as the development and 
implementation of innovative technologies to meet these 
challenges and create jobs. The effort should provide for 
streamlined interagency communication, and involve an inclusive 
stakeholder process. Specifically, EPA should collaborate with 
State agencies as well as other Federal partners such as the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources 
Conservation Service, and the Small Business Administration. 
The Agency should also include stakeholders from local 
governments and agencies, non-governmental organizations, and 
academic institutions. The conferees also recommend that the 
Agency, through this regional effort, facilitate the 
development of strategies to restore and protect the southern 
New England Estuaries.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      The bill provides $42,000,000 for the Office of Inspector 
General. The conferees appreciate the value of a robust 
Inspector General and expect the same level of effort as in 
fiscal year 2011 within the funding provided. The funding level 
reflects the high unobligated balances that remain in this 
account and the Inspector General should utilize previously 
appropriated funds first in fiscal year 2012.

                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

      The bill provides $36,428,000 for Buildings and 
Facilities, equal to the fiscal year 2011 enacted level.

                     HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      The bill provides $1,215,753,000 for the Hazardous 
Substance Superfund account, and includes bill language to 
transfer $9,955,000 to the Inspector General account and 
$23,016,000 to the Science and Technology account. Due to 
budget constraints, the conferees have reluctantly proposed 
general program reductions to the Superfund emergency response 
and removal and remedial programs, as detailed below. The bill 
provides the following additional direction:
      Enforcement.--The bill provides $187,033,000 for 
Superfund Enforcement.
      Operations and Administration.--The bill provides 
$135,969,000 for Superfund Operations and Administration. The 
agreement does not include further directives regarding 
allocation of funds but instead directs the Agency to submit an 
allocation of funds at the program project level as part of the 
operating plan.
      Superfund Cleanup.--The bill provides $789,180,000 for 
Superfund Cleanup, of which $189,895,000 is for Superfund: 
Emergency Response and Removal and $565,922,000 is for 
Superfund: Remedial. The conferees expect that future budget 
requests will propose a higher percentage of cleanup funding as 
part of the total request in addition to proposing funding 
sufficient to meet program goals, such as increasing the number 
of annual ``construction completes'' and more importantly 
``sites made ready for reuse''. The conferees direct the 
Inspector General to report to the Committees on Appropriations 
within 90 days of enactment of this Act on current agency 
efforts to strengthen Superfund contracting controls to prevent 
future waste, fraud and abuse.
      Financial Assurance.--In lieu of the directives contained 
in H. Rept. 112-151 regarding financial assurance requirements, 
the conferees direct the Administrator to collect and analyze 
information from the commercial insurance and financial 
industries regarding the use and availability of necessary 
instruments (including surety bonds, letters of credit, and 
insurance) for meeting any new financial responsibility 
requirements and to make that analysis available to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations and to the general 
public on the Agency website 90 days prior to proposing any 
rule pursuant to section 108(b) of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 
(42 U.S.C. 9608(b)).
      Special Accounts.--The conferees direct EPA to follow the 
language in House Report 112-151 with respect to managing the 
unobligated balances in the Superfund special accounts.

          LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK TRUST FUND PROGRAM

      The bill provides $104,309,000 for the Leaking 
Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Program.

                       INLAND OIL SPILL PROGRAMS

      The bill provides $18,274,000 for Inland Oil Spill 
Programs.

                   STATE AND TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS

      The bill provides $3,618,727,000 for the State and Tribal 
Assistance Grants (STAG) program and includes the following 
specific funding levels and direction:
      Infrastructure Assistance.--The bill provides 
$2,528,169,000 for infrastructure assistance, including 
$1,468,806,000 for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and 
$919,363,000 for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. The 
amount provided for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund 
program will fund approximately 473 new wastewater projects 
nationwide and more than 81,000 jobs when combined with state 
matching funds and leverage capabilities, according to Agency 
estimates. Amounts provided for the Drinking Water State 
Revolving Funds program will fund approximately 353 new 
drinking water projects nationwide and more than 50,000 jobs 
when combined with state matching and leveraged funds.
      The conferees do not direct EPA to submit a report on 
water rates requested in the House report. However, the 
conferees direct the Agency to report on how EPA and the States 
have used the additional subsidization authority including 
information on the number and amounts of loans awarded with 
additional subsidization, recipient communities, and 
descriptions of projects funded.
      Alaska Native Villages.--The bill provides $10,000,000 as 
requested.
      Brownfields.--The bill provides $95,000,000 for the 
Brownfields program.
      Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) Grants.--The bill 
provides $30,000,000 as the conferees do not agree with the 
proposal to terminate the DERA grants.
      Mexico Border.--The bill provides $5,000,000 for the 
Mexico border program.
      Categorical Grants.--The bill provides $1,090,558,000 for 
Categorical Grants and funding levels are specified in the 
table at the end of this division. This amount includes 
$164,757,000 for nonpoint source grants as requested. The 
amount also includes $236,107,000 for the State and Local Air 
Quality Management grant program, and the conferees direct EPA 
to allocate funds for this program using the same formula as 
fiscal year 2011.
      Bill Language.--The bill includes modified language 
specifying amounts made available under the state revolving 
fund programs for additional subsidization, and amounts made 
available for the green infrastructure reserve in the Clean 
Water State Revolving Fund program. The bill does not provide 
the requested mandatory set-aside for green infrastructure 
projects within the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund program 
but does include language allowing States to continue to fund 
these types of projects at their discretion.

       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

              (INCLUDING TRANSFER AND RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

      The bill rescinds $50,000,000 from specific unobligated 
balances. Modified bill language has been included to provide 
specific wage rate requirements for the Clean Water and 
Drinking Water State Revolving funds.
      Oil Spill Transfer Authority.--The bill includes modified 
transfer authority language that allows the Agency to meet its 
obligations to pay contractors responding to inland oil spills. 
The conferees have included this language for fiscal year 2012 
only. The conferees strongly urge EPA, in conjunction with the 
Office of Management and Budget, to propose a more appropriate 
legislative fix if the Administration is unable to process 
routine transfers from the Oil Spill Trust Fund in a timely 
fashion. The conferees support the approach discussed in the 
House report to be a more permanent solution.

                      TITLE III--RELATED AGENCIES

                       Department of Agriculture

                             FOREST SERVICE

                     FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH

      The bill provides $295,773,000 for Forest and Rangeland 
Research. The conferees also provide the following directions:
      The agreement does not specify allocations for individual 
research facilities. The conferees encourage the Forest 
Products Laboratory, as part of the Department of Agriculture's 
effort to promote and use wood products as a green building 
material, to invest in wood products life cycle assessment 
research to improve our understanding of the environmental and 
economic implications of using wood in building construction.
      The Forest Service is commended for its localized needs 
research and is directed to expand this research in support of 
project development on national forests. The Forest Service 
should prioritize research related to White Nose Syndrome as 
well as inventory and monitoring of bat resources on Forest 
Service lands. The Service is expected to continue ongoing 
urban natural resources stewardship research and should produce 
a joint report with the Department of Energy on the role that 
this work can play in helping reduce the urban heat island 
effect, as well as reduce the energy demand to cool buildings.

                       STATE AND PRIVATE FORESTRY

      The bill provides $253,331,000 for State and Private 
Forestry. The conferees also provide the following directions:
      Within six months of enactment of this Act, the Forest 
Service is directed to develop a process in consultation with 
State foresters that considers State Assessments and Strategies 
in the annual budget for Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act 
(CFAA) programs, and to develop a process allowing State 
foresters flexibility, with appropriate accountability, to 
reallocate a percentage of authorizations for CFAA programs to 
address State priorities consistent with the State Assessments 
and Strategies.
      Forest Legacy.--The bill provides $53,388,000 for the 
Forest Legacy program. This includes $6,628,000 for program 
administration, $2,500,000 for new State startups, and 
$44,260,000 for forest legacy projects. The Service should fund 
projects in priority order according to their competitively 
selected national priority list for fiscal year 2012.

                         NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM

      The bill provides $1,556,628,000 for the National Forest 
System. The agreement includes a proof of concept pilot for 
Integrated Resource Restoration (IRR). The conferees also 
provide the following directions:
      Land Management Planning.--The bill provides $40,000,000 
for land management planning. The agreement does not approve 
the consolidation of this line item with the Inventory and 
Monitoring line item. The Planning Rule should provide for a 
cost-effective and timely process for forest plan revisions.
      Inventory and Monitoring.--The bill provides $161,980,000 
for inventory and monitoring. The Forest Service is encouraged 
to allocate more funding towards monitoring of grazing 
allotments and work with State agencies, universities, 
professional societies and other USDA agencies, such as the 
Natural Resources Conservation Service, to efficiently and 
effectively increase allotment monitoring.
      Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness.--The bill provides 
$281,627,000 for recreation, heritage and wilderness programs. 
In place of House direction on the travel management rule, the 
Forest Service is encouraged to revise travel management plans 
where significant issues have arisen and resolve the 
Maintenance Level-3 road problem in Region 5. The agreement 
does not provide direction on the Wyoming Wilderness Act.
      Grazing Management.--The bill provides $55,445,000 for 
the grazing management program. The conferees are concerned 
that the best science should be used in making decisions 
concerning grazing on the Dakota Prairie Grasslands. Currently, 
North Dakota State University is conducting research that 
should benefit the agency in making these determinations. The 
agency is strongly encouraged to work cooperatively with the 
university and utilize its research to the extent practicable, 
to better inform its grazing management decisions.
      Forest Products.--The bill provides $336,049,000 for the 
forest products program. The Forest Service is directed to 
improve the health and resilience of national forests and 
through these efforts, work to achieve three billion board feet 
of timber sold. The conferees note that over the last ten 
years, the timber supply in Region 10 has been constrained to 
less than 10 percent of the allowable sale quantity in the 
current land management plan. The Forest Service is encouraged 
to prepare and offer, within three years, the four 10-year 
timber sales as previously indicated.
      Vegetation and Watershed Management.--The bill provides 
$184,341,000 for vegetation and watershed management 
activities. The Service is strongly encouraged to provide 
sufficient resources for leafy spurge eradication.
      Wildlife and Fish Habitat Management.--The bill provides 
$140,260,000 for wildlife and fish habitat management 
activities.
      Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration.--The bill 
provides $40,000,000 for the Collaborative Forest Landscape 
Restoration Fund.
      Minerals and Geology Management.--The bill provides 
$83,560,000 for minerals and geology management activities.
      The Service should implement the recommendations included

on National Forest System Lands'' and initiate a planning 
process for a renewable energy development program and, where 
appropriate, apply guidelines already developed by the Bureau 
of Land Management.
      Landownership Management.--The bill provides $85,875,000 
for landownership management activities. In the case of any 
land exchange involving National Forest System land carried out 
directly or through a third-party, the Forest Service is 
directed to provide written notice of the proposed land 
exchange to each owner of non-Federal land adjoining a parcel 
of National Forest System land proposed for exchange and each 
owner of non-Federal land adjoining the non-Federal land 
proposed to be acquired in the exchange. The Secretary shall 
determine adjoining landowners using the most recent available 
tax records.
      Integrated Resource Restoration.--The conferees have 
agreed to the House proposal to allow the Administration to 
conduct an Integrated Resource Restoration pilot in Regions 1, 
3, and 4. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the Forest 
Service should present a plan and guidance to the pilot regions 
for measuring performance and accountability. The plan and 
guidance should ensure program transparency, monitoring, fair 
allocation of funding, a consistent approach across the three 
regions, and that restoration is the primary goal of any 
projects funded through the pilot. The plan should also include 
traditional measures, such as timber targets and acres treated, 
while also including new measures such as watershed condition 
framework.

                  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The bill provides $394,721,000 for capital improvement 
and maintenance programs offset by a $12,000,000 scoring credit 
related to the road and trail fund. The conferees also provide 
the following directions:
      Facilities.--The bill provides $75,785,000 for facilities 
including $13,124,000 for construction and $62,661,000 for 
maintenance. For future year planning, the Forest Service 
should include both new construction and maintenance in its 
list of major facilities projects based on its facility master 
plans and the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars.
      Roads.--The bill provides $182,818,000 for roads 
including $27,327,000 for construction and $155,491,000 for 
maintenance.

program within Capital Improvement and Maintenance. The Forest 
Service should report on the jobs associated with this program 
and publicly post this information.
      Back-country airstrips.--In place of the reporting 
requirements in the House Report for back-country airstrips, 
within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Forest Service is directed to provide the Committees with a 
general assessment of back-country airstrips on National Forest 
System lands with recommendations for improving their function 
as an important component of the forest transportation and 
recreation system.
      Bill Language.--The bill includes language allowing the 
transfer of funding from Capital Improvement and Maintenance to 
the National Forest System for the Integrated Resource 
Restoration pilot.

                            LAND ACQUISITION

      The bill provides $52,605,000 for Land Acquisition, of 
which $7,500,000 is for acquisition management; $3,500,000 is 
for critical inholdings/cash equalization; and $41,605,000 is 
for acquisitions.
      This amount will fully fund projects 1 through 30 as 
prioritized by the Service pursuant to the Administration's 
revised request list provided to the Committees on August 26, 
2011. Requests for reprogramming will be considered pursuant to 
the guidelines in the front of this statement.
      The conferees direct the Forest Service to use inholding 
funding to acquire high priority lands within Federal 
boundaries that maximize benefits to the public through 
consolidated Federal ownership that provides access, creates 
management efficiencies, or protects critical resources.
      The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to submit a 
report to the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of 
enactment of this Act describing current negotiations between 
the Forest Service and private landowners for projects 
receiving prior year and current appropriations within the 
Tongass National Forest, including the overall scope and timing 
of these acquisitions.

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      The bill provides $1,737,631,000 for Forest Service 
Wildland Fire Management. In addition to the funding provided, 
the Forest Service is directed to use $240,000,000 in carryover 
emergency fire suppression funds before obligating fiscal year 
2012 suppression funds. The amount provided, combined with 
$315,886,000 in the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund, 
fully funds the Forest Service's 10-year average expenditures 
for fire suppression. The conferees also provide the following 
directions:
      The Forest Service should complete a plan to replace the 
aging fleet of federal air tankers as soon as possible. While 
the Forest Service and others have produced study after study 
on the critical shortage of firefighting aircraft, there has 
been a complete lack of substantive progress this year. The 
Service must work more closely with the Department of the 
Interior in developing the strategy for replacing the current 
air tanker fleet.
      Hazardous Fuels.--The bill provides $317,584,000 for 
hazardous fuels activities. The Forest Service is directed to 
remove the requirement that seventy-five percent of hazardous 
fuels funding be spent in the Wildland Urban Interface and 
instead the conferees direct hazardous fuels funding be spent 
on the highest priority projects in the highest priority areas.

                FLAME WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION RESERVE FUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

      The bill includes administrative provisions similar to

                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

                         Indian Health Service

                         INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES

      The bill provides $3,872,377,000 for Indian Health 
Services. Of the amount requested for current services, the 
conferees have included $56,019,000 above the fiscal year 2011 
enacted level, which covers the cost of staffing new 
facilities. Program increases above the fiscal year 2011 
enacted level include $12,000,000 for the Indian Health Care 
Improvement Fund; $3,400,000 for Health IT Security; 
$65,000,000 for Contract Health Services; $3,185,000 for Direct 
Operations; and $74,500,000 for Contract Support Costs. In 
agreement with the request, a reduction of $7,000,000 has been 
assumed from savings in grant programs. The conferees direct 
the Service to meet its annual Contract Support Costs reporting 
requirement due date, and to provide the Committees with 
current Contract Support Costs estimates in conjunction with 
its annual budget submission.
      The Service is directed to update the Committees at least 
annually on the progress of the Early Childhood Caries 
initiative and the ability of the Service to meet its goals in 
the allowed time frame. The conferees note that the Service has 
already complied with the request contained in the House report 
to provide a detailed schedule for implementation of the 
Electronic Dental Record system.
      Within the overall amount identified in the ``Indian 
Health Services'' account for the staffing of new facilities, 
funds are directed to the following projects, as requested in 
the President's budget request: $1,809,000 for the Carl Albert 
Hospital replacement, Ada, Oklahoma; $783,000 for the Lake 
County Tribal Health Center, Lakeport, California; $6,294,000 
for the Elbowoods Health Center, New Town, North Dakota; 
$21,185,000 for the Cheyenne River Health Center, Eagle Butte, 
South Dakota; $8,226,000 for the Absentee Shawnee Health 
Center, Little Axe, Oklahoma; $7,879,000 for the Cherokee 
Nation Vinita Health Center, Vinita, Oklahoma; and $9,843,000 
for joint venture projects. This distribution is in agreement 
with the budget estimate as it has been revised to reflect 
distributions made under the fiscal year 2011 operating plan, 
which was not available at the time the Service's request was 
submitted to Congress.
      The conferees understand that a number of joint venture 
construction projects are nearing completion and will require 
support for the staffing of these new facilities. The Service 
is urged to request sufficient funding in future budgets to 
fulfill its obligations to participating tribes in the joint 
venture program.
      Within the Indian Health Professions activity, the 
conferees have continued support for the Recruitment/Retention 
of American Indians into Nursing program; the Indians into 
Psychology program; and the Indians into Medicine program.

                        INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES

      The bill provides $441,052,000 for Indian Health 
Facilities. Of the amount requested for current services, the 
conferees have included $7,032,000 above the fiscal year 2011 
enacted level, which covers the cost of staffing new 
facilities. Program changes to the fiscal year 2011 enacted 
level include a decrease of $15,955,000 from Sanitation 
Facilities Construction, as requested, and an increase of 
$46,028,000 for Health Care Facilities Construction.
      Within the overall amount identified in the ``Facilities 
Services'' account for the staffing of new facilities, funds 
are directed to the following projects, as requested in the 
President's budget request: $678,000 for the Carl Albert 
Hospital replacement, Ada, Oklahoma; $305,000 for the Lake 
County Tribal Health Center, Lakeport, California; $1,021,000 
for the Elbowoods Health Center, New Town, North Dakota; 
$3,487,000 for the Cheyenne River Health Center, Eagle Butte, 
South Dakota; $755,000 for the Absentee Shawnee Health Center, 
Little Axe, Oklahoma; and $786,000 for the Cherokee Nation 
Vinita Health Center, Vinita, Oklahoma.
      The amount provided for health care facilities 
construction includes, as requested in the President's budget 
request: $62,184,000 to complete the Barrow Hospital, Barrow, 
Alaska; $10,000,000 for the Kayenta Health Center, Kayenta, 
Arizona; $10,000,000 for the San Carlos Health Center, San 
Carlos, Arizona; $2,000,000 for the Southern California Youth 
Regional Treatment Center, Hemet, California; and $1,000,000 to 
complete a feasibility report on the use of modular 
construction for health facilities.
      The conferees are concerned about the large unobligated 
balances in the ``Indian Health Services'' and the ``Indian 
Health Facilities'' accounts. The conferees direct the Service 
to review the programs that have carried high unobligated 
balances in recent years and provide a detailed report to the 
Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the 
causes for these unobligated balances and present a plan for 
reducing them.

      The bill provides a total of $811,530,000 for all 
Smithsonian Institution accounts, of which $636,530,000 is 
provided for salaries and expenses. The conferees encourage 
collaborative efforts between the Smithsonian Institution and 
regional and rural museums that facilitate greater access to 
the Smithsonian's virtual collections such as that of the 
Museum of Natural History. The conferees support the joint 
venture between the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian 
Institution creating a comprehensive compilation of personal 
histories and testimonials of individuals who participated in 
the Civil Rights movement. The conferees remain committed to 
the preservation of priceless, irreplaceable Smithsonian 
Institution collections and direct the Smithsonian to take 
steps toward implementing the recommendations of a recently 
completed audit by the Smithsonian's Office of Inspector 
General (OIG) on collections stewardship at the National Museum 
of American History. The conferees also support the decision by 
the OIG to use the Institution's Strategic Plan as a standard 
by which to measure the Institution's performance in its 
proposed audits and reviews. The Smithsonian Institution is 
directed to work with the Committees to standardize its annual 
budget submission justifications and supporting materials.

                           FACILITIES CAPITAL

      The bill provides $175,000,000 for the Facilities Capital 
account of which $75,000,000 is to complete the design and 
begin the construction of the National Museum of African 
American History and Culture (NMAAHC). Bill language is 
included providing that a future procurement for construction 
of the NMAAHC may include the full scope of the project, but 
that any contract for such procurement must contain a clause 
clarifying that any payment under the contract will be subject 
to the availability of funds. The Smithsonian is directed to 
devote remaining Facilities Capital funds to the highest and 
best uses on a priority basis and clearly articulate in future 
budget submissions specific funding needs in priority order for 
all Facilities Capital program initiatives.

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

             NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES

                    National Endowment for the Arts

                       GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION

      The bill provides $146,255,000 for the National Endowment 
for the Arts (NEA). The conferees agree that initiatives begun 
in prior years, such as the Big Read and Shakespeare in 
American Communities, are programs of demonstrated worth that 
reach a broad geographic audience. The Endowment is urged to 
maintain these grants at an appropriate funding level to allow 
a vibrant, competitive program to be maintained.
      The conferees understand that the proposal included in 
the budget request to eliminate the National Heritage 
Fellowship program and the American Jazz Masters Fellowship 
program was reconsidered by the Endowment and subsequently 
withdrawn. The conferees support this decision and expect the 
Endowment to continue its annual recognition of individuals 
with outstanding achievements in these disciplines in a similar 
manner to past years. The conferees disagree with the proposal 
to exempt funds for the ``Our Town'' initiative from the 
overall calculation for providing base funding to State arts 
agencies and direct that funds be distributed based on the 
longstanding agreement that States receive 40 percent of all 
appropriated grant funds. Reforms originally instituted by the 
Committees more than a decade ago relating to program 
priorities and grant guidelines are fully restated in Sections 
418 and 419. These reforms maintain broad bipartisan support 
and the conferees expect the NEA to adhere to them fully. 
Further, the conferees encourage the Administration and the 
appropriate committees of jurisdiction in Congress to address 
the vacancies on the National Council on the Arts in a timelier 
manner than has been the case to date.

                 National Endowment for the Humanities

                       GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION

      The bill provides $146,255,000 for the National Endowment 
for the Humanities (NEH). The conferees urge the NEH to provide 
no less than 40 percent of program funds to support the 
critical work of state humanities councils. The conferees 
support the Endowment's efforts to encourage a better 
understanding of our Nation's history and the democratic 
principles upon which it was founded by supporting grants for 
the teaching and study of American history. The conferees, 
therefore, have included $3,000,000 for the longstanding, 
successful We the People initiative. The NEH is encouraged to 
include Native American communities in the Bridging Cultures 
initiative and to work with tribes in the preservation of 
Native American languages through the Documenting Endangered 
Languages grant program.

                        Commission of Fine Arts

Arts.

               National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs

ensure that all grantees meet the program's eligibility 
requirements.

               Advisory Council on Historic Preservation

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

Historic Preservation.

                  National Capital Planning Commission

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

Planning Commission.

                United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

                       HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM

      The bill provides $50,798,000 for the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum. The conferees concur with the 
Museum's proposal to re-designate its exhibition fund as an 
outreach initiatives fund to broaden access to historic 
material, enhance its website, and provide a larger public 
education component.

                             PRESIDIO TRUST

                          PRESIDIO TRUST FUND

      The bill provides $12,000,000 for the Presidio Trust 
Fund.

                Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission

Expenses account.

                          CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION

      The bill provides $30,990,000 for Capital Construction.

officer to procure construction services as long as such 
contracts are contingent upon the availability of funds, and 
authorizes the Commission to proceed with the construction 
process despite not having full funding in place.

                                TITLE I

                          DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

                 Employment and Training Administration

                    TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement includes $3,195,383,000 for

available as an advance appropriation for the period October 1, 
2012 through June 30, 2013.
      The conferees direct that, beginning with the fiscal year 
2013 budget request, the TES detailed workload and performance 
tables in the congressional justification materials be modified 
to include, as a subset of the ``Participants Served in 
Employment and Training Activities,'' the number of 
participants who participated in core and intensive services, 
the number of participants who participated in training 
services, the number of exiters, and the number of exiters who 
gained employment.
      The conference agreement includes $1,008,432,000 for 
Dislocated Worker Assistance employment and training 
activities, of which $148,432,000 shall be available for 
obligation for the period July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013, 
and the remaining $860,000,000 shall be available as an advance 
appropriation for the period October 1, 2012 through June 30, 
2013. The conferees continue to support the use of National 
Emergency Grants to meet unanticipated increases in demand for 
employment and training services and encourage a rapid 
execution of funding throughout the program year to address 
these needs throughout the country.
      The conference agreement includes $84,451,000 for migrant 
and seasonal farmworker formula grants. The conferees direct 
that $5,689,000 shall be for migrant and seasonal farmworker 
housing grants, of which not less than 70 percent of this 
amount shall be used for permanent housing grants. The 
conferees further direct the Department of Labor to submit 
annual reports documenting the use of farmworker housing funds. 
The reports should include information on the amount of funds 
used for permanent and temporary housing activities, 
respectively; a list of the communities served; a list of the 
grantees and the states in which they are located; the total 
number of individuals or families served; and a list of 
allowable temporary housing activities.
      The conference agreement includes $50,000,000 for the

demonstrations, and research activities.
      The conferees note that the National Guard's Youth 
ChalleNGe program at the Department of Defense provides a 
structured high school curriculum in a residential setting for 
16- to 18-year old high school dropouts across 27 states. 
However, the success of this program is hindered by the lack of 
a formalized employment training component. As the Department 
of Labor has a long history with such endeavors, the conferees 
encourage the Secretary of Labor to work with the Department of 
Defense, providing technical assistance and guidance where 
needed, in establishing a vocational training component within 
the Youth ChalleNGe program.
      The conference agreement includes a directive for the 
Government Accountability Office to assess the capabilities of 
the Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training 
programs to adequately prepare participants for currently 
available jobs. The study shall include, but is not limited to, 
the following:
      1. An evaluation of the means by which Workforce 
Investment Act (WIA) local areas identify currently available 
jobs and the skills required for those jobs in potential growth 
sectors of the economy. This may include an evaluation of 
decisions by regional and local WIA areas and an assessment of 
the quality of available labor market information and job 
projections.
      2. An evaluation of the means by which WIA local areas 
direct program participants to prepare or train for currently 
or soon-to-be available jobs in the WIA area. To the extent 
that prospects for employment are greater outside the WIA area, 
the evaluation will assess the extent to which WIA areas help 
the participants of the programs prepare or train for these 
jobs.
      3. A compilation of any recommendations on how 
participants may be better prepared for current openings and 
for openings in growth sectors of the economy.
      The conference agreement includes $6,475,000 for the

$666,000,000 in advance funding for fiscal year 2013. The 
conferees provide full funding for OJC in fiscal year 2012, 
eliminating the need for advance appropriations, and direct the

without advance appropriations beginning with the fiscal year 
2013 budget submission.

      The conferees expect the Office of Smoking and Health to 
transfer no less than the amount it did in fiscal year 2011 to 
the Environmental Health Laboratory. The conferees intend that 
this transfer is to be provided to the lab in a manner that 
supplements and in no way replaces existing funding for 
tobacco-related activities.
      The conferees are pleased to learn that CDC has decided 
to retain the Division of Oral Health. This action is supported 
by a recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report titled 
``Advancing Oral Health in America'' that recommends oral 
health be given a high priority within HHS. This decision will 
allow CDC to focus on the prevention and elimination of oral 
disease, support state oral health infrastructure programs, and 
improve the coordination of oral health activities with other 
chronic disease prevention activities.

                BIRTH DEFECTS AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES

      The conference agreement includes $138,072,000 for birth 
defects and developmental diseases.
      The conferees have rejected the consolidation proposed in 
the fiscal year 2012 budget for disability initiatives in the 
National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities 
(NCBDDD). The conferees direct that any new consolidation put 
forward by the administration be accompanied by an assessment 
of the needs of people with disabilities that includes the 
categories of disabilities currently served, validates the 
value of such a consolidation, considers the input of 
stakeholders, and establishes the basis for any proposed 
efficiencies and commonalities.

      Congenital Heart Disease.--The conferees are concerned 
that there is a lack of rigorous epidemiological and 
longitudinal data on individuals of all ages with congenital 
heart disease and has included funding to begin to compile this 
information. The conferees are particularly interested in 
information on prevalence, barriers to effective care, survival 
outcomes and neurocognitive outcomes.

      The conference agreement includes language making Vessel 
Sanitation Program user fees available through September 30, 
2013.
      Working Capital Fund.--The conferees have included bill 
language that allows CDC to begin creating a Working Capital 
Fund (WCF) to achieve greater cost efficiencies across the 
administrative operations of the agency. The conferees expect 
this WCF to begin making disbursements no sooner than fiscal 
year 2014. CDC shall notify the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations prior to any funds being transferred to or 
deposited in the WCF.
      The conferees direct CDC to create a strong auditing 
system for the WCF, which shall include annual auditing of the 
calculation by which programs are charged to ensure that WCF 
funds are used solely for administrative costs and that CDC 
Centers and Offices are not over-charged for services. The 
conferees instruct that the structure of the WCF shall assume 
no more than a 2 year availability of any funds within it, that 
no construction of facilities shall be allowable costs, and 
that all allowable costs are clearly defined. The conferees 
further direct that the governance system be designed to 
include a role for all Center Directors in overseeing the costs 
incurred. The Committees on Appropriations expect quarterly 
briefings on the progress being made in drafting the charter 
and the methodology being used to set up the WCF.
      Within the amount provided for Business Services, the 
conferees have made $30,000,000 available until September 30, 
2013.

                     National Institutes of Health

      The conference agreement includes $30,689,990,000 for the 
accounts that comprise the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
total appropriation. This total does not include any funding 
for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; 
the conferees understand that all fiscal year 2012 funding for 
the Global Fund is provided through Division I (Department of 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs). The 
conference agreement continues the allocation to NIH of 
$8,200,000 in program evaluation set-aside funding. 
Appropriation levels for individual institutes and centers are 
described in the table at the end of this statement of 
managers.
      The conferees recognize NIH's mission to invest in basic 
biomedical research and apply that knowledge to enhance our 
Nation's health and well-being, lengthen life, and reduce the 
burdens of illness and disability. NIH is strongly urged to 
ensure its policies continue to support a robust extramural 
community and make certain sufficient research resources are 
available to the more than 300,000 NIH-supported scientists at 
over 3,100 institutions across the country. The conferees 
affirm the critical importance of new and competing research 
project grants (RPGs) to the mission of NIH and are concerned 
that in the past few years, NIH has failed to support the 
number of new, competing RPGs that it estimated would be 
awarded in its annual congressional budget justifications. The 
conferees expect NIH to evaluate its new grant-estimating 
methodology to improve its accuracy and support as many 
scientifically meritorious new and competing RPGs as possible, 
at a reasonable award level, with the funding provided in this 
Act.
      In recent years, extramural research has accounted for 
nearly 90 percent of NIH's budget. The conferees strongly urge 
NIH to maintain at least that level in fiscal year 2012. NIH 
should also establish safeguards to ensure the percentage of 
funds used to support basic research across NIH is maintained.
      The Office of the Director (OD) shall ensure, as 
practicable, the programs and offices within OD receive 
increases proportional to the overall increase, unless 
otherwise specified. The conferees request quarterly 
notification on obligations from the NIH Director's 
Discretionary Fund to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives and the Senate.
      The conferees expect NIH to continue the long-standing 
policy for Common Fund projects to be short-term, high-impact 
awards, with no projects receiving funding for more than 10 
years. The conferees recognize that certain investigator-
initiated programs such as Pioneer Awards may be exceptions to 
the 10-year limit. Any other proposed exceptions should be 
explained in the fiscal year 2013 congressional budget 
justification.
      The conference agreement includes language to eliminate 
the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) and create 
the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences 
(NCATS).
      NCATS will study steps in the therapeutics development 
and implementation process, consult with experts in academia 
and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to identify 
bottlenecks in the processes that are amenable to re-
engineering, and develop new technologies and innovative 
methods for streamlining the processes. In order to evaluate 
these innovations and new approaches, NCATS will undertake 
targeted therapeutics development and implementation projects. 
In all of these efforts, the conferees expect that NCATS will 
complement, not compete with, the efforts of the private 
sector.
      While the conferees welcome the creation of NCATS, they 
were disappointed by the way the administration requested it. 
The President's proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 included a 
vague description of NCATS but did not formally request funding 
for the restructuring or provide any details about which 
components of NIH would be consolidated into the new Center. 
The failure to do so caused unnecessary uncertainty about the 
proposal and contributed to the impression that it was being 
rushed. The conferees are also aware of concerns that the NIH 
process for evaluating the merits of the NCATS reorganization 
did not comply with the NIH Reform Act of 2006 with respect to 
the role of the Scientific Management Review Board (SMRB).
      Lessons learned with NCATS should guide NIH as it 
considers another proposed restructuring, one that would 
involve consolidating NIDA, NIAAA and components of other 
Institutes and Centers (ICs) into a new Institute devoted to 
research on substance use, abuse and addiction. The conferees 
understand that NIH plans to adopt a more deliberate approach 
in evaluating the need for this Institute. The conferees 
strongly recommend that this approach should include full 
consideration by the SMRB and that if the administration 
ultimately decides to seek such a restructuring, it should 
provide sufficient details in a formal budget request to 
Congress.
      The following table provides the specific funding levels 
for the institutes and centers and displays the comparable 
adjustments related to the reorganization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The FY 2011 enacted level does not include transfers.

      Cures Acceleration Network (CAN).--The conferees provide 
NCATS with up to $10,000,000 to support the CAN Board and 
related activities. The conferees expect a high bar for any use 
of waiver authority for CAN grant matching funds; any use 
should be extremely limited to maximize funds towards the CAN 
goals. The conferees encourage the CAN Board to create general 
principles and measurable outcomes to track success. The 
conferees request NCATS to charter an Institute of Medicine 
(IOM) work group to review, evaluate, and identify issues 
related to the CAN authority and provide a report for use by 
the CAN Board to help it identify ways to accelerate and expand 
the number of cures. The report should include a survey and 
inventory of activities at NIH, FDA, AHRQ, CDC, the Patent and 
Trademark Office (PTO), and in the private sector that relate 
to the CAN program. The conferees urge IOM to include balanced 
participation by the entities listed above as well as the 
representatives of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
industry and the biotech venture capital community. The report 
should address patent authority, marketability, use of high-
throughput analysis, regulatory timelines, and cost structure 
issues related to the purpose of CAN.
      Accelerating Commercialization of Therapies to 
Patients.--The conferees understand the need to develop models 
to assist research universities and institutes on the best ways 
to leverage and commercialize federally supported basic and 
applied biomedical research discoveries. This is a key reason 
why the conferees have agreed to create NCATS. The conferees 
note the market has started to develop public-private sector 
models that are beginning to show results in translating basic 
research far more quickly than traditional models. These types 
of models use pre-defined technology-licensing terms to rapidly 
license new products and build a core of options for 
commercialization partnerships with pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies to establish joint ventures to further 
advance products to the market. The conferees strongly urge NIH 
to study and foster these models.
      The conferees expect any NIH-supported partnerships to 
expand translational pharmaceutical development in a manner 
that does not inhibit creative market models. Top priorities of 
the Center should include developing tools to improve the ``de-
risking'' process and advancing the drug development process to 
the point at which it can reasonably be expected to be picked 
up by the private sector. The conferees suggest the selection 
of Center projects should consider future market acceptance as 
one component of the criteria to evaluate and select potential 
Center projects. The conferees direct NIH to host a trans-NIH 
workshop with key research organizations, venture capitalists, 
pharmaceutical firms, the PTO, the FDA, and a sample of 
research universities and institutes to work together with NIH 
and the drug development market. The workshop should also 
consider how existing NIH and government mechanisms can be used 
to encourage models around the country to speed 
commercialization of therapies through a market-based approach.
      Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs).--The 
conferees are encouraged by the success of the CTSA consortium 
and recommend the program receive full funding as it nears full 
implementation. The conferees expect the NCATS Director to 
ensure the current focus on the full spectrum of translational 
research is maintained, and CTSA resources are not diverted. 
The inclusion of patient-centered research, community 
engagement, training, dissemination science, and behavioral 
research is extremely important to the translation and 
application of basic science discoveries and success of the 
CTSAs. CTSAs now represent an investment of half a decade of 
innovation in translational research. To ensure the benefits of 
this investment are maintained, the conferees urge NIH to 
support a study by the IOM that would evaluate the CTSA program 
and recommend whether changes to the current mission are 
needed. The review should include stakeholders' input and be 
available no later than 18 months after the enactment of this 
bill.
      Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease (TRND) 
Program.--The conferees continue support for TRND at a level of 
$24,000,000 within NCATS. The conferees urge NIH to provide an 
annual report on the TRND program that identifies the number of 
projects started each year, cost per project, and the outcome 
of each project. The first report should be provided to the 
Committees on Appropriations by July 1, 2012.
      Institutional Development Awards.--The conferees provide 
$276,480,000 to increase support for the Institutional 
Development Awards (IDeA) program. The conferees recognize the 
importance of the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence 
(COBRE) and the IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence 
(INBRE) programs. The conferees believe the IDeA program has 
made a significant contribution to biomedical research and 
creating a skilled workforce. Therefore, the conferees provide 
a $45,882,000 increase and recommend it be divided equally 
toward a new COBRE competition and to support new awards for 
the IDeA Clinical Trial and Translation Program to develop 
infrastructure for clinical and translational research in IDeA 
States. The conferees encourage the NIH Director to expand the 
program to support co-funding of IDeA projects across NIH ICs 
to foster the development of efforts in IDeA State programs. 
Further, as an Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate 
Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program, the focus of IDeA should 
continue to be on improving the necessary infrastructure and 
strengthening the biomedical research capacity and capability 
of research institutions. Unfortunately, many institutions in 
EPSCoR-qualifying States who could benefit from the IDeA 
program are ineligible for funding. The conferees encourage NIH 
to revise current eligibility criteria to take into account how 
the decreasing success rate for R01 grants NIH-wide is 
affecting IDeA eligibility. In particular, the conferees 
believe the IDeA Director should have the authority to consider 
funding institutions in any State that is EPSCoR eligible. The 
conferees urge NIH to develop criteria to incorporate 
flexibility into the program to address these concerns. The 
conferees request an update on both the IDeA eligibility 
criteria proposals and funding level by State and major 
activities, to include the co-funding activity, in the fiscal 
year 2013 congressional budget justification.
      Third Party Collections 3-Year Pilot.--Since fiscal year 
1997, Congress has included bill language authorizing NIH to 
``collect third party payments for the cost of clinical 
services that are incurred in NIH research facilities.'' NIH 
has not yet exercised that authority. A recent study released 
in September that was conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(PwC) found that there are numerous potential advantages as 
well as potential disadvantages to implementing a third party 
billing program. ``The potential use of third party billing 
represents a significant investment and enduring change for the 
NIH Clinical Center,'' the study states. ``As such, additional 
efforts beyond the 14-week study represented in this report may 
be undertaken to more fully consider the challenges associated 
with the use of third party billing and the opportunities that 
may exist.'' The conferees concur with this observation and 
therefore direct NIH to conduct a 3-year pilot study to assess 
the viability of third party reimbursement at NIH by looking at 
one of the services commonly used by a significant number of 
outpatients at some point in the patient's protocol. One 
possible example would be radiology services, but this is not 
the only option. The Committees on Appropriations expect to be 
briefed on the proposed subject area and scope of the pilot 
before it is finalized. The conferees include $10,000,000 for 
the Clinical Center for the costs of building the billing 
infrastructure for the pilot.
      Neuroblastoma.--The conferees note the promising results 
of a recent clinical trial using a chimeric antibody to treat 
newly diagnosed neuroblastoma patients. The conferees support 
efforts to facilitate access to this new therapy for relapsed 
patients and request an update in the fiscal year 2013 
congressional budget request.
      Clinical Trials.--The conferees are aware of a 2010 IOM 
study on clinical trials that identified a number of concerns 
which may apply across all ICs.
      The conferees direct NIH to conduct a trans-NIH review of 
the applicability of the 12 IOM recommendations to all NIH ICs 
that conduct clinical trials. The review should examine ways to 
develop and strengthen NIH-wide policies with a focus on 
opportunities to improve the incorporation of innovative 
science, increase speed of initiation and completion, improve 
the means of setting priorities, and develop better incentives 
for participation in clinical trials.
      The conferees note the report found it takes over 900 
days to open a clinical trial, but trials supported through the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act developed methods to 
open studies within 90 days. The conferees encourage NIH to 
consider guidance to incorporate the 90-day opening model into 
other NIH-wide clinical trial activity.
      The review should examine the policies of each IC 
regarding funding for variable accrual costs per case, and 
ensure consistent guidelines across NIH. Specifically, the 
review should examine the viability and effect on speed of 
opening trials of a multi-tier system in which payments for 
cost-per-accrual vary according to the time required to open 
the trial. Furthermore, the review should examine the methods 
and processes ICs use to prioritize clinical trials based on 
peer-review input, funding, and other ways to optimize 
selection of studies.
      The conferees request a report by September 30, 2012, 
that identifies the findings, proposed policy changes, 
implementation timeline, and key measures NIH will use to 
monitor clinical trial activity.

       Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

      The conference agreement includes $3,354,313,000 for the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA). In addition, the conference agreement makes available 
$129,667,000 under section 241 of the Public Health Service 
(PHS) Act.
      The conference agreement includes bill language that 
divides SAMHSA into several accounts to improve transparency 
and accountability. The conferees direct that future budget 
requests, to include the fiscal year 2013 budget request, 
reflect this new structure. Further, the conferees direct 
SAMHSA to include in its budget justification the specific 
funding increases, decreases and FTE changes being requested by 
program, project or activity, along with a detailed description 
of activities funded under each program, the number of new and 
continuing grants made; the average grant size; and a State-by-
State table for any formula-based funding for all budget lines 
included in this Statement of the Managers. The conferees 
expect that SAMHSA shall not make changes to any program, 
project, or activity as outlined by the budget tables included 
in this Statement of the Managers without prior notification to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
      The conferees have provided funding for Programs of 
Regional and National Significance under each of SAMHSA's 
statutorily-created Centers rather than consolidate funding 
into a single account for Innovation and Emerging Issues, as 
proposed in the budget request.

                             MENTAL HEALTH

      The conference agreement includes $934,853,000 for Mental

                  Program Management
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Research, Demonstration and Evaluation................       $21,200,000
Program Operations....................................     2,663,935,000
State Survey and Certification........................       355,876,000
State High Risk Insurance Pools.......................        44,000,000
Federal Administration................................       794,465,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The conferees include funding for Research, 
Demonstration, and Evaluation activities, including the 
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. The conferees encourage 
CMS to review the programs within this account to determine if 
they are funded in the appropriate budget line. Specifically,

of moving the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey into the 
Program Operations activity.
      Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC).--The conferees 
understand that in 2008, ASCs provided 3.3 million Medicare 
recipients with outpatient surgical services, including 
screening services. The conferees have heard concerns related 
to the use of the consumer price index for urban consumers 
(CPI-U) to update the payment rates of ASCs, a different method 
than is used for other comparable service providers. The 
conferees request that CMS develop a report that compares other 
potential options for updating the payment rates of ASCs and 
report back the findings in the fiscal year 2013 budget 
request.
      CMS Test Environment for Testing Industry Solutions in 
Secure Settings.--The conferees direct and provide $5,000,000 
for CMS to provide a test environment ``sandbox'' where vendors 
can work independently and with CMS to seek solutions and 
execute ``proof of concept'' tests to Medicare issues in a 
secure environment, using Medicare data, on CMS technical 
architecture. The conferees recommend support within the 
Enterprise IT Activities function to establish an isolated, 
stand-alone test environment for independent vendor testing of 
industry solutions that could provide significant benefit to 
CMS operations. The test environment will provide controlled 
access to Medicare data to run ``proof of concept'' tests that 
determine solution effectiveness in addressing Medicare issues 
such as improper payment and quality measurement. The test 
environment must ensure data privacy and security, comply with 
CMS technical architecture standards, provide temporary access 
and secure connectivity for vendor testing, and make relevant 
data sets available for product testing. The conferees request 
a report and timeline in the fiscal year 2013 budget request.
      Comparison of Residency Position.--The conferees request 
CMS conduct an analysis evaluating the implementation of 
Section 5503 of Public Law 111-148 on the allocation of 
Medicare Graduate Medical Education (GME) resident slots to 
hospitals. This analysis shall compare how residency slots are 
allocated according to two assignment strategies. Strategy one 
is the allocation of GME slots according to the current final 
CMS Federal Rule as published in the Federal Register on 
November 24, 2010. The current final rule states that fiscal 
year 2009 report data not be included if it was reported after 
March 23, 2010. Strategy two involves an assessment of GME slot 
allocation which includes all fiscal year 2009 cost reports, 
including data for hospitals whose fiscal year ended on 
December 31, 2009, and as such have cost data reported after 
March 23, 2010. The report of this analysis shall include the 
number of Medicare GME slots allocated to each hospital under 
the two different allocation strategies. The conferees request 
CMS provide the final report with the detailed hospital level 
information under each option to the House and Senate 
Appropriations Committees not later than 6 months after 
enactment.
      Dialysis Facilities.--The conferees are concerned by 
reports of delays in the processing for surveys and 
certifications for dialysis facilities and encourage CMS to 
reduce the wait times. Further, the conferees request CMS 
report back to the Congress within 6 months on major 
impediments related to processing applications timely and 
provide its plan to address these impediments.
      The conferees urge CMS to develop an overall strategic 
plan that links its vision for operations, program integrity, 
information technology, and other areas into a comprehensive 
approach with measurable objectives and resources. The 
conferees request a copy of this plan no later than 180 days 
after enactment.

                        DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

                    Education for the Disadvantaged

      The conference agreement includes $15,750,983,000 for 
Education for the Disadvantaged. The conference agreement 
provides $4,909,806,000 in fiscal year 2012 and $10,841,177,000 
in fiscal year 2013 funding for this account.
      For Title I School Improvement Grants, the conference 
agreement continues bill language permitting fiscal year 2012 
appropriations to be used by local educational agencies to 
serve any Title I, part A-eligible school that has not made 
adequate yearly progress for at least two years or is in a 
State's lowest quintile of performance based on proficiency 
rates and, in the case of secondary schools, priority shall be 
given to those schools with graduation rates below 60 percent.
      The conference agreement includes language permitting the 
Secretary to establish a maximum subgrant size of $2,000,000 
for Title I School Improvement Grants and allows the Secretary 
to reserve up to 5 percent of school improvement funds for 
State and local capacity building.
      The conferees note that many children in schools 
receiving SIG funds face myriad personal, familial, and 
community challenges (including poverty-related stressors), and 
these challenges follow students into their schools, often 
resulting in distracting, disruptive, and ineffective learning 
environments. Even the best school leaders and teachers cannot 
achieve optimal results unless poverty-related barriers to 
teaching, learning, and school organization are addressed and 
effective conditions for learning are established. These 
barriers to teaching and learning must be addressed in addition 
to in-school factors in order to achieve sustained academic 
success.
      The conferees direct the Department to require that all 
schools receiving SIG funds have a plan in place for addressing 
the academic and non-academic needs of their students, 
including improving the overall school climate where necessary, 
in addition to addressing factors such as the usage of time, 
instructional practices, and professional development and 
supports. The conferees expect the plan to assess and address 
as appropriate the mental health needs and interventions of the 
students at the school in an integrated manner within the 
overall turnaround strategy; related training and professional 
development for all staff that increase classroom efficacy such 
as classroom organization and management, including teachers 
and administrators; access to school-based counseling services; 
the development of school-based systems, such as teams, to 
identify and address individual student academic, behavioral, 
health, or social needs and to support a positive and 
developmentally appropriate school climate; and how parents, 
families and the community will be engaged in this and other 
aspects of the school turnaround process.
      For the Striving Readers program, the conference 
agreement includes $160,000,000 and bill language to continue a 
comprehensive literacy program for States.

provides $2,868,577,000 in fiscal year 2012 and $1,681,441,000 
in fiscal year 2013 funding for this account.
      Within the amount provided for Teacher Quality State 
Grants, the conference agreement provides a set aside of one 
and one-half percent of funds for competitive awards for 
teacher or principal training or professional enhancement 
activities to national not-for-profit organizations.
      The conference agreement includes bill language that 
allows funds under the Education of Native Hawaiians program to 
be used for construction, renovation, and modernization of any 
elementary school, secondary school, or related structure run 
by the Department of Education of the State of Hawaii that 
serves a predominantly Native Hawaiian student body.
      The conference agreement also includes bill language that 
requires the Alaska Native Education program to be awarded 
without regard to earmarks included in the program's 
authorizing statute. The conference agreement also allows funds 
within this program to be used for construction.
      The conferees intend that in providing the technical 
assistance and guidance described in Senate Report 112-84, the 
Department of Education should not give priority to, show 
preference for, or provide direction about whether communities 
use 21st Century Community Learning Center funds for after 
school, before school, summer school or extended school day 
programs, unless specifically requested by a State or local 
educational agency.
      The conference agreement provides $27,000,000 for the 
Advanced Placement program. The conferees intend that 
$20,000,000 of these funds be used to continue the Advanced 
Placement Test Fee program and that $7,000,000 be used for 
continuation costs for the Advanced Placement Incentive 
Program.

                            Indian Education

      The conference agreement includes $131,027,000 for Indian 
Education.
      The conferees recognize that tribal education departments 
and agencies are uniquely situated at the local level to 
implement innovative education programs to improve Native 
American education. Accordingly, the conference agreement 
includes $2,000,000 under the National Activities line for a 
pilot project to increase the role of tribal education 
departments in Native American education. In the pilot, tribal 
education agencies would directly administer some Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act programs to enter into 
collaborative agreements with States to work closely with 
school districts located on Indian reservations or former 
Indian reservations located in Oklahoma. The conferees expect 
the Department of Education to collaborate with the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs on this effort.

childhood education component in administering the Race to the 
Top competition. The conference agreement also authorizes the 
Secretary to use up to five percent of funds under the Race to 
the Top and Investing in Innovation authorities for technical 
assistance and evaluation of these programs.
      The conference agreement continues language in the 
Teacher Incentive Fund program that provides for competitive 
grants to implement performance-based compensation systems for 
teachers, principals and other personnel in high-need schools.
      In the charter schools program, the conference agreement 
continues language requiring $23,000,000 to be used to support 
charter school facilities needs. The conference agreement also

extends availability of these funds to September 30, 2013.
      The conference agreement provides $2,000,000 for 
competitive grants to support alternative financing programs 
that provide for the purchase of assistive technology (AT) 
devices. The conferees' goal in providing these funds is to 
allow greater access to affordable financing to help people 
with disabilities purchase the specialized technologies needed 
to live independently, to succeed at school and work and to 
otherwise live active and productive lives. The conferees 
intend that applicants incorporate credit building activities 
in their programs, including financial education and 
information about other possible funding sources. Successful 
applicants must emphasize consumer choice and control and build 
programs that will provide financing for the full array of AT 
devices and services and ensure that all people, regardless of 
type of disability or health condition, age, level of income 
and residence have access to the program.

and Senate Committees on Appropriations, the House Committee on 
Ways and Means, and the Senate Committee on Finance with a 
timeline, major milestones, and projected 5-year costs of this 
project within 180 days of enactment of this bill and to 
provide annual progress reports thereafter.

following information in its annual budget requests, operating 
plans, and reprogramming requests:
      SSI Extramural Research and Demonstration program, 
project, and activity details;
      Annual fiscal year workload table on disability appeals

year 2011 questions for the record;

referred to ODAR's use of video technology as a model for other 
agencies. The conferees request a report by OIG within 180 days 
of enactment analyzing legislative and administrative options, 
including potential challenges, for expanding access to video 
hearings. The report should analyze the costs and benefits to 
the claimant, claimant representatives, and taxpayers related 
to the current use and potential expansion of the use of video 
hearings by SSA. The report should be sent to the House and 
Senate Appropriations Committees, the House Committee on Ways 
and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance.

               Security in Congressional District Offices

      The conferees are aware of efforts underway by the House 
Sergeant At Arms (HSAA) and the Capitol Police (USCP) to 
improve security in Congressional district offices. With the 
assistance of the HSAA and USCP, many Member offices had 
security assessments conducted and were provided a list of 
recommended security upgrades as a result of those assessments. 
Member offices currently pay for their office leases, including 
physical security, through their office budgets, also called 
the Members' Representational Allowance, which have been 
reduced. While the payment for district security is 
decentralized, the guiding principles and policies should not 
be. Therefore, the HSAA, along with USCP, shall assist offices 
in prioritizing improvements and highlighting alternative 
office locations that yield greater security with less cost. In 
addition the House's Chief Administrative Officer is directed 
to provide outreach to Member offices and offer assistance in 
lease negotiations as Member offices look to relocate or 
negotiate more favorable terms that incorporate heightened 
security concerns.

                        Congressional Youth Park

      The conferees note that the fiscal year 2002 Legislative 
Branch appropriations bill, Public Law 107-68 included a 
provision designating a special parcel of the Capitol Grounds 
as the Congressional Youth Park. The conferees commend the 
Architect of the Capitol (AOC) for developing the Capitol 
Complex Master Plan as a guiding document for the future 
development of the Capitol grounds. The plan embraces Frederick 
Law Olmstead's original landscape design establishing grounds 
that enhance and elevate the U.S. Capitol. Integral to this 
plan should be the original intent of the Botanic Garden to 
educate visitors about the aesthetic, cultural, economic, 
therapeutic, and ecological importance of plants. In this 
spirit, the conferees direct the AOC to develop, as part of the 
Capitol Complex Master Plan, the cultural landscape plan for 
the Congressional Youth Park that aligns the use of the Park 
with Olmstead's historically important vision about the 
importance of the natural world in their daily lives. This 
segment of the Master Plan shall also take into consideration 
landscape requirements necessary to ensure the continued 
security of the Capitol complex.

                             CVC GIFT SHOP

      The conferees note that the CVC gift shop operating 
budget exceeds the revenues generated within the gift shop 
revolving fund. The conferees understand that there are 
mitigating circumstances such as ``Buy American'' requirements 
that account for the CVC gift shop operating differently than 
other gift shops, such as the Library of Congress gift shop. 
Given that the CVC gift shop has been operating for a few 
years, the conferees believe it would be beneficial at this 
juncture for the AOC to review and report on the operations and 
steps that can be taken to improve operations within the 
revolving fund understanding the distinctive parameters under 
which the CVC gift shop operates. This report should be 
provided to the Committee on Appropriations of the House and 
Senate no later than March 31, 2012.

                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

                      REIMBURSABLE OVERTIME COSTS

      The conference agreement includes an administrative 
provision, section 1201, which authorizes the Architect of the 
Capitol to reimburse the Capitol Police for the cost of 
overtime associated with construction projects.
      The conferees direct the Architect of the Capitol and the 
United States Capitol Police to enter into a memorandum of 
understanding to establish the appropriate mechanisms necessary 
to implement this reimbursable process. The memorandum of 
understanding shall include, but not be limited to, the 
identification of the type and scope of construction projects 
subject to reimbursement, the projected overtime and related 
benefits costs for security requirements necessitated by a 
specific project before the project commences, and the 
reporting to the Architect of the Capitol actual costs for 
reimbursement on a regular basis during and upon completion of 
a security project. It is the conferees intent that this 
practice will commence with the submission of the fiscal year 
2013 budget request. The Architect of the Capitol shall submit 
the requested overtime for ongoing and future construction 
projects for fiscal year 2013. During fiscal year 2013, and for 
future fiscal years, if overtime costs exceed those requested, 
the Architect of the Capitol, with the concurrence of the 
Capitol Police, will submit such costs to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations for approval.
      The conference agreement includes an administrative 
provision, section 1202, concerning the Capitol grounds.

                       Government Printing Office

                           Operational Review

      Over the past 10 years, the Government Printing Office 
has regularly contracted out approximately 75% of the dollar 
value of all work ordered annually (other than U.S. passports 
and secure credentials). The vast majority of the work that is 
contracted out is for the Executive Branch. Printing for the 
Congress, passports for State Department, secure credentials 
for Federal agencies and Congress, products for the Office of 
the Federal Register, and several important jobs of the 
Executive Branch, such as the President's Annual Budget and 
printing for the White House, are conducted in-house, as are 
all of GPO's digital information operations serving all three 
branches of the Federal Government. The conferees note that 
several studies evaluating GPO's production, procurement, and 
information dissemination programs and operations, including 
the Federal Depository Library Program, have been conducted in 
the past. The conferees also note that past reviews have 
supported the GPO's business model as the most efficient way in 
which the government should operate its printing and 
information dissemination responsibilities. The conferees 
believe that the GPO and the Congress would benefit from an 
update of these reviews, particularly given the growth in 
printing and digital technology in recent years, including the 
feasibility of Executive Branch printing being continued to be 
performed by the GPO, and other cost saving operational 
alternatives that might be worthy of consideration. Within 
available funds under the heading, ``Congressional Research 
Service'' , the conferees direct the Congressional Research 
Service to award a grant or contract to the National Academy of 
Public Administration, an independent, nonpartisan organization 
that was chartered by Congress to assist Federal, State, and 
local governments in improving their effectiveness, efficiency, 
and accountability, to conduct a study on updating a review of 
GPO operations and additional cost saving opportunities beyond 
what GPO has already instituted, if any, and report its 
findings to the Committee on Appropriations of the House and 
Senate no later than one year after enactment of this Act.

                   CONGRESSIONAL PRINTING AND BINDING

                    Government Accountability Office

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $511,296,000 in direct 
appropriations for salaries and expenses, Government 
Accountability Office. In addition, $22,304,000 is available 
from offsetting collections.

                        ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION

      The agreement includes an administrative provision, 
section 1401, that allows GAO to be treated the same as other 
Legislative Branch agencies regarding employee buyout 
authority.
      The conferees direct that GAO cease all work and no funds 
are provided for any GAO study related to the study requested 
in House Report 112-148 regarding the future of the Government 
Printing Office. That work is being conducted by NAPA through 
CRS.

                             Cost Analysis

      The conferees believe that in order to provide the GAO 
with the appropriate funding level to conduct its audits 
efficiently, the conferees need a complete understanding of the 
costs associated with conducting the audits. The concern that 
certain costs associated with the reports cannot be accounted 
for was heightened by the GAO Office of Inspector General 
report noting that ``GAO's travel card program could be 
strengthened by adopting selected best practices identified in 
related Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. . . . 
Further, we found that OMB's travel card guidance was not used 
by GAO to manage or assess the effectiveness of its travel card 
program controls.'' Therefore, the conferees direct the GAO to 
report to the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations on 
a semi-annual basis, with a cost analysis by function of its 
work products, a total funding level for any completed report 
during the fiscal year, and the number of reports previously 
conducted on the particular issues for which reports are being 
conducted.

                Open World Leadership Center Trust Fund

      The conference agreement includes $10,000,000 for payment 
to the Open World Leadership Center Trust Fund.
      In June 2003 the House Committee on Appropriations 
directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to assess 
the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the Open World 
Leadership Center (OWLC) in fulfilling its responsibilities and 
role in achieving the overall intent and purposes of the 
program. In March 2004 the GAO issued a report (GAO-04-436) 
containing recommendations that OWLC establish strategic and 
performance plans, strengthen assessing and reporting on 
program performance, and improve its financial management and 
accountability mechanisms. In the report the OWLC took issue 
with the GAO emphasis on performance measures, noting that its 
success is only measurable in the medium or long term. The 
conferees direct the GAO to reexamine the OWLC regarding the 
recommendations to determine what action has been taken to meet 
the GAO recommendations with special emphasis on financial 
management and performance measures. It has been a number of 
years since this report was issued, and the conferees believe 
enough time has lapsed to determine progress in both these 
fields. Therefore, the conferees direct the GAO to reexamine 
the recommendations of the March 2004 report with emphasis on 
financial management and accountability mechanisms and the 
measurable benefits of the OWLC. GAO shall consult with the 
Committees on Appropriations as it develops the methodology and 
scope of the review. GAO shall issue its final report by August 
2012 and provide regular updates to the Committees prior to 
issuing the final report.

   John C. Stennis Center For Public Service Training and Development

      The conference agreement includes $430,000. The conferees 
direct that future budget requests from the John C. Stennis 
Center be accompanied by an appropriately detailed budget 
justification.

                      TITLE II--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      The conference agreement continues, in sections 201 to 
209, nine routine provisions carried in prior years. In 
addition the agreement includes section 210 related to delivery 
of printed copies of bills, joint resolutions, and resolutions, 
section 211 related to delivery of printed copies of the 
Congressional Record being delivered to a Member's House 
office, and section 212 related to Members of the House, which 
places a limitation on the amount that can be expended for the 
lease of a vehicle.

        Reprogramming Guidelines for Legislative Branch Agencies

      The conferees expect all agencies to notify the 
Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate of any 
significant departures from budget plans presented to the 
Committees of the House and Senate. In particular, agencies 
funded in this bill are required to notify the Committees prior 
to each reprogramming of funds in excess of the lesser of 10 
percent or $500,000 between programs, projects, or activities, 
or in excess of $500,000 between object classifications (except 
for shifts within the pay categories, object class 11, 12, and 
13, or as further specified in each agency's respective 
section). This includes cumulative reprogrammings that together 
total at least $500,000 from or to a particular program, 
activity, or object classification, as well as reprogramming of 
FTEs or funds to create new organizational entities within the 
Agency or to restructure entities which already exist. These 
guidelines remain effective unless modified by a subsequent 
conference.

                                TITLE I

                         DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

                       ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST

      Reprogramming Guidelines.--The following reprogramming 
guidelines apply for all military construction and family 
housing projects. A project or account (including the sub-
elements of an account) which has been specifically reduced by 
the Congress in acting on the budget request is considered to 
be a congressional interest item and as such, prior approval is 
required. Accordingly, no reprogrammings to an item 
specifically reduced below the threshold by the Congress are 
permitted, except that the Department of Defense may seek 
reprogrammings for appropriated increments.
      The reprogramming criteria that apply to military 
construction projects (25 percent of the funded amount or 
$2,000,000, whichever is less) continue to apply to new housing 
construction projects and to improvements over $2,000,000. To 
provide the services the flexibility to proceed with 
construction contracts without disruption or delay, the costs 
associated with environmental hazard remediation such as 
asbestos removal, radon abatement, lead-based paint removal or 
abatement, and any other legislated environmental hazard 
remediation may be excluded, provided that such remediation 
requirements could not be reasonably anticipated at the time of 
the budget submission. This exclusion applies to projects 
authorized in this budget year, as well as projects authorized 
in prior years for which construction has not been completed. 
Planning and design costs associated with military construction 
and family housing projects may also be excluded from these 
guidelines. In instances where prior approval to a 
reprogramming request for a project or account has been 
received from the Committees on Appropriations, the adjusted 
amount approved becomes the new base for any future increase or 
decrease via below-threshold reprogrammings (provided that the 
project or account is not a congressional interest item as 
defined above).
      In addition to these guidelines, the services are 
directed to adhere to the guidance for military construction 
reprogrammings and notifications, including the pertinent 
statutory authorities contained in DOD Financial Management 
Regulation 7000.14-R and relevant updates and policy memoranda. 
The conferees encourage the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence to use a format similar to that used by the Office 
of the Secretary of Defense to submit reprogramming requests.
      Incrementally Funded Projects.--The conferees note that 
the Administration requested several large military 
construction projects that can be incrementally funded, but 
were instead submitted as large single-year requests, in 
accordance with a directive from the Office of Management and 
Budget to the Department of Defense to severely restrict the 
use of incremental funding for military construction. The 
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress have 
previously notified the Administration that they reserve the 
prerogative to provide incremental funding where appropriate, 
in accordance with authorizing legislation. The conferees 
continue to believe that military construction projects should 
be fully funded or separated into stand-alone phases when 
practical. In some cases, however, incremental funding makes 
fiscal and programmatic sense. The conference agreement 
therefore incrementally funds the following projects: Aviation 
Complex Phase 3A, Fort Wainwright, Alaska; Mountainview 
Operations Facility, Buckley AFB, Colorado; Hospital 
Replacement, Increment 3, Fort Bliss, Texas; Ambulatory Care 
Center Phase 3, Joint Base San Antonio, Texas; STRATCOM 
Replacement Facility, Increment 1, Offutt AFB, Nebraska; Data 
Center, Increment 3, Camp Williams, Utah; Ambulatory Care 
Center, Ph 3, Joint Base Andrews, Maryland; and Strike Fuel 
Systems Maintenance Hanger, Anderson AFB, Guam.
      Quarterly Summary of Notifications.--The conferees direct 
the services and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (on 
behalf of itself and Defense agencies) to continue to submit a 
quarterly report listing all notifications, to include bid 
savings by service and Defense agencies, that have been 
submitted to the Committees during the preceding three-month 
period.
      Report on Design Obligations.--The conferees direct that 
the Secretary of Defense, and the secretaries of the Army, 
Navy, and Air Force, each submit separate semi-annual reports 
on the obligation and expenditure of planning and design funds. 
The Secretary of Defense's report shall cover Military 
Construction, Defense-Wide, and the reports by the Army, Navy, 
and Air Force shall cover active, guard, and reserve military 
construction accounts. Each report shall provide data on the 
total amount available from each and all fiscal years for 
planning and design activities, as well as the amounts 
currently obligated and expended. The reports shall be 
submitted no later than 30 days following the end of the second 
and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2012 and semi-annually no 
later than 30 days following the second and fourth quarters of 
each fiscal year thereafter.
      Quadrennial Defense Review/Nuclear Posture Review (QDR/
NPR).--The conference agreement does not reference language 
requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit a report regarding 
future funding for the QDR/NPR programs because the reporting 
requirement has already been fulfilled.
      Army Stationing in Europe.--In order to better understand 
future requirements for U.S. military construction in Germany 
in light of current and projected realignment activities, the 
conferees direct that no later than 90 days after enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall provide a report, in 
writing, on installations and properties in Germany that the 
Department of Defense intends to return to the host nation. 
This report should include (1) intended timelines for closures 
of U.S. Army installations along with a list of military 
construction projects required at other installations to 
facilitate the downsizing and consolidation of Army forces in 
Germany; (2) identification of the brigade combat team that 
will be withdrawn from Germany; (3) an estimate of costs 
(including operation and maintenance costs and military 
construction costs) to be incurred during fiscal years 2012 
through 2015 in connection with keeping the brigade identified 
in Germany through September 30, 2015, versus stationing a 
similar brigade in the United States; and (4) identification of 
the Army installations in the United States with the 
capability, existing infrastructure, and training facilities to 
support a brigade combat team similar to the one referenced 
above. The report should be submitted to the Committees on 
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress and may include a 
classified annex if necessary.
      Guam Realignment.--The conferees support the 
Administration's focus on strengthening the U.S. military 
posture in the Pacific region. One of the most ambitious 
undertakings by the Department of Defense is the joint U.S.-
Japanese plan to move 8,000 Marines and their families from 
Okinawa to Guam. The conferees note that a number of unforeseen 
obstacles, including lengthy environmental studies, legal 
challenges, and land use issues, have hampered the Department's 
ability to execute planned military construction projects 
associated with the realignment that have been funded in 
previous appropriations bills. In light of these delays, the 
conference agreement does not include funding, as requested, 
for two projects associated with the realignment. The conferees 
encourage the Department to complete the Guam master plan and 
provide a revised cost estimate and timetable for the Guam 
relocation so that the realignment can proceed without further 
delay.

                      MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY

      The conference agreement appropriates $3,006,491,000 for 
Military Construction, Army, instead of $3,041,491,000 as 
proposed by the House and $3,066,891,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Within this amount, the agreement provides $229,741,000 
for study, planning, design, architect and engineer services, 
and host nation support, the same amount as proposed by the 
House and Senate.

              MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, NAVY AND MARINE CORPS

      The conference agreement appropriates $2,112,823,000 for 
Military Construction, Navy and Marine Corps, instead of 
$2,436,547,000 as proposed by the House and $2,187,622,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. Within this amount, the agreement 
provides $84,362,000 for study, planning, design, architect and 
engineer services, the same amount as proposed by the House and 
Senate.

                    MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, AIR FORCE

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,227,058,000 for 
Military Construction, Air Force, instead of $1,247,358,000 as 
proposed by the House and $1,227,058,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Within this amount, the agreement provides $81,913,000 
for study, planning, design, architect and engineer services, 
the same amount as proposed by the House and Senate.

                  MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, DEFENSE-WIDE

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement appropriates $3,431,957,000 for 
Military Construction, Defense-Wide, instead of $3,533,757,000 
as proposed by the House and $3,380,917,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Within this amount, the agreement provides $430,602,000 
for study, planning, design, architect and engineer services, 
the same amount as proposed by the House and Senate.
      Fort Gordon, Georgia, National Security Agency (NSA) 
Project Adjustment.--The President's budget submission included 
$11,340,000 for the NSA Whitelaw Wedge Building addition at 
Fort Gordon, Georgia. Subsequent to the budget submission NSA 
determined that the cost of the project had increased to 
$17,705,000 and requested a $6,365,000 funding adjustment for 
the project. The Director of the NSA transmitted a formal 
request for this adjustment to the Committees on Appropriations 
of the House and Senate on June 2, 2011. Therefore, the 
conference agreement includes an additional $6,365,000 for this 
project as requested, with a corresponding decrement from the 
NSA minor construction account.
      Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) 
Schools.--The conferees note that over 86,000 children attend 
DODEA schools in the United States and overseas, but according 
to the 2009 DOD Report to Congress on Department of Defense 
Education Activity's Military Construction Program, 79 percent 
of DODEA schools were structurally rated as poor or failing. 
The conferees note that DOD's Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) 
for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 includes funding to 
recapitalize many, but not all, of these schools. The conferees 
urge the Secretary of Defense to prioritize the 
recapitalization of all poor or failing DODEA schools, and 
accelerate funding for this purpose in future FYDPs.
      Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP).--The 
conference agreement provides $135,000,000 for ECIP, as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate. Additionally, the 
conference agreement provides $10,000,000 in dedicated funding 
for ECIP planning and design, as proposed by the Senate. The 
conferees strongly support the efforts of the Department of 
Defense to promote energy conservation, green building 
initiatives, energy security, and investment in renewable 
energy resources, and commend the leadership of the Department 
and the services for making energy efficiency a key component 
of construction on military installations. The conferees urge 
the Department to use the the dedicated planning and design 
funds to invest in innovative renewable energy projects as well 
as projects that enhance energy security at military 
installations and encourages the Department to request 
dedicated planning and design funding for ECIP in future budget 
submissions.
      Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.--The conferees 
strongly support the construction of the new Landstuhl Regional 
Medical Center in Germany to replace the current aging 
facility, which is inefficient, and structurally a failing 
facility. However, the conferees note that the size, scope and 
design of the proposed replacement hospital was initiated 
several years ago, before the withdrawal schedule for U.S. 
troops in Iraq and Afghanistan was established, and before 
looming budget restraints prompted the Department of Defense 
(DOD) to reconsider all overseas basing of U.S. military 
forces. Given the potential for major force structure 
reductions in Europe, the conferees believe that the planning 
assumptions for the new Landstuhl Regional Medical Center 
should be re-evaluated to ensure that the facility is properly 
sized and scoped to meet the emerging contingency and force 
structure requirements in Europe.
      Because of the importance of this project, the conference 
agreement fully funds the Department's request to proceed with 
site preparation and utility infrastructure for the replacement 
hospital. However, the conference agreement restricts the 
Department from awarding a design contract for the hospital 
that exceeds the 20 percent design level until the Secretary of 
Defense has provided a plan to the Committees on Appropriations 
of the House of Representatives and the Senate describing how 
it intends to implement the recommendations of a Government 
Accountability Office study with regard to the plans, baseline 
data, and estimated cost of the new facility, and certifies 
that the replacement hospital is properly sized and scoped to 
meet the projected health care requirements.
      The conferees further direct DOD to provide to the 
Committees, in conjunction with the certification, 
justification supporting the size and scope of the replacement 
hospital that includes, at a minimum, (1) documentation that 
clearly shows how health care requirements were used to 
calculate the size, configuration, and associated costs of the 
facility, and (2) a risk or sensitivity analysis that assesses, 
at a minimum, how potential global posture changes in the area 
of responsibility of the European Command may impact the health 
care requirements for the proposed facility.

               MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY NATIONAL GUARD

      The conference agreement appropriates $773,592,000 for 
Military Construction, Army National Guard, as proposed by the 
Senate instead of $798,592,000 as proposed by the House. Within 
this amount, the agreement provides $20,671,000 for study, 
planning, design, architect and engineer services.

               MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, AIR NATIONAL GUARD

      The conference agreement appropriates $116,246,000 for 
Military Construction, Air National Guard, as proposed by the 
both the House and the Senate. Within this amount, the 
agreement provides $12,225,000 for study, planning, design, 
architect and engineer services.

                  MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY RESERVE

      The conference agreement appropriates $280,549,000 for 
Military Construction, Army Reserve, as proposed by both the 
House and the Senate. Within this amount, the agreement 
provides $28,924,000 for study, planning, design, architect and 
engineer services.

                  MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, NAVY RESERVE

      The conference agreement appropriates $26,299,000 for 
Military Construction, Navy Reserve, as proposed by both the 
House and the Senate. Within this amount, the agreement 
provides $2,591,000 for study, planning, design, architect and 
engineer services.

                MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, AIR FORCE RESERVE

      The conference agreement appropriates $33,620,000 for 
Military Construction, Air Force Reserve, as proposed by both 
the House and the Senate. Within this amount, the agreement 
provides $2,200,000 for study, planning, design, architect and 
engineer services.

     NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION SECURITY INVESTMENT PROGRAM

      The conference agreement appropriates $247,611,000 for 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment 
Program, the same amount as proposed by the House, instead of 
$272,611,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                   FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, ARMY

      The conference agreement appropriates $176,897,000 for 
Family Housing Construction, Army, instead of $186,897,000 as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

             FAMILY HOUSING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, ARMY

      The conference agreement appropriates $493,458,000 for 
Family Housing Operation and Maintenance, Army instead of 
$494,858,000 as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
      General Officer Flag Officer Quarters.--The conferees 
reduced the request for Family Housing Operation and 
Maintenance by $1,400,000 based on the Secretary of the Army's 
notification that the exterior repairs in Stuttgart, Germany, 
are no longer necessary.

           FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, NAVY AND MARINE CORPS

      The conference agreement appropriates $100,972,000 for 
Family Housing Construction, Navy and Marine Corps as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate.

    FAMILY HOUSING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, NAVY AND MARINE CORPS

      The conference agreement appropriates $367,863,000 for 
Family Housing Operation and Maintenance, Navy and Marine Corps 
as proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                 FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, AIR FORCE

      The conference agreement appropriates $60,042,000 for 
Family Housing Construction, Air Force instead of $84,804,000 
as proposed by both the House and the Senate. The funding 
adjustment was requested by the Air Force to offset a shortfall 
in family housing operation and maintenance funding. To cover 
the shortfall, the Air Force requested the cancellation of a 
family housing construction improvement project at Misawa, 
Japan, resulting in a decrease of $24,762,000 from the budget 
submission.

          FAMILY HOUSING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, AIR FORCE

      The conference agreement appropriates $429,523,000 for 
Family Housing Operation and Maintenance, Air Force instead of 
$404,761,000 as proposed by both the House and the Senate. The 
$24,762,000 increase was requested by the Air Force to cover a 
projected shortfall in family housing operation and maintenance 
funding. The funding increase is offset by a corresponding 
reduction of $24,762,000 in Air Force family housing 
construction funding.

         FAMILY HOUSING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, DEFENSE-WIDE

      The conference agreement appropriates $50,723,000 for 
Family Housing Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

         DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FAMILY HOUSING IMPROVEMENT FUND

      The conference agreement appropriates $2,184,000 for the 
Department of Defense Family Housing Improvement Fund as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                       HOMEOWNERS ASSISTANCE FUND

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,284,000 for the 
Homeowners Assistance Fund as proposed by both the House and 
the Senate. The conference agreement also includes language 
that the Secretary of Defense shall not issue any regulation or 
otherwise take any action to limit the submission of 
applications prior to September 30, 2012, for benefits, 
including permanent change of station benefits, as provided 
under section 1013 of the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan 
Development Act of 1966, (42 U.S.C. 3374), as amended.

          CHEMICAL DEMILITARIZATION CONSTRUCTION, DEFENSE-WIDE

      The conference agreement appropriates $75,312,000 for 
Chemical Demilitarization Construction, Defense-Wide as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

            DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE ACCOUNT 1990

      The conference agreement appropriates $323,543,000 for 
the Department of Defense Base Closure Account 1990, as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $373,543,000 as proposed by 
the House.

            DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE ACCOUNT 2005

      The conference agreement appropriates $258,776,000 for 
the Department of Defense Base Closure Account 2005, as 
proposed by both the House and Senate. The conferees note that 
significant bid savings have been realized in the BRAC 2005 
military construction program, primarily as a result of the 
favorable bid climate over the past several years, and believe 
that these savings should be used to offset current BRAC 2005 
requirements as well as current and projected requirements of 
the Homeowners Assistance Program. The conferees therefore are 
rescinding $258,776,000 from previous BRAC 2005 appropriations 
(Sec. 132 of Administrative Provisions) to offset the fiscal 
2012 request. Additionally, the conferees direct the Department 
to use the transfer authority provided elsewhere in this Act to 
transfer sufficient unobligated balances from the BRAC 2005 
account to the Homeowners Assistance Program to address 
eligible claims for benefits, including permanent change of 
station benefits, submitted through September 30, 2012.
      BRAC 133.--On November 30, 2011, the Department of 
Defense Inspector General (DODIG) released report number DODIG 
2012-024, which found that the Army's transportation management 
plan for Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) recommendation 
#133 (Mark Center) was based on faulty data, rendering the 
transportation plan's findings and conclusions unreliable. 
Further, the Inspector General found that the traffic studies 
used to develop the plan do not address the totality of issues 
related to site ingress and egress, nor will the plan achieve 
its goal of reducing single-occupancy vehicle utilization. The 
conferees find the analysis as outlined in the DODIG's report 
deeply troubling. Equally troubling is the Army's refusal to 
even consider the DODIG's recommendations.
      In an effort to mitigate traffic congestion surrounding 
the Mark Center site, the conference agreement includes a 
limitation on the number of parking spaces the Department may 
utilize at the Mark Center to no more than 2,000, with the 
exception of disabled parking spaces. The limitation may be 
waived in part, but not in whole, if the Secretary of Defense 
certifies that none of the intersections surrounding the Mark 
Center reach failing levels of service ``e'' or ``f,'' as 
defined by the Transportation Research Board Highway Capacity 
Manual, during a consecutive 90-day period.
      Should the intersections currently undergoing traffic 
monitoring surrounding the Mark Center be deemed as not to have 
reached failing levels of service, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) and the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) must 
agree to the number of additional spaces that may be utilized 
at the Mark Center, which would then be subject to another 90-
day traffic monitoring program. To ensure that the Department 
adequately plans and mitigates traffic generated by the BRAC 
#133 development, the Department is directed to implement the 
DODIG's recommendations outlined in report number DODIG-2012-
024, and certify to Congress not later than 180 days after 
enactment of this Act that the recommendations have been 
implemented.
      The conferees recognize that the employees that work at 
the Mark Center bear no fault in the poor planning and 
execution of the transportation management plan. The conferees 
therefore strongly encourage the Department of Defense to 
examine mandatory commuting alternatives such as telework, 
flexible work schedules, satellite parking facilities with 
dedicated shuttle service to the Mark Center, parking capacity 
at the Pentagon, additional ridesharing and public transit 
incentives and all other means to ensure that Mark Center 
employees can commute to and from work without undue burden.

Senate.

                     VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

                           AREAS OF INTEREST

      Rural access. The conferees are deeply concerned about 
the difficulties veterans in rural areas face in finding 
appropriate and accessible Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
health care. As identified in the House and Senate reports, the 
conferees urge the VA to focus on infrastructure improvements 
at small and mid-sized medical centers, to consider offering 
mobile health services, to promulgate regulations allowing 
veterans service organizations to provide better transportation 
options for rural veterans, and to partner with State and local 
organizations to identify veterans in rural and highly rural 
areas. The conferees also expect to see a long-range strategic 
plan for the Office of Rural Health, as well as that Office's 
response to recommendations in the Inspector General's April 
2011 report. The conferees emphasize that all reports on rural 
access issues requested by either the House or Senate are 
required to be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations of 
the House of Representatives and the Senate (``Committees'') 90 
days after enactment of this Act, as described in the first 
section of this explanatory statement. In addition to the 
strategic plan, the conferees strongly urge the Department to 
improve the accessibility, efficiency, and effectiveness of 
rural healthcare by detailing options available for veterans 
who need to access healthcare from facilities which are ``split 
campus'' models where outpatient care and specialty services 
are not collocated.
      Licensing. The conferees urge the Department of Defense 
(DOD) and the VA to examine ways to eliminate duplicative 
licensing requirements as described in Senate Report 112-29.

                            MEDICAL SERVICES

      The conference agreement appropriates $41,354,000,000 in 
advance for fiscal year 2013 for Medical Services, as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate. The agreement does not extend 
the availability of any of this funding until September 30, 
2014, as proposed by the House. The conferees do not include 
the language proposed by the House limiting the use of 
$664,000,000 of fiscal year 2012 medical services funding to 
the fourth quarter and only once approval is obtained from the 
Committees.
      The conference agreement fully funds the family 
caregivers program at the request level of $248,000,000 for 
fiscal year 2013. The conferees urge the VA to ensure that the 
caregivers program remains a top priority.
      The conference agreement provides sufficient resources to 
fully implement VA homeless assistance programs, including the 
providers grant and per diem, domiciliary care for homeless 
veterans, and the HUD-VA supported housing program. In 
particular, the conferees urge the VA to focus on homeless 
veterans living in rural and highly rural areas.
      The conferees concur with the direction of the House 
regarding an annual report detailing the distribution of 
medical services funding among the Veterans Integrated Service 
Networks, central headquarters, and medical centers.
      The conferees concur with the House report language 
directing the VA not to convert dialysis service from contract-
provided care to in-house care until after completion and 
evaluation of its pilot demonstration. The conferees include an 
exception to this directive if there are any locations where it 
would result in a diminution of clinical care.
      The conferees urge the VA to continue implementation of 
the Integrated Mental Health Strategy.
      The conferees note that VA HIV testing rates 
significantly improved at VA facilities which used a clinical 
reminder to prompt routine HIV testing. The conferees urge the 
VA to employ HIV testing clinical reminders at all VA medical 
centers to accelerate the implementation of routine HIV 
testing, consistent with VHA Directive 2009-036. The conferees 
also encourage the VA to continue to award laboratory and 
clinical grants to implement routine HIV testing.

                     MEDICAL SUPPORT AND COMPLIANCE

      The conference agreement appropriates $5,746,000,000 in 
advance for fiscal year 2013 for Medical Support and 
Compliance, as proposed by both the House and the Senate. The 
agreement does not extend the availability of any of this 
funding until September 30, 2014, as proposed by the House.

                           MEDICAL FACILITIES

      The conference agreement appropriates $5,441,000,000 in 
advance for fiscal year 2013 for Medical Facilities, as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate. The agreement does 
not extend the availability of any of this funding until 
September 30, 2014, as proposed by the House. The conferees 
urge the Department to submit an additional fiscal year 2013 
budget request for Medical Facilities with the submission of 
the 2013 budget to address the need for increased non-recurring 
maintenance funding. Additionally, the conferees direct the 
Department to submit no later than April 6, 2012, a 
comprehensive list by location of all established multi-
specialty outpatient clinics and any proposed to be opened in 
fiscal year 2012.

                    MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH

      The conference agreement appropriates $581,000,000 for 
Medical and Prosthetic Research as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $530,774,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conferees continue to support the development of 
advanced prosthetic devices and direct that, no later than 90 
days after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in 
coordination with the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency, shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations, the 
Committees on Veterans Affairs, and the Committees on Armed 
Services of both Houses of Congress a report on the 
Department's plans to make the next generation of advanced 
prosthetics available for injured veterans and members of the 
Armed Forces. The report shall include the strategic plan and 
timetable to make the next generation prosthetic devices 
available and a description of the challenges (both technical 
and administrative) that could impact the schedule, as well as 
the Department's plans to mitigate these challenges.

                    NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION

      The conference agreement appropriates $250,934,000 for 
the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) as proposed by both 
the House and the Senate. Of the amount provided, $25,100,000 
is available until September 30, 2013, as proposed by both the 
House and the Senate.
      The conferees are concerned that the NCA has failed to 
adequately serve the burial needs the nation's veterans in 
rural areas. The NCA fiscal year 2012 budget submission 
acknowledges that 10 percent of all veterans will not have 
access to a burial option in a national, State or tribal 
cemetery. The majority of these underserved veterans live in 
rural areas, and the conferees are concerned that the NCA's 
Urban Initiative will exacerbate the disparity of burial 
services between urban and rural veterans. The conferees have 
included a provision in the bill prohibiting funds from being 
used to expand the Urban Initiative beyond the sites already 
outlined in the budget until the NCA submits to the Committees 
a detailed strategy to meet the burial needs of veterans 
residing in rural and highly rural areas. The report shall 
include a timeline for implementation of such a strategy and 
cost estimates of establishing new burial sites in at least 
five rural or highly rural locations. This report shall be 
submitted no later than February 6, 2012.
      In the short term, because the Secretary has the 
authority to waive Department guidance establishing a 
population threshold for creating national cemeteries, the 
conferees urge the Secretary to use this waiver authority to 
address the pressing needs for access to VA cemeteries in some 
rural areas.

                      DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION

                         GENERAL ADMINISTRATION

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement appropriates $416,737,000 for 
General Administration, instead of $400,500,000 as proposed by 
the House and $431,257,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of the 
amount provided, $20,837,000 is available for obligation until 
September 30, 2013, instead of $22,144,000 as proposed by the 
House and $21,562,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference 
agreement includes bill language permitting the transfer of 
funds from this account to ``General Operating Expenses, 
Veterans Benefits Administration'', as proposed by both the 
House and Senate. Bill language is not included to identify 
specific resources to improve acquisition workforce capacity. 
The House and Senate had included such language, but with 
different funding amounts.
      The Administration's budget request proposed that funding 
for administrative expenses associated with executive offices 
be included in a single account with the general operating 
expenses of the Veterans Benefits Administration. The 
conference agreement includes funding for these two distinct 
functions in two separate accounts: General operating expenses, 
Veterans Benefits Administration; and General administration, 
as proposed by both the House and Senate. The conferees believe 
that differences in the mission and purpose of the Department's 
executive offices and the Veterans Benefits Administration 
justify providing funding in two separate accounts. Further, 
separating these two broad categories will provide the Congress 
with greater visibility of budgetary resources and oversight of 
expenditures for these two vital missions.
      The conference agreement includes the following funding 
levels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The total for the Office of the General Counsel includes 
$1,889,000 for staffing to speed the appeals process and 
regulation promulgation, as requested by the Administration and 
proposed by the Senate. The House had no similar provision.
      Within the total for the Office of Management, the 
conference agreement provides $1,600,000 to conduct audits of 
the Veterans Health Administration Fee Care program, as 
requested by the Administration and proposed by the Senate. The 
House did not include a similar provision. The conferees concur 
in the Fee Care report requirement proposed by the Senate and 
expect the report to be submitted within 90 days of enactment 
of this Act.
      The conferees provide $1,900,000 within the Office of 
Operations, Security and Preparedness to implement the Homeland 
Security Presidential Directive 12 mandate. The Senate provided 
$2,900,000 for this activity, as proposed in the Administration 
request; the House did not provide specific funding. The 
agreement also provides $705,000 to activate the Integrated 
Operations Center and the Capital Region Readiness Center, as 
requested by the Administration and proposed by the Senate. The 
House did not include a similar provision.
      The conference agreement provides $1,150,000 within the 
Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs for the tribal 
government outreach and new media offices, as requested by the 
Administration and proposed by the Senate. The House did not 
include similar provisions.
      The conference agreement provides $5,000,000 within the 
Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction for the 2012 
President's acquisition initiative and the facilities 
management transformation. The House provided $20,000,000 for 
these activities; the Senate provided $17,000,000.
      The conferees require the VA to include in budget 
justification documents each year a detailed summary of the 
marketing campaign budget, as proposed in the House report. The 
Senate report did not include a similar requirement.
      The conferees concur in the Senate report directive 
requiring a report on adopting payment recapture audits, with 
the report to be submitted within 90 days of enactment of this 
Act.

      GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES, VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION

      The conference agreement appropriates $2,018,764,000 for 
General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration, 
as proposed by the Senate instead of $2,020,128,000, as 
proposed by the House. The agreement makes available not to 
exceed $105,000,000 of this funding until the end of fiscal 
year 2013, as proposed by the Senate, instead of $105,856,000 
as proposed by the House. The conferees concur with Senate 
report language regarding Decision Review Officers.

                     INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

      The conference agreement appropriates $3,111,376,000 for 
Information Technology (IT) Systems instead of $3,025,000,000 
as proposed by the House and $3,161,376,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The agreement follows the Senate format of identifying 
separately in bill language the funding available for pay 
($915,000,000); operations and maintenance ($1,616,018,000); 
and systems development, modernization, and enhancement 
($580,358,000). The Senate bill provided $915,000,000 for pay; 
$1,709,953,000 for operations and maintenance; and $536,423,000 
for development. The House provided all IT funding in one lump 
sum. The agreement also adopts the Senate proposal of making 
$25,000,000 of pay funding available until the end of fiscal 
year 2013; $110,000,000 of operations and maintenance funding 
available until the end of fiscal year 2013; and all IT systems 
development, modernization and enhancement funding available 
until the end of fiscal year 2013. The House proposed to make 
the entire IT appropriation available until the end of fiscal 
year 2013.
      On May 2, 2011, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the 
Secretary of Defense entered into an agreement to implement an 
integrated electronic health record (iEHR) system rather than 
pursue separate strategies for modernizing the two existing 
health record systems. The conferees are encouraged by this 
agreement and believe that successful development and 
implementation is crucial for both Departments to continue to 
provide high-quality medical care in the 21st century and to 
enhance seamless transition from active duty to the VA.
      The conferees strongly encourage the Secretaries of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense to 
continue to work together throughout the development of this 
new system to ensure an unambiguous and unified message is 
clearly articulated to both Departments. It is imperative the 
new iEHR system be agreed to and driven by senior leadership at 
both Departments to ensure system development is on time and 
within budget.
      Given that the two Departments entered into this 
agreement after the Administration had transmitted the fiscal 
year 2012 budget request to Congress, the VA has had to alter 
its original Information Technology budget submission to 
account for iEHR. According to the VA, the requirement for iEHR 
in fiscal year 2012 is $100,000,000, which includes $73,200,000 
in development funds. The conference agreement fully funds this 
request and includes an updated development chart displaying 
the iEHR development requirement.
      The conferees direct the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
in conjunction with the Department of Defense, to identify the 
timeframe for completion of an integrated electronic health 
record system and develop detailed benchmarks to track 
progress. Additionally, the conferees direct the Office of 
Information Technology to provide quarterly updates on the 
progress of this project to the Committees on Appropriations of 
both Houses of Congress.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed in 
both the House and Senate bills requiring that no IT funding 
may be obligated until the VA submits to the Committees, and 
the Committees approve, an expenditure plan meeting the four 
criteria outlined. The conferees are disturbed that the VA has 
not complied with this language in previous years and expect 
prompt compliance in fiscal year 2012.
      The conference agreement includes bill language proposed 
by the Senate but not the House prohibiting the obligation of 
IT development, modernization, and enhancement funding until 
the VA submits a certification of the amounts to be obligated, 
in part or in full, for each development project.
      The conference agreement includes bill language proposed 
by the Senate but not the House permitting funding made 
available for the three IT subaccounts to be transferred among 
them after the VA requests and receives approval from the 
Committees.
      The conferees include bill language making funds 
available for IT development, modernization, and enhancement 
for the projects and in the amounts specified in the following 
table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As proposed in the Senate bill, the conferees intend this 
table to serve as the Department's approved list of development 
projects; any requested changes are subject to reprogramming 
guidelines. The agreement does not include the House proposed 
bill language requiring the VA to submit to the Committees a 
reprogramming base letter by project within 30 days of 
enactment of this Act.
      The conference agreement directs the Department to submit 
an expenditure plan to the Committees within 30 days of 
enactment of this Act as proposed by both the House and the 
Senate. This plan should be in the same format as the table 
above. The conferees also expect all future IT budget displays 
provided to the Committees to use this format.
      The conferees concur in the Senate report language 
concerning metrics for evaluating the Veterans Benefits 
Management System pilot.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      The conference agreement appropriates $112,391,000 for 
the Office of Inspector General as proposed by the Senate 
instead of $109,391,000 as proposed by the House. Of the amount 
provided, $6,000,000 is available for obligation until 
September 30, 2013, as proposed by the House instead of 
$6,600,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                      CONSTRUCTION, MAJOR PROJECTS

      The conference agreement appropriates $589,604,000 for 
Construction, Major Projects as proposed by both the House and 
the Senate.
      The agreement makes this funding available until 
expended, as proposed by the Senate, rather than with a 
limitation of five years as proposed by the House. The 
conferees are concerned about the very large unobligated 
balances that have built up in the major construction account 
and believe that the account's ``no year'' funding framework 
must be changed. In contrast, military construction funds 
provided in this bill are made available on a five-year basis. 
The Department of Defense (DOD) is able to manage these funds 
and construct its buildings in a timely way. The conferees 
understand that the VA will need to make process changes in 
planning, budgeting, and execution to make the DOD five-year 
obligation approach viable. The conferees direct the VA to 
develop a plan to transition to five-year availability of funds 
for both major and minor construction and deliver the plan to 
the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act. The 
plan should identify any legislative language needed to make 
the plan workable. The conferees' goal is to implement this 
plan when finalizing the fiscal year 2013 budget in the fall of 
2012.
      The conference agreement funds the following items as 
requested in the budget submission and as proposed by both the 
House and Senate:

Major construction total................................     589,604,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The conferees direct the VA to submit a master plan at 
the time of the budget submission describing each major 
construction project included in the budget. The plan should 
include the projected time line for completion of each 
component of each of the projects and the annual and total cost 
of each project. The format of the DOD Form 1391 is a good 
model for the VA to use to describe clearly and completely the 
expected obligations for each project.
      The conferees encourage the VA to examine its practices 
on rehabilitation and re-use of national landmarks within the 
VA infrastructure that are aging, outdated, or obsolete and 
report to the Committees on any actions taken or planned to be 
taken on these facilities.

                      CONSTRUCTION, MINOR PROJECTS

      The conference agreement appropriates $482,386,000 for 
Construction, Minor Projects, instead of $475,091,000 as 
proposed by the House and $550,091,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The agreement makes this funding available until 
expended, as proposed by the Senate, rather than with a 
limitation of five years as proposed by the House. As indicated 
in the narrative for Construction, Major Projects, the VA is 
directed to develop a plan to transition to five-year 
availability of funds for both major and minor construction and 
deliver the plan to the Committees within 180 days of enactment 
of this Act.
      As proposed by the Senate, the conferees direct the 
Department to provide to the Committees an expenditure plan for 
this account within 30 days of enactment of this Act. The House 
did not propose a similar requirement.
      The conferees expect the fiscal year 2013 budget 
submission to include a separate list of all minor construction 
projects proposed to be funded in fiscal year 2013 in priority 
order, consistent with the integrated Strategic Capital 
Investment Plan.

       GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE EXTENDED CARE FACILITIES

      The conference agreement appropriates $85,000,000 for 
Grants for Construction of State Extended Care Facilities, as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

             GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF VETERANS CEMETERIES

      The conference agreement appropriates $46,000,000 for 
Grants for Construction of Veterans Cemeteries, as proposed by 
both the House and the Senate.

by both the House and the Senate allowing for the use of

      The conference agreement includes section 215 as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate allowing for funds deposited 
into the Medical Care Collections Fund to be transferred to the

      The conference agreement includes section 216 as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate which allows Alaskan veterans 
to use medical facilities of the Indian Health Service or 
tribal organizations.
      The conference agreement includes section 217 as proposed 
by the Senate providing for the transfer of funds from the

House proposed that these funds be made available for five

      The conference agreement includes section 222 as proposed

      The conference agreement includes section 223 as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate limiting the obligation of 
non-recurring maintenance funds during the last two months of 
the fiscal year.
      The conference agreement includes section 224 as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate providing up to $241,666,000 
for transfer to the joint DoD-VA Medical Facility Demonstration

      The conference agreement includes section 225 as proposed

      The conference agreement includes section 227 which is

by both the House and the Senate which prohibits the VA from 
increasing the scope of work for a major construction project 
above the scope specified in the original budget request.
      The conference agreement includes section 230 which is 
similar to a provision proposed by the House regarding VA 
provision of information about controlled substance 
prescriptions to State controlled substance monitoring 
programs. The Senate bill did not contain a similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include section 230 as 
proposed by the Senate, requiring the Secretary, in 
coordination with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
(DARPA), to submit a report on the next generation of advanced 
prosthetics. This issue is addressed under the Medical and 
Prosthetic Research account.
      The conference agreement includes section 231 requiring 
the Secretary to report to the Committees each quarter about 
any single national outreach and awareness marketing campaign 
exceeding $2,000,000. The House bill contained similar 
language. The Senate did not have a comparable provision.
      The conference agreement includes, as VA administrative 
provision section 232, a general provision proposed by the 
House prohibiting the VA from using any funds to declare as 
excess to the needs of the VA Federal land and improvements to 
the St. Albans campus in New York. The Senate bill did not 
include a similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes, as VA administrative 
provision section 233, a general provision proposed by the 
House prohibiting the use of funds in the Act for any contract 
using procedures that do not give to small business concerns 
owned and controlled by veterans any preference with respect to 
such contract, except for a preference given to small business 
concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. The 
Senate bill did not include a similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes section 234 extending 
the authorization for the VA office in the Philippines through 
December 31, 2012. Neither the House nor the Senate bill 
contained a comparable provision.

      Information Technology.--The conferees recognize the 
significant management and oversight improvements that have 
been made at Arlington National Cemetery over the past year, 
particularly efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of 
burial and headstone records. The conferees also realize that 
the development of a robust information technology system is 
essential to this effort. To ensure that information technology 
development remains on track, the Executive Director of the 
Cemetery is directed to provide a report to Congress detailing 
the strategic plan and timetable for completing the 
modernization of the Cemetery's information technology system, 
including electronic burial records. The report should also 
include a description of improvements implemented to date, and 
identify any remaining information technology and systems 
infrastructure requirements. The report should be submitted to 
the following Committees of both Houses of Congress no later 
than 90 days after enactment of this Act: The Committees on 
Appropriations, Armed Services, Veterans Affairs, and the 
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

The conferees agree that the projects transferred to title IV 
are necessary to support the global war on terrorism and should 
be designated as overseas contingency operations functions.

                      MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY

      The conference agreement appropriates $80,000,000 for 
Military Construction, Army in this title instead of title I of

   DIVISION I--DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED 
                   PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2012

      In implementing this conference agreement, the 
departments and agencies shall comply with the Senate report 
(S. Rept. 112-85) accompanying S. 1601 as though stated in this 
joint explanatory statement unless specifically directed to the 
contrary. Matters addressed in the report of the House 
Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
(Full Committee Print, circulated on July 29, 2011) are 
restated in this joint explanatory statement where the 
conferees concur.

                                TITLE I

                 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCY

                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE

                   Administration of Foreign Affairs

                    DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides $6,550,947,000 for 
Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP), of which up to 
$1,355,000,000 is for Worldwide Security Protection. The 
conference agreement provides an additional $4,389,064,000 in 
title VIII under this heading, which is designated for Overseas 
Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) 
pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985.
      Within the total provided under this heading, the 
conference agreement includes:
      $2,277,862,000 for Human Resources (of which $121,814,000 
is for public diplomacy);
      $2,109,293,000 for Overseas Programs (of which 
$347,572,000 is for public diplomacy);
      $822,513,000 for Diplomatic Policy and Support; and
      $1,341,279,000 for security programs.
      The conference agreement does not include funding for the 
185 new positions requested in fiscal year 2012. The conference 
agreement assumes continuation of the pay freeze in fiscal year 
2012 for all Department of State employees, including Foreign 
Service Officers.
      The conference agreement includes language amending the 
heading ``Civilian Stabilization Initiative'' included in prior 
acts to ``Conflict Stabilization Operations'' (CSO) and 
provides transfer authority of up to $35,000,000 of the funds 
appropriated under this heading to funds made available under 
the CSO heading. The conference agreement provides an 
additional $8,500,000 in title VIII under the CSO heading, 
which is designated for OCO/GWOT pursuant to the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The conferees 
remain concerned with CSO's limited activities, specifically 
the minor role it has played in response to the earthquake in 
Haiti and the revolution in Libya. The conferees will further 
assess the performance of the CSO during fiscal year 2012.
      The conferees request the Secretary of State to be 
prepared to report to the Committees on Appropriations in 
hearings on the fiscal year 2013 budget on the use of the 
Secretary's authority to determine whether an American citizen 
has voluntarily renounced United States citizenship as a result 
of engaging in activities with a Foreign Terrorist 
Organization.
      The conferees recognize that B-1 and B-2 visitor visa 
applications in some countries, such as the People's Republic 
of China (PRC) and Brazil, are significantly and rapidly 
increasing. The number of visa applications increased 53 
percent in Brazil and 64 percent in the PRC from fiscal year 
2010 to fiscal year 2011, resulting in increased delays in 
interviewing applicants and longer approval times. The 
Department of State is taking steps to reduce the wait time but 
more needs to be done. Section 7076 of this Act directs the 
Secretary of State to take steps to reduce delays in processing 
tourist visas in the PRC, Brazil, and India, and to consider 
extending the expiration period for B-1 and B-2 visas for 
applicants before requiring a consular officer interview. The 
conferees recognize that wait times for interviews can 
fluctuate due to unforeseen circumstances, including assisting 
United States citizens abroad during an emergency, but expect 
the Department to continue to implement steps to minimize wait 
times. The conferees expect the Secretary of State to determine 
the appropriate extension beyond the current one-year limit in 
a manner consistent with security controls. The conference 
agreement also permits the Secretary to conduct a pilot program 
for processing tourist visas via secure remote 
videoconferencing technology if doing so would not pose a 
security risk.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to report to 
the Committees on Appropriations, not later than 90 days after 
enactment of this Act, on steps taken to reduce visa processing 
wait times; the Department of State's 5-year forecast of non-
immigrant visas for each country; the number of consular 
officers necessary to meet the Department's standards; a 
comparison of the Department's forecast with the Department of 
Commerce's 5-year visitor arrival projections; and the impact 
of the different projections on visa processing times and the 
required number of consular officers.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to provide to 
the Committees on Appropriations, not later than 90 days after 
the end of any videoconference pilot program, an assessment of 
the efficacy, efficiency, and security of this technology for 
conducting visa interviews.
      The conferees endorse Senate report language regarding 
the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, and recommend $1,000,000, in 
addition to funds otherwise made available for such purposes, 
for operations and programs under the Coordinator's authority. 
The conferees recommend that the fiscal year 2013 congressional 
budget justification materials include a request for program 
funds under the Coordinator's authority in the accounts 
included in title III of this Act.
      The conferees urge the Department of State to examine 
alternative approaches to furnishing residences for Foreign 
Service Officers posted overseas, including consideration of 
options for substantially reducing costs and delivery times and 
increasing available choices.
      The conferees are concerned with the unnecessary idling 
of parked motor vehicles that is wasteful and harms the 
environment. The conferees direct that, not later than 90 days 
after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the head of each United States Government 
agency that uses funds appropriated by this Act to purchase or 
lease motor vehicles, shall establish a policy to eliminate the 
unnecessary idling of parked motor vehicles and provide a copy 
of such policy to the Committees on Appropriations. Such policy 
may include exceptions to accommodate important security, 
health, or safety concerns, and if necessary to perform an 
important job function, ensure safe operating conditions, or to 
operate a motor vehicle in accordance with manufacturer 
specifications.
      The conferees support the Secretary of State's expanded 
engagement with governments to improve the inter-country 
adoption process, to finalize implementation agreements with 
such governments, where appropriate, and to resolve impediments 
to the completion of adoptions for waiting families and 
children.
      The conferees encourage the Secretary of State to 
continue to support the United States-Colombia Action Plan on 
Racial and Ethnic Equality and the United States-Brazil Joint 
Action Plan on Racial and Ethnic Equality.
      The conference agreement includes new language 
prohibiting the use of funds under this heading for the 
preservation of religious sites unless the Secretary of State 
determines and reports to the Committees on Appropriations 
that: (1) The site is historically, artistically, or culturally 
significant; (2) the purpose of the project is neither to 
advance nor to inhibit the free exercise of religion; and (3) 
the project is in the national interest of the United States.
      The conferees direct that a portion of the funds that 
have been provided to the Bureau of International Organizations 
Affairs and Office of International Conferences should be used 
to support the Group of 8 (G-8) and NATO summits during 2012.
      The conference agreement includes language requiring the 
continuation of the pilot Partner Vetting System (PVS), and 
requires that such pilot be implemented by September 30, 2012. 
The conferees direct that such PVS pilot continue to be applied 
equally to the programs and activities of the Department of 
State and USAID, as required by section 7034 of Public Law 111-
117.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to provide to 
the Committees on Appropriations, not later than 90 days after 
enactment of this Act, the following information on the 
Acquisitions Management program funded by the 1 percent 
procurement fee: (1) the Working Capital Fund (WCF) including 
carry-over balances, by line item, service center and program, 
currently available for the Acquisitions Management program; 
(2) the actual expenditures in fiscal year 2011 by line item, 
service center and program; (3) the number of staff, including 
employees and contractors funded by the 1 percent procurement 
fee; and (4) an evaluation of the efficiencies and improvements 
gained through this program. The Secretary is also directed to 
include: (1) the funds from the 1 percent procurement fee in 
the WCF in the Department's operating plans and quarterly 
unobligated balances report; and (2) a WCF section in the 
Department's fiscal year 2013 congressional budget 
justification, providing information on total budgetary 
resources for the Bureau of Administration and any other office 
that receives WCF funds and a WCF table by line item, service 
center and program that shall serve as the control level for 
reprogramming and transfer purposes.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to continue 
to assist American victims of terrorism abroad regarding frozen 
assets for compensation and other issues, including from the 
bombings of United States facilities in Kenya and Tanzania and 
terrorist acts sponsored by former Libyan leader Muammar 
Qaddafi.
      The conferees endorse Senate report language regarding 
funding for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor to 
monitor United States assistance to foreign security forces 
pursuant to section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 
as amended by this Act.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to continue 
the reporting requirement detailed under this heading in the 
joint statement accompanying the Department of State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2010 
(division F of Public Law 111-117) concerning agreements for 
transfer and release of detainees at Naval Station, Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba.
      Section 7078 of this Act requires the Secretary of State 
to submit an operating plan for funds appropriated in title I. 
The conferees expect the operating plan to integrate the 
additional funds appropriated in title VIII for OCO/GWOT, where 
appropriate, and the OCO/GWOT amounts should be separately 
identified in the integrated plan.

                        CAPITAL INVESTMENT FUND

      The conference agreement provides $59,380,000 for the 
Capital Investment Fund. In addition, the conference agreement 
permits the transfer of up to $6,000,000 from funds 
appropriated under the heading Diplomatic and Consular Programs 
to funds available under this heading.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      The conference agreement provides $61,904,000 for the 
Office of Inspector General (OIG), and an additional 
$67,182,000 in title VIII under this heading is designated for 
OCO/GWOT pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
Control Act of 1985.
      The conferees direct the Inspectors General of the 
Department of State and the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID), the Special Inspector 
General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), and the Special 
Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) to coordinate 
audit plans and activities to minimize unnecessary duplication, 
ensure comprehensive oversight plans, and maximize the 
effective use of resources. The conferees direct the OIG to 
continue to plan for increased responsibilities when SIGIR 
draws down its oversight operations.
      Section 7078 of the conference agreement requires the 
relevant department, agency, or organization to submit to the 
Committees on Appropriations a spend plan for funds 
appropriated in titles I and II of this Act. The conferees 
expect each inspector general funded under this heading in

Control Act of 1985.
      No funds are provided for the one-time competitive grants 
program in fiscal year 2012.
      Section 7078 of this Act includes a requirement that the 
Secretary of State submit to the Committees on Appropriations 
an operating plan for funds appropriated under this heading. 
The conferees expect such plan will include the distribution of 
unobligated balances and recoveries, as well as any transfers 
to this account from other accounts. The operating plan should 
integrate the funds appropriated under this heading in title 
VIII of this Act for OCO/GWOT, and the OCO/GWOT amounts should 
be separately identified in the integrated plan.
      Funds in this account are allocated, unless otherwise 
noted, according to the following table, and are subject to the 
provisions of section 7019 of this Act:

Internet circumvention program and direct the BBG to submit a

                  Funds Appropriated to the President

                           OPERATING EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

      The conference agreement provides $1,092,300,000 for 
USAID Operating Expenses, and an additional $255,000,000 in 
title VIII under this heading is designated for OCO/GWOT 
pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985.
      The conference agreement extends the period of 
availability of funds under this heading from one to two years, 
and no longer extends the authorities of section 7011 for funds 
made available under this heading.
      The conference agreement does not provide funding for 
additional Development Leadership Initiative positions in 
fiscal year 2012.
      The conferees recognize the importance of USAID's 
procurement reform efforts to enable USAID to become a more 
accessible, transparent, effective, and efficient agency, and 
the conference agreement includes several provisions intended 
to support these efforts as well as to build the capacity of 
local partners. The conference agreement includes section 7077 
regarding authority for a local competition pilot project, 
provides $22,000,000 for the Acquisition Workforce Initiative 
and the Implementation and Procurement Reform Initiative, and 
$3,000,000 for upgrades to the procurement IT system. The 
conferees intend that these funds will be used for USAID's 
procurement reform efforts in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. In 
addition, the conference agreement includes adequate funds for 
fiscal year 2012 staffing and operations costs for the Office 
of Acquisition and Assistance and for operations and 
maintenance of the procurement IT system. The conference 
agreement does not include a requested provision authorizing a 
new USAID Working Capital Fund. The conferees will revisit the 
justification for such a fund in fiscal year 2013. The 
conferees direct the USAID Administrator to provide to the 
Committees on Appropriations not later than May 1, 2012, an 
assessment of the efficiencies and improvements achieved as a 
result of USAID's procurement reform efforts.
      The conferees direct the USAID Administrator to provide a 
report on staff hired by USAID, not later than 60 days after 
enactment of this Act, which details the number of people 
employed by: employment category (direct hire, personal service 
contractor, Participating Agency Service Agreement, and similar 
categories); veteran status of direct hires; headquarters 
office or overseas post; and the appropriation account used to 
fund employees. The report shall also include the specific 
legislative authorities used to hire the employees as 
applicable, and if hired by another Federal agency, the 
additional administrative expenses charged by that agency. The 
conferees direct that this employment report reflect data as of 
the end of fiscal year 2011.
      As in past years, USAID is directed to notify the 
Committees on Appropriations 15 days prior to any procurement 
action that involves awarding a sole source contract in excess 
of $15,000,000; awarding a non-competitive grant or contract 
(other than sole source) in an amount greater than $75,000,000; 
raising the ceiling on an existing Indefinite Quantity Contract 
(IQC) by an amount greater than $35,000,000; issuing a new IQC 
in excess of $75,000,000; awarding an umbrella grant in excess 
of $25,000,000; or raising the ceiling on an existing umbrella 
grant in excess of $25,000,000. This requirement does not apply 
to assistance in critical priority countries and assistance for 
humanitarian response or post-conflict situations.
      The conferees direct the USAID Administrator to include 
in the fiscal year 2013 congressional budget justification an 
estimate of savings resulting from closing missions by each 
mission for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. The conferees 
support USAID's plan to close three missions during fiscal year 
2012.
      The conference agreement includes changes in section 7015 
on notification requirements for certain reorganization 
actions, and the conferees direct the USAID Administrator to 
consult with the Committees on Appropriations prior to 
initiating such actions. For the purposes of this requirement, 
such reorganizations are limited to those resulting in a 
significant shift in responsibility of the operating unit or in 
staffing and funds. The conferees do not expect to be consulted 
or notified for staffing reorganizations resulting in little or 
no change in responsibility of the operating unit, staffing or 
funds.
      The conferees direct the USAID Administrator to submit a 
report to the Committees on Appropriations, not later than 180 
days after enactment of this Act, on the implementation of its 
branding policy. The report should include an analysis of the 
public diplomacy impact of the current branding policy on a 
regional basis and the justification for the use of waivers to 
the policy.
      The conferees intend that funds appropriated under this 
heading be made available to develop and implement training for 
staff in overseas missions to promote the full inclusion and 
equal participation of people with disabilities. The conferees 
direct the USAID Administrator to seek to ensure that, where 
practicable, construction projects funded by this Act are 
accessible to people with disabilities and in compliance with 
USAID Policy on Standards for Accessibility for the Disabled, 
or other similar accessibility standards.
      Funds in this account are allocated, unless otherwise 
noted, according to the following table, and are subject to the

Mexico, and credible reports of a pattern of abuses by Mexican 
police. The conferees are also concerned with ongoing gender-
based crimes in Mexico, and encourage the Department of State 
to provide forensic equipment and training to Mexican states 
and localities that have the highest rate of homicide and other 
violent crime to ensure local law enforcement agencies have 
tools to solve and prosecute these cases. Additionally, the 
conferees direct the Secretary of State to provide a report, 
not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, on how 
programs funded under this heading are achieving judicial and 
law enforcement reforms in Mexico. The report should include 
objectives to be met, benchmarks for measuring progress, 
intended results, and the extent to which such programs are 
coordinated with the federal and state governments in Mexico.
      The conferees support continued assistance to strengthen 
civilian law enforcement and judicial institutions to reduce 
violent crime and narcotics trafficking in Mexico and Honduras. 
The conference agreement includes sections 7045(d) and 7045(e) 
that require the withholding of a portion of the assistance for 
military and police forces in these countries until the 
Secretary of State makes certain findings and submits them in a 
report to the Committees on Appropriations.
      The conferees direct the Department of State to ensure

implement a coordinated border security strategy.

programs and direct the Secretary of State to provide 
assistance at levels consistent with prior fiscal years.
      The conferees request that the country-by-country report 
required under this heading integrate the additional funds 
appropriated under this heading in title VIII for OCO/GWOT 
where appropriate, and the OCO/GWOT amounts should be 
separately identified in the integrated report.

    NONPROLIFERATION, ANTI-TERRORISM, DEMINING AND RELATED PROGRAMS

      The conference agreement provides $590,113,000 for 
Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related Programs 
(NADR), and an additional $120,657,000 in title VIII under this 
heading is designated for OCO/GWOT pursuant to the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

and the OCO/GWOT amounts should be separately identified in the 
integrated plan.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to notify the 
Committees on Appropriations in writing, within 5 days of 
exercising authority allowing funds made available under this 
heading to be spent ``notwithstanding any other provision of

such activities.

budget request, but includes funding for these programs within

of small arms/light weapons, and support the Department of 
State's efforts to expand this work.
      The conference agreement prioritizes the clearance of 
unexploded ordnance (UXO) in areas where such ordnance was 
caused by the United States. The conferees endorse Senate 
report language directing that $9,000,000 be made available for 
UXO clearance in Laos, and intend that funds also be 
prioritized for UXO clearance in locations in the Oceania 
region that have high concentrations of United States UXO 
dating to World War II.

threats, is implementing a reform strategy that has broad 
support within Guatemalan society, is respecting human rights,

performance of such forces and of factors that limit the 
operational capabilities of such forces. The conferees note 
that section 7041 limits the purposes for which funds may be

from the extraction or production of fossil fuels or the use of 
fossil fuels in electricity generation that exceed the average 
of the total emissions in the preceding three fiscal years 
resulting from the use of these authorities unless, not less 
than 15 days prior to each such use of such authorities in

emissions exceeding this amount and indicating the amount of 
the increase, and posts such report on the Bank's Web site.
      The conference agreement directs that not less than 10 
percent of the Bank's authority for aggregate loan, guarantee, 
and insurance should be used for renewable energy and end-use 
energy efficiency technologies. The conferees direct the Bank 
to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations, not 
later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, that includes: 
all financing for renewable energy and end-use energy 
efficiency technologies, or other environmentally beneficial 
exports carried out in fiscal year 2011; efforts made by the 
Bank to promote and support such exports; information on which 
regions and sectors exhibit the greatest potential for such

prior consultation on local currency guarantees and financing 
for nongovernmental organizations and private and voluntary 
organizations, as stated in House Report 111-187 accompanying 
H.R. 3081.
      The conferees direct the President of OPIC to include in 
its fiscal year 2013 congressional budget justification a 
confidential annex that describes new loans, guarantees, and 
insurance approved in fiscal year 2011 by category, recipient,

Sec. 7002.  Unobligated Balances Report (Modified)
      Section 7002 of the conference agreement requires any 
department or agency funded by this Act to provide a quarterly 
report on unobligated and unexpended balances to the Committees 
on Appropriations. The conferees expect the report to specify, 
where feasible, funds obligated pursuant to bilateral 
agreements which have not been further sub-obligated. The 
conferees note that current reports from USAID designate 
expired and unexpired funds by account and fiscal year, and 
expect the Department of State to continue to work on modifying 
their financial systems to enable them to submit a report in a 
similar format. The conferees also direct the Department of 
State and USAID to provide periodic briefings on the 
information in this report, including on the status of sub-
obligations related to bilateral agreements.
Sec. 7004.  Embassy Construction (Modified)
      The conference agreement includes authorization within 
section 7004 for the Maintenance Cost Sharing initiative to 
utilize funding from the Capital Security Cost Sharing (CSCS) 
program for the maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation of new 
facilities with an inter-agency presence.
Sec. 7006.  Local Guard Contracts (Modified)
Sec. 7008.  Coups d'Etat (Modified)
      The conferees intend that the modifications to this 
provision shall apply to prospective coups d'etat and shall not 
apply to retrospective assessments.

Sec. 7009.  Transfer Authority (Modified)
Sec. 7011.  Availability of Funds (Modified)
Sec. 7013.  Prohibition on Taxation of United States Assistance 
        (Modified)
Sec. 7015.  Notification Requirements (Modified)
Sec. 7019.  Allocations (Modified)

Sec. 7021.  Prohibition on Assistance to Governments Supporting 
        International Terrorism (Modified)
      Section 7021 of the conference agreement combines 
sections 7021 and 7022 in division F of Public Law 111-117 
relating to prohibitions on the export of lethal military 
equipment and on providing bilateral assistance to countries 
supporting international terrorism. Additionally, section 7021 
prohibits bilateral assistance to any foreign government 
controlled by a designated terrorist organization.
Sec. 7024.  Authorities for the Peace Corps, Inter-American Foundation 
        and African Development Foundation (Modified)
Sec. 7025.  Commerce, Trade and Surplus Commodities
      The conference agreement includes language expanding 
exceptions to the application of subsection (b). When relying 
on this expanded exception, the USAID Administrator should, in 
order to maximize program effectiveness, consult with relevant 
agriculture industry representatives regarding the same, 
similar, or substitute commodities and products.
Sec. 7029.  International Financial Institutions (Modified)
Sec. 7031.  Financial Management and Budget Transparency (Modified)
      For the purposes of this section the term ``direct 
government-to-government assistance'' shall include cash 
transfers, nonproject sector assistance, and other forms of 
assistance where funds appropriated by this Act are provided 
directly to the recipient government.
      Section 7031(c) includes language related to anti-
kleptocracy. The conferees note that this provision revises 
current law (section 7084 of division F of Public Law 111-117) 
and includes a national interest waiver. The conferees note 
that ineligibility for entry into the United States under this 
provision is not dependent on a decision or other action by any 
Federal agency other than the Department of State.
Sec. 7033.  Multi-Year Commitments (New)
      The conferees understand that the Secretary of the 
Treasury does not intend to increase the quota resources of the 
IMF in fiscal year 2012. If the Secretary does intend to commit 
the United States to additional contributions to the IMF, the 
conference agreement includes a provision that would, at a 
minimum, require consultation with the Committees on 
Appropriations not less than 7 days before such pledge is made.
Sec. 7034.  Special Provisions (Modified)
      Section 7034(h)(5) states that funds appropriated by this 
Act that are made available to promote democracy and human 
rights shall also be made available to support freedom of 
religion, especially in the Middle East and North Africa.
      Section 7034(k) redesignates section 620J of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961 to section 620M, and modifies it by 
substituting ``credible information'' for ``credible evidence'' 
in order to clarify that the information need not be admissible 
in a court of law to be credible and to conform to similar 
wording in a comparable provision in the Defense Appropriations 
Act, and by adding guidelines for: tracking United States 
assistance to foreign security forces; the collection, receipt, 
evaluation, and preservation of information about gross 
violations of human rights; vetting both individuals and units; 
and, to the maximum extent practicable, publicly identifying 
units for which no assistance shall be furnished pursuant to 
section 620M.
Sec. 7040.  Limitation on Assistance for the Palestinian Authority 
        (Modified subsection (f))
Sec. 7041.  Near East (Modified)
      Section 7041(a)(1) of this Act provides limitations on 
assistance for Egypt, and includes authorities for an Egypt 
debt initiative.
      Section 7041(a)(3) provides authority and conditions for 
an Egypt initiative. The conferees make available up to 
$500,000,000 of the funds appropriated under the Economic 
Support Fund heading in this Act and prior acts for such 
purposes. However, the conferees note that all funds are 
subject to the regular notification procedures of the 
Committees on Appropriations and expect that funds will be 
provided in tranches, at the minimum rate necessary, and in a 
manner consistent with the advancement of United States-
Egyptian strategic interests. The conferees note that this 
initiative demonstrates United States support for Egypt's 
democratic transition and economic development, and should 
serve as an incentive to the Government of Egypt (GOE) to 
pursue policies of mutual interest. The conferees intend that 
prior to the use of the authority under this initiative the 
transition to a civilian government will have substantially 
progressed, and the GOE will implement economic development 
policies consistent with the objectives of such initiative.
      The conferees direct that the notification submitted to 
the Committees on Appropriations include a detailed description 
and estimate of the economic benefits of projects anticipated 
to be undertaken, the role of the GOE in implementing projects, 
an explanation of how such projects contribute to economic and 
democratic reforms in Egypt, and the means by which the uses of 
funds and results achieved will be monitored and measured. The 
conferees intend that the notification may be submitted to 
other congressional committees, as appropriate.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to use prior 
appropriated funds to the maximum extent practicable with 
respect to supporting projects and initiatives in Egypt, and to 
structure the timing and amounts of disbursements of funds for 
activities regarding the Egypt debt initiative. The Secretary 
of State shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations 
and other congressional committees, as appropriate, on the 
planned uses of the funds prior to obligating funds under such 
structured disbursement. The conferees expect the Secretary of 
State to spend down prior appropriated funds in an efficient 
manner, and to keep the Committees on Appropriations informed 
on a regular basis on the balances of such funds.
      Section 7041(b) of this Act includes language authorizing 
the establishment of enterprise funds in Egypt, Tunisia, and 
Jordan. The conferees intend that at the termination of the 
respective funds, 50 percent of the proceeds realized by each 
fund from the liquidation of its assets should be returned to 
the United States Treasury. The conferees request that the 
Comptroller General of the United States conduct a review, one 
year after the establishment of any enterprise fund, to examine 
the management and oversight of the funds and to determine if 
appropriate and sufficient safeguards exist against financial 
misconduct.
      The conference agreement includes language regarding 
democracy promotion in Libya and Syria, and restricts 
infrastructure assistance for Libya.
Sec. 7042.  Serbia (Modified)
Sec. 7043.  Africa (Modified)
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to provide to 
the Committees on Appropriations the report detailed in section 
7061(b)(3) of S. 1601 (112th Congress).
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to ensure 
that no United States training, equipment, or other assistance 
is provided to any Kenyan military personnel or units who have 
been credibly alleged to have violated human rights at Mount 
Elgon in March 2008, and to report to the Committees on 
Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of this Act on steps 
taken by the Government of Kenya to conduct a thorough, 
credible investigation of such violations.
      The conferees endorse language in the Senate report 
regarding the disappearance of journalist Ebrimah Manneh in The 
Gambia.
Sec. 7044.  Asia (Modified)
Sec. 7045.  Western Hemisphere (Modified)
      The conferees direct that of the funds appropriated by 
this Act that are available for assistance for the Colombian 
Armed Forces, 25 percent may be obligated only after the 
Secretary of State consults with, and subsequently certifies 
and submits a written report to, the Committees on 
Appropriations that--
      (1) The Colombian Armed Forces are suspending those 
members, of whatever rank, who have been credibly alleged to 
have violated human rights, or to have aided, abetted or 
benefitted from paramilitary organizations or other illegal 
armed groups; all such cases are promptly referred to civilian 
jurisdiction for investigation and prosecution, and the 
Colombian Armed Forces are not opposing civilian jurisdiction 
in such cases; and the Colombian Armed Forces are cooperating 
fully with civilian prosecutors and judicial authorities.
      (2) The Government of Colombia has taken all necessary 
steps to sever links with paramilitary organizations or other 
illegal armed groups.
      (3) The Government of Colombia is dismantling 
paramilitary networks, including by arresting and prosecuting 
under civilian criminal law individuals who have provided 
financial, planning, or logistical support, or have otherwise 
aided, abetted or benefitted from paramilitary organizations or 
other illegal armed groups, and by returning land and other 
assets illegally acquired by such organizations or their 
associates to their rightful occupants or owners.
      (4) The Government of Colombia is respecting the rights 
of human rights defenders, journalists, trade unionists, and 
other social activists, and the rights and territory of 
indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities; and the Colombian 
Armed Forces are implementing procedures to distinguish between 
civilians, including displaced persons, and combatants, in 
their operations.
      The conferees also direct that not later than 90 days 
after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall 
submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations detailing 
any United States funding, assistance or other support for the 
Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad, its officials, 
employees, affiliates and contractors during the period 2002 
through 2010, including but not limited to training, equipment, 
information sharing, technical assistance, and facilities 
construction. To the maximum extent possible the report shall 
be provided in unclassified form, but may also include a 
classified annex.
Sec. 7046. South Asia (Modified)
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State to submit a 
report to the Committees on Appropriations not later than 45 
days after enactment of this Act, detailing what steps have 
been taken by the Government of Sri Lanka and international 
bodies to thoroughly and credibly investigate war crimes and 
violations of international humanitarian law during the 
internal armed conflict, and evaluating the adequacy of steps 
taken by the Government of Sri Lanka to hold perpetrators 
accountable. The report should also indicate whether suspected 
combatants detained during the conflict remain in custody and 
whether humanitarian organizations have access to such 
detainees.
      The conferees direct that funds available for Afghanistan 
under the ESF and INCLE headings for training of foreign 
police, judicial, and military personnel should address gender-
based violence, where appropriate.
      The conferees direct that, not later than 180 days after 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in consultation 
with the USAID Administrator, submit a report to the Committees 
on Appropriations detailing actions taken by the Government of 
Afghanistan to expand rail transport in Afghanistan since 2009; 
providing an assessment of any national rail transport 
strategy, including the costs associated with implementation of 
such strategy; providing an analysis of the economic benefits 
of expanding and improving rail connections with neighboring 
countries, including in areas with significant resources; and 
making recommendations for the standardization of rail gauge in 
Afghanistan that is compatible with Central Asian countries, 
including Uzbekistan.
Sec. 7049.  United Nations (New)
      Section 7049(a) requires that 15 percent of United States 
contributions to United Nations agencies and the Organization 
of American States shall be withheld from obligation if the 
Secretary of State determines and reports that such agency or 
organization is not taking steps to meet certain conditions. 
The Secretary may waive this requirement if to do so is in the 
national interest. The conferees intend this restriction to 
apply only to such entities that receive annual United States 
contributions exceeding $20,000,000. The conferees further 
intend that for the purposes of this section, ``necessary 
access'' means access necessary for United States Government 
officials to obtain the results of financial and performance 
audits in a timely manner.

Administrator to submit to the Committees on Appropriations, 
not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, a 
multi-year strategy to prevent and respond to violence against 
women and girls in countries where it is common. The strategy 
should include achievable and sustainable goals, benchmarks for

violence.

      This section consolidates directives, related reporting 
requirements and limitations for program funding in sectors 
including education, environment, and food security and 
agriculture development. The conferees expect these funds to be 
awarded competitively and in accordance with all applicable
