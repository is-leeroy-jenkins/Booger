agriculture risk coverage payments under section 1117(b)(1) of the 
Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017(b)(1)), that provides all or 
some of the State Farm Service Agency offices in each State the 
opportunity to provide agricultural producers in the State a 
supplemental payment described in subsection (c) based on the alternate 
calculation method described in subsection (b) for 1 or more counties in 
a State if the office for that State determines that the alternate 
calculation method is necessary to ensure that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, there are not significant yield calculation disparities 
between comparable counties in the State.
    (b) The alternate calculation method referred to in subsection (a) 
is a method of calculating the actual yield for the 2017 crop year for 
county-level agriculture risk coverage payments under section 1117(b)(1) 
of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017(b)(1)), under which--
            (1) county data of the National Agricultural Statistics 
        Service (referred to in this section as ``NASS data'') is used 
        for the calculations;
            (2) if there is insufficient NASS data for a county (as 
        determined under standards of the Secretary in effect as of the 
        date of enactment of this Act) or the available NASS data 
        produces a substantially disparate result, the calculation of 
        the county yield is determined using comparable contiguous 
        county NASS data as determined by the Farm Service Agency office 
        in the applicable State; and
            (3) if there is insufficient NASS data for a comparable 
        contiguous county (as determined under standards of the 
        Secretary in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act), 
        the calculation of the county yield is determined using reliable 
        yield data from other sources, such as Risk Management Agency 
        data, National Agricultural Statistics Service district data, 
        National Agricultural Statistics Service State yield data, or 
        other data as determined by the Farm Service Agency office in 
        the applicable State.

    (c)(1) A supplemental payment made under the pilot program 
established under this section may be made to an agricultural producer 
who is subject to the alternate calculation method described in 
subsection (b) if that agricultural producer would otherwise receive a 
county-level agriculture risk coverage payment for the 2017 crop year in 
an amount that is less than the payment that the agricultural producer 
would receive under the alternate calculation method.
    (2) The amount of a supplemental payment to an agricultural producer 
under this section may not exceed the difference between--
            (A) the payment that the agricultural producer would have 
        received without the alternate calculation method described in 
        subsection (b); and
            (B) the payment that the agricultural producer would receive 
        using the alternate calculation method.

    (d)(1) There is appropriated to the Secretary, out of funds of the 
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000, to remain available 
until September 30, 2019, to carry out the pilot program described in 
this section.

$5,000,000 to carry out the pilot program described in this section.
    (e)(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall select 
States to participate in the pilot program under this section so the 
cost of the pilot program equals the amount provided under subsection 
(d).
    (2) To the extent that the cost of the pilot program exceeds the 
amount made available, the Secretary shall reduce all payments under the 
pilot program on a pro rata basis.
    (f) Nothing in this section affects the calculation of actual yield 
for purposes of county-level agriculture risk coverage payments under 
section 1117(b)(1) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017(b)(1)) 
other than payments made in accordance with the pilot program under this 
section.

satellite locations of schools in the Bureau school system as of

educational programs for non-public schools located within the 
jurisdictional area of the tribal government which exclusively serve 
tribal members, do not include grades beyond those currently served at 
the existing Bureau-funded school, provide an educational environment 
with educator presence and academic facilities comparable to the Bureau-
funded school, comply with all applicable Tribal, Federal, or State 
health and safety standards, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 
and demonstrate the benefits of establishing operations at a satellite 
location in lieu of incurring extraordinary costs, such as for 
transportation or other impacts to students such as those caused by 
busing students extended distances:  Provided, That no funds available

    Sec. 214.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in fiscal

determines, in consultation with the tenants and the local government, 
that such a multifamily property owned or held by the Secretary is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, 
State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 524 
of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 
(``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be remedied in

appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts remain in 
effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual 
abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major 
threats to health and safety after written notice to and informed 
consent of the affected tenants and use of other available remedies, 
such as partial abatements or receivership. After disposition of any 
multifamily property described under this section, the contract and 
allowable rent levels on such properties shall be subject to the 
requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.

any way the use of capital funds for central office costs pursuant to

    Sec. 218.  No official or employee of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development shall be designated as an allotment holder unless the 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer has determined that such allotment

Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured projects with 
assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but do not apply to such units 
assisted under section 8(o)(13) (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public 
housing units assisted with capital or operating funds under section 9 
of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g).
    (c)(1) Within 15 days of the issuance of the REAC inspection, the 
Secretary must provide the owner with a Notice of Default with a

        effectuate; or
            (I) take any other regulatory or contractual remedies 
        available as deemed necessary and appropriate by the Secretary.

    (d) The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that

threats to health and safety after written notice to the affected 
tenants. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation with 
the tenants and the local government, that the property is not feasible 
for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 or other 
programs, based on consideration of--
            (1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property 
        and all available Federal, State, and local resources, including 
        rent adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted 
        Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (``MAHRAA''); and

        assistance.

        conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties and 
        termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have such 
        conditions multiple times;

        Development is taking to protect tenants of such identified 
        properties; and

        further improve the living conditions at properties covered

regulatory fees to recover the costs of carrying out the activities 
described in section 6(a) only to the extent, and in the total amounts, 
provided for in Appropriations Acts.
    ``(b) Establishment of Schedule.--The Commission shall assess and 
collect regulatory fees at such rates as the Commission shall establish 
in a schedule of regulatory fees that will result in the collection, in 
each fiscal year, of an amount that can reasonably be expected to equal 
the amounts described in subsection (a) with respect to such fiscal 
year.
    ``(c) Adjustment of Schedule.--
            ``(1) In general.--For each fiscal year, the Commission 
        shall by rule adjust the schedule of regulatory fees established 
        under this section to--
                    ``(A) reflect unexpected increases or decreases in 
                the number of units subject to the payment of such fees; 
                and
                    ``(B) result in the collection of the amount 
                required by subsection (b).

        subsection, the Commission may round fees to the nearest $5 
        increment.

    ``(d) Amendments to Schedule.--In addition to the adjustments 
required by subsection (c), the Commission shall by rule amend the 
schedule of regulatory fees established under this section if the 
Commission determines that the schedule requires amendment so that such 
fees reflect the full-time equivalent number of employees within the 
bureaus and offices of the Commission, adjusted to take into account 
factors that are reasonably related to the benefits provided to the 
payor of the fee by the Commission's activities. In making an amendment 
under this subsection, the Commission may not change the total amount of 
regulatory fees required by subsection (b) to be collected in a fiscal 
year.
    ``(e) Exceptions.--

        from paying such fee.

    ``(f) Deposit of Collections.--
            ``(1) In general.--Amounts received from fees authorized by

        collected in excess of the total amount of fees provided for in

SEC. 610. BIDIRECTIONAL SHARING STUDY.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, including an opportunity for public comment, the 
Commission, in collaboration with the NTIA, shall--
            (1) conduct a bidirectional sharing study to determine the 
        best means of providing Federal entities flexible access to non-
        Federal spectrum on a shared basis across a range of short-, 
        mid-, and long-range timeframes, including for intermittent 
        purposes like emergency use; and
            (2) submit to Congress a report on the study under paragraph 
        (1), including any recommendations for legislation or proposed 
        regulations.

    (b) Considerations.--In conducting the study under subsection (a), 
the Commission shall--
            (1) consider the regulatory certainty that commercial 
        spectrum users and Federal entities need to make longer-term 
        investment decisions for shared access to be viable; and
            (2) evaluate any barriers to voluntary commercial 
        arrangements in which non-Federal users could provide access to 
        Federal entities.

                                carrier; or
                                    (II) an unaffiliated carrier to 
                                serve a rural area; and
                    (B) if the Commission finds that such a program 
                would promote--
                          (i) the availability of advanced 
                      telecommunications services in rural areas; or
                          (ii) spectrum availability for covered small 
                      carriers.
            (2) Considerations.--In conducting the rulemaking proceeding 
        under paragraph (1), the Commission shall consider, with respect 
        to the program proposed to be established under that paragraph--
                    (A) whether reduced performance requirements with 
                respect to spectrum obtained through the program would 
                facilitate deployment of advanced telecommunications 
                services in the areas covered by the program;
                    (B) what conditions may be needed on transfers of 
                spectrum under the program to allow covered small 
                carriers that obtain spectrum under the program to build 
                out the spectrum in a reasonable period of time;
                    (C) what incentives may be appropriate to encourage 
                licensees to lease or sell spectrum, including--
                          (i) extending the term of a license granted 
                      under section 301 of the Communications Act of 
                      1934 (47 U.S.C. 301); or
                          (ii) modifying performance requirements of the 
                      license relating to the leased or sold spectrum; 
                      and
                    (D) the administrative feasibility of--
                          (i) the incentives described in subparagraph 
                      (C); and
                          (ii) other incentives considered by the 
                      Commission that further the goals of this section.
            (3) Forfeiture of spectrum.--If a party fails to meet any 
        build out requirements set by the Commission for any spectrum 
        sold or leased under this section, the right to the spectrum 
        shall be forfeited to the Commission unless the Commission finds 
        that there is good cause for the failure of the party.
            (4) Requirement.--The Commission may offer a licensee 
        incentives or reduced performance requirements under this 
        section only if the Commission finds that doing so would likely 
        result in increased availability of advanced telecommunications 
        services in a rural area.

    (a) Establishment.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in consultation 
        with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and leading 
        research, advocacy, self-advocacy, and service organizations, 
        shall establish standards and best practices relating to the use 
        of non-invasive and non-permanent tracking technology, where a 
        guardian or parent has determined that a non-invasive and non-
        permanent tracking device is the least restrictive alternative, 
        to locate individuals as described in subsection (a)(2) of 
        section 240001 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement 
        Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. 12621), as added by this Act.
            (2) Requirements.--In establishing the standards and best 
        practices required under paragraph (1), the Attorney General 
        shall--
                    (A) determine--
                          (i) the criteria used to determine which 
                      individuals would benefit from the use of a 
                      tracking device;
                          (ii) the criteria used to determine who should 
                      have direct access to the tracking system; and
                          (iii) which non-invasive and non-permanent 
                      types of tracking devices can be used in 
                      compliance with the standards and best practices; 
                      and
                    (B) establish standards and best practices the 
                Attorney General determines are necessary to the 
                administration of a tracking system, including 
                procedures to--
                          (i) safeguard the privacy of the data used by 
                      the tracking device such that--

                                to law enforcement and health agencies 
                                determined necessary by the Attorney 
                                General; and
                                    (II) collection, use, and retention 
                                of the data is solely for the purpose of 
                                preventing injury to or death of the 
                                individual wearing the tracking device;

[[Page 132 STAT. 1122]]

                          (ii) establish criteria to determine whether 
                      use of the tracking device is the least 
                      restrictive alternative in order to prevent risk 
                      of injury or death before issuing the tracking 
                      device, including the previous consideration of 
                      less restrictive alternatives;
                          (iii) provide training for law enforcement

                                    (II) use of a tracking device over 
                                the objection of an individual; and
                          (vi) determine the role that State agencies 
                      should have in the administration of a tracking 
                      system.
            (3) Effective date.--The standards and best practices

        parent or guardian's supervision if the parent or guardian

[[Page 132 STAT. 1123]]

        does not believe that the use of such device is necessary or in 
        the interest of the child or adult under supervision.

 DIVISION R--TARGET <<NOTE: Targeted Rewards for the Global Eradication 
of Human Trafficking. 22 USC 2651 note. 22 USC 2708 note.>>  ACT

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLES.

    This division may be cited as the ``Targeted Rewards for the Global 
Eradication of Human Trafficking'' or the ``TARGET Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Trafficking in persons is a major transnational crime, 
        as recognized by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 
        (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.; division A of Public Law 106-386).
            (2) Trafficking in persons is increasingly perpetrated by 
        organized, sophisticated criminal enterprises.
            (3) Combating trafficking in persons requires a global 
        approach to identifying and apprehending the world's worst human 
        trafficking rings.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of State's rewards program is a powerful tool in combating 
sophisticated international crime and that the Department of State and 
Federal law enforcement should work in concert to offer rewards that 
target human traffickers who prey on the most vulnerable people around 
the world.

        redesignated, 2 ems to the right;
            (3) by inserting before clause (i), as redesignated, the 
        following:
                    ``(A) means--'';
            (4) in clause (ii), as redesignated, by striking the period 
        at the end and inserting ``; and''; and
            (5) by adding at the end following:

                persons (as defined in section 103 of the Trafficking 
                Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102))

    This title may be cited as the ``Taylor Force Act''.

SEC. 1002. <<NOTE: 22 USC 2378c-1 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Palestinian Authority's practice of paying salaries 
        to terrorists serving in Israeli prisons, as well as to the 
        families of deceased terrorists, is an incentive to commit acts 
        of terror.
            (2) The United States does not provide direct budgetary 
        support to the Palestinian Authority. The United States does pay 
        certain debts held by the Palestinian Authority and funds 
        programs for which the Palestinian Authority would otherwise be 
        responsible.
            (3) The United States Government supports community-based 
        programs in the West Bank and Gaza that provide for basic human 
        needs, such as food, water, health, shelter, protection, 
        education, and livelihoods, and that promote peace and 
        development.
            (4) Since fiscal year 2015, annual appropriations 
        legislation has mandated the reduction of Economic Support Fund 
        aid for the Palestinian Authority as a result of their payments 
        for acts of terrorism including, in fiscal year 2017, a 
        reduction ``by an amount the Secretary determines is equivalent 
        to the amount expended by the Palestinian Authority, the 
        Palestine Liberation Organization, and any successor or 
        affiliated organizations with such entities as payments for acts 
        of terrorism by individuals who are imprisoned after being 
        fairly tried and convicted for acts of terrorism and by 
        individuals who died committing acts of terrorism during the 
        previous calendar year''.

[[Page 132 STAT. 1144]]

SEC. 1003. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    Congress--
            (1) calls on the Palestinian Authority, the Palestine 
        Liberation Organization, and any successor or affiliated 
        organizations to stop payments for acts of terrorism by 
        individuals who are imprisoned after being fairly tried and 
        convicted for acts of terrorism and by individuals who died 
        committing acts of terrorism and to repeal the laws authorizing 
        such payments;
            (2) calls on all donor countries providing budgetary 
        assistance to the Palestinian Authority to cease direct 
        budgetary support until the Palestinian Authority stops all 
        payments incentivizing terror;
            (3) urges the Palestinian Authority to develop programs to 
        provide essential public services and support to any individual 
        in need within its jurisdictional control, rather than to 
        provide payments contingent on perpetrating acts of violence;
            (4) urges the United States Permanent Representative to the 
        United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the 
        United States at the United Nations to highlight the issue of 
        Palestinian Authority payments for acts of terrorism and to urge 
        other Member States to apply pressure upon the Palestinian 
        Authority to immediately cease such payments; and
            (5) urges the Department of State to use its bilateral and 
        multilateral engagements with all governments and organizations 
        committed to the cause of peace between Israel and the 
        Palestinians to highlight the issue of Palestinian Authority 
        payments for acts of terrorism and to urge such governments and 
        organizations to join the United States in calling on the 
        Palestinian Authority to immediately cease such payments.

                    (A) are taking credible steps to end acts of 
                violence against Israeli citizens and United States 
                citizens that are perpetrated or materially assisted by 
                individuals under their jurisdictional control, such as 
                the March 2016 attack that killed former United States 
                Army officer Taylor Force, a veteran of the wars in Iraq 
                and Afghanistan;
                    (B) have terminated payments for acts of terrorism 
                against Israeli citizens and United States citizens to 
                any individual, after being fairly tried, who has been

                sentence or period of incarceration of an individual 
                imprisoned for an act of terrorism to determine the 
                level of compensation paid, or have taken comparable 
                action that has the effect of invalidating any such law, 
                decree, regulation, or document; and
                    (D) are publicly condemning such acts of violence 
                and are taking steps to investigate or are cooperating 
                in investigations of such acts to bring the perpetrators 
                to justice.
            (2) Additional certification requirement.--The Secretary of 
        State shall include in the certification required under 
        paragraph (1) the definition of ``acts of terrorism'' that the

        subparagraph (B) of such paragraph.

    (b) Exception.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the limitation on

        successor or affiliated organizations have met the conditions 
        set forth in subsection (a). Except as provided in paragraph 
        (3), such funds may not be made available for any purpose other

SEC. 101 <<NOTE: 18 USC 1 note.>> . SHORT TITLE.

    This division may be cited as the ``Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use 
of Data Act'' or the ``CLOUD Act''.

SEC. 102 <<NOTE: 18 USC 2523 note.>> . CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Timely access to electronic data held by communications-
        service providers is an essential component of government 
        efforts to protect public safety and combat serious crime, 
        including terrorism.
            (2) Such efforts by the United States Government are being 
        impeded by the inability to access data stored outside the 
        United States that is in the custody, control, or possession of 
        communications-service providers that are subject to 
        jurisdiction of the United States.
            (3) Foreign governments also increasingly seek access to 
        electronic data held by communications-service providers in the 
        United States for the purpose of combating serious crime.
            (4) Communications-service providers face potential 
        conflicting legal obligations when a foreign government orders 
        production of electronic data that United States law may 
        prohibit providers from disclosing.
            (5) Foreign law may create similarly conflicting legal 
        obligations when chapter 121 of title 18, United States Code 
        (commonly known as the `` Stored Communications Act''), requires 
        disclosure of electronic data that foreign law prohibits 
        communications-service providers from disclosing.
            (6) International agreements provide a mechanism for 
        resolving these potential conflicting legal obligations where 
        the United States and the relevant foreign government share a 
        common commitment to the rule of law and the protection of 
        privacy and civil liberties.

service shall comply with the obligations of this chapter to preserve, 
backup, or disclose the contents of a wire or electronic communication

                      executive agreement that has entered into force

                Such a motion shall be filed not later than 14 days 
                after the date on which the provider was served with the

                permission from the court to extend the deadline based 
                on an application made within the 14 days. The right to

        subparagraph (A), the court shall afford the governmental entity
