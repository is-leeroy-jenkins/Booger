CLERK’S NOTE 

This committee print provides a compilation of the enacted text 
and applicable explanatory material for the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2023 (H.R. 2617, P.L. 117–328). 

The Act consists of 12 divisions related to regular annual appropriations 
Acts for fiscal year 2023 (divisions A through L), and two 
supplemental appropriations Acts (division M, which contains the 
Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2023, and division 
N, which contains the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations 
Act, 2023), which provide supplemental appropriations for 
fiscal year 2023. The Act also includes 25 additional divisions 
largely unrelated to appropriations matters (divisions O through 
MM). This compilation includes only the 14 divisions related to regular 
and supplemental appropriations matters (A–N). It also includes 
the front matter of the Act, which contains provisions applicable 
to the entire consolidated Act. 

Divisions A through L are the products of negotiations between 
the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on final fiscal 
year 2023 appropriations for all 12 annual appropriations bills. 

The legislative text of the consolidated Act was submitted by 
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Appropriations, as an amendment (Senate Amendment 6552) to the 
House amendment to the Senate amendment to an unrelated bill 
pending in the Senate, H.R. 2617. The Senate agreed to that 
amendment on December 22, 2022, after adopting 8 additional 
amendments to Senate Amendment 6552. The House agreed to the 
measure on December 23, 2022. The President signed the legislation 
on December 29, 2022, and it became Public Law 117–328. 

Because an ‘‘amendments-between-the-Houses’’ process was used 
instead of a conference committee, there is no conference report 
and no ‘‘Joint Explanatory Statement of the Managers’’ for H.R. 
2617. An explanatory statement relating to Senate Amendment 
6552 was filed by Senator Leahy in the Congressional Record on 
December 20, 2022.1 Section 4 of the front matter of the consolidated 
Act provides that this explanatory statement ‘‘shall have the 
same effect with respect to the allocation of funds and implementation 
of divisions A through L of this Act as if it were a joint explanatory 
statement of a committee of conference.’’ 

For the convenience of users, the legislative text of each of divisions 
A through L is paired with the applicable division of the explanatory 
statement. Divisions M and N do not have associated explanatory 
material. 

1 The explanatory statement appears in Books I, II, and III of the December 20, 2022, Congressional 
Record. (See pages S7819–S9590.)

[CLERK’S NOTE.—Reproduced below is the material relating to division 
A contained in the Explanatory Statement regarding H.R. 
2617, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.1] 

DIVISION A—AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, 

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED 

AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2023 

CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVES 

The joint explanatory statement accompanying this division is 
approved and indicates congressional intent. Unless otherwise 
noted, the language set forth in House Report 117–392 carries the 
same weight as language included in this joint explanatory statement 
and should be complied with unless specifically addressed to 
the contrary in this joint explanatory statement. While some language 
is repeated for emphasis, it is not intended to negate the language 
referred to above unless expressly provided herein. 

In cases in which the House or this explanatory statement has 
directed the submission of a report, such report is to be submitted 
to both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no 
later than 60 days after enactment of this Act, unless otherwise directed. 


Hereafter, in Division A of this statement, the term ‘the Committees’ 
refers to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate. 

For the appropriations provided by this Act and previous Acts, 
the departments and agencies funded by this agreement are reminded 
that the Committees use the definitions for transfer, reprogramming, 
and program, project, and activity as defined by the 
Government Accountability Office (GAO) in GAO–04–261SP Appropriations 
Law—Vol. I and GAO–05–734SP Budget Glossary. 

A transfer is the shifting of funds between appropriations. It applies 
to (1) transfers from one agency to another, (2) transfers from 
one account to another within the same agency, and (3) transfers 
to an interagency or intra-agency working fund. In each instance, 
statutory authority is required. 

Reprogramming is the utilization of funds in an appropriation account 
for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of appropriation.

OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR MARKETING AND 
REGULATORY PROGRAMS 

The agreement provides $1,617,000 for the Office of the Under 
Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs. 

The agreement continues to reject past proposals to administratively 
implement new user fees and believes USDA should not propose 
new user fees without taking into account the full impact on 
farmers, ranchers, and beneficiaries who would be forced to contend 
with rapid changes and additional costs without prior notice. 

ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE 

SALARIES AND EXPENSES 

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS) 

The agreement provides $1,171,071,000 for the Animal and Plant

The agreement notes that assessing Agriculture Quarantine Inspections’ 
treatment monitoring fees on a per-enclosure basis imposes 
disproportionate impacts on industry and user groups at certain 
key ports of entry, including ports along the Southeastern 
United States. USDA is encouraged to continue evaluating alternative 
and equitable funding mechanisms in consultation with relevant 
stakeholder groups. 

The agreement encourages the Department to continue coordination 
with State animal health officials in order to proactively mitigate 
the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza and to increase 
outreach and engagement with poultry producers to educate 
on proactive measures individuals can take to further mitigate the 
spread of the virus. The agreement encourages the Department to 
utilize existing supplemental funding to continue these efforts. 

The agreement directs the Department to submit a report to the 
Committees on its efforts to manage Carrizo cane and cattle fever 
tick within 60 days of enactment of this Act.

The agreement recognizes the significant economic impact of the 
Huanglongbing disease on the citrus industry, which is especially 
acute in Florida and is a growing concern in both Texas and California. 
The agreement encourages the Huanglongbing Multi-Agency 
Coordination [HLB–MAC] group to explore and identify new methods 
to expedite the delivery of promising treatments directly to 
growers. Finally, the agreement expects that any funds which are 
redirected from existing HLB–MAC projects be repurposed to other 
priority HLB–MAC projects that are showing promising results to 
ensure these critical funds remain committed to facilitating the design 
and implementation of the rapid delivery pathway to growers. 

The agreement directs APHIS to consider options for expanding 
environmental documentation for spotted lanternfly treatments in 
areas outside the states currently included in APHIS’ environmental 
analysis as well as the cost of such treatments and to provide 
a report on these topics 90 days after the enactment of this 
Act. 

APHIS is directed to provide an annual report within 120 days 
of the end of the fiscal year, detailing how the funds for non-lethal 
strategies were dispersed; including regional distribution, wild and 
domestic species impacted, number and size of livestock/agricultural 
operations impacted, and nonlethal tools and methods implemented 
and supported. 

The agreement provides no less than the fiscal year 2022 level 
to support ongoing cooperative agreements with States impacted by 
Eastern Equine Encephalitis. 

The continued presence of feral cattle in the Gila National Forest 
Wilderness Area in New Mexico is negatively impacting both the 
ecosystem and recreational use of the area. The agreement directs 
APHIS Wildlife Services and the United States Forest Service to 
address this issue as expeditiously as feasible. The agencies shall 
provide reports to the Committees on their progress in the first and 
third quarters of the year. 

The agreement provides $3,000,000 for APHIS to ensure necessary 
steps are taken to develop a qualified workforce comprised 
of subject matter experts in foreign, emerging, and zoonotic diseases 
and capable of developing, validating, and conducting needed 
diagnostics, performing epidemiologic studies, and completing 
bioinformatics analyses. The agreement encourages APHIS to establish 
cooperative agreements with academic research institutions, 
particularly non-land grant Hispanic-Serving Institutions, to 
support the next generation of the National Bio- and Agro-Defense 
Facility workforce. 

The agreement directs USDA to submit a report to the Committees 
within 1 year of enactment of this Act regarding the National 
Detector Dog Training Center’s role in protecting the domestic agriculture 
sector from pests and diseases. The report shall include a 
description of domestic pest and disease programs that use canine 
detector teams, coordination between APHIS and U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection on use of canine teams for agricultural quarantine 
inspections, and the Center’s current capacity level. 

The agreement directs USDA to coordinate amongst all relevant 
agencies under its authority to update, and where applicable, develop 
consistent, easily replicated formulas on an annual basis to 


74 

estimate market values of livestock and poultry categories for indemnity 
purposes. In developing and updating these annual values, 
USDA should ensure that they reflect applicable modern production 
practices, and relevant livestock and poultry markets so that 
payments by USDA represent average fair market values for the 
category of animal that the compensation payment is intended to 
cover. 

The agreement directs APHIS to work with ARS and stakeholders 
and provides no less than the fiscal year 2022 level to develop 
an integrated management program for control of the Roseau 
cane scale insect pest infestation. 

The agreement includes no less than the fiscal year 2022 funding 
level to improve understanding of EU1 and NA1 strains of the sudden 
oak death pathogen and treatment methods to inform control 
and management techniques in wildlands. 

The agreement provides $121,957,000 for wildlife damage control 
to maintain priority initiatives, including preventing the transport 
of invasive snakes and other harmful species. The agreement provides 
no less than the fiscal year 2022 funding level for the agency 
to reduce blackbird depredation in the Northern Great Plains. 

The agreement provides no less than the fiscal year 2022 level 
for damage management efforts and the development of methods to 
assist producers in combatting the persistent threat and economic 
hardship caused by cormorants, pelicans, and other birds. The 
agreement provides $28,000,000 for the National Rabies Management 
Program to fortify existing barriers and advance prevention 
and eradication efforts. 

The agreement provides $2,000,000 within Wildlife Damage 
Management to maintain a National Training Academy focused on 
those areas of greatest concern such as pyrotechnics, firearms, hazardous 
materials, immobilization and euthanasia drugs, pesticides, 
animal care and handling, land vehicles, watercraft, and zoonotic 
diseases. 

The agreement notes that the need for the equine industry and 
APHIS to cooperate in order to eliminate the soring of horses has 
been consistently recognized. In 2021, the National Academy of 
Sciences recognized the importance of objective science-based inspection 
to ensure accuracy and fairness. The Committee directs 
APHIS to continue to utilize existing resources to implement proven 
objective science-based inspection tools for its horse soring inspection 
protocol.

BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES 

The agreement provides $3,175,000 for APHIS Buildings and Facilities. 


AGRICULTURAL MARKETING SERVICE 

MARKETING SERVICES 

The agreement provides $237,695,000 for Agricultural Marketing 
Service (AMS), Marketing Services. 

The agreement includes the following increases: $2,000,000 for 
the National Organic Standards program; $500,000 for the Acer Access 
and Development program; and $5,000,000 for oversight and 
enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act. 

The agreement includes $25,000,000 for the Dairy Business Innovation 
Initiatives program and $8,000,000 for the Micro-Grants for 
Food Security program. The agreement also includes $1,000,000 for 
the Cattle Contracts Library in this account. 

The agreement expects AMS to prioritize proposals for the Acer 
Access and Development Program that support the promotion of research 
and education, natural resource responsibility, and market 


76 

development and promotion, and that are from regions with sufficient 
distribution of Acer saccharum to support a commercially viable 
maple syrup industry. 

The agreement directs the Department, in collaboration with 
Customs and Border Protection, FDA, and domestic commercial 
honey producer stakeholders, to provide a report on the resources 
and authorities needed to ensure a fairer market for domestic 
honey producers and a more transparent market for American consumers. 


The agreement directs the Secretary, working with the Attorney 
General as appropriate, to act expeditiously to analyze issues surrounding 
transparent meat pricing mechanisms and reliable price 
discovery for cattle producers and the rest of the supply chain nationwide, 
and to consider extending the ongoing investigation to include 
economic disruptions associated with public health emergencies. 


The agreement urges AMS to administer the Micro-Grants for 
Food Security program in a manner that will ensure that low-income, 
disadvantaged, and minority individuals are able to submit 
applications and receive funding for projects that would increase 
the amount and quality of locally produced foods. When practicable, 
the agreement directs AMS to waive or amend how it applies the 
regulatory requirements of 2 CFR 200.206, 200.313, 200.328, and 

200.329 to ensure that this program addresses food insecurity challenges. 
The agreement recognizes AMS’ work to reimburse dairy producers 
for unintended losses in 2020 resulting from a milk pricing 
change made in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 and pan-
demic-related market disruption and is concerned that the per-producer 
limitation of five million pounds resulted in larger producers 
being reimbursed for only minimal portions of their losses. The Department 
is encouraged to evaluate possible measures to ensure 
more wholesome reimbursement under future programs. 

The agreement encourages USDA to support the Native American 
Tourism and Improving Visitor Experience Act (Public Law 
114–221) by prioritizing projects that market, promote, or expand 
Native American foods, markets, and enterprises. 

The agreement directs AMS to continue strong enforcement of organic 
dairy production standards and to resolve significant variations 
in standard interpretation that exist among organic certifiers 
and organic dairy producers. AMS shall continue to conduct 
critical risk-based oversight, particularly for large, complex dairy 
operations. 

The agreement recognizes the need for organic dairy producers to 
have detailed data about market conditions in order to make decisions 
about the value of their products. Within 60 days of enactment 
of this Act, AMS is directed to brief the Committees on the 
feasibility of collection and publication of organic fluid milk data 
from all Federal Milk Marketing Orders. 

The agreement directs the Secretary to require mandatory reporting 
on an annual basis by accredited certifying agents on aggregate 
production areas certified by crop and location in order to 
accurately calculate organic acreage and yield estimates on a country-
by-country basis. The agreement maintains funding for AMS to 


77 

coordinate with NASS for activities related to expanding organic 
price reporting and organic data collection. 

LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 

The agreement provides a limitation on administrative expenses 
of $62,596,000.

(SECTION 32) 

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS) 

The agreement provides $21,501,000 for Funds for Strengthening 
Markets, Income, and Supply. 

The agreement notes the importance of the Secretary’s authority, 
described in clause 3 of 7 U.S.C. 612c, to direct funds from the Section 
32 account, but believes that communication between USDA 
and Congress should be improved when this practice is used. The 
agreement directs the Secretary to provide notification to the Committees 
in advance of any public announcement or release of Section 
32 funds under the authorities described above. 

The following table reflects the status of this fund:

This amount includes an additional $10,000,000 to continue the 
reduced user fees for small and very small establishments. The Act 
also includes $2,800,000 to address the persistently high levels of 
public health veterinarian vacancies and up to $1,000,000 for the 
inspection of wild caught invasive species in the order Siluriformes 
and family Ictaluridae, including blue catfish in the Chesapeake 
Bay. 

The agreement appreciates the updated memorandum of understanding 
on worker safety with FSIS and the U.S. Department of 
Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration that will 
go towards protecting workers and improved training over the next 
five years. 

The Committees still await the report on the Cooperative Interstate 
Shipment 

(CIS) program as outlined in Section 764(e)(2) of Division N of 
Public Law 116–260. 

The agreement recognizes the crucial need for the Federal Government 
to improve its interagency coordination efforts on food

The agreement urges USDA to maintain its position that drought 
on acequia-irrigated land is an eligible cause of loss for the Non-
insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program. 

The agreement again directs USDA to brief the Committees on 
the implementation status of the Acreage Crop Reporting Streamlining 
Initiative. 

The agreement recognizes that drought is the largest cause of 

U.S. farm production losses and reminds the Secretary of the report 
directed in the joint explanatory statement accompanying Public 
Law 116–260 detailing a full analysis of the new CREP dryland 
agricultural uses authority and which dryland farming best practices 
could make advancements to protect ground water and surface 
water quality and control soil erosion while enhancing wildlife 
habitat. 
The agreement directs the Secretary to restore normal mortality 
rates under the Emergency Livestock Assistance Program for honeybees 
to fifteen percent and to restore fair market values for colonies 
and hives to at least the levels utilized in the 2019 program 
year. The agreement encourages the Secretary to expand eligibility 
under the program to include climate change and drought-related 
losses, or to include managed honeybees under other appropriate 
disaster assistance programs. 

The agreement encourages FSA to work with ranchers to tailor 
the Livestock Indemnity Program to address unique circumstances 
currently preventing producers from receiving compensation for

Dairy Indemnity Program. 

The agreement notes that no payments have been made to Maine 
farmers who depopulated their herds as a result of per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination and encourages 
USDA to provide indemnification to those farmers. The agreement 
also recognizes that USDA updated the Dairy Indemnity Payment 
Program (DIPP) to provide additional options to dairy producers 
impacted by PFAS contamination, but directs USDA to evaluate 
additional resources available to producers facing PFAS contamination, 
and to inform the Committees of additional resources needed 
to provide relief.

$86,757,000 for the Soil Surveys Program; and $800,892,000 for 
Conservation Technical Assistance, of which $14,000,000 is for the 
Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative, $13,000,000 is for additional 
staff, and $1,000,000 is for Phragmite control. The agreement 
also includes $3,000,000 for a cost-share program for the construction 
and repair of perimeter fencing. 

The agreement maintains funding for the Grazing Lands Conservation 
Initiative, of which at least $12,000,000 shall be provided 
through State allocations as competitive grants to diverse partnerships. 
The agreement also directs NRCS to provide at least 
$2,000,000 through a cooperative agreement with a national grazing 
lands conservation coalition to establish diverse State-based 
coalitions and undertake grazing education. 

The agreement provides an increase of $7,000,000 to expand 
NRCS Snow Telemetry Network, of which $1,000,000 is for a study, 
following consultation with the Committees, of potential expansion 
of the SNOTEL automated mountain weather monitoring network 
to the northeastern United States. The agreement also encourages 
consideration of expansion into the Alpine zone of glaciated mountain 
ranges, and consideration of working with interested university, 
tribal, and non-profit partners on the installation and maintenance 
of such SNOTEL sites. 

The agreement encourages the Secretary to use mitigation with 
the conversion of a natural wetland and equivalent wetlands functions 
at a ratio which does not exceed 1-to-1 acreage. 

The agreement expects NRCS to utilize all available opportunities 
and to work with eligible entities, including producers, States, 
irrigation districts, and acequias to assist in implementing area-
wide plans to address drought resiliency and mitigation. 


82 

The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) helps 
farmers conserve energy and develop conservation plans through 
locally based technical service providers. The agreement urges the 
Secretary to seek out and implement opportunities to encourage 
and support farmers’ energy efficiency projects. The agreement further 
encourages the Department to develop EQIP guidance that ensures 
input from local communities, including listening sessions 
with land grants and acequias. 

The agreement expects NRCS to continue to take into account 
sample design, data collection software, and data processing capability 
in order to collect and produce scientifically credible information 
on the status, condition, and trends of Alaska’s lands, soils, 
waters, and related resources. 

The agreement directs NRCS to implement a multi-year cooperative 
agreement with appropriate funding support to an organization 
that supports efforts to conserve the lesser-prairie chicken and 
implements carbon sequestration conservation programs nationwide, 
and that can make conservation solutions and best practices 
accessible daily to private land owners. 

The agreement directs NRCS to provide a report within 90 days 
of enactment of this Act on actions it will take to eliminate program 
duplication as identified in IG Audit Report 10601–0004–KC 
and IG Audit Report 10601–0001–32. 

The agreement continues to direct NRCS to maintain a record of 
total technical assistance dollars, differentiated between mandatory 
and discretionary allocations, and to provide the data to the Committees 
on Appropriations. 

The agreement encourages NRCS to reevaluate the match requirements 
for the Technical Service Provider program supporting 
State and Tribal health programs. 

WATERSHED AND FLOOD PREVENTION OPERATIONS 

The agreement provides $75,000,000 for Watershed and Flood 
Prevention Operations (WFPO). 

The agreement funds congressionally directed spending for certain 
activities and locations under Watershed and Flood Prevention 
Operations. While the agreement provides the funding, recipients 
of CDS are still required to apply for the funding. The agreement 
expects the agency to review the applications and fund projects in 
the same manner as previous years. 

The agreement is aware of increased interest in using WFPO 
funds for projects that modernize irrigation systems while also providing 
benefits for drought response and wildlife habitats, and directs 
NRCS, in collaboration with outside stakeholders and project 
sponsors, to review and streamline program guidance to facilitate 
these projects. The agreement further directs NRCS to provide a 
report within 60 days of enactment of this Act detailing the steps 
taken to streamline the program to reflect expanded use of funds 
for irrigation modernization projects that also improve drought response 
and wildlife habitat. 

WATERSHED REHABILITATION PROGRAM 

The agreement provides $2,000,000 for the Watershed Rehabilitation 
Program.

The agreement provides a limitation of $15,000,000 for Hazardous 
Waste Management. 

TITLE III 

RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 

OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT 

The agreement provides $1,620,000 for the Office of the Under 
Secretary for Rural Development. 

RURAL DEVELOPMENT 

SALARIES AND EXPENSES 

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS) 

The agreement provides $801,079,000 for Salaries and Expenses 
of Rural Development, including a direct appropriation of 
$351,087,000. 

The agreement remains concerned about IT systems within 
Rural Development and provides an increase of $25,000,000 to continue 
making improvements and retiring legacy systems. This increase 
shall be used to update or retire the following systems: 
UniFi/SURPASS, Hyperion Reports, and PLAS. Furthermore, the 
agreement directs the Department to provide a report listing the 
programs that still require paper applications and the estimated 
cost to develop online portals, as well as monthly updates on mak



84 

ing improvements to the systems listed above and any other IT development. 


The agreement provides $5,000,000 for the Rural Partners Network 
and still awaits the updated report that includes key performance 
measures to evaluate the success of this new initiative. Additionally, 
the fiscal year 2022 joint explanatory statement requested 
monthly updates on the rollout of the program, and the Committees 
have yet to receive an update. The agreement directs the Department 
to begin sending those updates immediately. 

Additionally, the agreement provides an increase of $25,802,000 
for pay costs. The agreement directs the Department to continue to 
fill vacancies, prioritizing ongoing mission critical activities, and to 
brief the Committees prior to advancing or expanding the Rural 
Partners Network and onboarding Community Liaisons. The agreement 
also directs the Department to provide a report that breaks 
out staffing by program, including current levels and end of year 
goals within 30 days of enactment of this Act and monthly reports 
to the Committees with hiring updates thereafter. 

RURAL HOUSING SERVICE 

RURAL HOUSING INSURANCE FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT 

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS) 

The agreement provides a total budget authority of $527,357,000 
for activities under the Rural Housing Insurance Fund Program 
Account. 

The Committees applaud the initial success of the Single-Family 
Housing Direct relending loan program and provide $7,500,000 in 
loan level to expand the pilot to other States, particularly in the 
southwestern United States. The agreement directs the Department 
to publish a report on its website detailing the Native community 
development finance institutions (CDFI) that receive loans 
from this demonstration program, a breakdown of mortgage loans 
made under this program to households residing on and off Tribal 
trust lands, and the average mortgage loan amount made by Native 
CDFIs under this program. 

The agreement is concerned that there are unnecessary impediments 
facing individuals who utilize Single Family Housing Direct 
Loans and the Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program 
to purchase homes or property in rural areas. The agreement reminds 
the Department that efficient review and approval of these 
applications is essential to the success of these programs, especially 
in the current housing market, and directs the Department to submit 
a report, within 60 days of enactment, on the current appraisal 
requirements for these homes and whether these requirements are 
adopted from requirements used by the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development or the Department of Veterans Affairs. 

The agreement reminds the Department that the fiscal year 2017 
Appropriations Act required the Department to conduct research 
and identify policy program reforms, and incentives for preserving 
rural rental housing and to produce a report summarizing those 
findings to be submitted to the Committees 2 years later. The report 
is now 3 years overdue, and the agreement directs the Depart



85 

ment to submit the completed report within 30 days of enactment 
of this Act. 

The following table indicates loan, subsidy, and grant levels provided 
by the agreement: 

(Dollars in thousands)

RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 

The agreement provides $1,487,926,000 for the Rental Assistance 
Program. 

The Committees are interested in the fiscal year 2023 President’s 
budget request to decouple rental assistance from Section 515 loans 
but believe additional information is needed. Therefore, the agreement 
directs the Department to hold at least three listening sessions 
and stakeholder meetings within six months of enactment of 
this Act. Furthermore, the Department shall brief the Committees, 
within 60 days after the final listening session, on how decoupling 
rental assistance would be implemented. 

The Secretary is encouraged to prioritize multi-family housing 
properties acquired by means of a section 515 loan within the current 
fiscal year when determining current rental assistance needs. 

The agreement is concerned the shift of urban population to more 
rural settings has disproportionally impacted affordable housing for 
rural residents. Therefore, where practicable, the agreement urges 
the Secretary to prioritize Rental Assistance to these regions. 

RURAL HOUSING VOUCHER ACCOUNT 

The agreement provides $48,000,000 for the Rural Housing 
Voucher Account.

RURAL COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM ACCOUNT 

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS) 

The agreement provides $341,490,328 for the Rural Community 
Facilities Program Account and an additional $25,300,000 in Division 
N of this consolidated Act. 

The agreement is concerned by the ineligibility of projects under 
the Community Facilities Grant program located in significantly 
rural and low-income areas that are defined as distressed but do 
not qualify for grant funding under this program. The Department 
is required to evaluate the program’s income and service area-
based eligibility standards and identify ways to approve community 
access to these grants, including whether basing eligibility on national 
rather than state median household income could benefit 
areas located in predominantly poor, rural States. 

The following table reflects the loan, subsidy, and grant amounts 
provided by the agreement:

RURAL BUSINESS—COOPERATIVE SERVICE 

RURAL BUSINESS PROGRAM ACCOUNT 

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS) 

The agreement provides $86,520,000 for the Rural Business Program 
Account. 

The agreement provides a $550,000,000 increase in loan authority 
for Business and Industry Guaranteed loan program. The agreement 
provides $500,000 for transportation technical assistance and 
directs that of the $4,000,000 provided for grants to benefit federally 
Recognized Native American Tribes, $250,000 shall be used to 


87 

implement an American Indian and Alaska Native passenger 
transportation development and assistance initiative. 

The agreement is aware of GAO’s recent report, GAO–21–579, 
which issued recommendations to USDA, Department of Housing 
and Urban Development [HUD], and the Economic Development 
Agency [EDA] to better leverage complementary Federal community 
and economic development funds. The agreement encourages 
USDA to improve collaboration with HUD and EDA to help communities 
maximize and more effectively utilize Federal economic 
development resources. 

The agreement recognizes that strong partnerships exist between 
RD and Federal Regional Commissions and Authorities. The agreement 
encourages RD to coordinate with Regional Commissions to 
promote efficiency during the grant planning and review process. 
Additionally, the agreement encourages RD to ensure flexible processes 
are available for each Regional Commission as appropriate. 

The agreement provides $2,000,000 for the RISE grant program 
enacted as part of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public 
Law 115–334). These grants have the potential to help struggling 
communities by funding jobs accelerators in low-income rural 
areas. The agreement recommends funding be prioritized for entities 
leveraging next generation gigabit broadband service to promote 
entrepreneurship and entities based in geographical areas 
with established agriculture and technology sectors which are focused 
on the development of precision and autonomous agriculture 
technologies as a way to strengthen rural economies and create 
jobs. 

The following table reflects the loan, subsidy, and grant levels 
provided by the agreement:

RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT 

The agreement provides $75,000,000 for the Rural Economic Development 
Loans Program Account. 

RURAL COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS 

The agreement provides $28,300,000 for Rural Cooperative Development 
Grants. Of the amounts made available, $13,000,000 is 
for the Value-Added Producer Grant Program and $3,500,000 is for 
the Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas Program. 

The agreement provides $3,000,000 for Agriculture Innovation 
Center funding, as authorized in section 6402 of Public Law 107– 
171, to be available as grants to States authorized to host, and that 
have previously hosted, a USDA Agriculture Innovation Center and 
where the State continues to demonstrate support and provide non-
Federal grant funding to producers developing, producing, and 
marketing value-added agricultural and food products. Prior year 
or current grant awardees shall be eligible for these funds. 

The Committees are still awaiting the report on implementation 
of Section 6306 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public 
Law 115–334), including a projected timeline for full implementation 
of this provision. 

The agreement urges that Value-Added Producer Grants be 
prioritized to support the production of value-added agricultural 
products, including dairy, with significant potential to expand production 
and processing in the United States. 

RURAL MICROENTREPRENEUR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 

The agreement provides $6,000,000 for the Rural Microentrepreneur 
Assistance Program. 

RURAL ENERGY FOR AMERICA PROGRAM 

The agreement provides $18,000 for the Rural Energy for America 
Program (REAP) in addition to resources provided in the Agriculture 
Improvement Act of 2018 and Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022. 

The agreement also acknowledges the potential of REAP to help 
rural agricultural producers and small businesses diversify on-farm 
income and promote energy efficiency through renewable energy 
production. However, the agreement recognizes financial barriers 
to program utilization by small agricultural producers and small 
businesses due to matching fund requirements and reimbursement-
based grant funding. As such, the agreement encourages the Department 
to make REAP grants more accessible to socially disadvantaged 
groups and low income applicants to ensure the program’s 
feasibility and accessibility for applicants of all demographics. 


The following table reflects the loan, subsidy, and grant levels 
provided by the agreement:

HEALTHY FOOD FINANCING INITIATIVE 

The agreement provides $3,000,000 for the Healthy Food Financing 
Initiative. 

RURAL UTILITIES SERVICE 

RURAL WATER AND WASTE DISPOSAL PROGRAM ACCOUNT 

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS) 

The agreement provides $596,404,000 for the Rural Utilities 
Service Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program Account and an 
additional $60,000,000 in Division N of this consolidated Act. 

The agreement recognizes that small and rural communities located 
within Central Appalachia can lack access to reliable water 
and sanitation because they do not have the capacity or population 
bases to support centralized water systems. Within the funds provided 
for the Rural Water and Wastewater Disposal program, the 
agreement encourages the Department to fund pilot projects intended 
to provide decentralized small-scale water and wastewater 
services to communities in distressed counties within Central Appalachia. 


The agreement provides $70,000,000 for water and waste disposal 
systems grants for Native Americans, including Native Alaskans, 
and the Colonias. The agreement recognizes the special needs 
and problems for delivery of basic services to these populations and 
encourages the Secretary to distribute these funds in line with the 
fiscal year 2014 distribution to the degree practicable. 

The agreement directs that no less than $1,000,000 within the 
technical assistance funding be used to support manufactured 
homes. 

The following table reflects the loan, subsidy, and grant levels 
provided by the agreement: 

(Dollars in thousands)

DISTANCE LEARNING, TELEMEDICINE, AND BROADBAND PROGRAM 

The agreement provides $466,503,317 for the Distance Learning, 
Telemedicine, and Broadband Program. The agreement provides 
$3,000,000 to address critical healthcare needs, as authorized by 
section 379G of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development 
Act. The agreement also provides $3,000,000 for the broadband deployment 
programs authorized in the Agriculture Improvement Act 
of 2018. 

The agreement provides $348,000,000 for the Re-Connect pilot, 
which was established in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2018 (Public Law 115–141). The program shall establish a scoring 
criterion that prioritizes serving the hardest to reach, unserved and 
underserved rural communities. Additionally, the agreement continues 
to direct the Secretary to allow entities of any structure, including 
partnerships and infrastructure applications, to apply, provided 
sufficient assurances are given that broadband service will be 
provided to the subject area through contractual arrangements. 

The agreement encourages the Department to continue to update 
the program and review process to make ReConnect more efficient, 
including collaborating with the Rural Electric Division to ensure 
that all utilities and broadband technologies are treated equally in 
the application process. In addition, the burdens of applying for 
funding and participating in the program should be as minimal as 
possible, including allowing all providers to offer proof of financial 
capability through bond ratings instead of submitting financial documentation, 
and to offer collateral for loans as well as security for 
performance under grants using alternate forms of security instead 
of providing a first lien on assets. 

To maximize the reach of funding, projects should not be funded 
if another broadband provider has begun a network build or is sub



91 

ject to an enforceable commitment, either through a Federal, State, 
or local funding program or other binding obligation to a government 
entity, to serve the proposed service area. In addition, the 
agreement reminds USDA to avoid efforts that could duplicate existing 
networks built by private investment or those built 
leveraging and utilizing other Federal programs and to coordinate 
with the National Telecommunications Information Administration 
and the Federal Communications Commission to ensure wherever 
possible that any funding provided to support deployment of last-
mile broadband infrastructure is targeted to areas that are currently 
unserved. 

In any areas, study areas, or census blocks outside an area 
where a Tribal government has jurisdiction, and where a provider 
is already subject to a buildout obligation of 25/3 Mbps or greater 
for fixed terrestrial broadband pursuant to a commitment to another 
government entity, RUS Telecommunications Program should 
take that funding into account to prevent the duplication of services 
financed by Federal support. Entities subject to such existing 
commitment applying for ReConnect funds to bring service offerings 
to the ReConnect build-to speed should be given a scoring 
preference by RUS. This shall include areas pending FCC final approval 
of an award of High-Cost USF funds for 2 years after the 
applicable long form application deadline. 

Further, the agreement encourages the agency to prioritize 
projects financed through public-private partnerships and projects 
where Federal funding will not exceed 50 percent of the project’s 
total cost. The agreement also supports efforts to increase transparency 
and encourages the Secretary to follow the notice and comment 
rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act 
(Public Law 79–404) with respect to all program administration 
and activities, including publishing a written decision on RUS’ 
website of how challenges were decided and the agency’s reasons 
for such decision. In addition, the agreement intended the pilot to 
be technology neutral and encourages the Secretary to eliminate or 
revise the awarding of extra points under the ReConnect program 
based on commercial status, or to applicants from States without 
restrictions on broadband delivery by utilities service providers. 

The agreement also encourages the Department to allow service 
areas that received CAF II funds to allow other entities to apply 
for ReConnect funding for the same service area if the CAF II 
funds supported satellite deployment and the entity that received 
CAF II funds cannot provide terrestrial broadband. In addition, the 
agreement is concerned that States and territories outside the contiguous 
United States are having difficulty participating with the 
USDA broadband programs, and encourages the Secretary to consider 
grants or loans for satellite, or other technologies, if such 
middle mile infrastructure predominantly serves a ‘‘rural area’’ as 
defined in section 601(b) and do not lead to overbuilding. The 
agreement also remains concerned that States and territories outside 
the contiguous United States are having difficulty utilizing 
this program and directs the agency to report back to the Committees 
with recommendations to address these concerns. 

The agreement is concerned that the current weighting scale for 
the ReConnect program disadvantages rural households and com



92 

munities that are not necessarily located on farms. In addition, the 
agreement is concerned that providing preference to 100 Mbps 
symmetrical service also unfairly disadvantages these communities 
by limiting the deployment of other technologies capable of providing 
service to these areas. Further, the agreement is concerned 
that the current program does not effectively recognize the unique 
challenges and opportunities that different technologies, including 
satellite, provide to delivering broadband in noncontiguous States 
or mountainous terrain. While the agreement continues to provide 
the Secretary with the flexibility to consider applications that provide 
lower speeds to areas with severe geographic limitations, the 
minimum buildout speed for the ReConnect program remains 100/ 
20 Mbps. 

The Department is required to submit a report within 90 days 
on the feasibility and cost of utilizing satellite internet service 
under its existing programs. The report must cover a cost comparison 
of fiber versus satellite costs with a focus on reaching rural 
areas. Additionally, USDA should report on any statutory barriers 
that prevent program dollars to go toward satellite internet access.

TITLE IV 

DOMESTIC FOOD PROGRAMS 

OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FOOD, NUTRITION, AND 
CONSUMER SERVICES 

The agreement provides $1,376,000 for the Office of the Under 
Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. 

The agreement directs the Secretary to determine ways to 
streamline the application process for the Summer Food Service 
Program and the Child and Adult Care Food Program. The Secretary 
is directed to consider allowing organizations in good standing 
for 3 years to file only one application to administer both programs 
each year. The agreement directs the Department to submit 
the report on ways to streamline the application process for SFSP 
and CACFP as required by Public Law 116–260. 

The agreement urges FNS to focus efforts on providing support 
to States with high levels of food insecurity, including high density 
vulnerable populations in areas without adequate transportation. 
The agreement also encourages FNS to assess gaps in current feeding 
programs. 

The agreement appreciates the intent of FNS to focus on implementing 
locally-designed initiatives to increase food security in 


93 

frontier communities. The agreement strongly encourages FNS to 
continue to work closely with relevant stakeholders. The agreement 
directs FNS to collaborate with AMS in implementing Micro-
Grants for Food Security. 

The agreement is concerned about the effects changes in SNAP 
eligibility can have on vulnerable populations that are not always 
looked at on a State-by-State level. The agreement encourages the 
Secretary to include vulnerable populations in State-by-State demographic 
profiles. 

The agreement directs USDA, within 18 months of enactment of 
this Act, to formalize and publish metrics for evaluating nutrition 
security in consultation with other Federal agencies, researchers, 
and public health organizations. 

FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICE 

CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS 

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS) 

The agreement provides $28,545,432,000 for Child Nutrition Programs, 
including $30,000,000 for school meal equipment grants; 
$40,000,000 for Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer; $14,000,000 
for Farm to School grants; $3,000,000 for School Breakfast Expansion 
grants; and $20,162,000 for Team Nutrition. 

The agreement directs the Department to submit the report on 
the Summer Food Service Program as required by Public Law 116– 
260 within 30 days after enactment of this Act. 

The agreement encourages the Department to retain low-fat, flavored 
milk in the forthcoming rulemaking on child nutrition meal 
pattern components and to consider the food safety and functional 
uses of sodium in cheese. 

The agreement is concerned that the per-meal reimbursement 
rates for school meals in outlying areas do not accurately reflect 
the high costs of producing and supplying school meals. The agreement 
notes the calculation for the national payment rate for outlying 
areas has not been adjusted since its original 1979 analysis. 
The agreement directs USDA to provide a temporary increase in 
the national average payment rate for the outlying areas at a rate 
at least equal to the national average payment rate for Alaska 
until the School Nutrition Cost Study II is completed. The agreement 
further directs USDA to provide technical assistance and 
flexibility to school food authorities in outlying areas. 

The agreement encourages the Secretary to update the system of 
crediting high-protein yogurt to accurately reflect the scientifically 
demonstrated higher protein content in strained yogurt. 

The agreement recognizes the nutritional value of pulse crops for 
children and encourages FNS to support school food authorities in 
sourcing and serving pulse crops. 

The agreement encourages FNS to explore utilizing third-party 
services to deliver meals and snacks through CACFP in a non-congregate 
setting, particularly in school districts in which the poverty 
rate is higher than the national average. 

The agreement provides the following for Child Nutrition Programs:

SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN, INFANTS, 
AND CHILDREN (WIC) 

For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, 
and Children, the agreement provides $6,000,000,000, which 
fully funds expected participation in fiscal year 2023. The agreement 
includes $90,000,000 for the breastfeeding peer counselor program 
and $14,000,000 for infrastructure. 

The work of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and 
Medicine (NASEM) to review and make recommendations for updating 
the WIC food packages to reflect current science and cultural 
factors is recognized. The agreement notes, however, that 
while all revised packages now allow some fish, the amounts remain 
low compared to the recommendations of other authoritative 
health agencies. The agreement strongly encourages the Department 
to consider the health and cultural benefits of fish consumption 
as the NASEM recommendations are reviewed and used to inform 
the Department’s next course of action. The agreement also 
strongly encourages the Department to continue to allow states to 
submit cultural food package proposals to respond to the cultural 
preferences of WIC participants in states like Alaska. 

The agreement encourages USDA to collaborate with HHS on the 
development of uniform, evidence-based nutrition education materials 
in order to best service WIC eligible pregnant women and 
caregivers to infants impacted by Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. 

Repeated Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) have identified 
dairy products as nutrient-dense, while also identifying a high 
percentage of the U.S. population, including WIC’s at-risk population, 
as not consuming the recommended level of dairy. As the 
Secretary considers an update to the WIC Supplemental Food 
Package, the Committee urges the Department to ensure that 
quantities of milk and other dairy foods provided to WIC participants 
are aligned with the DGAs.

SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 

The agreement provides $153,863,723,000 for the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 

The agreement is concerned about high rates of food insecurity 
among active-duty service members, particularly in rural and remote 
areas. The agreement directs FNS to submit a report on steps 
taken to address food insecurity in military communities, including 
efforts to identify eligible individuals, outreach efforts on military 
bases, and resources available to military families. 

The agreement continues to support the full implementation of 
the National Accuracy Clearinghouse and encourages the Department 
to use a blended workforce, including contractors and subcontractors, 
that have the capability to use data analytics and public 
data to determine the correct State to issue SNAP benefits. The 
agreement also directs the Department to ensure individuals are 
not automatically removed from receiving benefits. 

The agreement directs FNS to submit the report on FDPIR as required 
by PL 116–260 within 30 days of enactment of this Act. 

The agreement is concerned that FNS has prohibited tribes and 
tribal organizations that participate in the FDPIR pilot program 
from including traditional food. The agreement directs FNS to 
allow tribes participating in the pilot program to include traditional 
foods without substitutions and to allow participating tribes 
to purchase traditional foods from producers that may not be able 
to provide sufficient quantities to serve all participating tribes 
across the Nation. 

The agreement remains concerned about data discrepancies that 
allowed benefits to be issued using fraudulent credentials. The 
agreement encourages FNS to implement controls to address these 
problems and update the Committees on its progress in addressing 
the issues outlined in the January 2017 OIG report. 

The Department is reminded that SNAP funding is not to be 
used in contravention of Section 107(b) of Division A of the Victims 
of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. 

The agreement encourages FNS to continue efforts on SNAP income 
verification from third-party databases and to enter into an 
agreement in fiscal year 2023 to make a third-party income database 
electronic data matching solution available to all 53 SNAP 
agencies, with a single negotiated price that reduces costs by taking 
advantage of economies of scale, and will facilitate greater efficiency 
and streamlined service delivery at the State level. 

The agreement provides the following for SNAP:

The agreement is concerned by the fragility of the infant formula 
supply chain and the detrimental health impacts that can arise 
from shortage of these regulated products. The agreement notes 
that while access to infant formula has improved, there are still 
supply issues, especially in rural communities, and directs the FDA 
to continue to monitor supply in order to better identify areas of 
shortage. The agreement notes a request for an investigation by 
the HHS Inspector General as well as the GAO. The agreement directs 
the FDA to submit a report within 180 days, in consultation 
with the Department of Agriculture, assessing the risks and resilience 
of domestic supply chains of infant formula, including specialty 
formula, and identifying potential solutions to address 
vulnerabilities. The assessment should cover the full ‘‘farm to bottle’’ 
supply chain including ingredient production, processing, and 
manufacturing, and distribution, including the inputs and regulatory 
approval needed at each of these steps. 

The agreement is also aware of FDA’s efforts to develop pathways 
for foreign infant formula companies to enter the domestic infant 
formula market and bypass certain requirements that domes



100 

tic companies must meet. The agreement directs FDA report to 
Congress within 90 days of passage of this Act how FDA determined 
that the oversight of foreign facilities participating in enforcement 
discretion and foreign pathways was easier, safer, and 
potential impacts towards expanding and growing domestic infant 
formula production. 

The agreement is concerned that human food facilities are not inspected 
frequently enough to adequately identify and respond to 
risks. The FDA is directed to increase the frequency of domestic 
human food inspections and develop a report for the Committees 
that identifies operational changes and determine the resource implications 
of conducting inspections every 18 months for high-risk 
domestic facilities and every three years for non-high-risk domestic 
facilities. 

The agreement directs FDA to provide a report to the Committees 
on Appropriations not later than 30 days after the enactment 
of this Act identifying applicants of INDs, NDAs, ANDAs, including 
ANDAs for OTC products, and BLAs that are headquartered in 
Russia. 

The United States continues to be an important producer of olive 
oils and one of the largest olive oil markets globally. Accordingly, 
the agreement recognizes that the establishment of a uniform set 
of standards would better protect and inform consumers. Furthermore, 
the agreement is aware that a petition was submitted to the 
FDA in July 2022 to establish a Standard of Identity for different 
grades of olive oil (e.g. extra virgin, virgin, and refined) and olive-
pomace oils. The agreement supports this effort and urges the FDA 
to work with USDA on the issue of grade standards and expeditiously 
evaluate and act on the petition. The agreement also directs 
FDA to brief the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of 
enactment on the status of the agency’s progress in developing a 

U.S. Standard of Identityinclusive of quality and authenticity for 
different grades of olive oil. 
The agreement is aware of the contribution of the accelerated approval 
pathway in expediting access to critical therapies for patients 
with cancer and certain rare diseases. The agreement encourages 
FDA to clarify the use of the pathway to help make treatment 
options available for such patients. 

The agreement directs the agency to review the Policy and Procedures 
Manual Guide 1240.3605 for solutions on how certain ingredient 
claims can be regulated as animal food and report back to the 
Committees within 120 days of enactment of this Act. 

The agreement encourages the FDA to consider an accelerated 
regulatory pathway for the review of articles intended for animal 
consumption that claim to have significant beneficial environmental 
impact. The agreement directs FDA to make recommendations 
for the appropriate pathway for environmentally beneficial 
animal food additives and report back within 120 days of enactment 
of this Act. 

The agreement is concerned about the increase of products that 
are labeled and marketed using animal food product terminology 
and related iconography, including seafood. The agreement directs 
FDA to conduct a study to better understand consumers’ attitudes, 
beliefs, motivations, and perceptions relative to product composi



101 

tion, health attributes, and labeling and report back to the Committees 
within one year of enactment of this Act. 

The agreement encourages the FDA to work with the Type 1 diabetes 
community on the assessment of potential diabetes biomarkers 
related to islet autoimmunity. 

The agreement encourages the FDA to further invest in the 
science base for regulatory decisions on botanical dietary supplements. 
The agreement also encourages FDA to further invest in research 
to identify potential drug interactions with botanical drugs. 

The agreement supports FDA’s proposal to require that all products 
marketed as dietary supplements be listed with FDA. The 
agreement believes that FDA’s authorities over products marketed 
as dietary supplements should be clarified to facilitate enforcement 
against unlawfully marketed products. 

The agreement directs the FDA, in consultation with the Committees, 
to provide a report 180 days after enactment of this Act 
on domestic and foreign manufacturing of drugs included on FDA’s 
list of Essential Medicines and Medical Countermeasures published 
in October 2020. 

The agreement encourages ongoing collaboration with patient 
stakeholders and the broad eczema community to address gaps and 
scientific knowledge and clarify the pathways for eczema therapies. 

The agreement is concerned about the proliferation of products 
marketed using standards of identity for dairy products that do not 
contain dairy ingredients. The agreement directs the FDA to implement 
an updated enforcement approach to enforce against dairy 
imitation products. 

The agreement is aware of the important contribution of the 
CFSAN Centers of Excellence (COE). The agreement encourages 
the FDA to continue to fully utilize the COEs. 

The agreement expects the FDA to provide outreach, training, 
and technical assistance to farmers and provides no less than the 
fiscal year 2022 level. The agreement also directs the FDA to continue 
working with small farms to clarify requirements for compliance 
with FSMA. 

The agreement remains concerned about potential consumer confusion 
over nutritional labeling requirements and guidelines for 
added sugar, for products such as honey and maple syrup. The 
agreement directs the FDA to continue working with impacted industries 
to ensure clear and appropriate labeling. 

The agreement understands that the FDA has approved new 
drug applications for opioids following completion of clinical trials 
using enriched enrollment, randomized, withdrawal (EERW) designs. 
The agreement directs the FDA to conduct a study to review 
EERW study designs. The agreement also encourages the FDA to 
consider expanding the scope of information requested on requiring 
fixed quantity blister packaging for certain opioids. 

The agreement commends the FDA for its continued efforts to 
approve cellular therapy drugs to treat cancer. The agreement 
urges the FDA to work with industry and the research community 
more broadly to continue enhancing its guidance and regulations 
concerning standardization of potency testing requirements for cellular 
therapies. This will expedite the advancement of novel cel



102 

lular therapies and accelerate delivery of medicines to patients 
with complex and unmet medical need. 

The agreement is concerned about the escalating cost of specialty 
cancer drugs and biologics. The agreement encourages the FDA to 
organize clinical trials, in collaboration with academic medical centers 
and other Federal agencies, of marketed cancer drugs and biologics 
to assess whether dosing frequency adjustments may reduce 
waste and/or toxicities of treatment without compromising efficacy. 

The agreement encourages the FDA to facilitate innovative and 
flexible regulatory approaches, including expedited programs under 
section 506, authorities that allow for genetically targeted platform 
technologies, gene expression biomarkers, novel statistical approaches, 
external controls and a benefit-risk approach to evaluating 
manufacturing process requirements. 

The agreement urges the FDA to develop clearer regulatory pathways 
for emerging aging treatments and to provide an update on 
its progress in the fiscal year 2024 congressional budget justification. 
The agreement also urges the FDA to increase support for 
regulatory science that can inform these pathways, including collaborations 
with the National Institutes of Health, industry, and 
academia on the discovery and validation of biomarkers. 

The agreement directs the FDA to address regulation of donor 
human milk and donor human milk derived products and banks. 

The agreement encourages the FDA to work to include no less 
than two expert members on each Advisory Committee when that 
Committee is reviewing a drug that has been designated as an Orphan 
Drug. The agreement directs FDA to report the percentage of 
recommendations made by Advisory Committees with respect to orphan 
drugs. 

The agreement is concerned with reports of positive drug tests, 
addiction, overdose, and death related to contaminated imported 
poppy seeds and directs the FDA to establish a maximum permissible 
threshold of opiate alkaloid content for poppy seeds. 

The agreement directs the FDA to work with glass packaging 
suppliers and pharmaceutical manufacturers to evaluate and promote 
streamlined approval requirements designed to expedite the 
adoption and use of innovative glass packaging technologies. 

The agreement supports FDA’s work to improve predictability of 
human and animal response to FDA regulated products. The agreement 
is encouraged by the agency’s efforts to support the qualification 
of non-animal approaches with the ISTAND pilot program. 

The agreement supports FDA’s efforts to confront the opioid crisis 
through the agency’s priority areas, including additional funding 
for International Mailing Facilities. Funds made available in 
this Act for FDA’s efforts at International Mail Facilities must 
focus on preventing controlled, counterfeit, or otherwise dangerous 
pharmaceuticals from entering the United States. Further, funds 
made available in this Act should prioritize cases in which importation 
poses a significant threat to public health. The FDA is directed 
to provide a report on products refused import at international 
mail facilities by classifying such products as controlled or non-controlled 
drugs, and further classifying controlled or non-controlled 
drugs as counterfeit, misbranded, or unapproved. 


103 

The agreement encourages the FDA to continue to focus on the 
unique role medical foods play in nutritional management. 

The agreement directs the FDA to issue final separate regulations 
in regard to medical gas as required by Public Law 115–31. 
Should the agency not issue final regulations by March 31, 2023, 
the agency shall submit a report to the Committees quarterly 
thereafter explaining the status of the rulemaking and reasons for 
delay. 

The agreement expects the FDA to continue to support collaborative 
research with universities and industry on the toxicology of 
nanotechnology products and processes in accordance with the 2021 
National Nanotechnology Initiative Strategic Plan. 

The agreement provides $2,000,000 to support and enhance the 
neurology drug program. The agreement urges FDA to use this 
funding to develop policies and guidance that keep pace with scientific 
discovery in these areas, particularly as they apply to the 
prevention and early detection of neurological disease. 

The agreement encourages FDA to establish a pilot program that 
will apply new tools to improve generic drug development, manufacturing, 
and quality. The program should be in collaboration with 
academic institutions. 

The agreement encourages FDA to invest in real-world evidence 
and prioritize further investments in pathogen reduction technologies 
to inform its decisions concerning blood donor deferral 
policies and the safety of the U.S. blood supply. 

The agreement encourages the FDA to fund Pediatric Device 
Consortia Grants at the authorized level in fiscal year 2023. 

The agreement is concerned that imported human food continues 
to have significantly higher pesticide violation rates than domestically 
produced food. The agreement encourages FDA to continue to 
partner with State inspection services and increase use of emerging 
technologies as well as treat products that are more likely to have 
pesticide violations with special attention. In the fiscal year 2023 
sampling plan, FDA is encouraged to increase sampling of imported 
products noted in its 2019 supplemental analysis as having higher 
rates of foreign violations compared to domestic violations, consistent 
with FDA’s risk-based approach to sampling. 

The agreement urges FDA to clarify the obligation of prescription 
drug and biological product sponsors with respect to promotional 
activities. 

The agreement supports FDA’s work to promote the domestic 
manufacturing of drug and biological products and urges the agency 
to increase efforts to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to 
adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that have the potential 
to improve product quality. 

The agreement encourages the FDA to increase funding for research 
into Vibrio illnesses associated with the consumption of raw 
molluscan shellfish, improve risk assessment models, and develop 
improved rapid detection methods for virulent Vibrio strains. 

The agreement urges the FDA to expedite its ongoing work with 
the lupus community to develop solutions to identified barriers that 
will accelerate development of new therapies. 

The food program’s recent missteps and delayed actions outlined 
in the Reagan-Udall Foundation report have revealed the serious 


104 

consequences of FDA continuing to operate with a fragmented organizational 
structure and lack of accountability. To better regulate 
food and improve the food program, the agreement encourages the 
FDA to strongly consider the report’s recommendations and develop 
a restructuring plan, that includes stakeholder engagement and 
input, that establishes and unifies all capacities of the food program. 


The agreement notes that the final rule for ‘‘Yogurt Standards of 
Identity’’ has been published and urges the FDA to promptly consider 
any application for a Temporary Marketing Permit on these 
issues. 

BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES 

The agreement provides $12,788,000 for Buildings and Facilities.

B contained in the Explanatory Statement regarding H.R. 
2617, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.1] 

DIVISION B—COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND 
RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2023 

The joint explanatory statement accompanying this division is 
approved and indicates congressional intent. Unless otherwise 
noted, the language set forth in House Report 117–395 (‘‘the House 
report’’) carries the same weight as language included in this joint 
explanatory statement and should be complied with unless specifically 
addressed to the contrary in this joint explanatory statement 
or the act. The explanatory statement, while repeating some language 
for emphasis, is not intended to negate the language referred 
to above unless expressly provided herein. In cases where the 
House report directs the submission of a report, such report is to 
be submitted to both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
(‘‘the Committees’’). 

Each department and agency funded in this act shall follow the 
directions set forth in this act and the accompanying explanatory 
statement and shall not reallocate resources or reorganize activities 
except as provided herein. Reprogramming procedures shall apply 
to: funds provided in this act; unobligated balances from previous 
appropriations acts that are available for obligation or expenditure 
in fiscal year 2023; and non-appropriated resources such as fee collections 
that are used to meet program requirements in fiscal year 
2023. These procedures are specified in section 505 of this act. 

Any reprogramming request shall include any out-year budgetary 
impacts and a separate accounting of program or mission impacts 
on estimated carryover funds. Any program, project, or activity 
cited in this explanatory statement, or in the House report and not 
changed by this act, shall be construed as the position of the Congress 
and shall not be subject to reductions or reprogramming 
without prior approval of the Committees. Further, any department 
or agency funded in this act that plans a reduction-in-force 
shall notify the Committees by letter no later than 30 days in advance 
of the date of any such planned personnel action. 

When a department or agency submits a reprogramming or 
transfer request to the Committees and does not receive identical 
responses, it shall be the responsibility of the department or agency 
seeking the reprogramming to reconcile the differences between the 
two bodies before proceeding. If reconciliation is not possible, the 
items in disagreement in the reprogramming or transfer request 
shall be considered unapproved. Departments and agencies shall

December 20, 2022 by Mr. Leahy of Vermont, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. 
The statement appears on page S7898 of Book I. 

(235) 


236 

not submit reprogramming notifications after July 1, 2023, except 
in extraordinary circumstances. Any such notification shall include 
a description of the extraordinary circumstances. 

In compliance with section 528 of this act, each department and 
agency funded in this act shall submit spending plans, signed by 
the respective department or agency head, for the Committees’ review 
not later than 45 days after the date of enactment of this act. 

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall conduct ongoing 
reviews of large National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) projects and major research equipment and facilities 
construction at the National Science Foundation, with reports to 
the Committees on a semiannual basis. The agencies shall provide 
access to all necessary data, as determined by GAO, in order for 
these reviews to be completed and provided to the Committees in 
a timely manner. 

The departments and agencies funded in this act are directed to 
submit reports by the deadlines detailed herein or to provide advance 
notification if there is sufficient reason why deadlines cannot 
be met, along with the expected date of submission. 

Some enduring reporting requirements from previous appropriations 
laws may no longer be necessary for congressional oversight 
purposes. In the interest of reducing government waste and expediting 
responses to current report mandates, each department or 
agency is invited to submit a list of reporting requirements that it 
considers outdated or no longer relevant for the review of the Committees. 
Any list submitted for review shall cite the original authority, 
as well as a justification for eliminating each reporting requirement. 


For fiscal year 2023, all agencies and departments funded in this 
act are directed to follow prior year direction adopted in Public Law 
116–93, on the following topics for this fiscal year: ‘‘Fighting Waste, 
Fraud, and Abuse,’’ ‘‘Federal Vehicle Fleet Management,’’ ‘‘Reducing 
Duplication and Improving Efficiencies,’’ ‘‘Reprogrammings, Reorganizations, 
and Relocations,’’ ‘‘Congressional Budget Justifications,’’ 
‘‘Reporting Requirements,’’ and ‘‘Reductions-in-Force.’’

other stakeholders to address some of the pressing issues that challenge 
economic development in distressed communities across the 
country. As in prior years, the agreement directs EDA to consider 
geographic equity in making all award decisions and to ensure that 
rural projects are adequately represented among those selected for 
funding. Any deviation of funds shall be subject to the procedures

projects that support outdoor recreation when consistent with a region’s 
Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy, as well as 
projects that promote innovation in communities and regions that 
have been adversely impacted by changes in the timber and pulp 
marketplaces and to support projects that help these communities 
develop related industries, including commercialization of new forest 
products using low-grade wood. 

Aeronautics.—The agreement encourages EDA to support communities 
looking to expand the presence of aeronautics-related industries. 


Technical Assistance.—EDA is encouraged to identify and provide 
technical assistance to eligible entities, consistent with the NATIVE 
Act (Public Law 114–221). 

Economic Adjustment Assistance.—EDA shall continue to follow 
direction contained in the joint explanatory statement accompanying 
division B of Public Law 116–260, in the paragraph entitled 
‘‘Economic Adjustment Assistance.’’ 

Assistance to Energy Transition Communities.—Within the funds 
provided for Assistance to Energy Transition Communities, the 
agreement provides $48,000,000 for assistance to coal communities, 
and affirms the House language on this topic. Also within Assistance 
to Energy Transition Communities, the agreement provides 
$16,500,000 for assistance to nuclear power plant closure communities 
and $4,500,000 for assistance to biomass power plant closure 
communities. 

Regional Innovation Program (RIP).—The agreement provides

Of this amount, no less than $40,000,000 shall be for the i6 Challenge 
and no less than $8,000,000 shall be for Seed Fund Support. 


239 

EDA shall continue to ensure that RIP awards go to multiple 
grantees in diverse geographic areas and increase its focus on organizations 
and States that have not previously received funding 
from the program. Within funds provided for RIP, EDA shall award 
not less than 40 percent of grants to support rural communities. 
Additionally, EDA is directed to provide in its fiscal year 2023 
spending plan a detailed justification for any funding that is intended 
to be used to support a B2S Industry Challenge in fiscal 
year 2023. EDA shall continue to ensure that RIP awards go to 
multiple grantees in multiple and diverse geographic areas, including 
an increased focus on organizations and States, and regions 
within States, that have not previously received funding from the 
program. Furthermore, within funds provided for RIP, EDA shall 
award not less than 40 percent of grants to support rural communities. 


Persistent Poverty.—The agreement retains the House definition 
of the term ‘‘high poverty area.’’ In lieu of the reporting requirement 
contained in the House report the agreement directs the Department, 
in its fiscal year 2024 budget request, to provide to the 
Committees on Appropriations a plan for developing and implementing 
additional measures to increase the share of investments 
from all EDA programs in persistent poverty counties, high-poverty 
areas, and any other impoverished communities that EDA determines 
to be appropriate areas to target. The agreement also directs 
EDA to explain, in the case of any EDA program for which at least 
10 percent of the funds allocated in fiscal year 2022 were not allocated 
to persistent poverty counties, why such benchmark was unable 
to be met and what steps are being taken to meet it in fiscal 
year 2023. 

Coordinating Federal Resources.—The agreement encourages 
EDA to improve collaboration with the Department of Housing and

to respond to the merits of the petition within 30 days of enactment 
of this act. Further, NOAA is encouraged to consider revising 
the Linden and Pace models and Decision Support Tool using 
‘‘most reasonably certain to occur’’ rather than ‘‘worst case’’ scenarios 
and assumptions and to incorporate whale behavior and 
data from broader (and more representative) time periods to more 
accurately predict future NARW populations before issuing any 
new proposed or final regulations. 

NOAA shall continue to work with Canada to develop risk reduction 
measures that are comparable in effectiveness for both vessels 


260 

and fisheries, and to incorporate Canadian fishery measures, Canadian 
vessel restrictions, and U.S. vessel restrictions into the evaluations 
under the Conservation Framework. NOAA is also encouraged 
to improve regional management efforts by including pertinent 
States and interstate bodies in bilateral engagements with 
Canadian officials regarding coordinated efforts to enhance NARW 
recovery. NOAA is further encouraged to work with Canadian and 
State fisheries officials to explore the possibility of developing an 
agreement that provides for cooperative fisheries management of 
the Gulf of Maine.

279 

velop a dedicated high performance computing facility consistent 
with prior year direction adopted in Public Law 117–103. 

Maximizing Value of Environmental Observations.—The agreement 
notes concern that too little value is being extracted from the 
plethora of environmental observations collected and/or purchased 
by NOAA to inform weather, climate, and ecosystem models that 
then generate forecasts and predictions. Therefore, within the increase 
provided for Research Supercomputing/CCRI, no less than 
$5,000,000 is to develop artificial intelligence systems and optimization 
of software to support preprocessing of dense observation 
datasets so extraction of the most useful information will be included 
in data assimilation for model initialization. 

Research Acquisitions and Management.—The agreement provides 
$30,000,000 for a demonstration system for a dual polarization 
Phased Array Radar (PAR) to assess advanced techniques to 
meet NOAA’s future weather radar requirements and replace the 
current NEXRAD system starting in the 2030s. The agreement also 
encourages NOAA to engage with the weather industry to develop 
a charge for the SAB to study options for procuring or leasing assets 
as well as acquiring commercial data to help satisfy NOAA’s 
next generation radar needs. 

Observations.—The agreement provides the requested amount for 
the ASOS Service Life Extension Program. 

Integrated Water Prediction (IWP).—The agreement provides no 
less than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level for Central Processing 
under NWS PAC, which includes not less than $5,739,000 to procure 
operational high performance computing resources to enable 
modeling improvements associated with the IWP initiative, consistent 
with direction adopted in Public Law 117–103. 

NWS Facilities.—Within 270 days of enactment of this act, 
NOAA is directed to provide the Committees with an updated NWS 
Facilities Strategic Plan, including an ordered list of the highest 
priority facilities and associated upgrade or lease improvement 
costs. 

NESDIS Budget Reorganization.—The agreement approves the 
technical transfers from Projects, Planning, and Analysis to Space 
Weather Next and Common Ground Services. In addition, as satellites 
are launched and move from the construction phase into operations, 
NOAA is encouraged to continue to propose technical 
transfers of funding from PAC to ORF as part of subsequent budget 
requests. 

Geostationary Extended Observations (GeoXO).—The agreement 
provides $285,000,000 for GeoXO, which is the amount required to 
maintain the current program schedule in fiscal year 2023, including 
to complete Phase A formulation studies, to complete the Department 
of Commerce Acquisition Milestone 2, and to award the 
imager development contract. NOAA is encouraged to partner with 
NASA on the Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer 
(GLIMR) mission to de-risk the ocean color instrument, as 
appropriate, for the GeoXO program. Before initiating procurement 
activities for other instruments and the spacecraft, NOAA shall 
provide the Committees with the report about the user needs and 
requirements and estimated lifecycle costs of the next generation of 
NOAA flagship weather satellites requested in the joint explana



280 

tory statement accompanying Public Law 117–103. The requested 
report shall include how the proposed suite of GeoXO instruments 
will improve NOAA’s weather mission. 

Systems/Services Architecture and Engineering.—The agreement 
provides an increase of $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted 
level for the Commercial Data Purchase and Commercial 
Weather Data Pilot programs, which is to be divided between the 
two programs as deemed appropriate. Within these funds and consistent 
with direction from the Promoting Research and Observations 
of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow 
(PROSWIFT) Act (Public Law 116–181), the agreement provides up 
to $5,000,000 for a Commercial Space Weather Data Pilot. 

The agreement notes that NOAA’s current schedule of conducting 
commercial weather data solicitations every 2 years may have the 
unintended consequence of limiting new partnerships with the 
quickly evolving commercial sector. NOAA shall ensure that funds 
provided for commercial data purchases are used in a manner that 
maximizes competition by conducting solicitations for new qualified 
commercial data market entrants on an annual or more frequent 
basis. 

NOAA Construction.—The agreement provides $90,000,000 for 
NOAA’s highest priority facilities construction, repair, and deferred 
maintenance requirements, which is an increase of $31,000,000 
above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. NOAA shall immediately 
inform the Committees if there are any significant schedule delays 
or project cost increases. Further, 30 days before obligating any 
funds, NOAA shall submit a report detailing how the funds will be 
expended and an explanation of why these projects were 
prioritized. 

The agreement reiterates direction adopted by Public Law 117– 
103 for NOAA to establish a five-year budget framework to address 
regional facility modernization planning and redevelopment of priority 
sites, particularly those in the Northwest, Northeast, and 
Southeast regions. 

Vessel Recapitalization and Construction.—The agreement reaffirms 
its support for NOAA’s Fleet Recapitalization Plan by providing 
$20,000,000 for Vessel Recapitalization and Construction 
above the requested level. The agreement expects that NOAA will 
execute a contract on two new Class B vessels in fiscal year 2023 
and that NOAA’s new vessels will facilitate the reduction of gaps 
in mission coverage as current ships are decommissioned. The 
agreement notes that the current procurement plan for Class C 
vessels would result in a mission gap for fisheries surveys starting 
in 2027. Therefore, NOAA is encouraged to begin design and acquisition 
of the Class C vessels. 

Mission Requirement Costs.—NOAA shall, in all future budget 
submissions to Congress, detail any unfunded mission requirement 
costs, particularly those that are necessary to maintain the optimal 
operational tempo of NOAA’s assets and posture of NOAA facilities. 

PACIFIC COASTAL SALMON RECOVERY 

The agreement includes $65,000,000 for the Pacific Coastal 
Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF) and directs that funds will be 
available to Tribes without a matching requirement. NOAA is di



281 

rected to report on how its current priorities meet the intent of the 
PCSRF to support the recovery and protection of all declining salmon 
stocks.

health emergencies and a timeline to implement any corrective action 
plans. This report shall also include agency corrective actions 
that BOP has undertaken or plans to undertake to improve and 
modernize emergency preparedness plans, as they relate to natural 
disasters, extreme weather, and public health emergencies and a 
timeline to implement any corrective action plans. 

Swift-Certain-Fair (SCF) Model in the Federal Prison System.— 
The SCF model has proven to be an effective deterrent for incarcerated 
populations in State and local corrections settings. BOP is directed

BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES 

The agreement includes $290,000,000 for the construction, acquisition, 
modernization, maintenance, and repair of prison and detention 
facilities housing Federal inmates, of which $182,000,000 is included 
under this heading in division N. BOP shall proceed with 
ongoing planned and associated new construction efforts to meet 
projected capacity requirements, as identified in its monthly status 
of construction reports to the Committees. BOP is directed to continue 
to provide such reports monthly, along with notifications and 
explanations of any deviation from construction and activation 
schedules, and any planned adjustments or corrective actions. 

Modernization and Repair (M&R) of Existing Facilities.—BOP is 
expected to apply the funding to reduce its longstanding M&R 
backlog and is directed to prioritize funding for repairs that protect 
life and safety. BOP shall continue to provide monthly status of 
construction reports and notify the Committees of any changes reflected 
in those reports. House language regarding facilities with 
geological or seismological deficiencies is not adopted. 

LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, FEDERAL PRISON 
INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED 

The agreement includes a limitation on administrative expenses 
of $2,700,000 for Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated. 

STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES 

In total, the agreement includes $4,424,485,000 for State and 
local law enforcement and crime prevention programs. This amount 
includes $133,000,000 scored as mandatory for Public Safety Officer 
Benefits. 

For fiscal year 2023, the Department is directed to continue following 
the directives in the joint explanatory statement accompanying 
Public Law 117–103 on the following topics: ‘‘Management 
and Administration Expenses,’’ ‘‘Grant Funding Set-Asides,’’ ‘‘DOJ 
Grant Oversight,’’ ‘‘Grant Funds for Rural Areas,’’ ‘‘Science Advisory 
Board,’’ ‘‘Post-Conviction Relief for Trafficking Victims,’’ and 
‘‘Sexual Abuse Services in Detention Hotline.’’ The Department 
shall submit updated reports consistent with the directives. The 
Department is further directed to submit an annual report on 
grant programs that have not received a sufficient number of qualified 
applicants. 

Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.—The agreement recognizes 
that Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, or 
‘‘BSCA’’, (Public Law 117–159) on June 25, 2022, which included 
$1,600,000,000 in supplemental appropriations for the Department 
beginning in fiscal year 2022 and available through 2026. Of this 
amount $1,500,000,000 was included for existing grant programs 
including STOP School Violence, the Community Violence Intervention 
and Prevention Initiative, and the National Criminal Records 
History Improvement Program (NCHIP), as well as a new Byrne 
State-Crisis Intervention program. For fiscal year 2023, in addition 
to the funds made available for these programs in this Act, the 
agreement expects that funding for these programs will be supplemented 
through the funds provided in the BSCA pursuant to the 


300 

spend plan submitted to the Committees on August 9, 2022. Further, 
the agreement directs the Department to continue following 
the directives in the joint explanatory statement accompanying 
Public Law 117–103 under the heading ‘‘STOP School Violence 
Act.’’ 

The agreement acknowledges that the Fix NICS Act (Public Law 
115–141) allows the Attorney General to waive the National Criminal 
History Improvement Program (NCHIP) match for States that 
are in compliance with the implementation plan required under 
Section 107 of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 
(Public Law 110–180). The Department is directed to remind States 
of the possibility of this waiver in guidance or technical assistance 
regarding this grant program. Further, the Department is urged to 
ensure that grants made under the NCHIP can be made available 
for supporting States in the planning and the implementation of 
records systems that allow for the efficient expungement or sealing 
of qualifying criminal history records without requiring those eligible 
to apply. 

Tribal Grants and Victim Assistance.—The agreement provides a 
total of $129,000,000 in discretionary grant funding for Tribes as 
follows: $60,000,000 within the Office of Justice (OJP) for Tribal 
assistance; $17,000,000 for a Tribal youth program within the Office 
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP); 
$34,000,000 for Tribal resources and $4,000,000 for a Tribal Access 
Program within the COPS Office; and $11,000,000 for a special domestic 
violence criminal jurisdiction program and $3,000,000 for a 
Special Assistant U.S. Attorney on Tribal land program within the 
OVW. In addition, a total of $95,000,000 is provided to Tribal governments 
and Tribal coalitions in OVC funding as part of set-
asides determined by program statute. For fiscal year 2023, the Department 
is directed to continue following the directives and reporting 
requirements in the joint explanatory statement accompanying 
Public Law 116–260 for ‘‘Tribal Grants and Victim Assistance.’’

programs, including Services, Training, Officers, and Prosecutors 
(STOP) Grants and Sexual Assault Services Program grants, outline 
set-asides for Tribal governments and coalitions, culturally 
specific community-based organizations, and organizations providing 
services to underserved populations. These set-asides provide 
a total of $90,098,535 for fiscal year 2023, with $66,263,535 
for Tribal governments and coalitions, $17,425,000 for culturally 
specific organizations, and $6,410,000 to meet the needs of under-
served populations. OVW shall ensure that the full amounts provided

Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, including the right to 
receive medical forensic examinations, the preservation of evidence 
collection kits, and access to information resulting from such kits, 
prior notification of any destruction or disposal of evidence collection 
kits, and the right to request further preservation of any such 
kit. The Department is further directed to submit its plan for administering 
this program, including the grant solicitation process, 
as part of the fiscal year 2023 spend plan. Within one year of the 
date of enactment of this act, DOJ shall provide a report to the 
Committees on the number of States that have applied for grants, 


302 

the number of awards made and the respective award amounts, 
and the level of unmet demand for this program. 

Victim Services on Campus.—The agreement includes $2,000,000 
for a demonstration program to expand access to holistic assault 
services on college campuses with the intent to establish a best 
practices guide for other institutions to implement. The Department 
should partner with an accredited post-secondary institution 
in the greater Gulf Coast region that has expertise in this area, including 
both an established campus-based sexual assault nurse examiner 
program and an established campus-based multidisciplinary 
sexual assault response team, affiliation agreements with 
both an acute care hospital-based sexual assault program as well 
as a community-based sexual assault victim service provider, and 
an existing infrastructure to provide evidence and simulation-based 
training and education to multidisciplinary team members.

Justice Statistics (BJS).—Directives under the Foundations for Evi-
dence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–435) (‘‘Evidence 
Act’’) and other congressionally-requested initiatives have 
given NIJ and BJS additional responsibilities and obligations. The 
agreement directs OJP to conduct a full assessment of the impact 
on NIJ and BJS regarding the Evidence Act and other congressionally-
requested initiatives, including their ability to keep pace with 
cutting-edge scientific practices and emerging policy needs. OJP is 
further directed to develop a forward-looking vision for strengthening 
these agencies’ abilities to respond nimbly to and anticipate 
future needs and scientific developments over the next decade and 


303 

identify the resources needed to achieve this vision. These activities 
should, where possible, be integrated into OJP’s implementation of 
the Evidence Act. OJP shall provide an update to the Committees 
on its progress within 180 days of the date of enactment of this act. 

Research on Violence Against Women.—In addition to $3,500,000 
transferred from the OVW for research and evaluation on violence 
against women and Indian women, the agreement provides 
$1,000,000 for NIJ to research domestic violence radicalization and 
$1,000,000 for research on violence against Native Americans, 
Alaska Natives and other Indigenous communities at extraction 
sites. NIJ is encouraged to undertake additional research regarding 
domestic violence homicide prevention.

$1,200,000 for NIJ to administer a competitive grant to an accredited 
research university for a study covering the purposes of the solicitation 
for opportunity number O–NIJ–2022–171191 in the K–12 
education system to understand the scope, characteristics, and outcomes 
of these incidents. 

Study on Law Enforcement Responses to Opioid Overdoses.—The 
agreement provides $1,000,000 for NIJ to administer a competitive 
grant to an accredited research university for a study regarding 
law enforcement’s responses to opioid overdoses. The study shall 
take into account law enforcement’s responses with linked community 
agencies and also include specific practices utilized to ensure 
the well-being, assessment, and protection of children in these situations. 


In lieu of House report language regarding the ‘‘Community Oriented 
Policing Services (COPS) Hiring Program’’ the agreement directs 
the Department to report to the Committees, no later than 
180 days after the enactment of this act, on the feasibility of assessing 
State and local law enforcement pay compared to the cost 
of living in the jurisdiction for which they serve. The agreement encourages 
the Department to include in its report any challenges or 
limitations in performing this type of survey as well as funding 
that would be required to perform this work.

that Byrne-JAG funding may not be made available for luxury 
items, real estate, or construction projects. Lastly, the agreement 
urges Byrne-JAG recipients to offer meaningful language access to 
applicable programs and services for individuals with limited 
English proficiency, where practicable. The Department shall submit 
updated reports consistent with the directives. 

For fiscal year 2023, the Department is directed to continue following 
the directives in the joint explanatory statement accompanying 
Public Law 117–103 on the following topics: ‘‘Officer Training 
on Responding to People with Mental Illness or Disabilities,’’ 
‘‘Capital Litigation Improvement and Wrongful Conviction Review,’’

Intervention and Prevention Initiative (CVIPI),’’ and ‘‘Forensic 
Ballistics and Higher Education.’’ 

The agreement adopts and reinforces language in House Report 
117–395 under the heading ‘‘Rapid DNA.’’ 

National Center on Restorative Justice.—Of the $3,000,000 provided 
in the agreement for this program, no less than $2,500,000 
shall be used to continue a partnership with an accredited university 
of higher education and/or law school for the purposes of supporting 
a National Center on Restorative Justice (the ‘‘Center’’) to 
educate and train the next generation of justice leaders. The Center 
shall also continue to support research focusing on how best to 
provide direct services to address social inequities, such as simultaneous 
access to substance abuse treatment and higher education. 
Further, the Center will expand educational opportunities for those 
under sentence and in a court-supervised substance abuse program, 
and, through research and evaluation, the Center will disseminate 
reports on the impact of attitudes, recidivism, and costs 
of the educational initiatives. Up to $500,000 may be used to support 
microgrants to innovative restorative justice projects in communities 
across the country. 

Drug Data Research Center to Combat Opioid Abuse.—The agreement 
provides $4,000,000 for the continuation of a national drug 
data research center to combat opioid abuse that is at an accredited 
institution of higher education that conducts research on 
opioids, has existing expertise in databases, statistics, and geographic 
information systems, and has an established network of 
subject and behavioral matter experts. 

Virtual Training.—The agreement provides $5,000,000 for OJP 
to partner with no fewer than two universities in a joint effort to 
develop a training regime with artificial intelligence and virtual reality. 



306 

Internet of Things Capabilities Database.—The agreement provides 
$2,000,000 for a separate competitive grant program in order 
to provide four awards of not less than $500,000 each for institutions 
of higher learning that provide training in computer forensics 
and digital investigation to develop a database on Internet of 
Things device capabilities and to build and execute training modules 
for law enforcement. 

Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) Training Program 
Grants.—The Department is encouraged to prioritize rural, Tribal, 
underserved communities, and urban areas without full-time coverage 
for this program. Within the amount provided for Sexual Assault 
Forensic Exam Program, $2,000,000 shall be to establish regional 
SANE training programs, which are identified as establishing 
a level of excellence in forensic nursing and are qualified to 
prepare current and future sexual assault nurse examiners/forensic 
nurse examiners to be profession-ready and meet the applicable 
State certification and licensure requirements. These programs 
shall provide training and supervision to nurses with the purpose 
of increasing sexual assault forensic nurse capacity in rural areas, 
and in support of population-specific programs and hospitals including, 
but not limited to, underserved or historically underfunded 
communities. Entities receiving these funds shall promote best 
practices in forensic nursing throughout a region, while continuing 
to research and develop the highest standards of care. 

Sexual Assault Kit Initiative.—The Department should maximize 
the results of investments in sexual assault kit (SAK) testing 
through continued research to identify best practices for State, 
local, and Tribal jurisdictions in handling the myriad issues that 
arise from perpetrator identification, such as victim notification, investigation, 
prosecution, documentation, forensic advancements, 
inter-jurisdiction sharing, and tracking. The Department should 
also fund efforts to support cross-jurisdiction and cross-site data 
sharing to identify and pursue repeat offenders operating in multiple 
jurisdictions. Finally, the Department should work further to 
validate the extensive cost savings that result from the prevention 
of future offenses as a result of SAK testing. The Department is directed 
to support efforts that advance these objectives and BJA is 
directed to issue a report within one year of the date of enactment 
of this act on the number of partially tested kits. 

Assessing Reentry Impacts on Local Communities.—When awarding 
Second Chance Act grants, OJP shall consider the impact of reentry 
of prisoners on communities in which a disproportionate 
number of individuals reside upon release from incarceration. OJP 
shall assess the reentry burdens borne by local communities and 
local law enforcement agencies, review the resources available in 
such communities to support successful reentry and the extent to 
which those resources are used effectively, and make recommendations 
to strengthen the resources in such communities that are 
available to support successful reentry and to lessen the burden 
placed on such communities by the need to support reentry. 

Project HOPE Institute.—The agreement provides $5,000,000 for 
Project HOPE, of which not less than $500,000 shall be to continue 
the Project HOPE Institute to provide training, technical assistance, 
and best practices for jurisdictions replicating the HOPE 


307 

model. BJA shall award grants to support both existing Project 
HOPE models and new jurisdictions. 

Veterans Treatment Courts.—OJP is directed to keep the Committees 
apprised of the status of the evaluation to be completed 
under the NIJ solicitation ‘‘NIJ Multisite Impact and Cost-Efficiency 
Evaluation of Veterans Treatment Courts, Fiscal Year 
2022.’’ BJA is urged to promote awareness of veterans treatment 
court funding opportunities within State court systems. OJP shall 
report, within 180 days of the enactment of this act, on these efforts, 
including efforts to administer the program through a dedicated 
solicitation. 

Keep Young Athletes Safe Act.—The agreement provides 
$2,500,000 for a competitive grant program to safeguard young athletes 
against abuse in sports, including emotional, physical, and 
sexual abuse. The Department is directed to ensure that survivors’ 
lived experiences are incorporated as part of new curriculum, training 
materials, and technical assistance, including a better understanding 
of how and when to report. Any recommendations regarding 
youth athletes stemming from the work and reporting by the 
Commission on the State of U.S. Olympics and Paralympics shall 
be incorporated into this program. 

Byrne Discretionary Community Project Grants/Byrne Discretionary 
Grants (‘‘projects’’).—The agreement provides $229,551,000 
for projects to prevent crime, improve the criminal justice system, 
provide victim services, and for other related activities. The accompanying

[CLERK’S NOTE.—Reproduced below is the material relating to division 
C contained in the Explanatory Statement regarding H.R. 
2617, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.1] 

DIVISION C—DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2023 

The following is an explanation of the effects of this Act, which 
makes appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 
2023. The joint explanatory statement accompanying this division 
is approved and indicates congressional intent. Unless otherwise 
noted, the language set forth in House Report 117–388 carries the 
same weight as language included in this joint explanatory statement 
and should be complied with unless specifically addressed to 
the contrary in this joint explanatory statement. While some language 
is repeated for emphasis, it is not intended to negate the language 
referred to above unless expressly provided herein. 

DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY 

For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), as amended by the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 
1987 (Public Law 100–119), and by the Budget Enforcement Act of 
1990 (Public Law 101–508), the terms ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ 
for appropriations contained in this Act shall be defined as the 
most specific level of budget items identified in the Department of 
Defense Appropriations Act, 2023, the related classified annexes 
and Committee reports, and the P–1 and R–1 budget justification 
documents as subsequently modified by congressional action. 

The following exception to the above definition shall apply: the 
military personnel and the operation and maintenance accounts, 
for which the term ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ is defined as the 
appropriations accounts contained in the Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act. 

At the time the President submits the Budget for fiscal year 
2024, the Secretary of Defense is directed to transmit to the congressional 
defense committees budget justification documents to be 
known as the M–1 and O–1, which shall identify, at the budget activity, 
activity group, and sub-activity group level, the amounts requested 
by the President to be appropriated to the Department of 
Defense for military personnel and operation and maintenance in 
any budget request, or amended budget request, for fiscal year 
2024. 

1 This Explanatory Statement was submitted for printing in the Congressional Record on 
December 20, 2022 by Mr. Leahy of Vermont, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. 
The statement appears on page S8029 of Book I.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE 

The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming 
guidance for acquisition accounts as specified in the 
report accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense 
Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110– 
279). The dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall be 
$10,000,000 for military personnel; operation and maintenance; 
procurement; and research, development, test and evaluation. 

Additionally, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed 
to continue to provide the congressional defense committees 
annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II and quarterly, 
spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-
wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III 
and IV shall comply with guidance specified in the explanatory 
statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations 
Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation 
that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, 
development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These 
thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value 
as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value 
of transfers into or out of a military personnel (M–1); an operation 
and maintenance (O–1); a procurement (P–1); or a research, development, 
test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified 
threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addition, 
guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming 
procedures for congressional special interest items are established 
elsewhere in this statement. 

CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS 

Items for which additional funds have been provided or items for 
which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the project level 
tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in 
this report are congressional special interest items for the purpose 
of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these 
items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, 
as specifically addressed in the Committee report. 

REVISED ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS 

The agreement provides additional funding to offset cost factors 
that have increased since the formulation of the fiscal year 2023 
President’s budget request. This includes $1,752,375,000 for higher 
than planned housing, subsistence and other expenses for military 
personnel; $841,892,000 for higher costs for utilities and daycare; 
over $1,000,000,000 for acquisition programs; $209,615,000 to offset 
price increases for patrons at the commissaries; $400,000,000 for 
higher costs for the Defense Health Program; as well as 
$3,734,000,000 for higher fuel costs. It is directed that the additional 
funding shall be applied to incremental costs due to increased 
inflation or other pricing indexes and shall not be used to 
address program baseline shortfalls or to fund other unforeseen requirements. 
The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is di



495 

rected to continue working with the congressional defense committees 
to refine pricing shortfall estimates caused by revised economic 
assumptions through the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. 
Further, it is directed that none of these additional funds may be 
obligated or expended until 30 days after the Under Secretary of 
Defense (Comptroller) provides an execution plan to the congressional 
defense committees. 

CLASSIFIED ANNEX 

Adjustments to the classified programs are addressed in the classified 
annex accompanying this report. 

FUNDING INCREASES 

The funding increases outlined in the tables for each appropriation 
account shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated 
in the tables. 

COMPETITION FOR CONGRESSIONAL INCREASES 

Funding increases outlined in the tables for each appropriation 
account shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated 
in the tables titled Explanation of Project Level Adjustments. Except 
for projects contained in the table titled Community Project 
Funding, funding increases shall be competitively awarded, or provided 
to programs that have received competitive awards in the 
past. 

COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING 

The agreement directs the Secretary of Defense to ensure that all 
Community Project Funding is awarded to its intended recipients. 

APPROPRIATIONS FOR DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE-IDENTIFIED 
UNFUNDED REQUIREMENTS 

In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 222(a), the military services and 
combatant commands submitted to the congressional defense committees 
unfunded mission requirements in excess of 
$19,000,000,000 with submission of the fiscal year 2023 President’s 
budget. The agreement includes additional appropriations in fiscal 
year 2023 to address these shortfalls, as identified in the tables of 
Explanation of Project Level Adjustments in this explanatory statement. 
As previously stated, there are concerns about instances 
where appropriations for unfunded requirements remained unobligated 
until proposed for realignment. While it is understandable 
that requirements evolve and associated funding requirements 
change during execution of the budget, such unexecuted appropriations 
suggest that additional details regarding the execution of appropriations 
provided specifically for unfunded requirements identified 
by the Department of Defense is warranted. Therefore, direction 
included in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying 
the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2022, is reiterated, 
and it is directed that any submission of unfunded requirements by 
the military services, defense agencies, and combatant commands 
with the fiscal year 2024 President’s budget be accompanied by updated 
requirements and programmatic and execution plans for un



496 

funded requirements that received appropriations in fiscal year 
2023. Further, the Assistant Secretaries (Financial Management 
and Comptroller) for the Air Force, Navy, and Army are directed 
to incorporate in the congressional budget brief templates distinct 
programmatic and execution data for appropriations provided in 
the previous three fiscal years for unfunded requirements pertaining 
to the program/effort. 

CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION 

In March 2020, the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence 
and Security issued Instruction 5200.48, which outlines the Department’s 
policies on content that it deems controlled unclassified information 
(CUI). It is understood that these policies are intended 
to safeguard national security and ensure that sensitive but unclassified 
Department of Defense information is not revealed to adversaries. 
However, while common sense security practices are supported, 
there is concern that the extensive use of CUI will result 
in less transparency, accountability, and congressional oversight. 
Therefore, the Deputy Secretary of Defense is directed to review 
the current usage of CUI to ensure its appropriate application, and 
to brief the congressional defense committees not later than 30 
days after the enactment of this Act on the findings of this review. 
As appropriate, the briefing may be provided in an unclassified format 
with a classified annex. 

NAVY AND MARINE CORPS AVIATION MISHAPS 

The number of Navy and Marine Corps aviation mishaps that 
have occurred in the current calendar year, some of which have resulted 
in the tragic loss of life of sailors and Marines, is concerning. 
The Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine 
Corps are directed to brief the findings of the accident review 
boards on the various mishaps to the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of 
this Act. The agreement encourages Service leadership to focus on 
finding common causes that apply to both the Navy and Marine 
Corps aviation units and their missions. 

REFORMS, RE–PRIORITIZATIONS, AND RETIREMENTS EXHIBIT 

The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue 
to refine the ‘‘Reforms, Re-prioritizations, and Retirements’’ 
budget exhibit, to include budget line item details, and to submit 
the Defense Operation and Maintenance overview book at the same 
time as the detailed justification books. 

HOMELAND DEFENSE RADAR—HAWAII 

The agreement directs the Director of the Missile Defense Agency, 
in consultation with the Commander of United States Indo-Pacific 
Command, to provide quarterly updates to the congressional 
defense committees on the status of the Homeland Defense 
Radar—Hawaii production and location siting, as well as current 
and evolving threats in the region. These updates shall be provided 
at the unclassified and classified level as required. 


497 

DEFENSE OF GUAM 

The Director, Missile Defense Agency, in coordination with the 
Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, is directed to provide 
a quarterly update to the congressional defense committees on the 
mission to support the Defense of Guam. The update shall include: 
the status of environmental impact statements and site surveys required 
to support placement of weapons systems supporting the 
Defense of Guam, the upgrades to Guam’s infrastructure required 
to support the mission, acquisition schedules of anticipated weapons 
systems and corresponding deployment schedules of such systems, 
manning requirements for the Defense of Guam mission, and 
obligation and expenditure data on all funding related to the Defense 
of Guam. These updates shall be provided at an unclassified 
and classified level as required. 

COMPLETE AND TIMELY FINANCIAL REPORTING 

The agreement directs the Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) 
to provide the congressional defense committees, not later 
than 60 days after the enactment of this Act, a plan for delivery 
of comprehensive obligation and execution data, including expenditure 
data for funds with a tenure longer than one year. 

JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER 

In July 2022, the Department of Defense announced a contract 
for F–35 Joint Strike Fighters (JSF) covering production lots 15 
through 17, corresponding to fiscal years 2021 through 2023. This 
contract encompasses 230 United States aircraft previously appropriated 
by Congress or requested in the fiscal year 2023 President’s 
budget request. Due to multiple factors, the cost of this contract exceeds 
available and requested funds by $1,825,600,000 once all relevant 
factors are considered, putting 19 aircraft at risk of being 
lost. Through a combination of congressional increases and excess 
funds transferred from elsewhere within the JSF program, the 
agreement provides resources to cover this shortfall, allowing for 
the restoration of all 19 at-risk aircraft, including 11 F–35A, one 
F–35B, and seven F–35C aircraft in fiscal year 2023 and prior 
years. The Program Executive Officer (PEO), F–35 Joint Program 
Office (JPO) is directed to report to the congressional defense committees, 
not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, on 
how these additional funds will be applied to the lot 15–17 contract. 


In addition, it is noted that development and test activities on 
the critical path for the Block 4 and TR–3 capability upgrades continue 
to experience repeated delays and are jeopardizing the current 
timeline for planned integration into lot 15 aircraft. The agreement 
therefore directs the PEO, F–35 JPO to submit a report to 
the congressional defense committees providing an updated assessment 
of the Block 4 and TR–3 development programs, to include 
an assessment of the critical paths to lot 15 integration and retrofit 
installation, not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act 
and written notification following each subsequent breach in 
timeline for those activities identified along the critical path. 


498 

BUDGET JUSTIFICATION DOCUMENTATION OF OVERSEAS OPERATIONS 

FUNDING 

Section 8077 of H.R. 8236 directed specific details be included in 
separate budget justification documents for cost of the United 
States Armed Forces’ participation in contingency operations for 
the Military Personnel accounts; the Operation and Maintenance 
accounts; the Procurement accounts; and the Research, Development, 
Test, and Evaluation accounts. The agreement does not include 
this provision. It is acknowledged that creating base budget 
justification books and a separate Overseas Operations Appendix is 
not only an administrative burden, but may confuse the process, 
with some stakeholders not being aware that the Appendix is a 
subset of the baseline submission. 

In lieu of a general provision prescribing the formulation of the 
budget justification documents, the agreement directs the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Assistant Secretaries of 
the Army, Navy, and Air Force (Financial Management and Comptroller) 
to work together with the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees to develop clear guidance on how to account for both 
baseline and contingency operations funding in the budget request 
exhibits for all appropriations. Comptrollers are further directed to 
begin discussions not later than 45 days after the enactment of this 
Act and for the updated exhibits to be included in the justification 
materials with the fiscal year 2025 President’s budget request. 

TITLE I—MILITARY PERSONNEL 

The agreement provides $172,708,964,000 in Title I, Military 
Personnel.

is directed to provide the Department of Defense Acquisition Workforce 
Development Account annual report to the congressional defense 
committees not later than 30 days after submission of the fis



579 

cal year 2024 President’s budget request. Further, as in previous 
years, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and 
Sustainment is directed to provide the congressional defense committees, 
with the fiscal year 2024 President’s budget request, additional 
details regarding total funding for the acquisition workforce 
by funding category and specific appropriations accounts in the future 
years defense program, to include an explanation of changes 
from prior years’ submissions. 

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ACQUISITION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT 
ACCOUNT REPROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS 

The Secretary of Defense is directed to follow reprogramming 
guidance for the Department of Defense Acquisition Workforce Development 
Account (DAWDA) consistent with reprogramming guidance 
for acquisition accounts detailed elsewhere in this joint explanatory 
statement. The dollar threshold for reprogramming 
DAWDA funds remains $10,000,000. 

TITLE III—PROCUREMENT 

The agreement provides $162,241,330,000 in Title III, Procurement, 
as follows: 


580 



581 

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS 

The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming 
guidance as specified in the report accompanying the 
House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for 
Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar 
threshold for reprogramming funds shall be $10,000,000 for procurement 
and research, development, test and evaluation. 

Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to 
continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly, 
spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-
wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III 
and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory 
statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations 
Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation 
that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, 
development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These 
thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value 
as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value 
of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research, development, 
test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified threshold, 
the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval reprogramming 
to the congressional defense committees. In addition, 
guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming procedures 
for congressional special interest items are established 
elsewhere in this statement. 

FUNDING INCREASES 

The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided 
only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. Additional 
guidance is provided in the overview of this explanatory statement. 

PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS 

Items for which additional funds have been recommended or 
items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the 
project level tables detailing recommended adjustments or in paragraphs 
using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the joint explanatory 
statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose 
of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of 
these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated 
amount, as specifically addressed elsewhere in the joint explanatory 
statement. 

ARMY ORGANIC INDUSTRIAL BASE 

The Secretary of the Army is directed to provide 45-day written 
notification to the congressional defense committees prior to approving 
civilian reductions in force that will result in an employment 
loss of 50 or more full-time employees at any Army organic 
industrial base facility. The notification shall include the impact 
that the proposed reduction in force will have on the ability to 
maintain the organic industrial base critical manufacturing capabilities 
as delineated in the Army Organic Industrial Base Strategy 
Report, a detailed accounting of the costs of implementing the re



582 

duction in force, and an assessment of the cost of, and time necessary, 
for restoration of any lost capability to meet future organic 
wartime manufacturing needs.

the Army provides a detailed spend plan to the congressional defense 
committees detailing planned obligations by project, to include 
any changes from prior year spend plans. Further, with submission 
of the fiscal year 2024 President’s budget request, the Secretary 
of the Army is directed to submit an updated Army Ammunition

SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE 

The agreement fully supports the fiscal year 2023 President’s 
budget request for the Columbia class submarines (CLB) and the 
Virginia class submarines (VCS), but notes continued concern over 
both the VCS construction cost and schedule performance and CLB 
schedule variances. The agreement further notes that for the first 
time since fiscal year 2010, the budget request includes funds for 
cost overruns for VCS program construction-related performance 
overruns. Therefore, to ensure transparency of future cost and 
schedule estimates, the Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit 
to the congressional defense committees the most current cost and 
schedule estimates, by submarine, with the submission of future 
President’s budget requests. The report shall also include detailed 
explanations for all submarines not fully resourced to the Navy’s 
cost estimate and all projected cost-to-complete requirements for 
previously authorized and appropriated submarines. 

SUBMARINE INDUSTRIAL BASE 

The agreement provides $541,000,000 in Columbia class submarine 
and $207,000,000 in the Industrial Base Analysis and 
Sustainment (IBAS) program to strengthen the submarine industrial 
base (SIB) to fund supplier development, shipyard infrastructure, 
strategic outsourcing, workforce development, and technology 
opportunities. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit a report 
to the congressional defense committees not later than 60 days 
after the enactment of this Act detailing how SIB and IBAS funding 
will be allocated to industry partners, state and local entities, 
and other partners, and clearly articulate how these investments 
will enable serial submarine production. 

DOMESTIC SOURCE CONTENT FOR NAVY SHIPBUILDING 

The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report assessing the domestic source 
content of any procurements carried out as part of a Navy shipbuilding 
program, identifying critical components that are available 
from only one or a few suppliers in the United States, and providing 
recommendations to expand productive capacity in the 
United States with the submission of the fiscal year 2024 President’s 
budget request. Additionally, the Secretary shall establish 
an information repository for the collection of supplier information 
that can be used for continuous data analysis and program management 
activities. 

OTHER PROCUREMENT, NAVY

urges the Secretary of the Navy to keep the congressional defense 
committees apprised of plans to meet this requirement.

F–15EX 

The agreement includes $2,317,368,000 for 24 F–15EX aircraft, 
a reduction of $104,980,000 and the same number of aircraft included 
in the request. The agreement directs the Secretary of the 
Air Force to procure the full number of aircraft appropriated by the 
agreement and to apply the funding reduction to initial spares and 
other support costs as indicated by the table titled ‘‘Explanation of 
Project Level Adjustments’’ included under this account heading. 
The agreement is based on the understanding that the Air Force 
will not award the production of these aircraft through an 
undefinitized contractual action as has been the practice for prior 
lots of aircraft. This language replaces the language under this 
heading in House Report 117–388. 

POLAR TACTICAL AIRLIFT 

The Air National Guard currently maintains and operates a fleet 
of LC–130H aircraft that provide assured access to the polar regions 
in support of Presidential Decision Memorandum 6646 and 
the United States Northern Command’s (USNORTHCOM) mission 
requirements. The agreement notes that these aircraft possess approximately 
15 years of service life and are being upgraded with 
advanced avionics and propulsion. Given the ever-increasing importance 
of the polar regions in our National Defense Strategy, and 
our adversaries’ excursion into those regions, the Congress believes 
that this vital capability must be maintained, modernized, and 
eventually replaced in an appropriate and timely fashion. 

The agreement therefore directs the Secretary of the Air Force 
to begin the requirements definition process for the follow-on aircraft 
to fulfill the polar tactical airlift mission set and provides an 
additional $1,000,000 in Operation and Maintenance, Air Force to 
conduct the studies and analyses to inform those requirements. 
The agreement further directs the Secretary of the Air Force, in coordination 
with the Commander, USNORTHCOM and Director, Air 
National Guard, to submit to the congressional defense committees, 
not later than 120 days following the enactment of this Act, an initial 
cost estimate and capabilities review of C–130J aircraft and 
the associated modifications to fulfill the polar tactical airlift mission 
set. 

CLASSIC ASSOCIATIONS 

The agreement notes that pending the resolution and passage of 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, the 
Secretary of the Air Force may develop a plan to transfer KC–135 
aircraft to air refueling wings of the Air National Guard that are 
operating as classic associations with active duty units of the Air 
Force. The agreement therefore directs the Secretary of the Air 
Force to provide a copy of the plan and the associated implementation 
costs by appropriation and budget line item across the future 
years defense program to the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees. 


635 

TRUNCATION OF EXISTING PRODUCTION PROGRAMS 

The fiscal year 2023 President’s budget request includes ten 
Combat Rescue Helicopters (CRH), which is less than the 20 CRH 
previously planned. The agreement therefore recommends an additional 
$570,000,000 for ten additional CRH and associated spares. 
It is concerning that in the fiscal year 2023 President’s budget submission 
both the F–15EX and CRH programs have been truncated 
across the future years defense program (FYDP) well below their 
stated acquisition objectives. The revised strategy sees the F–15EX 
planned procurement objective reduced from 144 to 80 aircraft and 
the CRH procurement objective reduced from 113 to 75 aircraft. 
Both programs are in the relatively early stages of production and 
provide modern capabilities, but the new strategy ends CRH production 
after this fiscal year and F–15EX production after fiscal 
year 2024. 

While trade-offs occur to support force readiness and modernization, 
truncating programs that only recently transitioned into production 
and were hailed as supporting critical Air Force missions, 
such as personnel recovery and future tactical air, calls into question 
the strategic underpinning of these and other acquisition decisions. 
The reduction in the F–15EX program, for example, leaves 
in doubt the status and future of F–15C/D units, several of which 
are housed in the Air National Guard. The agreement therefore directs 
the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a report to the congressional 
defense committees, concurrent with submission of the 
fiscal year 2024 President’s budget request, that provides a list of 
all aircraft procurement programs that are being truncated across 
the FYDP, to include F–15EX and CRH. The report shall include 
an assessment of the operational impacts of the decision, strategic 
basing impacts, cost avoidance by fiscal year, quantity change, and 
the rationale for truncation. 

F–15EX CONFORMAL FUEL TANKS 

Conformal fuel tanks (CFT) have the capacity to extend the 
range and increase the lethality of F–15EX aircraft. The Secretary 
of the Air Force is directed to submit a report to the congressional 
defense committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of 
this Act on the Air Force’s plans to equip F–15EX aircraft with 
CFT, including the potential procurement of new CFT that are in 
production.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS 

The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming 
guidance as specified in the report accompanying the 
House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for 
Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar 
threshold for reprogramming funds shall be $10,000,000 for procurement 
and research, development, test and evaluation. 

Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to 
continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly, 
spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-
wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III 
and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory 
statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations 
Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation 
that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, 
development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These 
thresholds are cumulative from the Base for Reprogramming value 
as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value 
of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research, development, 
test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified threshold, 
the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval reprogramming 
to the congressional defense committees. In addition, 
guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming procedures 
for congressional special interest items are established 
elsewhere in this statement. 

FUNDING INCREASES 

The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided 
only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. Additional 
guidance is provided in the overview of this explanatory statement. 

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST 
ITEMS 

Items for which additional funds have been recommended or 
items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the 
project level tables detailing recommended adjustments or in paragraphs 
using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the joint explanatory 
statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose 
of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of 
these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated 
amount, as specifically addressed elsewhere in the joint explanatory 
statement. 

OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS 

Pursuant to section 873 of the John S. McCain National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), as 
amended by section 819 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92) and the Joint Explanatory 
Statement accompanying the Department of Defense and 
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations 
Act for 2019 (Public Law 115–245), the Department of Defense is 
required to meet annual and quarterly reporting requirements on 


656 

the use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA). The agreement 
notes the continued importance of this reporting requirement, particularly 
given the lack of fidelity within the Department on execution 
of OTAs and the wide discrepancy in utilization rates. This 
continues to raise concerns on the efficacy of existing guidance in 
normalizing the use of OTAs going forward. 

Therefore, the agreement directs the Under Secretary of Defense 
for Acquisition and Sustainment to continue the previously established 
reporting requirements. Further, the agreement directs the 
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, not 
later than 60 days following the enactment of this Act, to submit 
a report to the congressional defense committees on the Department’s 
use of OTA agreements in fiscal year 2022, to include an 
analysis of the relative success rates of follow-on production contracts 
initiated after the conclusion of initial OTA agreements in 
comparison to lessons learned from conventional Federal Acquisition 
Regulation-based acquisitions. 

REPORTING ON MID-TIER ACQUISITION AND RAPID PROTOTYPING 
PROGRAMS 

The agreement notes support for efforts to deliver capability to 
the warfighter at an accelerated pace, such as through use of acquisition 
authorities and contracting strategies provided in National 
Defense Authorization Acts for the rapid development, rapid prototyping, 
rapid acquisition, accelerated acquisition, and middle-tier 
acquisition (‘‘section 804’’) of warfighter capabilities. The agreement 
notes that the spectrum of programs using these types of acquisition 
authorities ranges from small programs that have already deployed 
prototypes, to programs that by virtue of their scope and 
cost would otherwise be subject to reporting requirements and acquisition 
regulations applicable to traditional major acquisition category 
I programs. The agreement notes the Department of Defense’s 
continued use of such acquisition authorities, and concern 
remains over the lack of standard acquisition information provided 
for such programs with the budget request, to include independent 
cost estimates, technology and manufacturing readiness assessments, 
and test and evaluation master plans. This is of particular 
concern as programs increase the use of acquisition strategies that 
utilize both rapid prototyping and rapid fielding authorities sequentially, 
together resulting in a ten-year acquisition program, or 
by purchasing excessive numbers of end-items under the rapid 
prototyping authorities for eventual fielding, rather than only procuring 
the number of units required for testing. Further, there is 
remaining concern that the Services’ growing trend toward procuring 
de facto operational assets via prototyping acquisitions may 
limit the Services’ ability to successfully manage their acquisition 
programs in the long-term by eliminating the full understanding of 
full program costs up-front; unnecessarily narrowing the industrial 
base early in the acquisition process; and eliminating opportunities 
for future innovation by reducing competition over the life of the 
acquisition. Further, there is concern that budgeting for these de 
facto end-items incrementally with research and development appropriations 
instead of fully funding them with procurement appropriations 
obfuscates costs and limits transparency and visibility 


657 

into Services’ procurement efforts. Therefore, the agreement modifies 
section 8059 of this Act, further defining instances in which 
end-item procurement can be conducted with research and development 
funding. 

The Under Secretaries of Defense for Research and Engineering 
and Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the Service 
acquisition executives for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Space 
Force, are directed to provide to the congressional defense committees 
with submission of the fiscal year 2024 President’s budget request 
a complete list of approved acquisition programs, and programs 
pending approval in fiscal year 2024, utilizing prototyping or 
accelerated acquisition authorities, along with the rationale for 
each selected acquisition strategy, as well as a cost estimate and 
contracting strategy for each such program. Further, the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Assistant Secretaries 
(Financial Management and Comptroller) for the Army, Navy, and 
Air Force, are directed to certify full funding of the acquisition 
strategies for each of these programs in the fiscal year 2024 President’s 
budget request, including their test strategies; finally, the 
Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, is directed to certify to 
the congressional defense committees the appropriateness of the 
Services’ planned test strategies for such programs, to include a 
risk assessment. To the extent that the respective Service acquisition 
executives, Services’ financial manager and comptrollers, and 
Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, provided the information 
requested above with submission of the fiscal year 2023 President’s 
budget, any variations therefrom should be included with 
the fiscal year 2024 submission. In addition, the Services’ financial 
manager and comptrollers are directed to identify the full costs for 
prototyping units by individual item in the research, development, 
test and evaluation budget exhibits for the budget year as well as 
the future years defense program. 

SOFTWARE AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY PILOT PROGRAMS 

The fiscal year 2023 President’s budget request includes ten new 
programs for inclusion in the Software and Digital Technology Pilot 
Programs funded in Budget Activity Eight (BA 08) within the research, 
development, test and evaluation accounts, established in 
fiscal year 2021. This is an increase over the five new programs requested, 
but not approved, in the fiscal year 2022 budget request. 

The agreement again acknowledges the Department’s rationale 
regarding the incremental technical challenges posed by modern 
software development practices, including implementing technical 
fixes to existing code, addressing cyber vulnerabilities, and integrating 
incrementally developed new capabilities. However, the 
Congress maintains its position that objective quantitative and 
qualitative evidence is required to evaluate the ongoing approved 
pilot programs prior to considering an expansion of programs funded 
under BA 08. Reporting requirements outlined in the Joint Explanatory 
Statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations 
Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260) have not been submitted 
to the congressional defense committees on a timely basis 
and have not yet provided a baseline for analyzing the effectiveness 
of the pilot programs compared to traditional appropriation prac



658 

tices. Reports received to date indicate that the Department is still 
implementing methods to capture the appropriate data that would 
allow an objective analysis for how a single budget activity improves 
the performance of software pilot programs. Therefore, the 
agreement recommends maintaining the Software and Digital 
Technology Pilot Programs in their current form, as detailed in 
title VIII of this Act. The recommendation transfers funds for programs 
requested as BA 08 new starts in fiscal year 2023 to their 
historical appropriation accounts for execution, as detailed in the 
appropriate Explanation of Project Level Adjustments tables. Further, 
the agreement encourages the Secretary of Defense to refrain 
from submitting additional BA 08 pilot programs in future budget 
submissions until the Department has demonstrated its ability to 
collect quantitative data on the performance improvements provided 
by the pilot program. 

As detailed in the reporting requirements outlined in the Joint 
Explanatory Statement accompanying the Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260), and Department of 
Defense Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–103), the Secretary 
of Defense shall submit quarterly reports to the congressional 
defense committees detailing the Department’s assessment 
for each of the programs included in title VIII. This report shall include, 
at a minimum, quantitative and qualitative metrics; an assessment 
of eight similar programs, with representations from each 
service, funded through traditional appropriation legislation for 
comparison; an assessment of each pilot program against their own 
historical performance when funded through traditional appropriation 
legislation; and an assessment of prior year BA 08 execution 
by activity compared to planned execution in the respective budget 
request. 

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION, ARMY 

The agreement provides $17,150,141,000 for Research, Development, 
Test and Evaluation, Army, as follows:

SERIAL BUS CYBER VULNERABILITIES 

Army weapons platforms require cyber resilience as a key performance 
parameter of system survivability especially in compromised 
or contested cyber environments. To meet this requirement, 
the agreement encourages the Secretary of the Army to implement 
technology solutions on existing platforms, such as Stryker 
vehicles, as well as new weapons systems, that will develop, integrate, 
and demonstrate secure communication technologies using 
secure digital bus subsystems while minimizing performance degradation. 
These technology solutions are especially critical to the 
resiliency and survivability of weapons platforms that implement 
common bus dependent architectures like Modular Open Systems 
Approach, while operating in cyber-contested environments. Army 
labs and centers within Army Futures Command, Combat Capabilities 
Development Command, along with affiliated industry partners, 
possess the competencies and infrastructure to enable maturation 
and transition of such technologies to weapon system program 
managers. 

ROBOTIC COMBAT VEHICLE-MEDIUM 

The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2022 provided 
$20,000,000 to procure additional Robotic Combat Vehicle—Medium 
(RCV–M) test assets for experimentation by U.S. Army 
Forces Command (FORSCOM) via soldier evaluations at the company 
level. The agreement recognizes the importance of such experimentation 
in shaping future doctrine, concepts of operation, 
tactics, techniques, and procedures, and requirements for follow-on 
robotic platforms and therefore directs the Secretary of the Army, 
through FORSCOM, to utilize all available RCV–M assets in the 
aforementioned experiments. 

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION, NAVY 

The agreement provides $26,017,309,000 for Research, Development, 
Test and Evaluation, Navy, as follows:

ULTRA-LONG ENDURANCE UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS 

The agreement notes that the Geographic Combatant Commands 
have a requirement for persistent airborne intelligence, surveillance, 
and reconnaissance platforms that is not being fully met by 
existing unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Therefore, the Chief of 
Naval Research is directed to provide a report to the congressional 
defense committees, not later than 90 days following the enactment 
of this Act, that identifies research and development activities for 
ultra-long endurance attritable group III UAS, along with a 
resourcing profile associated with these efforts, and identification of 
any additional areas in need of investment. 

GUIDANCE AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS FOR 81MM MORTAR ROUNDS 

Recent battlefield lessons underscore the importance of mobile 
precision fires on modern battlefields. Over the past decade, Congress 
has appropriated significant funds for the development of 
guidance systems that can be utilized on existing munition rounds, 
to include 81mm mortars, 155mm howitzers, and Naval 5–inch 
guns. The agreement notes that recently, the 81mm mortar precision 
guidance kit was tested by the Marine Corps from an unmanned 
aerial system. Further, the agreement notes that maturation 
of the prototype guidance system to operate in a GPS-denied 
environment is technically achievable and feasible. Therefore, the 
Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to provide a 
plan, not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act, for 
technology maturation and potential fielding of this capability by 
one or more of the services. 

LARGE DISPLACEMENT UNMANNED UNDERSEA VEHICLE PROGRAM 

The agreement notes that the fiscal year 2023 President’s budget 
request did not include funding for the Snakehead Large Displacement 
Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV) program and proposes 
a divestment from the platform including all planned procurements 
in the future years defense program (FYDP) following 
the Department’s decision to reprogram fiscal year 2022 programmatic 
funds. The agreement further notes that there have 
been significant advancements in commercially available unmanned 
undersea vehicle (UUV) technology since the inception of 
the Snakehead LDUUV program. The Secretary of the Navy is encouraged 
to prioritize advancements in autonomy, endurance, and 
multi-mission payload capability now available in the commercial 
LDUUV sector. 

Consistent with the Navy’s goal of delivering these significant 
advantages in the undersea domain to the fleet, the Secretary of 
the Navy, in consultation with the Chief of Naval Operations and 
the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and 
Acquisition), is encouraged to integrate available commercial 
LDUUV platforms into the test and evaluation schedule for UUVs. 
The Secretary of the Navy is further encouraged to integrate commercially 
available UUV technology into Navy and Marine Corps 
concept of operations development and resourcing, procurement, 
and fielding plans over the FYDP.

TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPABILITIES 

The agreement transfers the Transformational Technology Development 
activities in the Advanced Technology Development budget 
activity to the Future AF Integrated Technology Demos line, program 
element 0603032F, to provide a more complete picture of the 
Vanguard program. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to 
provide detailed justifications of critical tasks under the Vanguard 
program with the submission of the fiscal year 2024 President’s 
budget request. 

PROVIDING BUDGETARY FIDELITY IN THE TECH TRANSITION PROGRAM 

The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to retain the program 
element structure established in the table titled ‘‘explanation of 
project level adjustments’’ included under this account heading for 
Tech Transition Program; AFWERX Prime; Nuclear Command, 
Control and Communications (NC3); and Rapid Defense Experimentation 
Reserve in the fiscal year 2024 President’s budget request. 


ADVANCED ENGINE DEVELOPMENT 

The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to retain separate program 
elements for the Adaptive Engine Transition Program and 
Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion programs in the fiscal year 
2024 President’s budget request. 

AFWERX 

The agreement supports AFWERX as a novel acquisition approach 
to accelerate development of emerging technology and encourages 
the Secretary of the Air Force to expand the program into 
new focus areas such as supersonic flight. 

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PARTNERSHIP INTERMEDIARY 

The agreement supports increased use of a Department of Defense 
Partnership Intermediary as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3715, to 
seek out, assess and engage non-traditional small business vendors 
into the Department’s development and acquisition efforts. The effort 
should engage a Partnership Intermediary with a successful 
history of leveraging non-Department of Defense networks and 
using innovative means to seek out, identify, qualify, and help to 
interest new and non-traditional small business and manufacturers 
in sharing their innovations and doing business with the Department. 
Expanding the availability of highly qualified non-traditional 
manufacturers within the Department of Defense’s support base 
will save money for the taxpayer and the Department of Defense, 
broaden the national industrial base, and bring improved solutions 
and equipment to the warfighter faster. 

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION, 
SPACE FORCE 

The agreement provides $16,631,377,000 for Research, Development, 
Test and Evaluation, Space Force, as follows: 


712

SPACE FORCE PROGRAM AFFORDABILITY AND EXECUTABILITY 

The agreement notes that the budget projection provided with 
the fiscal year 2023 Space Force request is currently anticipated to 
remain flat and declining over the next five years, even though the 
Space Force is proposing ambitious plans for new architectures, 
programs, and mission areas. This apparent mismatch between 
program scope and overall budget resources raises concerns about 
the degree to which serious analysis or long-term planning has 
been done to assess the realism and affordability of its portfolio of 
programs. Therefore, the agreement directs the Secretary of the Air 
Force, through the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space 
Acquisition and Integration, to provide the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees with a briefing, including supporting 
analysis, an assessment of risks, and risk management plans, not 
later than February 1, 2023, on the projected cost, affordability, 
and executability of the full portfolio of classified and unclassified 
programs and activities funded in the Space Force accounts. 

MISSILE WARNING-MISSILE TRACKING LIFE-CYCLE COST 

The fiscal year 2023 President’s budget request includes more 
than $4,500,000,000 for missile warning-related programs for both 
legacy missile warning programs and smaller, more proliferated architectures 
in medium and low-earth orbit as part of the Resilient 
Missile Warning/Missile Tracking program. While the agreement 
strongly supports the pivot to a more proliferated and diverse architecture 
of smaller satellites, the Space Force has not provided 
sufficient information on the expected life-cycle cost of the new architecture; 
the cost to recapitalize a proliferated architecture every 
three to five years; potential risks and challenges in the supply 
chain; the ability of the Space Force to scale up capabilities to command 
and control a much larger number of satellites; and the applicability 
and ability to meet stringent requirements for missile 
warning certification, cybersecurity, and resilience against reversible 
and irreversible kinetic and non-kinetic attacks. Therefore, the 
agreement directs the Director, Cost Assessment and Program 
Evaluation, to develop a life-cycle cost estimate for the proposed 
Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking initiative and provide a 
report on the estimate to the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of this 
Act. 

In addition, the agreement directs the Secretary of the Air Force, 
in consultation with the Chief of Space Operations, to provide a report 
to the congressional defense committees, not later than 60 
days after the enactment of this Act, that provides an assessment 
of each of the missile warning and missile tracking programs to include 
a comparison of the cost, schedule, capabilities, system life-
span, and associated risk of each. The report shall include an integrated 
master schedule for all missile warning and missile tracking 
weapon systems currently in operation or development. This report 
shall be accompanied by a supplementary classified version that 
captures all relevant programs capable of providing missile warning 
across the Title 10 and Title 50 mission sets. Further, the 
agreement directs the Secretary of the Air Force to continue to pro



719 

vide quarterly briefings on the status of its missile warning-related 
program and expand the scope to include both the OPIR program 
and the Resilient Missile Warning-Missile Tracking program as an 
integrated set of programs. 

SPACE FORCE UNIQUE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 

The agreement continues to recognize that science and technology 
programs can have shared goals and leverage advancements 
in research areas that cut across both the air and space domains. 
While there are clear benefits to cross-domain multi-disciplinary investments, 
it can result in an increased level of complexity in allocating 
resources to the appropriate Service appropriations accounts 
for technology discovery and application efforts early in the research 
and development (R&D) phase. The agreement notes that 
space unique capabilities and those programs executed out of the 
Space Vehicles Directorate at the Air Force Research Lab are more 
appropriately budgeted in the Research, Development, Test and 
Evaluation, Space Force account. Further, the Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–103) directed that 
the Secretary of the Air Force provide a comprehensive proposal to 
the congressional defense committees to establish an objective, 
transparent, and effective means to align the Department of the 
Air Force’s science and technology resources across the R&D continuum; 
a requirement that has not yet been fulfilled. Therefore, 
the agreement directs the Secretary of the Air Force, with the submission 
of the fiscal year 2024 President’s budget request, to include 
space unique science and technology programs and efforts 
within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Space 
Force account and to provide the required proposal in a timely 
manner. 

TACTICALLY RESPONSIVE SPACE 

The agreement continues to support the maturation of a responsive 
launch program of record to rapidly place and reconstitute 
space assets in support of combatant command requirements and 
space enterprise resilience. Therefore, the agreement recommends 
an additional $50,000,000 for a tactically responsive launch capability. 


The agreement notes that the Department of Defense Appropriations 
Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–103) provided $50,000,000 for 
tactically responsive space launch capabilities and directed that the 
Secretary of the Air Force to provide the congressional defense 
committees with an acquisition strategy for this capability. Further, 
section 1609 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) directed the Secretary of 
the Air Force to establish a tactically responsive space launch program 
within the future years defense program. However, the fiscal 
year 2023 President’s budget request does not include any resources 
to establish the program despite a need to counter adversarial 
launches of disruptive technologies in a tactically relevant 
timeline. Therefore, the agreement directs the Secretary of the Air 
Force to submit, with the President’s fiscal year 2024 budget request, 
the resourcing profile across the future years defense pro



720 

gram by program, project, and activity for tactically responsive 
space capabilities, to include launch. 

CISLUNAR SPACE 

The agreement notes that the Department of Defense Appropriations 
Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–103) appropriated $61,000,000 for 
a cislunar flight experiment and $70,000,000 for nuclear propulsion 
technologies for cislunar flight. Developing capabilities and operating 
within cislunar space is imperative for the Nation to obtain 
national security, science and technology, and economic advantages. 
Therefore, the agreement recommends an additional 
$20,000,000 for cislunar activities. Further, the agreement strongly 
supports operationally relevant capabilities in cislunar space and 
encourages the Secretary of the Air Force to increase investments 
in this area. Further, the agreement directs the Secretary of the 
Air Force, in coordination with the Chief of Space Operations, to 
submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later 
than 90 days following the enactment of this Act, that details the 
acquisition programs and systems that are in development for operational 
use within the cislunar or lunar space, and any capabilities 
in development for the cislunar space domain awareness mission. 
The report shall include a list of acquisition milestones and dates 
(or program schedule for each of the efforts) as well as the costs 
of the effort by appropriation, line item, and program element 
across the future years defense program. In addition, the report 
shall include a list of unfunded programs and opportunities for investment. 


RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION,

RAPID DEFENSE EXPERIMENTATION RESERVE 

The fiscal year 2023 President’s budget request includes 
$358,000,000 for the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve Fund 
(RDER), an increase of $323,981,000 over fiscal year 2022 enacted 
funding levels. The request included RDER funding within Service 
program elements, aligning resources with the Service responsible 
for conducting the experimentation. 

The agreement makes modest adjustments to funding levels in 
Service RDER program elements and ensures that RDER funding 
is delineated in a standalone program element. Moreover, it provides 
the Office of the Secretary of Defense with an appropriate 
level of funding within Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, 
Defense-Wide, to conduct only core program management and 
integration activities, and reduces the scope of RDER efforts within 
the Office of the Joint Staff funding element. 

Concerns remain with RDER’s ability to synchronize experimentation 
occurring at Service and Combatant Command-level events 
with programmatic acquisition milestones. Therefore, the agreement 
directs the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, 
in coordination with the Service Secretaries, to provide a 
schedule and spend plan of RDER activities to the congressional 
defense committees not later than 60 days after the enactment of 
this Act. 

STREAMLINING AND BOLSTERING INNOVATION PROGRAM ELEMENTS 

The agreement consolidates existing prototyping program elements 
within Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Defense-
Wide, into one dedicated program element per budget activity. 
In Budget Activity 03, the Defense Modernization and Prototyping 
Program, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration, 
and certain prototyping activities previously conducted in the Technology 
Innovation program element are combined to create the Defense 
Innovation Acceleration program element. In Budget Activity 
04, the agreement supports the continuation of the Rapid Prototyping 
Program and separates the Rapid Defense Experimentation 
Reserve Fund program management activities into a dedicated program 
element. Furthermore, the agreement modifies section 8061 
of the bill to normalize standards across program elements. Not 
later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act, the Undersecretary 
of Defense for Research and Engineering shall brief the congressional 
defense committees on its implementation of these adjustments 
to the budget structure. 

RADAR TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES 

The agreement directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a report 
to the congressional defense committees not later than 180 
days after the enactment of this Act on current and potential contributions 
to national security capabilities for navigation and space 
situational awareness (SSA) of the ongoing efforts by the National 
Science Foundation, its National Radio Astronomy Observatory,

retary may vest unconditional title or other property interests acquired 
under projects in an award recipient, subrecipient, or successor 
in interest, including the United States, at the conclusion of 
the award period for projects receiving an initial award in fiscal 
year 2022 or later. 

(b) Upon vesting unconditional title pursuant to subsection (a) in 
an award recipient, subrecipient, or successor in interest other 
than the United States, the United States shall have no liabilities 
or obligations to the property. 
(c) For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘property interest’’ does 
not include any interest in intellectual property developed using 
funding provided under a project. 
SEC. 310. None of the funds made available in this title may be 
used to support a grant allocation award, discretionary grant 
award, or cooperative agreement that exceeds $100,000,000 in Federal 
funding unless the project is carried out through internal independent 
project management procedures.

TITLE I—CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL DEPARTMENT OF 
THE ARMY 

CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL 

The summary tables included in this title set forth the dispositions 
with respect to the individual appropriations, projects, and 
activities of the Corps of Engineers (Corps). Additional items of this 
Act are discussed below. 

Advanced Funds Agreements.—In light of a non-federal sponsor’s 
commitment to provide all funding required for construction of the 
project, or separable element thereof, federal funds shall not be 
provided for such construction. Instead, for such projects, any federal 
funding may be provided only after completion of construction, 
as repayment of the federal share of such construction, from funding 
provided in this or subsequent acts for reimbursements or repayments, 
and would be subject to a new start designation. This 
direction is not intended to apply to any project with an advanced 
funds project partnership agreement that was in place prior to December 
20, 2019. 

Apportionment Under a Continuing Resolution.—The change in 
apportionment policy is rejected, and the Administration is directed 
to follow the previous policy during any continuing resolutions that 
may occur in this or any future fiscal years. 

Budget Structure Changes.—The fiscal year 2023 budget request 
for the Corps proposed numerous structural changes, including the 
creation of two new accounts, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
(HMTF) and Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF); the shifting of 
various studies and projects among accounts and business lines; 
and the consolidation of certain remaining items. The agreement 
rejects all such proposed changes and instead funds all activities in 
the accounts in which funding has traditionally been provided. Unless 
expressly noted, all projects and studies remain at the levels 
proposed in the budget request but may be funded in different accounts. 
In particular:

• 
Projects proposed for funding in the HMTF account in the 
budget request are funded in the Construction, Mississippi River 
and Tributaries, and Operation and Maintenance accounts, as appropriate;
• 
Projects requested in the IWTF account are shown in the Construction 
account; 

819 

• 
Dredged Material Management Plans, requested in the Investigations 
account, are funded in the Operation and Maintenance account; 
• 
Disposition studies will continue to be funded under the Disposition 
of Completed Projects remaining item in the Investigations 
account; 
• 
Tribal Partnership projects will continue to be funded under 
the Tribal Partnership Program remaining item in the Investigations 
account as well as in the remaining item in the Construction 
account, and these amounts may be used to cover necessary administrative 
expenses prior to agreement execution;
• 
Project Condition Surveys, Scheduling of Reservoir Operations 
and Surveillance of Northern Boundary Waters will continue to be 
funded under states instead of consolidated into national programs 
as requested in the Operation and Maintenance account and the 
HMTF account; 
• 
Inspection of Completed Works will continue to be funded 
under the individual states instead of consolidated into a national 
program as requested in the Operation and Maintenance account 
and the Mississippi River and Tributaries account; and
• 
Dam Safety Modification Studies, requested in the Investigations 
account, will be funded under the Dam Safety and Seepage/ 
Stability Correction Program remaining item in the Construction 
account. 
For any fiscal year, if the Corps proposes budget structure 
changes, the budget request shall be accompanied by a display of 
the funding request in the traditional budget structure. 

Continuing Contracts.—The Corps is authorized by section 621 of 
title 33, United States Code, to execute its Civil Works projects 
through the use of a Special Continuing Contract Clause as described 
in Engineer Circulars 11–2–221 and 11–2–222, and an Incremental 
Funding Clause (DFARS 252.2327–7007). The Administration 
is directed to continue using its existing continuing contract 
authorities in accordance with the general provisions in this Act as 
an efficient approach to managing large, multi-year projects. 

Deep Draft Navigation.—The agreement provides an estimated 
$2,318,000,000 for HMTF eligible activities in accordance with the 
changes in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act 
(Public Law 116–136) and the Water Resources Development Act 
(WRDA) of 2020 (Public Law 116–260). The agreement provides 
$56,000,000 for the program authorized by section 2106 (c) of the 
Water Resources and Reform Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 
(Public Law 113–121). 

Invasive Carp.—The Corps is undertaking multiple efforts to stop 
invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes. There is appreciation 
that the Corps’ spend plan for fiscal year 2022 funding provided 
under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (Public 
Law 117–58) included $225,838,000 to initiate construction of the 
Brandon Road Lock and Dam, Aquatic Nuisance Species Barrier 
project. Further, the fiscal year 2023 budget request includes 
$47,880,500 for the project to continue this important effort. As the 
Corps prioritizes projects, it shall consider critical projects to prevent 
the spread of invasive species. The Corps is directed to provide 
to the Committees quarterly updates on the progress and sta



820 

tus of efforts to prevent the further spread of invasive carp, including 
the Brandon Road Recommended Plan and the second array at 
the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal; the location and density of 
carp populations; the use of emergency procedures previously authorized 
by Congress; the development, consideration, and implementation 
of new technological and structural countermeasures; 
and progress on preconstruction engineering and design (PED) and 
construction work. 

The Corps shall continue to collaborate at levels commensurate 
with previous years with the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, the State of Illinois, and members of the Invasive 
Carp Regional Coordinating Committee, including identifying navigation 
protocols that would be beneficial or effective in reducing 
the risk of vessels inadvertently carrying aquatic invasive species, 
including invasive carp, through the Brandon Road Lock and Dam 
in Joliet, Illinois. Any findings of such an evaluation shall be included 
in the quarterly briefings to the Committees. The Corps is 
further directed to implement navigation protocols shown to be effective 
at reducing the risk of entrainment without jeopardizing the 
safety of vessels and crews. The Corps and other federal and state 
agencies are conducting ongoing research on additional potential 
invasive carp solutions. The Corps is directed to provide to the 
Committees not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act a 
briefing on such navigation protocols and potential solutions. 

Reporting Requirement.—The Corps is directed to provide to the 
Committees a quarterly report that shall include the total budget 
authority and unobligated balances by year for each program, 
project, or activity, including any prior year appropriations. The 
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works is directed to provide 
to the Committees a quarterly report that includes the total 
budget authority and unobligated balances by year for each activity 
funded in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for 
Civil Works account, including any prior year appropriations. 

Reprogramming.—The reprogramming legislation provided in the 
Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations 
Act, 2020 (Public Law 116–94) is retained. 

ADDITIONAL FUNDING 

The agreement includes funding above the budget request to ensure 
continued improvements to our national economy, public safety, 
and environmental health that result from water resources 
projects. This funding is for additional work that either was not included 
in the budget request or was inadequately budgeted. The 
bill contains a provision requiring the Corps to allocate funds in accordance 
with only the direction in this agreement. In lieu of all 
House direction—under any heading—regarding additional funding, 
new starts, and the fiscal year 2023 work plan, the Corps shall 
follow the direction included in this explanatory statement. 

The executive branch retains complete discretion over project-
specific allocation decisions within the additional funds provided, 
subject to only the direction here and under the heading ‘‘Additional 
Funding’’ or ‘‘Additional Funding for Ongoing Work’’ within 
each of the Investigations, Construction, Mississippi River and 
Tributaries, and Operation and Maintenance accounts. A study or 


821 

project may not be excluded from evaluation for being ‘‘inconsistent 
with Administration policy.’’ Voluntary funding in excess of legally-
required cost shares for studies and projects is acceptable, but shall 
not be used as a criterion for allocating the additional funding provided 
or for the selection of new starts. 

The Administration is reminded that these funds are in addition 
to the budget request, and Administration budget metrics shall not 
be a reason to disqualify a study or project from being funded. It 
is expected that all of the additional funding provided will be allocated 
to specific programs, projects, or activities. The focus of the 
allocation process shall favor the obligation, rather than expenditure, 
of funds. Additionally, the Administration shall consider the 
extent to which the Corps is able to obligate funds as it allocates 
the additional funding. The Corps shall evaluate all studies and 
projects only within accounts and categories consistent with previous 
congressional funding. 

A project or study shall be eligible for additional funding within 
the Investigations, Construction, and Mississippi River and Tributaries 
accounts if: (1) it has received funding, other than through 
a reprogramming, in at least one of the previous three fiscal years; 
or (2) it was previously funded and could reach a significant milestone, 
complete a discrete element of work, or produce significant 
outputs in fiscal year 2023. None of the additional funding in any 
account may be used for any item where funding was specifically 
denied or for projects in the Continuing Authorities Program 
(CAP). Funds shall be allocated consistent with statutory cost 
share requirements. Also, funding associated with each category of 
Additional Funding may be allocated as appropriate to any eligible 
study or project within that category; funding associated with each 
subcategory may be allocated only to eligible studies or projects, 
within that subcategory. 

The Corps is reminded that the flood and storm damage reduction 
mission area can include instances where non-federal sponsors 
are seeking assistance with flood control and unauthorized discharges 
from permitted wastewater treatment facilities and that 
the navigation mission area includes work in remote and subsistence 
harbor areas. In addition to the priority factors used to allocate 
all additional funding provided in the Construction account, 
the Corps also shall consider the non-federal sponsor’s ability and 
willingness to promptly provide the required cash contribution, if 
any, as well as required lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, 
and disposal areas. 

Work Plan.—The Corps is directed to provide to the Committees 
not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act a work plan including 
the following information: (1) a detailed description of the 
process and criteria used to evaluate studies and projects; (2) delineation 
of how these funds are to be allocated; (3) a summary of the 
work to be accomplished with each allocation, including phase of 
work and the study or project’s remaining cost to complete (excluding 
Operation and Maintenance); and (4) a list of all studies and 
projects that were considered eligible for funding but did not receive 
funding, including an explanation of whether the study or 
project could have used funds in fiscal year 2023 and the specific 


822 

reasons each study or project was considered as being less competitive 
for an allocation of funds. 

The Administration shall not delay apportioning the funding for 
Community Project Funding and Congressionally Directed Spending 
while developing the work plan for additional funding. 

New Starts.—The agreement includes funding for a limited number 
of new projects, including those proposed in the budget request. 
No further new starts are provided for in this Act. 

While there remains significant need for new investments in 
water resources projects, decisions regarding the processes by 
which projects may be made eligible for funding or the manner in 
which projects are funded can only be made by the Committees. 

There continues to be confusion regarding the executive branch’s 
policies and guidelines regarding which studies and projects require 
new start designations. Therefore, the Corps is directed to notify 
the Committees at least seven days prior to execution of an 
agreement for construction of any project except environmental infrastructure 
projects and projects under the CAP. Additionally, the 
agreement reiterates and clarifies previous congressional direction 
as follows. Neither study nor construction activities related to individual 
projects authorized under section 1037 of WRRDA of 2014 
shall require a new start or new investment decision; these activities 
shall be considered ongoing work. No new start or new investment 
decision shall be required when moving from feasibility to 
PED. The initiation of construction of an individually authorized 
project funded within a programmatic line item may not require a 
new start designation provided that some amount of construction 
funding under such programmatic line item was appropriated and 
expended during the previous fiscal year. No new start or new investment 
decision shall be required to initiate work on a separable 
element of a project when construction of one or more separable 
elements of that project was initiated previously; it shall be considered 
ongoing work. A new construction start shall not be required 
for work undertaken to correct a design deficiency on an existing 
federal project; it shall be considered ongoing work. The Corps is 
reminded that resumptions are just that—resumption of previously-
initiated studies or projects and, as such, do not require 
new start designations. 

INVESTIGATIONS 

The agreement includes $172,500,000 for Investigations. 

The allocation for projects and activities within the Investigations 
account is shown in the following table:

826 



827 



828 

Updated Capabilities.—The agreement adjusts some project-specific 
allocations downward based on updated technical information 
from the Corps. 

Additional Funding.—The Corps is expected to allocate the additional 
funding provided in this account primarily to specific feasibility 
and PED phases, rather than to remaining items as has been 
the case in previous work plans. The Corps shall include appropriate 
requests for funding in future budget submissions for PED 
and new feasibility studies initiated in fiscal year 2023. The Administration 
is reminded that a project study is not complete until 
the PED phase is complete and that no new start or new investment 
decision shall be required when moving from feasibility to 
PED. 

Of the additional funding provided, $4,000,000 shall be for Flood 
Risk Management PED activities. 

When allocating the additional funding provided in this account, 
the Corps shall consider prioritizing: completing or accelerating ongoing 
studies that will enhance the nation’s economic development, 
job growth, and international competitiveness; projects located in 
areas that have suffered recent natural disasters; projects that protect 
life and property; or projects addressing legal requirements. 
The Corps is urged to consider any national security benefits a 
project may have when allocating this funding. The Corps is encouraged 
to prioritize completing or accelerating ongoing studies for 
flood risk management projects in areas experiencing dramatic or 
rapid increases in urban development in and around project sites.

job growth, and international competitiveness. 

Public Law 117–43 and Public Law 117–58 included funding 
within the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies account to restore 
authorized shore protection projects to full project profile. 
That funding is expected to address some of the current year capability. 
The Corps is reminded that if additional work can be done, 
these projects are also eligible to compete for additional funding for 
flood and storm damage reduction. 

The Corps is reminded that projects in the non-contiguous states 
and U.S. territories such as Hawaii are eligible for funding in this 
account. 

When allocating the additional funding provided in this account, 
the Corps is encouraged to evaluate authorized reimbursements in 
the same manner as if the projects were being evaluated for new 
or ongoing construction. The Corps shall not condition these funds, 
or any funds appropriated in this Act, on a non-federal interest 
paying more than its required share in any phase of a project. 
When allocating the additional funding provided in this account, 
the Corps shall consider giving priority to the following: 

• 
benefits of the funded work to the national economy; 
• 
extent to which the work will enhance national, regional, or 
local economic development; 
• 
number of jobs created directly and supported in the supply 
chain by the funded activity; 
• 
significance to national security, including the strategic significance 
of commodities; 
• 
ability to obligate the funds allocated within the calendar year, 
including consideration of the ability of the non-federal sponsor to 
provide any required cost share; 
• 
ability to complete the project, separable element, or project 
phase with the funds allocated; 
• 
legal requirements, including responsibilities to tribes; 
•

nonstructural measures and periodic beach renourishments): 
Æ 
population, safety of life, economic activity, or public infrastructure 
at risk, as appropriate; 
Æ 
the severity of risk of flooding or the frequency with which 
an area has experienced flooding; and 
Æ 
preservation of historically significant communities, culture, 
and heritage;

• 
for shore protection projects, projects in areas that have suffered 
severe beach erosion requiring additional sand placement outside 
of the normal beach renourishment cycle or in which the normal 
beach renourishment cycle has been delayed, and projects in 

841 

areas where there is risk to life and public health and safety and 
risk of environmental contamination; 

• 
for mitigation projects, projects with the purpose to address the 
safety concerns of coastal communities impacted by federal flood 
control, navigation, and defense projects;
•

the local, regional, and national economy if the project is not funded, 
as well as discrete segments of work that can be completed 
within the funding provided in this line item;
• 
for other authorized project purposes and environmental restoration 
or compliance projects, to include the beneficial use of 
dredged material; and
• 
for environmental infrastructure, projects with the greater economic 
impact, projects in rural communities, projects in communities 
with significant shoreline and instances of runoff, projects in 
or that benefit counties or parishes with high poverty rates, 
projects owed past reimbursements, projects in financially-distressed 
municipalities, projects that improve stormwater capture 
capabilities, projects that provide backup raw water supply in the 
event of an emergency, and projects that will provide substantial 
benefits to water quality improvements. 
Alternative Delivery.—The agreement supports alternative delivery 
approaches such as P3s and split delivery methods that leverage 
public and private resources to reduce cost and risk to populations 
by delivering infrastructure sooner. The use of P3s and split 
delivery methods can be a viable strategy to help address the 
Corps’ backlog of projects while reducing scheduling and funding 
risk to the federal government. The Corps is reminded that projects 
which use these methods are eligible to compete for additional 
funding recommended in this account. 

Aquatic Plant Control Program.—Of the additional funding provided 
for the Aquatic Plant Control Program, $16,000,000 shall be 
for watercraft inspection stations and rapid response, as authorized 
in section 104 of the River and Harbor Act of 1958 (Public Law 85– 
500), distributed to carry out subsections (d)(1)(A)(i), (d)(1)(A)(ii), 
(d)(1)(A)(iii), and (d)(1)(A)(iv), and $3,000,000 shall be for related 
monitoring as authorized by section 1170 of AWIA. The agreement 
provides $2,000,000 for activities for monitoring, surveys, and control 
of flowering rush and hydrilla. Additionally, $7,000,000 shall 
be for nationwide research and development to address invasive 
aquatic plants, and the Corps is encouraged to consider work to address 
invasive aquatic plants in the Northern Everglades region. 
The Corps is encouraged to consider work to address and prevent 
the threat of hydrilla infestation within the states of Florida and 
Georgia. The agreement also provides $500,000 to continue activities 
authorized under section 509 of WRDA of 2020, and the Corps 
is directed to provide to the Committees prior to the obligation of 
any funds for this purpose a briefing on how it will implement this 
program. 

Aquatic Plant Control Program, Connecticut River Basin.—Additional 
funding of $6,000,000 is provided for hydrilla control, re



842 

search, and demonstration work in the Connecticut River basin. 
The Corps is encouraged to consider the benefits of establishing a 
rapid response task force to cover the multistate watershed. 

Aquatic Plant Control Program, Mississippi River Basin.—The 
Corps is engaged in a multipronged effort to combat invasive species 
in the country’s waterways and protect the Mississippi River 
Basin, which is one of the most valued ecosystems in the world.

The Corps is encouraged to work with the Department of 
the Interior and the South Florida Water Management District to 
quickly identify a consensus project footprint between SW 8th 
Street and the C–1W Canal to the south, immediately east of 
Krome Avenue. This work is intended to enable Miami-Dade County 
and the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority to begin necessary 
land acquisitions in support of the creation of a West Kendall Everglades 
Buffer and progress toward completing this important element 
of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). 

Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project.—The Corps is encouraged 
to consider the incorporation of highly treated, reclaimed 
wastewater as an additional source of freshwater into further 
study, design, and construction of the project and to evaluate the 
potential to use additional volumes of reclaimed wastewater to restore 
freshwater artesian springs within the Bay through underground 
injection to the shallow, underlying aquifer. 

Central Everglades Planning Project.—The Corps is strongly encouraged 
to expedite the required validation reports for PPA North. 
The Corps is also encouraged to design and construct the recently-
authorized Everglades Agricultural Area Storage Reservoir as 
quickly as possible to utilize the expanded water delivery capabilities 
of completed PPA South elements. 

Central and South Florida Project.—The Corps is urged to maintain 
continued attention to the need of the South Florida economy 
and environment for a functioning flood control system. 

CERP—Indian River Lagoon-South.—The Corps is urged to expedite 
design work on the C–23 and C–24 Reservoirs that will serve 
as crucial elements of the Indian River Lagoon-South CERP 
project.

843 

plan. The non-federal sponsor may be eligible for additional reimbursement 
in the future. 

Chesapeake Bay Comprehensive Water Resources and Restoration 
Plan.—The Corps is reminded that the Chesapeake Bay Environmental 
Restoration and Protection Program and the Chesapeake 
Bay Oyster Recovery Program are eligible to compete for the additional 
funding provided in this account, and the Corps is encouraged 
to provide appropriate funding in future budget requests. 

Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Dispersal Barrier, Illinois.— 
No funds recommended in this Act may be used for construction of 
hydrologic separation measures. 

Columbia River Treaty.—The Corps is directed to brief, in a classified 
setting and in coordination with the Department of State, not 
later than 60 days after enactment of this Act on post-fiscal year 
2023 flood control operations as dictated by the Columbia River 
Treaty. Further, not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act 
the Corps shall provide a classified detailed assessment, in coordination 
with Department of State, of its funding requirements and 
plan for post-fiscal year 2023 flood control operations as dictated by 
the Columbia River Treaty. 

Construction Funding Schedules.—A complete and reliable cost 
estimate with an out-year funding schedule is essential to understanding 
current funding and future funding requirements within 
the Corps’ construction portfolio. A comprehensive outlook of these 
dynamic requirements is necessary for Congress to consider and 
balance funding allocations annually, and to assess the long-term 
effects of new investment decisions. Therefore, not later than 90 
days after enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Chief 
of Engineers shall submit directly to the Committees, a breakdown, 
by fiscal year, of the full and efficient federal funding needs for 
each ongoing construction project in the Corps’ Civil Works program. 
For each project identified, the Corps shall also provide the 
total project cost with a breakdown between the federal and non-
federal costs, and any applicable authorization ceiling. For the purposes 
of this report, an active project shall mean any project which 
has received construction account appropriations, including those 
funded in a supplemental, and has remaining costs to be funded 
from the Construction account. These funding requirements shall 
be based on technical construction sequencing, and realistic 
workflow and shall not be altered to reflect administrative policies 
and priorities or any assumed limitation on funding available. 

Continuing Authorities Program (CAP).—Funding is provided for 
nine CAP sections at a total of $72,285,000. The management of 
CAP should continue consistent with direction provided in previous 
fiscal years. The Corps shall allow for the advancement of flood 
control projects in combination with ecological benefits using natural 
and nature-based solutions alone, or in combination with, built 
infrastructure where appropriate for reliable risk reduction during 
the development of projects under section 205 of CAP. Within the 
section 1135 CAP authority, and to the extent already authorized 
by law, the Corps is reminded that projects that restore degraded 
wetland habitat and stream habitat impacted by construction of 
Corps levees or channels, including those with executed Feasibility 
Cost Share Agreements, and projects that will divert significant 


844 

pollutant nutrient runoff from entering wetland habitats, are eligible 
to compete for funding. 

Environmental Infrastructure.—The Corps is reminded that environmental 
infrastructure authorities include caps on federal participation, 
but do not provide a guarantee that the project authorization 
level will be met. 

Everglades Agricultural Area.—The agreement reiterates House 
direction. 

Friendswood, TX.—The agreement reiterates House direction. 

Implementation of Projects Receiving Supplemental Funds.—The 
Committees continue to have significant concerns with the Administration’s 
implementation of funding provided via supplemental 
appropriations Acts. As stated in the fiscal year 2022 Act, the Committees 
are troubled by the continued challenges with execution, 
cost overruns, and significant delays in completing projects funded 
under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–123). As 
the BBA 2018 program progresses, it is possible that projects will 
not be completed within previously available supplemental funds. 
The Committees do not intend for those projects to be delayed. The 
Corps is directed to provide to the Committees not later than 90 
days after enactment of this Act an out-year plan for completion of 
all BBA 2018 projects by identifying funding shortfalls by project 
and fiscal year. 

In addition, the Administration, without notice or explanation to 
Congress, changed its interpretation of bill language that had not 
changed from previous supplemental appropriations Acts when allocating 
funding under the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations 
Act of 2022 (DRSAA) (Public Law 117–43). Specifically, it 
has ignored congressional intent and its own previous interpretation 
that construction projects be funded to completion using supplemental 
funds and that ongoing construction projects be completed 
at full federal expense. By allocating only incremental funding 
for some ongoing construction projects, the Administration’s decision 
means that the non-federal sponsors remain responsible for 
significant costs. The lack of forethought and consideration for the 
impact to non-federal sponsors that likely do not have funding 
available to cost-share these lifesaving projects according to the 
normal rules is unreasonable and contrary to congressional intent 
apparent in the expressed provisions of DRSAA. 

Not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, the Administration 
shall provide to the Committees a briefing on the legal and 
policy justification for the changed interpretation of law, plans for 
completing all construction projects funded under DRSAA, and options 
for addressing cost share issues that have arisen as a result 
of the Administration’s decision. Further, the Corps shall brief the 
Committees quarterly on the status of all supplemental programs 
and the plan for completion of related projects. 

Kentucky Lock and Dam, Kentucky.—There is concern about 
major delays on construction projects, particularly the Kentucky 
Lock and Dam, which was provided funding by Public Law 117–58 
that the Administration states will physically complete and fiscally 
close out the project. The Corps is strongly urged to expedite construction. 



845 

Lake Isabella, California.—The Corps is directed to work with 
the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to expeditiously finalize the site location 
for the USFS visitor center and to undertake all requirements 
to evaluate, update, and finalize any necessary statutorily-
required review and compliance activities with the goal of commencing 
construction by December 31, 2023, or at the earliest possible 
date. 

McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS).— 
MKARNS is recognized as an established Marine Highway for waterborne 
commerce to include agriculture and aggregate commodities 
(sand, gravel, and rock) from the Gulf Coast to the Mid-West. 
Deepening the MKARNS to a consistent 12-foot navigation channel 
will provide tow drafts that are more compatible with navigation 
on the Mississippi River, which will reduce inefficient barge operations 
and transportation costs. The Corps is urged to prioritize 
this project in fiscal year 2023 to accelerate construction. The 
Corps is also encouraged to provide funds for nonstructural activities, 
such as channel deepening, with low annual funding needs in 
years where appropriated funds for IWTF cost shared projects are 
sufficient to accommodate such projects without impacting ongoing 
construction projects. Lastly, the Corps is encouraged to prioritize 
inland waterways projects consistent with the update to the Capital 
Investment Strategy, pursuant to section 2002(d) of WRRDA of 
2014. 

New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam, Georgia and South Carolina.—
The Corps is encouraged to work with all stakeholders toward 
a mutually beneficial resolution that will ensure waters levels 
for existing activities and functions are maintained, as detailed in 
section 1319 of the WIIN Act. 

Non-Federal Implementation Pilot Program.—Due to ongoing 
concerns initially expressed in the fiscal year 2020 Senate Report, 
the Corps shall notify the Committees upon receiving any proposal 
from a non-federal interest requesting to utilize the section 1043 

(b) of WRRDA of 2014 authority. The Corps shall not negotiate or 
enter into a project partnership agreement to transfer funds to a 
non-federal interest utilizing this authority unless approval is received 
from the Committees. None of the funds recommended in 
this Act shall be used under this authority for a project where construction 
has been started but not completed. 
Port of Brownsville Deepening Project, Texas.—The Corps is encouraged 
to include appropriate funding for this project in future 
budget submissions. 

Raritan River Basin, Green Brook Sub-Basin, New Jersey.—The 
Corps is encouraged to expeditiously move forward with construction 
of the Lower Basin and Stony Brook portions of the project.

funding is recommended to provide technical, planning, 
and design assistance to federal and non-federal interests carrying 
out projects to address water quality problems caused by drainage 
and related activities from abandoned and inactive noncoal mines 
under section 560 of WRDA of 1999 (Public Law 106–53). Additionally, 
the Corps is directed to develop an action plan to proactively 
engage with tribal communities in the western United States and 


846 

brief the Committees no later than 90 days after enactment of this 
Act on such plan. 

Riverbank Erosion.—The Corps is encouraged to prioritize 
projects to stabilize the Indiana shoreline of the Ohio River damaged 
by the operation of federally-owned dams on the Ohio River 
as authorized in section 9 of the Flood Control Act of 1946 (33 USC 
701q). 

Soo Locks, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.—The Corps is strongly 
encouraged to move forward expeditiously to complete this critical 
project and to include appropriate funding for these activities in future 
budget submissions. 

South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (SFER), Florida.—As in 
previous years, the agreement provides funding for all study and 
construction authorities related to Everglades restoration under the 
line item titled ‘‘South Florida Ecosystem Restoration, Florida.’’ 
This single line item allows the Corps flexibility in implementing 
the numerous activities underway in any given fiscal year. For fiscal 
year 2023, the Corps is directed to make publicly available a 
comprehensive snapshot of all SFER cost share accounting down to 
the project level and to ensure the accuracy of all budget justification 
sheets that inform SFER Integrated Financial Plan documents 
by October 31, 2023. 

Tulsa and West-Tulsa Levee System (TWTLS).—The Corps is encouraged 
to expeditiously complete construction since the TWTLS 
protected area is home to a substantial population of elderly and 
low income residents, and was classified by the Corps as a high 
risk of failure and life loss in 2019. 

Unified Facilities Guide Specifications.—The Corps is encouraged 
to continue to work with the Air Force and Navy to update the criteria 
included in the Unified Facilities Guide Specifications as appropriate. 
The Corps is encouraged to consider using lower carbon 
building materials, including cements such as portland-limestone 
cement, in order to reduce the environmental footprint of infrastructure 
projects. 

Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program (UMRR), Quincy 
Bay.—The Corps is encouraged to prioritize the environmental restoration 
project in Quincy Bay near Quincy, Illinois as a Tier 1 
project for immediate commencement through the UMRR Program. 

MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES

Updated Capabilities.—The agreement adjusts some project-specific 
allocations downward based on updated technical information 
from the Corps. 

Additional Funding.—When allocating the additional funding 
provided in this account, the Corps shall consider giving priority to 
completing or accelerating ongoing work that will enhance the nation’s 
economic development, job growth, and international competitiveness 
or for studies or projects located in areas that have 
suffered recent natural disasters. While this funding is shown 
under remaining items, the Corps shall use these funds in Investigations, 
Construction, and Operation and Maintenance, as applicable. 
This may include work on remaining unconstructed features 
of projects permitted and authorized by law, in response to recent 
flood disasters. 

When allocating additional funds provided in this account, the 
Corps is directed to give adequate consideration to cooperative 
projects addressing watershed erosion, sedimentation, flooding, and 
environmental degradation. Also, the importance of erosion control 
in headwater streams and tributaries, and the environmental, 
water quality, and sediment reduction benefits it provides downstream 
is recognized. 

Comprehensive Management Studies.—Comprehensive management 
studies that are fully within the boundaries of this account 
are authorized under the requirements, including cost share, of the 
Mississippi River and Tributaries project. 

Lower Mississippi River Main Stem.—The budget request proposes 
to consolidate several activities across multiple states into 
one line item. The agreement does not support this change and instead 
continues to fund these activities as separate line items. 

Mississippi River Commission.—No funding is provided for this 
new line item. The Corps is directed to continue funding the costs 
of the commission from within the funds provided for activities 
within the Mississippi River and Tributaries project. 

Yazoo Basin, Yazoo Backwater Area, Mississippi.—Funding is 
provided for mitigation of previously constructed features.

allocations downward based on updated technical information 
from the Corps. 

Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.—Of the additional funding 
provided in this account for other authorized project purposes, 
the Corps shall allocate not less than $300,000 for efforts to address 
terrestrial noxious weed control and sediment removal activities 
pursuant to section 503 of WRDA of 2020. 

Of the additional funding provided in this account for other authorized 
project purposes, the Corps shall allocate not less than 
$2,000,000 for efforts to combat invasive mussels at Corps-owned 
reservoirs. 

Of the additional funding provided in this account, the Corps 
shall also allocate funds according to the direction under the headings 
‘‘Water Control Manuals’’. 

There is not support for a level of funding that does not fund operation 
and maintenance of our nation’s aging infrastructure sufficiently 
to ensure continued competitiveness in a global marketplace. 
Federal navigation channels maintained at only a fraction of 
authorized dimensions and navigation locks and hydropower facilities 
being used well beyond their design life results in economic inefficiencies 
and risks infrastructure failure, which can cause substantial 
economic losses. 

When allocating the additional funding provided in this account, 
the Corps shall consider giving priority to the following:

• 
ability to complete ongoing work maintaining authorized 
depths and widths of harbors and shipping channels (including 
small, remote, or subsistence harbors), including where contaminated 
sediments are present;
• 
ability to address critical maintenance backlog;
• 
presence of the U.S. Coast Guard;
• 
extent to which the work will enhance national, regional, or 
local economic development, including domestic manufacturing capacity;
• 
extent to which the work will promote job growth or international 
competitiveness;
• 
number of jobs created directly by the funded activity;
• 
ability to obligate the funds allocated within the fiscal year;
• 
ability to complete the project, separable element, project 
phase, or useful increment of work within the funds allocated;
• 
ability to address hazardous barriers to navigation due to shallow 
channels; 
•

Æ 
maintenance of dredge disposal activities; 

Æ 
lack of alternative means of freight movement; 

Æ 
savings over alternative means of freight movement; and 

Æ 
improvements to dredged disposal facilities that will result 

in long-term savings, including a reduction in regular mainte


nance costs. 

Aquatic Nuisance Control Research Program.—The agreement 
provides $8,000,000 to supplement activities related to harmful 
algal bloom research and control and directs the Corps to target 
freshwater ecosystems. There is awareness of the need to develop 
next generation ecological models to maintain inland and intra-
coastal waterways and the agreement provides $5,000,000 for this 
purpose. The agreement provides $5,000,000 to continue work on 
the Harmful Algal Bloom Demonstration Program, as authorized 
by WRDA of 2020, and the Corps is directed to provide to the Committees 
not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act a briefing 
on the status of this effort. 

Additional funding recommended in this remaining item is to 
supplement and advance Corps activities to address harmful algal 
blooms including: early detection, prevention, and management 
techniques and procedures to reduce the occurrence and impacts of 
harmful algal blooms in our nation’s water resources; work collaboratively 
with university partners to develop prediction, avoidance, 
and remediation measures focused on environmental triggers in 
riverine ecosystems; and to advance state-of-the-art Unmanned 
Aerial Systems-based detection, monitoring, and mapping of 
invasive aquatic plant species in conjunction with university partners. 


Arkansas Red River Chloride Control.—The Corps is reminded of 
their existing obligations to continue operations and maintenance 
activities for the Red River Chloride Control project, Oklahoma and 
Texas, at federal expense and is also reminded that this project is 
eligible to compete for additional funding in this account. 

Asset Management/Facilities and Equipment Maintenance 
(FEM).—The agreement provides $2,000,000 to continue research 
on novel approaches to repair and maintenance practices that will 
increase civil infrastructure intelligence and resilience. The Corps 
is directed to provide to the Committees not later than 60 days 
after enactment of this Act a report on the status of this effort. The 
Corps was previously provided $1,000,000 under the Asset Management/
FEM remaining item to complete a study of their inventory 
in accordance with section 6002 of WRRDA of 2014. There is frustration 
regarding how long it has taken the Corps to make progress 
on this effort. Nonetheless, the second phase of inventory and assessment 
are currently ongoing, and the Corps is directed to provide 
to the Committees not later than 60 days after enactment of 
this Act a briefing that includes details on the percentage of the 
work that has already been done and a timeline for completion of 
the inventory. 


875 

Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Dispersal Barrier.—The Chicago 
Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC) dispersal barrier at Des 
Plaines River is a key control mechanism for protecting the Great 
Lakes from invasive carp. Over the last decade, the Corps has invested 
significant resources in building a permanent electric barrier 
on the Chicago Area Waterways System. Maximizing effectiveness 
of the CSSC can have significant immediate benefits for preventing 
spread of aquatic invasive species into the productive and 
ecologically diverse Great Lakes system. 

Coastal Inlets Research Program.—Communities, infrastructure, 
and resources tied to coastal regions are vulnerable to damage from 
extreme coastal events and long-term coastal change. The agreement 
includes additional funding for the Corps-led, multi-university 
effort to identify engineering frameworks to address coastal resilience 
needs; to develop adaptive pathways that lead to coastal 
resilience; for efforts that measure the coastal forces that lead to 
infrastructure damage and erosion during extreme storm events; 
and to improve coupling of terrestrial and coastal models. Additional 
funding is also provided for the Corps to continue work with 
NOAA’s National Water Center on protecting the nation’s water resources. 


Civil Works Water Management System.—Additional funding is 
included for incorporation of ensemble forecasts within the suite of 
numerical modeling tools in support of water management operations 
to advance the Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations 
(FIRO) effort. 

Dredging Operations and Environmental Research, Contaminated 
Sediment Management.—The assessment and management of contaminated 
sediments represents a significant cost to the federal 
government and impacts the nation’s inland and coastal navigation 
system affecting the free flow of commerce. There is a critical need 
for investment in technology and approaches to enable more cost 
effective and sustainable practices for the assessment and management 
of contaminated sediments. The Corps is directed to develop 
a public-private partnership focused on research, development, and 
implementation of solutions for the assessment and management of 
contaminated sediments through the Dredging Operations and Environmental 
Research program. 

Dredging Operations Technical Support Program.—The agreement 
provides $2,200,000 for the further development of the Integrated 
Navigation Analysis and Visualization platform related to 
the operation and maintenance of the U.S. Marine Transportation 
System. The agreement also includes additional funds to support 
the research and application of artificial intelligence, machine 
learning, and advanced modeling capabilities to improve 
streamflow forecasting for channel shoaling and dredging to help 
reduce interruptions in waterborne inland commerce as a result of 
flooding and other silting activities. The Corps is directed to provide 
to the Committees not later than 90 days after enactment of 
this Act a briefing on the potential need for evaluation of whether 
deeper and wider channels would improve supply chain performance 
throughout the southeast region of the country. 

Emerging Harbor Projects.—The agreement includes funding for 
individual projects defined as emerging harbor projects in section 


876 

210(f)(2) of WRDA of 1986 (Public Law 99–662) that exceeds the 
funding levels envisioned in sections 210(c)(3) and 210(d)(1)(B)(ii) of 
WRDA of 1986. 

Engineering With Nature.—The agreement provides $20,000,000 
for the Engineering with Nature (EWN) initiative. Funding under 
this line item is intended for EWN activities having a national or 
regional scope or that benefit the Corps’ broader execution of its 
mission areas. It is not intended to replace or preclude the appropriate 
use of EWN practices at districts using project-specific funding 
or work performed across other Corps programs that might involve 
EWN. Of the funding provided in this remaining item, 
$10,000,000 is provided to support research and development of 
natural infrastructure solutions for the nation’s bays and estuaries 
to reduce costs, environmental and aesthetic impacts, and improve 
access and health outcomes for the communities, economies, ecosystems, 
and defense installations that concentrate in the nation’s 
bays and estuaries, and to design innovative nature-based infrastructure 
with landscape architecture, coastal modeling, and engineering. 
Of the funding provided in this remaining item, 
$5,000,000 is to support ongoing research and advance work with 
university partners to develop standards, design guidance, and 
testing protocols to improve and standardize nature-based and hybrid 
infrastructure solutions, including those in drought and fire-
prone lands and post-fire recovery areas. 

Enhanced Options for Sand Acquisition for Beach Renourishment 
Projects.—The Corps is urged to provide states with guidance and 
recommendations to implement cost effective measures and planning 
for sand management. 

Flood and Earthquake Modeling.—Last fiscal year additional 
funds were provided in the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program 
to facilitate coordination with the National Levee Safety program 
to develop a plan for leveraging existing knowledge related 
to potential seismic concerns related to levees. The Corps is evaluating 
whether earthquake models would aid in assessment and if 
collaboration with universities would be beneficial. The Corps is directed 
to provide to the Committees not later than 90 days of enactment 
of this Act a briefing on the progress to date and any recommended 
future work. 

Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act.— 
The Corps is directed to provide to the Committees not later than 
90 days after enactment of this Act a briefing on the effort to coordinate 
the federal response to harmful algal bloom activities. 

Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, Washington.—The agreement reiterates 
House direction. 

Inland Water Navigation Charts.—The agreement provides 
$2,000,000 for the eHydro program to modernize and enhance the 
distribution of the navigation charts and an additional $2,000,000 
to support the transition of the National Dredging Quality Management 
Program’s automated dredging monitoring data to a cloud environment. 


Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam.—The agreement reiterates House 
direction. 

Kennebec River Long-Term Maintenance Dredging.—There is continued 
support for the Memorandum of Agreement signed in Janu



877 

ary 2019 denoting responsibilities between the Department of the 
Army and the Department of the Navy for the regular maintenance 
of the Kennebec River Federal Navigation Channel. Maintenance 
dredging of the Kennebec is essential to the safe passage of newly 
constructed Navy guided missile destroyers to the Atlantic Ocean. 
The Secretary is directed to continue collaborating with the Department 
of the Navy to ensure regular maintenance dredging of the 
Kennebec. 

Lake Okeechobee, Florida.—The Corps is encouraged to use the 
best available science and appropriately weigh the concerns of all 
water users to ensure the ecosystem is preserved, water supply for 
the eight million residents in South Florida is maintained, and the 
safety of all residents of the region is upheld. 

Lake Providence Harbor, Louisiana.—The agreement reiterates 
House direction. 

Lake Sakakawea & Lake Oahe Recreation Facilities.—There is 
support for the coordinated efforts by the Corps with state and 
local stakeholders to maintain recreational areas and related infrastructure 
at mainstem Missouri River reservoirs during drought 
conditions. However, there is disappointment in the fact that the 
Corps has not provided a long-term plan to restore and maintain 
recreational facilities near Lake Sakakawea and Lake Oahe as recommended 
in fiscal year 2020. The Corps is directed to report not 
later than 60 days after enactment of this Act with a plan that 
identifies funding sources to address the deferred maintenance 
backlog in these areas and repair boat ramps and access roads to 
these facilities. 

Levee Safety.—The agreement provides additional funding for the 
National (Levee) Flood Inventory, including $3,150,000 to expedite 
work on non-federal levees in meeting the requirements of section 
131 of WRDA of 2020. The Corps is directed to provide to the Committees 
not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act a briefing 
on this effort. In fiscal year 2020, Congress provided 
$15,000,000 to implement levee safety initiatives to meet the requirements 
under section 3016 of WRRDA of 2014. These funds are 
sufficient to complete Phase II activities. The Corps is directed to 
provide to the Committees not later than 30 days after enactment 
of this Act a briefing on the status of these activities and activities 
associated with section 3016 of WRRDA of 2014, including any additional 
funding needs identified to complete and a timeline for implementation 
of the next phase. 

Missouri River Operations.—The Corps intends to conduct a test 
flow regarding releases of water from the Missouri River mainstem 
dams in the future. The Corps is directed to provide to the Committees 
not later than 30 days prior to such a release a report that 
includes 1) the rationale for conducting such a test flow; 2) the expected 
implications for water access along the Missouri River; and 

3) steps the Corps has taken to reduce or mitigate the effects of a 
test flow on water access. 
Mobile Bay Beneficial Use of Dredged Material.—The Corps is 
encouraged to examine beneficial uses of dredged material in Mobile 
Bay, Alabama. 

Monitoring of Completed Navigation Projects, Fisheries.—There 
is concern that a reduction in or elimination of navigational lock 


878 

operations on the nation’s inland waterways is having a negative 
impact on river ecosystems, particularly the ability of endangered, 
threatened, and game fish species to migrate through waterways, 
particularly during critical spawning periods. Preliminary research 
successfully indicates that reduced lock operations on certain 
Corps-designated low-use waterways are directly impacting migration 
and that there are effective means to mitigate the impacts. 
Maximizing the ability of fish to use these locks to move past the 
dams has the potential to restore natural and historic long-distance 
river migrations that may be critical to species survival. 

Within available funds for ongoing work, the Corps is directed to 
continue this research at not less than the fiscal year 2022 level. 
The agreement provides $4,000,000 to expand the research to assist 
the Corps across all waterways, lock structures, lock operation 
methods, and fish species that will more fully inform the Corps’ operations. 
Additionally, the agreement provides $2,000,000 for the 
NICE effort by the Corps to expand, on a national basis, the ongoing 
research on the impact of reduced lock operations on riverine 
fish. 

Monitoring of Completed Navigation Projects, Structural Health 
Monitoring.—The agreement provides $4,000,000 to support the 
structural health monitoring program to facilitate research to 
maximize operations, enhance efficiency, and protect asset life 
through catastrophic failure mitigation. 

Mount St. Helens Sediment Monitoring.—The Corps is encouraged 
to include appropriate funding for sediment monitoring activities 
in future budget submissions. 

National Coastal Mapping Program.—The agreement provides 
$5,000,000 for Arctic coastal mapping needs. The Corps has responsibility 
for some mapping but, in general, does not include shoreline. 
Before the Corps obligates funds to map shoreline in Alaska, 
the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works shall provide 
notice to the Committees. The notice shall include certification that 
the effort is coordinated with NOAA and complements those efforts. 

Okatibbee Lake, Mississippi.—The agreement reiterates House 
direction. 

Ohio Harbors.—The Corps is reminded that the Toledo, Huron, 
Port Clinton, Lorain, and Sandusky Harbors are eligible to compete 
for additional funding in this account. 

Performance Based Budgeting Support Program.—Of the funding 
provided for this remaining item, $3,500,000 shall be used to support 
performance-based methods that enable robust budgeting of 
the hydropower program through better understanding of operation 
and maintenance impacts leveraging data analytics. 

Recreational Facilities.—The Corps is directed to provide to the 
Committees not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act a 
report including an analysis of current lease terms and the effects 
these terms have on concessionaire financing. 

Regional Dredge Contracting.—In accordance with section 1111 
of AWIA and the Gulf Coast Regional Dredge Demonstration Program 
established by Public Law 116–94, the Corps is encouraged 
to enter into regional contracts to support increased efficiencies in 
the deployment of dredges for all civil works mission sets, 
prioritizing deep draft navigational projects. 


879 

Regional Sediment Management.—The agreement provides 
$4,000,000 to develop integrated tools that build coastal resilience 
across navigation, flood risk management, and ecosystem projects 
within the program, integrate existing and emerging physical 
coastal processing tools that focus on sediment management, and 
apply optimization principles to placement in order to gain greater 
value and benefit from dredged sediments, particularly for Civil 
Works business lines and missions. The Corps is directed to conduct 
a study and provide a report to the Committees not later than 
one year after enactment of this Act on how the Corps could apply 
dredged sediments to better increase coastal resilience and what 
resources are needed to implement these practices. Additionally, 
the agreement provides $600,000 for cooperation and coordination 
with the Great Lakes states to develop sediment transport models 
for Great Lakes tributaries that discharge to federal navigation 
channels. 

Response to Climate Change at Corps Projects.—The agreement 
provides $2,000,000 to update policies to enhance the consideration 
of benefit categories equally and improve efforts to identify and 
consider impacts to disadvantaged, rural/urban, tribal, and other 
minority communities throughout the Corps planning and decision-
making processes. 

Small, Remote, or Subsistence Harbors.—The agreement emphasizes 
the importance of ensuring that our country’s small and low-
use ports remain functional. The Corps is urged to consider expediting 
scheduled maintenance at small and low-use ports that have 
experienced unexpected levels of deterioration since their last 
dredging. There is concern that the Administration’s criteria for 
navigation maintenance disadvantage small, remote, or subsistence 
harbors and waterways from competing for scarce navigation maintenance 
funds. The Corps is directed to revise the criteria used for 
determining which navigation maintenance projects are funded and 
to develop a reasonable and equitable allocation under the Operation 
and Maintenance account. There is support for including criteria 
to evaluate economic impact that these projects provide to 
local and regional economies. 

Stakeholder Engagement.—The agreement reiterates House direction. 


Tampa Harbor, Florida.—The agreement reiterates House direction. 


Tangier Island, Beneficial Use.—Additional funding recommended 
for Baltimore Harbor and Channels (50 foot) project is 
for environmental coordination as well as plans and specifications 
to add Tangier Island as a beneficial use placement site for dredged 
material. 

Tenkiller Ferry Lake.—The Corps’ effort to use flows out of the 
surge tank to feed the fishery downstream of the Tenkiller Ferry 
Lake is encouraging, and the Corps is strongly encouraged to complete 
the assessment as soon as possible. 

Tuttle Creek Lake, KS.—The additional funding provided is for 
Water Injection Dredging efforts. 

Upper St. Anthony Falls, Minnesota.—The Corps is reminded 
that the Upper St. Anthony Falls project remains an authorized 
federal project and is encouraged to continue to operate and main



880 

tain the lock and keep it in a state of good repair. There is concern 
that the Corps is attempting to divest the entire federal project at 
once without a willing non-federal partner for the disposition study. 
The Corps is directed to continue the disposition study at full federal 
expense. 

Walter F. George, George W. Andrews, and Jim Woodruff Locks 
and Dams.—The Corps is reminded that repair and maintenance 
needs for the Walter F. George Lock and Dam, the George W. Andrews 
Lock and Dam, and the Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam are eligible 
to compete for additional funding provided in this account and 
is encouraged to include appropriate funding for these activities in 
future budget submissions. The Corps is directed to provide to the 
Committees not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act a 
briefing on these projects and the status of dredging in the lower 
Apalachicola River. 

Water Control Manuals.—The Corps is encouraged to continue to 
update water control manuals across its projects. The agreement 
provides additional funding of $5,700,000 in this account for other 
authorized project purposes, for water control manual updates at 
projects located in states where a Reclamation facility is also located, 
in regions where FIRO projects exist, and where atmospheric 
rivers cause flood damages. The agreement also provides 
$1,000,000 of additional funding provided in this account for other 
authorized project purposes to expand the scope of the water control 
manual update prioritization report funded in fiscal year 2020 
to other projects within the Corps portfolio to ensure that actions 
being conducted for water control manual updates and incorporation 
of FIRO-based principles are properly aligned with one another. 


Water Control Manuals, Section 7 Dams.—The agreement provides 
$2,200,000 of additional funding provided in this account for 
other authorized project purposes to update water control manuals 
for non-Corps owned high hazard dams where: (1) the Corps has 
a responsibility for flood control operations under section 7 of the 
Flood Control Act of 1944; (2) the dam requires coordination of 
water releases with one or more other high-hazard dams for flood 
control purposes; and (3) the dam owner is actively investigating 
the feasibility of applying FIRO technology. 

Water Operations Technical Support (WOTS).—The agreement 
provides $5,000,000 in addition to the budget request to continue 
developing and incorporating improved weather forecasting for 
Corps reservoirs and waterway projects through the multiagency, 
multidisciplinary FIRO research effort by completing Phase 2 and 
starting Phase 3. The Corps is encouraged to consider applying 
FIRO to additional section 7 dams, including the Seven Oaks Dam 
in California. 

REGULATORY PROGRAM 

The agreement includes $218,000,000 for the Regulatory Program. 
Funds above the budget request are included to address capacity 
needs across the Corps related to staffing shortages in Corps 
districts. The Corps is encouraged to budget appropriately in order 
to process permits in a timely fashion. 

Chehalis Basin.—The agreement reiterates House direction. 


881 

Mitigation Banking.—The Corps is encouraged to ensure sufficient 
staffing levels to efficiently and expeditiously process mitigation 
bank applications. 

Permit Application Backlogs.—The agreement reiterates House 
direction. The Corps is directed to provide to the Committees not 
later than 90 days after enactment of this Act a report on staffing 
levels and permit backlogs in each of the last five years, as well 
as a plan for rectifying the staffing shortages. The Corps is directed 
to brief the Committees on the results of the report upon completion. 


Shellfish Permitting.—The Corps is encouraged to work with 
Clean Water Act enforcing agencies to uphold a fair permitting system 
that protects the nation’s waters and balances the needs of the 
economy and communities. 

FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAM 

The agreement includes $400,000,000 for the Formerly Utilized 
Sites Remedial Action Program. 

FLOOD CONTROL AND COASTAL EMERGENCIES 

The agreement includes $35,000,000 for Flood Control and Coastal 
Emergencies. As the nation experiences severe weather events 
more frequently, the agreement notes appreciation for the work the 
Corps undertakes with this funding. The Administration is reminded 
that traditionally, funding for disaster response has been 
provided in supplemental appropriations legislation, including recently 
in 2021 (Public Law 117–43), and that amounts necessary to 
address damages at Corps projects in response to natural disasters 
can be significant. The Administration is again reminded that it 
has been deficient in providing to the Committees detailed estimates 
of damages to Corps projects as required by Public Law 115– 
123 and shall submit such report not later than 15 days after enactment 
of this Act and monthly thereafter. 

EXPENSES 

The agreement includes $215,000,000 for Expenses. 

Additional funds recommended in this account shall be used to 
support implementation of the Corps’ Civil Works program, including 
hiring additional full-time equivalents. This includes developing 
and issuing policy guidance; managing Civil Works program; and 
providing national coordination of and participation in forums and 
events within headquarters, the division offices, and meeting other 
enterprise requirements and operating expenses. The Corps is encouraged 
to pursue updating the 2011 U.S. Army Manpower Analysis 
Agency staffing analysis based on current Civil Works needs. 

OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS 

The agreement includes $5,000,000 for the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. The agreement includes legislative 
language that restricts the availability of 25 percent of the 
funding provided in this account until such time as at least 95 percent 
of the additional funding provided in each account has been 
allocated to specific programs, projects, or activities. This restric



882 

tion shall not affect the roles and responsibilities established in 
previous fiscal years of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the 
Army for Civil Works, the Corps headquarters, the Corps field operating 
agencies, or any other executive branch agency. 

A timely and accessible executive branch in the course of fulfilling 
its constitutional role in the appropriations process is essential. 
The requesting and receiving of basic, factual information, 
such as budget justification materials, is vital in order to maintain 
a transparent and open governing process. The agreement recognizes 
that some discussions internal to the executive branch are 
pre-decisional in nature and, therefore, not subject to disclosure. 
However, the access to facts, figures, and statistics that inform 
these decisions are not subject to this same sensitivity and are critical 
to the budget process. The Administration shall ensure timely 
and complete responses to these inquiries.

inclusion; set benchmarks for measuring progress; and offer 
recommendations for advancing financial inclusion through public

1173 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 

SALARIES AND EXPENSES 

The bill provides $390,192,000 for salaries and expenses of the

$390,192,000 be derived from offsetting collections, resulting in no 
net appropriation. 

9–1–1.—The FCC is commended for requiring the deployment of 
vertical location technology to ensure that the location of 9–1–1 
calls is transmitted at the time of the call delivery and is directed 
to brief the Committees on what other actions can be taken to improve 
9–1–1 reliability. 

Agency Coordination.—In recognition of their vital role in advancing 
and preserving universal communication services, the FCC 
is encouraged to coordinate efforts with the Rural Utility Service 
to optimize the use of limited resources and promote broadband deployment 
in rural America. 

Contraband Cell Phones.—The agreement notes continued concerns 
regarding the exploitation of contraband cell phones in prisons 
and jails nationwide. The FCC is encouraged to continue to explore

Promoting Digital Expansion.—Far too many individuals residing 
in low-income areas and communities of color lack access to high-
speed Internet service. The FCC is commended for its commitment 
to implement the Congressional mandate in the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act and is urged to act expeditiously on this

unserved and underserved areas in all Universal Service Fund

FEDERAL PERMITTING IMPROVEMENT STEERING COUNCIL

Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council Environmental 
Review Improvement Fund with $350,000,000 to remain available 
through September 30, 2031, of which $70,000,000 is for fiscal year

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

SALARIES AND EXPENSES 

The bill provides $430,000,000 for salaries and expenses of the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This appropriation is partially 
offset by premerger filing and Telemarketing Sales Rule fees estimated 
at $190,000,000 and $20,000,000, respectively. 


1175 

With the concurrence of the Committees, the FTC may choose to 
provide a briefing to the Committees in lieu of providing a required 
report. 

Consumer Right to Repair.—In lieu of House report language, the 
agreement notes the FTC’s ongoing work examining how manufacturers, 
particularly mobile phone and car manufacturers, may limit 
repairs by consumers and repair shops, and how those limitations 
may increase costs, limit choice, and impact consumers’ rights 
under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The FTC’s ‘‘Nixing the 
Fix’’ report includes assertions that manufacturers are exploiting 
their access to consumers’ telematics data while limiting those 
same consumers from accessing their own data or from sharing 
such access with independent repair shops. Following up on the report, 
the agreement directs the FTC to prioritize investigations and 
enforcement efforts that protect consumers from unfair acts limiting 
competition, specifically stemming from manufacturers’ control 
over telematics systems. 

Food Marketed to Children.—The agreement notes that no funding 
for the Federal Trade Commission may be used to complete the 
draft report on food marketed to children as described in the House 
report. 

Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act.—The agreement supports 
continued implementation of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety 
Act (P.L. 116–260) to promote fairness and increase safety in the 
horseracing industry. 

Imported Shrimp.—The FTC is strongly encouraged to continue 
to enforce its Section 5 reviews of deceptive practices tied to country-
of-origin labeling for imported shrimp. Imported shrimp account 
for more than 90 percent of the shrimp consumed in the United 
States, yet there is widespread use of illegal veterinary drugs and 
overuse of antibiotics by foreign bad actors. The FTC is urged to 
coordinate its enforcement and proper origin requirements for the 
benefit of U.S. consumers with Customs and Border Protection, the 
Department of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration 
to close any country-of-origin labeling gaps and prevent deceptive 
practices for imported shrimp. 

Made in U.S.A.—There are continuing concerns that, for companies 
that brazenly violate the FTC Act’s prohibition on deception 
by falsely labeling wholly imported products as ‘‘Made in U.S.A.,’’ 
the FTC has often settled charges without requiring the company 
to disgorge its ill-gotten gains or admit liability. The agreement 
recommends that the FTC seek aggressive remedies for ‘‘Made in 
U.S.A.’’ violators, including through tougher settlements and the 
use of its powers under both section 5(m) of the FTC Act and the 
FTC’s recently finalized Made in U.S.A. Labeling Rule. 

Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Study.—The FTC is urged to 
expeditiously execute its 6(b) study of pharmacy benefits managers’ 
business practices. The study should identify acts and practices 
that may be either unlawful today or contrary to the public interest 
in obtaining safe and affordable medicines, and provide recommendations 
to Congress and the Administration. 

Section 13(b).—The Supreme Court recently ruled that Section 
13(b) of the FTC Act permits the FTC to obtain only injunctions 
and not monetary redress for victims of violations of laws enforced 


1176 

by the FTC. Therefore, victimized consumers will have less of an 
opportunity via Section 13(b) to get their money back. The FTC is 
encouraged to work with Congress to address this issue.

House report directive in Construction and Acquisition on Land 
Ports-of-Entry Study. 

Innovative Wood Products.—The agreement directs GSA to evaluate 
the use of innovative wood products as a green building material 
and potential aid in carbon storage, which can deliver a cost-
effective and sustainable path to reduce excessive hazardous fuels 
loads and foster long-term forest resilience by expanding markets 
for low-grade and low-value wood, providing economic diversity for 
forest communities and reducing wildfire risk in the process. GSA 
is encouraged to continue to partner with industry to identify opportunities

Island. DHS and GSA are encouraged to work expeditiously on the 
Plum Island Closure and Sale project and to consider a Federal 
conservation outcome for the island, should the Department of Interior 
or another Federal agency express an interest in acquiring 
the property through a Federal transfer for conservation and related 
activities. 

Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) in Public Buildings.— 
In addition to the House report directive on Automated External 
Defibrillators (AEDs) in public buildings, the agreement directs 
GSA to work with the Department of Health and Human Services 
to examine whether AEDs should be required in federally owned 
buildings under the custody and control of GSA. GSA and HHS 


1179 

shall issue an updated FMR bulletin no later than 1 year after enactment 
of this Act. 

GENERAL ACTIVITIES 

GOVERNMENT–WIDE POLICY 

The bill provides $71,186,000 for GSA government-wide policy 
activities. 

Library of Buildings.—In lieu of House report language, the 
agreement directs GSA to create a ‘‘library of buildings’’ comprised 
of a representative group of ‘‘typical’’ as-built projects to establish 
baseline embodied carbon through whole building life cycle assessments 
for government construction projects. Using standard based 
metrics from Life Cycle Inventory and a set of standard-based 
Whole Building Life Cycle Assessment practices, GSA is directed to 
analyze and evaluate existing buildings to assess their embodied 
carbon levels. The data would be made accessible to the public and 
inform future policy direction on reductions below the baselines to 
maximize carbon reduction in federal buildings. 

Brooks Act.—The agreement directs GSA to not award or facilitate 
the award of any contract for the provision of architectural, engineering, 
and related services in a manner inconsistent with the 
procedures in the Brooks Act (40 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) and part 36.6 
of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

The bill provides $74,583,000 for the Office of Inspector General. 

ALLOWANCES AND OFFICE STAFF FOR FORMER PRESIDENTS 

The bill provides $5,200,000 for allowances and office staff for 
former Presidents. 

FEDERAL CITIZEN SERVICES FUND 

(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) 

The bill provides $90,000,000 for deposit into the Federal Citizen 
Services Fund and authorizes use of appropriations, revenues, and 
collections in the Fund in an aggregate amount not to exceed

Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act.—The agreement 
includes up to $5,000,000 for implementation of the Foundations 
for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Public Law 115–435). 
GSA is urged to develop guidance to ensure all relevant external 
stakeholders are provided the opportunity to comment. GSA is en



1180 

couraged to work towards consolidating existing and leveraging 
new commercial technologies to implement Federal data initiatives 
and carry out pilot projects related to the implementation of the 
OPEN Government Data Act and to expand the data.gov platform 
further to implement these initiatives. 

Credential Service Providers.—In lieu of House report language, 
the agreement directs GSA to promote government-wide policy that 
leverages portable identity and multiple credential service providers 
(CSPs) independently certified against the requisite National 
Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines for the highest 
possible pass rates, fraud prevention, and cost reduction. 

Federal Government IT Investments.—The current funding for 
Federal Government information technology (IT), especially the 
siloed nature in which agencies acquire, deploy, and oversee their 
IT investments, impedes the development, maintenance and ongoing 
improvement of shared technology platforms and services that 
address common needs across agencies. The inability of government 
systems to interface and interact with each other makes it 
exceptionally harder for Americans to easily and securely access 
benefits and makes it easier for people to defraud the government. 
Some fraud uncovered in pandemic relief programs could have been 
avoided if federal agencies were able to make data available to 
other agencies in ways that improved program administration, reduced 
administrative burden to citizens, and limited the ability of 
bad actors to exploit common weaknesses across programs. 

Section 753 of this Act authorizes the transfer of funds to GSA 
to finance an appropriate share of various IT projects that support 
modernization, customer experience, and cybersecurity efforts 
across the federal enterprise. The GSA Administrator, in consultation 
with the Office of Management and Budget and, as appropriate, 
other federal agencies, is directed to identify, define, and 
produce a prioritized list of the common challenges or needs across 
agencies that would benefit from shared technical solutions or ways 
to make data more accessible and interoperable across one or more 
agency IT systems, including specific examples and recommendations 
and report to the Committees no later than 180 days after enactment 
of this Act. 

The Government Accountability Office is directed to identify statutes 
or agency policies that currently inhibit the adoption of shared 
technology platforms and services, and make recommendations on 
changes—either within agency procedures or statute—that would 
remove these obstacles. 

TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FUND 

The bill provides $50,000,000 for the Technology Modernization 
Fund for technology-related modernization activities. 

WORKING CAPITAL FUND 

The bill provides $5,900,000 for the Working Capital Fund for 
necessary costs to modernize e-rulemaking systems.

charges assessed by GSA. 

Section 524 permits GSA to pay certain construction-related 
claims against the Federal Government from savings achieved in 
other projects. 

Section 525 requires that the delineated area of procurement for 
leased space match the approved prospectus, unless the Administrator 
provides an explanatory statement to the appropriate Congressional 
committees. 

Section 526 requires a spending plan for the Federal Citizen 
Services Fund.

The bill provides $385,708,000 for salaries and expenses of Office 
of Personnel Management (OPM). Within the amount provided, 
$190,784,000 is a direct appropriation and $194,924,000 is a transfer 
from OPM trust funds. These amounts support 34 new full-time 
equivalents for Retirement Services and $19,373,000 for information 
technology modernization. 

Transparency in Political Appointments.—In lieu of House report 
language on transparency in political appointments, the agreement 
recommends that OPM include political appointee data in 
Fedscope. 

Wildland Firefighter Classification and Pay.—OPM is directed to 
analyze how pay for wildland and other firefighters employed by 
the Federal Government might be modified or reformed to address 
concerns about pay-related matters, such as classification and work 
hours, and report to the Committees on its findings no later than 
90 days after enactment of this Act. OPM should use this information 
to assess the need for special rates of pay under section 5305 
of title 5, United States Code, for Federal wildland firefighters, including 
estimates of the cost of providing any proposed special 
rates and include that information in its reporting. 

Exploring Tools for Prescription Drug Price Transparency in the 
Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) Program.—OPM is directed 
to explore and evaluate the benefits and potential overall 
cost savings resulting from FEHB Carriers’ implementation of 
Internet-based self-service tools that deliver transparency and clinical 
decision support on prescription drug costs to its members. 
OPM is directed to report to the Committees one year after enactment 
of this Act, contingent on the availability of funding for this 
study. 

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Police.—The agreement 
recognizes the difficulty of designating the members of the FBI police 
and other General Schedule police officers as law enforcement 
officers for retirement purposes and the need to review pay levels 
for police officers in the General Schedule. GAO shall conduct a 
study of the FBI and other agencies that employ General Schedule 
police officers and report to the Committees regarding the issues

resulting in no net appropriation. 

Climate Change Risks to Municipal Bond Markets.—The agreement 
does not adopt the House report directive on State and local 
municipal bond markets. 

Data Security and the Consolidated Audit Trail.—The SEC continues 
to collect an increasing amount of market-sensitive data and 
customer information-including through the Consolidated Audit 
Trail (CAT). As a repository for sensitive market data, the security 
of the CAT system and the data included within it is paramount. 
The Commission is strongly urged, in their oversight of FINRA, to 
ensure the CAT has adequate breach notification policies in place 
so affected participants are promptly notified of critical security 
events. 

International Financial Reporting.—The agreement notes that investors 
have expressed the need for more material information 
about the international financial operations of public companies in 
order to assess risk and inform investment decisions, and encourages 
the SEC to consider promulgating requirements for public 
companies to disclose basic financial information on a country-by-
country basis. 

Reserve Fund Notifications.—The SEC’s adherence to its obligation 
to notify Congress of the date, amount, and purpose of any obligation 
from the Reserve Fund within 10 days of such obligation 
is appreciated. The SEC is directed, in its written notifications to 
Congress required by 15 U.S.C. 78d(i)(3), to specify: (1) the balance 
in the fund remaining available after the obligation is deducted; (2) 
the estimated total cost of the project for which amounts are being 
deducted; (3) the total amount for all projects that have withdrawn 
funding from the fund since fiscal year 2012; and (4) the estimated 
amount, per project, that will be required to complete all ongoing

Act, a detailed spending plan for the allocation of expenditures 
from the fund. 

Small Business Outreach.—SEC is directed to submit a report no 
later than 120 days after enactment of this Act detailing outreach 
to small businesses and investors, particularly women and minority-
owned small businesses, and how the SEC can incorporate this 
outreach into each rulemaking. 

Special Purpose Acquisition Companies.—Special Purpose Acquisition 
Companies (SPACs) raise investor funds through an initial 
public offering with the goal of acquiring and merging with a private 
company within a two-year window. SPACs are becoming 
more popular but the risks that come with these companies are not 
always clear to everyday investors. The SEC is encouraged to use 
their authority to provide retail-friendly disclosures for SPACs. 

SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM

Small Business Administration (SBA). The agreement includes at 
least $12,000,000 for SBA’s Office of Credit Risk Management 
(OCRM) for lender oversight and risk-based reviews. Funding for 
the Office of General Counsel is provided separately from this 
amount. OCRM must play a key role in eliminating waste, fraud, 
and abuse in SBA lending programs and protecting taxpayer losses 
on loans by ensuring lenders comply with procedures that mitigate 
the risk of loss under SBA’s loan programs. 

District Office Staffing Levels.—Adequate staffing at district offices 
is essential to SBA’s mission. District offices offer a critical 
line of communication and source of advice for small businesses, especially 
during the pandemic, when so many businesses and entrepreneurs 
relied on SBA services. SBA is directed to provide a report 
to the Committees no later than 90 days after enactment of 
this Act on the staffing and budget level for each district office for 
the past five fiscal years. 

Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Collaboration.— 
SBA is directed to continue its collaborative effort with the SEC to 
ensure effective oversight of SBICs and the protection of SBIC investors. 


Small Business Investment Company Concentration.—Due to concerns 
about the geographic concentration of SBICs, the agreement 
supports the inclusion of additional reporting requirements on 
small business investment activities and encourages SBA to conduct 
Investment Committee interviews on-site or as close to the applicant’s 
physical location as possible. 

2017 Hurricane Recommendations.—The agreement notes that 
SBA has implemented two recommendations for Executive Action 
made by the Government Accountability Office in the report ‘‘Disaster 
Loan Processing Was Timelier, but Planning Improvements 
and Pilot Program Evaluation Needed,’’ and expects SBA to implement 
the remaining recommendations. 

Disaster Loan Assistance Portal.—SBA is encouraged to migrate 
the Disaster Loan Assistance Portal to the cloud to improve the 
user experience by making it more user-friendly, accessible, and intuitive. 


Information Technology Modernization.—The agreement recognizes 
the importance of IT systems modernization and performance 
to fulfilling SBA’s mission. The agreement notes SBA’s authority to 
utilize a working capital fund to help SBA implement IT modernization 
projects that comply with the intent of Congress in the 
Federal Information Technology Acquisition Act to eliminate waste, 
fraud, and abuse in Federal IT enterprise programs. 

Native Hawaiian Organizations.—There is concern that Native 
Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) are not treated as 8(a) eligible entities 
by all Federal agencies, and expects SBA to work closely with 
Congress to provide equal opportunities to NHOs.

Grants Management System.—SBA is directed to provide a report 
no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act on the implementation 
of a new grants management system and the timeline for 
completion. 

Cybersecurity for Small Businesses.—The agreement recommends 
$3,000,000 for a Cybersecurity Assistance Pilot Program that will 
competitively award up to three grants to States to provide new 
small businesses with access to cybersecurity tools during their 
formative and most vulnerable years. 

Federal and State Technology Partnership (FAST) Program.— 
The agreement notes the FAST program’s efforts to reach innovative, 
technology-driven small businesses and to leverage the Small 
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology 
Transfer (STTR) programs to stimulate economic development. 
The FAST program is particularly important in States that 
are seeking to build high technology industries but are underrepresented 
in the SBIR/STTR programs. SBA is directed to consider 
prioritizing awards to States that receive below the national median 
average of SBIRs/STTRs. Small Business and Technology Development 
Centers (SBTDCs) serve small businesses in these fields 
and are accredited to provide intellectual property and technology 
commercialization assistance to businesses in high technology industries. 
Of the amount provided for FAST, $1,500,000 shall be for 
FAST awards to SBTDCs fully accredited for technology designation 
as of December 31, 2022. 

Growth Accelerators.—The agreement recognizes the success of 
Growth Accelerators in spreading the growth of start-ups in areas 
of the country where funding from private capital is scarce. Within 
amounts provided for growth accelerators, SBA shall prioritize 
funding to applications from rural areas that have not previously 
received an award. 

HUBZone.—SBA is encouraged to update and implement 
HUBZone guidance, as well as implement a plan to mitigate infor



1191 

mation technology issues affecting the HUBZone certification process.

encourages SBA to reevaluate the eligibility criteria established 
in the fiscal year 2019 request for proposal (RFP) for Regional Innovation 
Clusters and directs SBA to brief the Committees on the 
eligibility criteria for the fiscal year 2022 RFP no less than 30 days 
prior to its publication. 

SCORE.—The SCORE program has made several improvements 
to address issues identified in SBA Office of Inspector General’s 
audit of SCORE’s fiscal year 2017 award. The agreement supports 
efforts by SCORE to continue to improve program operations and 
strengthen financial monitoring and accountability. 

Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs).—Subject to the 
availability of funds, the Administrator shall, to the extent practicable, 
ensure that a small business development center is appropriately 
reimbursed within the same fiscal year in which the expenses 
are submitted for reimbursement for any and all legitimate 
expenses incurred in carrying out activities under section 21(a)(1) 
et seq. of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648(a)(1) et seq.). 

SBDC Minimum Funding Awards.—SBA should assess the minimum 
funding levels awarded to States and U.S. territories 
through the SBDC Program to ensure adequate resources are provided 
to meet the demand of each State. 

Women’s Business Centers.—SBA is encouraged to refine and 
share its quarterly dashboard of performance goals with all WBCs 
for transparency and coordinate services with other business assistance 
programs to avoid duplication. 

OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL 

The bill provides $32,020,000 for the Office of Inspector General

the business loans programs. 

DISASTER LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

The bill provides $179,000,000 for the administrative costs of the 
Disaster Loans Program, of which $143,000,000 is designated as 


1192 

being for disaster relief for major disasters and $36,000,000 is provided 
for the authorized expenses of administering SBA-declared 
disasters. 

Examining Disparities in Disaster Assistance.—SBA is directed to 
conduct an internal review of its disaster recovery program implementation 
practices to identify if any current practices leave out or 
provide unequal outcomes for communities of color and economically-
disadvantaged communities; and, if so, develop recommendations 
on executive and legislative actions that could improve outcomes. 
Further, GAO is directed to provide a report to the Committees 
no later than 270 days after enactment of this Act, on recovery 
outcomes in communities that received SBA disaster recovery support 
and identify how SBA programs address the needs of economically-
disadvantaged communities or communities of color. 

SBA Disaster Loan Duplication of Assistance.—There is concern 
that some disaster victims are penalized with disaster benefit reductions 
if they apply for SBA disaster loans, but wind up not taking 
the loan when other Federal assistance is awarded. SBA is 
urged to issue guidance relating to the consideration of whether an 
applicant was approved for but declined assistance from SBA under 
section 7(b) of the Small Business Act. 

Business Recovery Centers.—SBA is encouraged to continue its 
close collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) during disaster recovery and consider additional co-location 
of Business Recovery Centers and Disaster Recovery Centers 
where economically practicable.

over the past 10 years, the OIG has contributed over $33 million 
in forfeited funds to the Postal Service Fund, either from cases 
where it was the lead investigating agency or as a participant in

that the OIG no longer has access to proceeds in the Fund, as it 
has had for the past 17 years.

The following is an explanation of Division F, which makes appropriations 
for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for 
fiscal year 2023. Funding provided in this agreement sustains existing 
programs that protect the nation from all manner of threats 
and ensures DHS’s ability to improve preparedness at the federal, 
state, local, tribal, and territorial levels; prevent and respond to 
terrorist attacks; and hire, train, and equip DHS frontline personnel 
protecting the country. 

The joint explanatory statement (JES) accompanying this division 
indicates congressional intent. Unless otherwise specifically 
noted in this JES, directives set forth in House Report 117–396 
carry the same weight as those included in the JES. While some 
directives from the House report may be repeated in the JES for 
emphasis, this should not be interpreted as establishing other directives 
from the House report as lesser priorities. 

References in the JES to ‘‘the Committees’’ or ‘‘the Committees 
on Appropriations’’ should be interpreted as both the House Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Homeland Security and the Senate Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Homeland Security. 

This JES refers to certain entities, persons, funds, and documents 
as follows: the Department of Homeland Security is referenced 
as DHS or the Department; the Government Accountability 
Office is referenced as GAO; and the Office of Inspector General of 
the Department of Homeland Security is referenced as OIG. In addition, 
‘‘full-time equivalents’’ are referred to as FTE; ‘‘full-time positions’’ 
are referenced as FTP; ‘‘Information Technology’’ is referred 
to as IT; ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ is referred to as 
PPA; any reference to ‘‘the Secretary’’ should be interpreted to 
mean the Secretary of Homeland Security; ‘‘component’’ should be 
interpreted to mean an agency, administration, or directorate within 
DHS; any reference to SLTT should be interpreted to mean 
state, local, tribal, and territorial governments; and ‘‘budget request’’ 
or ‘‘the request’’ should be interpreted to mean the budget 
of the U.S. Government for fiscal year 2023 that was submitted to 
Congress on March 28, 2022.

December 20, 2022 by Mr. Leahy of Vermont, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations.

appropriate anti-harassment protocols are in place for all personnel. 
CBP shall also ensure that staff are trained to recognize 
signs of trauma exposure, understand common behaviors of people 
exposed to trauma, and on trauma-informed practices. 

Resource Prioritization.—CBP is directed to provide a bimonthly 
briefing to the Committees on its efforts to evaluate CBP-wide 
workload, capabilities, assets, and human resource gaps; describe 
how those gaps impact mission performance; and use the results of 
the ongoing analyses to support the development of the fiscal year 
2024 budget request. 

BORDER SECURITY OPERATIONS 

Assessing Commercial Satellite Radio Frequency (RF).—CBP is 
directed to continue pilot programs and other efforts to evaluate 
the use of commercial satellite radio frequency (RF) collections to 
improve situational awareness near the land borders of the United 


1312 

States, including how RF collection can be integrated into existing 
surveillance and reconnaissance architectures. 

Border Barriers.—Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this 
Act, the Commissioner shall provide an update on the work of the 
multi-agency working group established to identify the impacts of 
complete and incomplete border security infrastructure on border 
security, communities, tribes, wildlife, and local environments, including 
the impacts of erosion and improper drainage associated 
with partially complete infrastructure projects, as well as its plan 
for addressing such impacts. 

Border Patrol Hiring.—The agreement provides funding for 
19,855 Border Patrol agents, an increase of 300 above the level 
funded in fiscal year 2022. In light of the Border Patrol’s ongoing 
recruitment and attrition challenges, funding that is unable to be 
executed for new hiring in fiscal year 2023 is available for additional 
targeted Border Patrol Agent hiring and retention efforts; 
hiring processing coordinators and professional staff that relieve 
agents of administrative duties; and for morale efforts, to include 
increasing the uniform allowance. 

Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall 
brief the Committees on a plan and schedule for hiring the funded 
level of agents. The briefing shall also address how CBP is ensuring 
appropriate oversight of the hiring process and its efforts to implement 
recommendations from misconduct investigations. Given 
the number of agents from the northern border who have been redeployed 
to the southwest border in recent years, the briefing shall 
also detail the number of planned new agents who will be assigned 
to the northern border. 

Border Security Technology Gaps.—Within 180 days of the date 
of enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Committees on its efforts 
to improve border security technology development and acquisition. 


Body Worn Cameras.—Within 90 days of the date of enactment 
of this Act, CBP shall provide the Committees an execution plan 
and deployment schedule for body worn cameras. 

Operational Impact of Processing Coordinators.—Within 60 days 
of the date of enactment of this Act and quarterly thereafter, CBP 
shall provide a briefing to the Committees on the status of hiring 
processing coordinators funded by this and previous appropriations 
Acts, including the number of law enforcement personnel returned 
to the field as a result of the onboarding of new coordinators; the 
measures the agency is using to assess the costs and benefits of coordinator 
positions; and a description of all training and certifications 
required for such positions. Future funding requests for coordinators 
shall be accompanied by measures clearly detailing projected 
operational impacts. 

Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA).—The agreement directs 
CBP to post on its website, within 60 days of the date of enactment 
of this Act, a schedule for achieving full compliance with PREA requirements. 


Reporting Requirements for Deaths in Custody.—CBP shall continue 
to provide the data required in House Report 116–80 regarding 
deaths of noncitizens. 


1313 

Shelter and Services Program.—The agreement provides 
$800,000,000 for a Shelter and Services Program (SSP) to support 
CBP in effectively managing noncitizen processing and preventing 
the overcrowding of short-term CBP holding facilities. Within the 
total amount provided, up to $50,000,000 is available for the construction 
or expansion of shelter facilities. The funds are transferred 
to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for 
administration as grants or cooperative agreements with state and 
local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 

During fiscal year 2023, a portion of this funding may be used 
for the existing Emergency Food and Shelter Program-Humanitarian 
(EFSP–H) in order to provide time for CBP and FEMA to 
establish a funding allocation process for the SSP. While the Emergency 
Food and Shelter National Board has performed admirably 
in administering EFSP–H since it was first funded in fiscal year 
2019, funding the SSP through CBP will facilitate more effective 
support of CBP efforts to efficiently process and humanely treat 
noncitizens. It also acknowledges the existing vital partnership between 
CBP and NGOs. 

Prior to EFSP–H, many NGOs and local communities already 
provided shelter and other services to individuals released directly 
from CBP custody, helping to facilitate the humane and respectful 
treatment of noncitizens undergoing processing at CBP facilities, 
including families, while minimizing impacts on local border communities. 
Overcrowding at CBP short-term holding facilities has 
negative impacts on noncitizens and makes it more difficult for 
CBP personnel to carry out their duties. This partnership also 
serves American taxpayers by minimizing the need to expand the 
capacity of existing CBP facilities. 

Not less than quarterly, CBP shall provide data to FEMA to help 
inform decisions on where funding should be provided to shelters 
along the southwest border and in the interior of the United States 
to support CBP’s border security mission. At a minimum, this data 
shall include historical data and future projections of encounters of 
families and single adults, by POE and Border Patrol sector. 

Short Term Detention.—In addition to direction in House Report 
117–396, the Commissioner shall provide a report to the Committees, 
within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, on infrastructure 
changes, training protocols, and other investments made 
or planned to ensure the safe, humane, and orderly processing of 
single adults, families, and unaccompanied children in CBP custody, 
in compliance with the CBP National Standards on Transport, 
Escort, Detention, and Search as well as the Flores Settlement. 
The report shall also describe CBP efforts to improve stakeholder 
monitoring and access policies at CBP facilities. These directives 
should not be construed to interfere with the rights obtained, 
or obligations owed, under any federal consent decree. 

Transportation Checks and Roving Enforcement.—In addition to 
direction in House Report 117–396, the required reporting shall include 
the total amount of drugs, currency, and firearms seized as 
a result of transportation checks. 

Workload Staffing Model for Between the Ports.—Within 30 days 
of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall provide a briefing 
to the Committees on how data from the Border Patrol’s Mission 


1314 

Advantage Program demonstrates its impact on personnel needs 
and projections of the impacts of future investments in the program. 
Within 60 days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP 
shall provide a report to the Committees detailing the staffing 
model and the process that CBP used to create and validate it. 

TRADE AND TRAVEL OPERATIONS—OFFICE OF FIELD OPERATIONS 

Advanced Electronic Data (AED).—Within 180 days of the date

agreement encourages CBP to continue to collaborate with domestic 
and international partners to disrupt the flow of funding that 
supports illicit monetary instruments and firearm smuggling activities. 
CBP shall inform the Committees any additional legal authorities 
or resources needed for these efforts. 

Data on Asylum Seekers.—The agreement directs the Office of 
Field Operations (OFO) to continue to produce a monthly report detailing 
for each preceding month: the POEs along the southwest 
border at which queue management or metering practices have 
been employed; a detailed flow-chart for how a noncitizen’s case is 
managed in these processes; and the number of asylum seekers 
processed at each such POE. 

The report shall also address: CBP’s rationale for queue management 
or metering practices at POEs; capacity and resource constraints 
leading to or requiring the implementation of such practices; 
recommendations for alleviating such capacity and resource 
constraints; and any agreements or arrangements between CBP, or 
the Federal Government more broadly, and Government of Mexico 
authorities involving efforts to restrict the number of potential asylum 
seekers that can access a POE prior to entering the United 
States.

timber products. The briefing shall also address CBP efforts to assist 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture with the electronic collection of data, as 
well as its continued consultation with trading partners, importers, 
exporters, and other interested groups as the provisions of the Act 
are fully implemented. 

Enhancement of Supply Chain Security.—Within 180 days of the 
date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall provide a briefing to the 
Committees with recommendations on how innovative capabilities, 
including blockchain-based platforms, may improve trade operations

to provide an expenditure plan for the use of these funds 
and to brief the Committees on the metrics it will use to capture 
the impact of this investment. 

Fee Shortfalls and Reinstating Base Funding for OFO Personnel.—
The agreement restores $94,655,000 in proposed reductions 
to pay for existing OFO personnel. The CBP CFO shall continue 
to manage and oversee CBP fee funding to ensure current 
year operational requirements are balanced against the continuing 
requirement to build and maximize a carryover balance. If fee collections 
during fiscal year 2023 exceed current projections and carryover 
requirements, CBP shall refrain from obligating those available 
funds until it briefs the Committees on options for the use of 
those funds to include for hiring additional CBP officers and mission 
support staff. 

Identifying Fentanyl Analogues and Related Substances at the 
Southwest Border.—Within 60 days of the date of enactment of this 
Act, CBP shall provide the Committees a briefing on options to

Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft (MEA).—The agreement provides 
$29,000,000 to fund the second land variant MEA to expand 
CBP’s ability to conduct maritime, air, and land surveillance at our 
Nation’s borders. Additionally, the agreement rescinds $23,182,000 
from prior year funding for this program due to contract cost savings. 


NII.—The agreement provides $69,947,000 for the NII pro-
gram.CBP shall execute these funds only as follows: $15,250,000 
for outbound inspection equipment; $10,000,000 for artificial intelligence

$44,947,000 for the deployment of previously funded equipment, 
civil works infrastructure, site prep, and installation of equipment 
associated with achieving 100 percent scanning of vehicles crossing 
the U.S. border. The agreement rescinds all remaining unobligated 


1322 

fiscal year 2022 funding provided for NII, totaling $73,246,000, due 
to continued concerns with the management of the NII program, as 
discussed in House Report 117–396. 

To date, CBP has failed to request any funding to address unfunded 
requirements for civil works, installation, and site prep for 
previously funded NII equipment to be deployed in pre-primary 
lanes at LPOEs, which could require more than an additional 
$200,000,000. While the agreement provides additional funding for 
the NII program, CBP and DHS are encouraged to request funds 
in future budgets to address this shortfall. 

To ensure proper oversight of NII funds, CBP shall also continue 
to provide monthly updates to the Committees on the obligation of 
funds for NII equipment, along with actual and projected performance 
gains as a result of NII deployments funded in this or prior 
appropriations. Within 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act,

will impact current secondary inspection capacity and the workflow 
of other federal agencies that may not have sufficient time to plan 
for additional resource needs. 

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
CBP shall provide a report on the current status of mobile NII 
technology and proposals for enhancing it. 

CBP is reminded of the reporting requirement on 100 percent 
scanning in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the fiscal 
year 2022 funding Act, which was due to Congress on September 
12, 2022. 

Period of Availability.—The PPA funding table in the explanatory 
statement accompanying division F of the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–103) included an inadvertent 
transposition of the funding amounts available for three years and 
five years in CBP’s Procurement, Construction, and Improvements 
(PC&I) account. Notwithstanding that transposition, the three- and 
five-year funds are not purpose restricted and may be obligated for 
any project funded under the fiscal year 2022 PC&I appropriation. 
CBP shall allocate these funds as necessary to execute fully all of 
the funded projects within the periods of availability set forth in 
that Act. CBP is directed to provide revised spending allocations for 
the three- and five-year funds when it submits the expenditure 
plan required under Section 208 of this Act.

FEMA may have in providing data to the Committees related to 
sheltering requirements and a description of the strategies in place 
to overcome these issues. 

Under the new SSP, the permissible use of funding includes the 
construction and expansion of shelter facilities to help address shelter 
capacity constraints, particularly in border areas with consistently 
high numbers of individuals crossing the border between the 
ports of entry. During the fiscal year 2023 transition to SSP, a limited 
amount of EFSP–H funding is made available, at the discretion 
of the Board and in consultation with CBP and FEMA, for the 
construction and expansion of state, local, or NGO shelter facilities. 
This authority provides flexibility in meeting shelter capacity requirements 
as part of an overall strategy to maximize the use of 
shelter capacity in support of decompressing CBP short-term holding 
facilities. FEMA and the Board shall notify the Committees at 
least 15 days in advance of awarding any EFSP–H funds for shelter 
construction or expansion.

1374 
TITLE V—GENERAL PROVISIONS 

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS AND RESCISSIONS OF FUNDS) 

Section 501. The agreement continues a provision directing that 
no part of any appropriation shall remain available for obligation 
beyond the current year unless expressly provided. 

Section 502. The agreement continues a provision providing authority 
to merge unexpended balances of prior appropriations with 
new appropriation accounts, to be used for the same purpose, subject 
to reprogramming guidelines. 

Section 503. The agreement continues a provision related to reprogramming 
limitations and transfer authority. 

The Department must notify the Committees on Appropriations 
at least 15 days in advance of each reprogramming of funds that 
would: (1) reduce programs, projects, and activities, or personnel, 
by ten percent or more; or (2) increase a program, project, or activity 
by more than $5,000,000 or ten percent, whichever is less. 

The term ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ (PPA) is defined as 
each functional category listed under an account heading in the 
funding table at the back of this explanatory statement, along with 
each funding amount designated for a particular purpose within 
the statement narrative, exclusive of simple references to increases 
or reductions below the budget request. Funding for each PPA 
should not be used for the purposes of any other PPA. Within 30 
days of the date of enactment of this Act, the Department shall 
submit to the Committees a table delineating PPAs subject to section 
503 notification requirements. 

For purposes of reprogramming notifications, the creation of a 
new program, project, or activity is defined as any significant new 
activity that has not been explicitly justified to the Congress in 
budget justification material and for which funds have not been appropriated 
by the Congress. 

Limited transfer authority is provided to give the Department 
flexibility in responding to emerging requirements and significant 
changes in circumstances, but is not intended to facilitate the implementation 
of new programs, projects, or activities that were not 
proposed in a formal budget submission. Transfers may not reduce 
accounts by more than five percent or augment appropriations by 
more than ten percent. The Department must notify the Committees 
on Appropriations not fewer than 30 days in advance of any 
transfer. 

To avoid violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act, the Secretary shall 
ensure that any transfer of funds is carried out in compliance with 
the limitations and requirements of section 503(c). In particular, 
the Secretary should ensure that any such transfers adhere to the 
opinion of the Comptroller General’s decision in the Matter of: John 

D. Webster, Director, Financial Services, Library of Congress, dated 
November 7, 1997, with regard to the definition of an appropriation 
subject to transfer limitations. 
Notifications should provide complete explanations of proposed 
funding reallocations, including detailed justifications for increases 
and offsets; any specific impact the proposed changes are expected 
to have on future-year appropriations requirements; a table showing 
the proposed revisions to funding and full-time equivalents 


1375 

(FTE)—at the account and PPA levels—for the current fiscal year; 
and any expected funding and FTE impacts during the budget 
year. 

The Department shall manage its PPAs within the levels appropriated 
and should only submit reprogramming or transfer notifications 
in cases of unforeseeable and compelling circumstances that 
could not have been predicted when formulating the budget request 
for the current fiscal year. When the Department becomes aware 
of an emerging requirement after the President’s budget has been 
submitted to Congress but prior to the enactment of a full-year 
funding Act for the budget year, it is incumbent on the Office of 
the Chief Financial Officer to timely notify the Committees. When 
the Department submits a reprogramming or transfer notification 
and does not receive identical responses from the House and Senate 
Committees, it is expected to work with the Committees to reconcile 
the differences before proceeding. 

Section 504. The agreement continues a provision, by reference, 
prohibiting funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the 
Department to make payment to the Working Capital Fund (WCF), 
except for activities and amounts allowed in the President’s fiscal 
year 2023 budget request. 

Section 505. The agreement continues a provision providing that 
not to exceed 50 percent of unobligated balances from prior-year 
appropriations for each Operations and Support appropriation shall 
remain available through fiscal year 2024, subject to section 503 reprogramming 
requirements. 

Section 506. The agreement continues a provision that deems intelligence 
activities to be specifically authorized during fiscal year 
2023 until the enactment of an Act authorizing intelligence activities 
for fiscal year 2023. When such an authorization is enacted 
after the enactment of this Act, amounts appropriated for ‘‘Intelligence, 
Analysis, and Situational Awareness—Operations and Support’’ 
in excess of the authorized amounts shall be transferred to 
‘‘Management Directorate—Operations and Support’’. 

Section 507. The agreement continues a provision requiring notification 
to the Committees at least three days before DHS executes 
or announces grant allocations or grant awards totaling $1,000,000 
or more; an award or contract, other transaction agreement, or task 
order on a multiple award agreement, or to issue a letter of intent 
of greater than $4,000,000; task or delivery orders greater than 
$10,000,000 from multi-year funds; or sole-source grant awards. 
Notifications shall include a description of the projects or activities 
to be funded and the location, including city, county, and state. 

Section 508. The agreement continues a provision prohibiting all 
agencies from purchasing, constructing, or leasing additional facilities 
for federal law enforcement training without advance notification 
to the Committees. 

Section 509. The agreement continues a provision prohibiting the 
use of funds for any construction, repair, alteration, or acquisition 
project for which a prospectus, if required under chapter 33 of title 
40, United States Code, has not been approved. 

Section 510. The agreement continues and modifies a provision 
that includes and consolidates by reference prior-year statutory 
provisions related to sensitive security information and the use of 


1376 

funds in conformance with section 303 of the Energy Policy Act of 
1992.

Section 513. The agreement continues a provision regarding the 
oath of allegiance required by section 337 of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act. 

Section 514. The agreement continues and modifies a provision 
that precludes DHS from using funds in this Act to use reorganization 
authority. This prohibition is not intended to prevent the Department 
from carrying out routine or small reallocations of personnel 
or functions within components, subject to section 503 of 
this Act. This section prevents large-scale reorganization of the Department, 
which should be acted on legislatively by the relevant 
congressional committees of jurisdiction. Any DHS proposal to reorganize 
components that is included as part of a budget request will 
be considered by the Committees. 

Section 515. The agreement continues a provision prohibiting 
funds for planning, testing, piloting, or developing a national identification 
card. 

Section 516. The agreement continues a provision directing that 
any official required by this Act to report or certify to the Committees 
on Appropriations may not delegate such authority unless expressly 
authorized to do so in this Act.

funds in this Act to be used for first-class travel.
