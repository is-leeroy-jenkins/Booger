some of the State Farm Service Agency offices in each State the 
opportunity to provide agricultural producers in the State a 
supplemental payment described in subsection (c) based on the alternate 
calculation method described in subsection (b) for 1 or more counties in 
a State if the office for that State determines that the alternate 
calculation method is necessary to ensure that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, there are not significant yield calculation disparities 
between comparable counties in the State.
    (b) The alternate calculation method referred to in subsection (a) 
is a method of calculating the actual yield for the 2018 crop year for 
county-level agriculture risk coverage payments under section 1117(b)(1) 
of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017(b)(1)), under which--

        for the calculations;

[[Page 133 STAT. 85]]

            (2) if there is insufficient NASS data for a county (as 
        determined under standards of the Secretary in effect as of the 
        date of enactment of this Act) or the available NASS data 
        produces a substantially disparate result, the calculation of 
        the county yield is determined using comparable contiguous 
        county NASS data as determined by the Farm Service Agency office 
        in the applicable State; and
            (3) if there is insufficient NASS data for a comparable 
        contiguous county (as determined under standards of the 
        Secretary in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act), 
        the calculation of the county yield is determined using reliable 
        yield data from other sources, such as Risk Management Agency 
        data, National Agricultural Statistics Service district data, 
        National Agricultural Statistics Service State yield data, or 
        other data as determined by the Farm Service Agency office in 
        the applicable State.

    (c)(1) A supplemental payment made under the pilot program 
established under this section may be made to an agricultural producer 
who is subject to the alternate calculation method described in 
subsection (b) if that agricultural producer would otherwise receive a 
county-level agriculture risk coverage payment for the 2018 crop year in 
an amount that is less than the payment that the agricultural producer 
would receive under the alternate calculation method.
    (2) The amount of a supplemental payment to an agricultural producer 
under this section may not exceed the difference between--
            (A) the payment that the agricultural producer would have 
        received without the alternate calculation method described in 
        subsection (b); and
            (B) the payment that the agricultural producer would receive 
        using the alternate calculation method.

    (d)(1) There is appropriated to the Secretary, out of funds of the 
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000, to remain available 
until September 30, 2020, to carry out the pilot program described in 
this section.
    (2) Of the funds appropriated, the Secretary shall use not more than 
$5,000,000 to carry out the pilot program described in this section.
    (e)(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall select 
States to participate in the pilot program under this section so the 
cost of the pilot program equals the amount provided under subsection 
(d).
    (2) To the extent that the cost of the pilot program exceeds the 
amount made available, the Secretary shall reduce all payments under the 
pilot program on a pro rata basis.
    (f) Nothing in this section affects the calculation of actual yield 
for purposes of county-level agriculture risk coverage payments under 
section 1117(b)(1) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017(b)(1)) 
other than payments made in accordance with the pilot program under this 
section.
    (g) A calculation of actual yield made using the alternate 
calculation method described in subsection (b) shall not be used as a 
basis for any agriculture risk coverage payment determinations under 
section 1117 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017) other than 
for purposes of the pilot program under this section.

policy form or agreement that is to be executed by a person connected 
with the conduct of an intelligence or intelligence-related activity, 
other than an employee or officer of the United States Government, may 
contain provisions appropriate to the particular activity for which such

also make it clear that they do not bar disclosures to Congress, or to 
an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of 
Justice, that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law.
    (b) A nondisclosure agreement may continue to be implemented and 
enforced notwithstanding subsection (a) if it complies with the

interests of the Government.
    Sec. 745.  None of the funds made available by this or any other Act 
may be used to enter into a contract, memorandum of understanding, or 
cooperative agreement with, make a grant to, or provide a loan or loan

the awarding agency is aware of the conviction, unless a Federal agency 
has considered

suspension or debarment of the corporation and has made a determination 
that this further action is not necessary to protect the interests of 
the Government.
    Sec. 746. (a) During fiscal year 2019, on the date on which a

percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary spending limits for all 
categories for that fiscal year.
    Sec. 748. (a) <<NOTE: 5 USC 5303 note.>>  The adjustment in rates of 
basic pay for employees under the statutory pay systems that takes

[[Page 133 STAT. 200]]

law, the payable rate for an employee serving in an Executive Schedule 
position, or in a position for which the rate of pay is fixed by statute 
at an Executive Schedule rate, shall be increased by 1.9 percent 
(relative to the preexisting rate actually payable) at the time the 
official rate is adjusted in January 2019. Such an employee may receive 
no other pay increase during calendar year 2019, except as provided in 
subsection (i).
    (c) Notwithstanding section 401 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 
(Public Law 96-465) or any other provision of law, a chief of mission or

                official rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule; or
                    (B) a limited term appointee or limited emergency 
                appointee in the Senior Executive Service serving under 
                a political appointment and paid a rate of basic pay at 
                or above the official rate for level IV of the Executive 
                Schedule.
            (2) Notwithstanding sections 5382 and 5383 of title 5, 
        United States Code, an employee described in paragraph (1) who 
        is serving at the time official rates of the Executive Schedule 
        are adjusted may receive a single increase in the employee's pay 
        rate of no more than 1.9 percent during calendar year 2019, 
        subject to the normally applicable pay rules and pay limitations 
        in effect on December 31, 2013, after those pay limitations are 
        increased by 1.9 percent (after applicable rounding). Such an 
        employee may receive no other pay increase during calendar year 
        2019, except as provided in subsection (i).

    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any employee paid a

except as provided in subsection (i). This subsection does not apply to 
employees in the General Schedule pay system or the Foreign Service pay 
system, to employees appointed under section 3161 of title 5, United 
States Code, or to employees in another pay system whose position would 
be classified at GS-15 or below if chapter 51 of title 5, United States 
Code, applied to them.
    (f) Nothing in subsections (b) through (e) shall prevent employees 
who do not serve under a political appointment from receiving pay 
increases as otherwise provided under applicable law.
    (g) This section does not apply to an individual who makes an

time as that election is in effect.
    (i) Notwithstanding subsections (b) through (e), an employee in a 
covered position may receive a pay rate increase upon an authorized 
movement to a different covered position only if that new position has 
higher-level duties and a pre-established level or range of pay higher 
than the level or range for the position held immediately before the 
movement. Any such increase must be based on the rates of pay and 
applicable pay limitations in effect on December 31, 2013, after those 
rates and pay limitations are increased by 1.9 percent (after applicable 
rounding).
    (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for an individual 
who is newly appointed to a covered position during the period of time 
subject to this section, the initial pay rate shall be based on the 
rates of pay and applicable pay limitations in effect on December 31, 
2013, after those rates and pay limitations are increased by 1.9 percent 
(after applicable rounding).
    (k) If an employee affected by this section is subject to a biweekly 
pay period that begins in calendar year 2019 but ends in calendar year 
2020, the bar on the employee's receipt of pay rate increases shall 
apply through the end of that pay period.
    (l) For the purpose of this section, the term "covered position'' 
means a position occupied by an employee whose pay is restricted under 
this section.
    (m) This section takes effect on the first day of the first 
applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2019.

available to provide assistance for a foreign country under a new 
bilateral agreement governing the terms and conditions under which such 
assistance is to be provided unless such agreement includes a provision 
stating that assistance provided by the United States shall be exempt 
from taxation, or reimbursed, by the foreign government, and the 
Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for 
International Development shall expeditiously seek to negotiate 
amendments to existing bilateral agreements, as necessary, to conform 
with this requirement.
    (b) Notification and Reimbursement of Foreign Taxes.--An amount 
equivalent to 200 percent of the total taxes assessed during fiscal year 
2019 on funds appropriated by this Act and prior Acts making 
appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and 
related programs by a foreign government or entity against United States 
assistance programs, either directly or through grantees, contractors, 
and subcontractors, shall be withheld from obligation from funds 
appropriated for assistance for fiscal year 2020 and for prior fiscal 
years and allocated for the central government of such country or for

[[Page 133 STAT. 301]]

United States assistance or which have an effective arrangement that is 
providing substantial reimbursement of such taxes, and that can 
reasonably accommodate such assistance in a programmatically responsible 
manner.
    (e) Determinations.--
            (1) In general.--The provisions of this section shall not 
        apply to any foreign government or entity that assesses such 
        taxes if the Secretary of State reports to the Committees on 
        Appropriations that--
                    (A) such foreign government or entity has an 
                effective arrangement that is providing substantial 
                reimbursement of such taxes; or
                    (B) the foreign policy interests of the United 
                States outweigh the purpose of this section to ensure 
                that United States assistance is not subject to 
                taxation.
            (2) Consultation.--The Secretary of State shall consult with 
        the Committees on Appropriations at least 15 days prior to

rules, regulations, or policy guidance, as appropriate, to implement the 
prohibition against the taxation of assistance contained in this 
section.
    (g) Definitions.--As used in this section:
            (1) Bilateral agreement.--The term "bilateral agreement'' 
        refers to a framework bilateral agreement between the Government 
        of the United States and the government of the country receiving 
        assistance that describes the privileges and immunities 
        applicable to United States foreign assistance for such country 
        generally, or an individual agreement between the Government of 
        the United States and such government that describes, among 
        other things, the treatment for tax purposes that will be 
        accorded the United States assistance provided under that 
        agreement.
            (2) Taxes and taxation.--The term "taxes and taxation'' 
        shall include value added taxes and customs duties but shall not 
        include individual income taxes assessed to local staff.

    (h) Report.--Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of State, in consultation with the heads of other relevant 
agencies of the United States Government, shall submit a report to the 
Committees on Appropriations on the requirements contained under this 
section in House Report 115-829.

Provided, That any such reprogramming shall be subject to the regular 
notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations:  Provided 
further, That assistance that is reprogrammed pursuant to this 
subsection shall be made available under the same terms and conditions

contained in subsection (a), the original period of availability of 
funds appropriated by this Act and administered by the Department of 
State or the United States Agency for International Development that are 
specifically designated for particular programs or activities by this or 
any other Act may be extended for an additional fiscal year if the 
Secretary of State or the USAID Administrator, as appropriate, 
determines and reports promptly to the Committees on Appropriations that 
the termination of assistance to a country or a significant change in 
circumstances makes it unlikely that such designated funds can be 
obligated during the original period of availability:  Provided, That 
such designated funds that continue to be available for an additional 
fiscal year shall be obligated only for the purpose of such designation.
    (c) Other Acts.--Ceilings and specifically designated funding levels 
contained in this Act shall not be applicable to funds or authorities 
appropriated or otherwise made available by any subsequent Act unless 
such Act specifically so directs:  Provided, That specifically 
designated funding levels or minimum funding requirements contained in

a contract for rental assistance payments under section 8 of the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 or other Federal programs, the Secretary 
shall maintain any rental assistance payments under section 8 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 and other programs that are attached

determines, in consultation with the tenants and the local government, 
that such a multifamily property owned or held by the Secretary is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, 
State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 524 
of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 
("MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be remedied in 
a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in consultation with the 
tenants of that property, contract for project-based rental assistance 
payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties, 
or provide other rental assistance. The Secretary shall also take 
appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts remain in 
effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual 
abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major 
threats

[[Page 133 STAT. 460]]

to health and safety after written notice to and informed consent of the 
affected tenants and use of other available remedies, such as partial 
abatements or receivership. After disposition of any multifamily 
property described under this section, the contract and allowable rent 
levels on such properties shall be subject to the requirements under 
section 524 of MAHRAA.
    Sec. 214.  The commitment authority funded by fees as provided under 
the heading "Community Development Loan Guarantees Program Account'' 
may be used to guarantee, or make commitments to guarantee, notes, or

communities in the State in accordance with the requirements of section 
108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974:  Provided,

government in non-entitlement areas that received the commitment.

U.S.C. 1437g(d) and (e)), the Secretary shall not impose any requirement 
or guideline relating to asset management that restricts or limits in 
any way the use of capital funds for central office costs pursuant to 
section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 
U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)):  Provided, That a public housing agency may 
not use capital funds authorized under section 9(d) for activities that 
are eligible under section 9(e) for assistance with amounts from the 
operating fund in excess of the amounts permitted under section 9(g)(1) 
or 9(g)(2).

    Sec. 217.  No official or employee of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development shall be designated as an allotment holder unless the 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer has determined that such allotment 
holder has implemented an adequate system of funds control and has 
received training in funds control procedures and directives. The Chief 
Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a trained allotment holder 
for each HUD appropriation under the accounts "Executive Offices'' and 
"Administrative Support Offices,'' as well as each account receiving 
appropriations under the general heading "Program Office Salaries and 
Expenses'', "Government National Mortgage Association--Guarantees of

any other such office or account:  Provided, That no appropriation for 
any such office or account shall be increased or decreased by more than 
10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less, without prior written 
approval of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations:  Provided 
further, That the Secretary shall provide notification to such

        days that all Exigent Health and Safety deficiencies identified 
        by the inspector at the project have been corrected.

Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured projects with 
assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but do not apply to such units 
assisted under section 8(o)(13) (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public 
housing units assisted with capital or operating funds under section 9 
of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g).
    (c)(1) Within 15 days of the issuance of the REAC inspection, the 
Secretary must provide the owner with a Notice of Default with a 
specified timetable, determined by the Secretary, for correcting all 
deficiencies. The Secretary must also provide a copy of the Notice of 
Default to the tenants, the local government, any mortgagees, and any 
contract administrator. If the owner's appeal results in a UPCS score of

[[Page 133 STAT. 462]]

    (2) At the end of the time period for correcting all deficiencies 
specified in the Notice of Default, if the owner fails to fully correct 
such deficiencies, the Secretary may--

        a management agent approved by the Secretary;
            (B) impose civil money penalties, which shall be used solely

        abatement, as determined by the Secretary, until all 
        deficiencies have been corrected;
            (D) pursue transfer of the project to an owner, approved by 
        the Secretary under established procedures, which will be

        stabilize the property in an attempt to preserve the property 
        through compliance, transfer of ownership, or an infusion of 
        capital provided by a third-party that requires time to 
        effectuate; or
            (I) take any other regulatory or contractual remedies 
        available as deemed necessary and appropriate by the Secretary.

    (d) The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that 
project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the exercise of

threats to health and safety after written notice to the affected 
tenants. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation with 
the tenants and the local government, that the property is not feasible 
for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 or other 
programs, based on consideration of--
            (1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property 
        and all available Federal, State, and local resources, including 
        rent adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted 
        Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 ("MAHRAA''); and

        assistance.

        conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties and 
        termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have such

        Development is taking to protect tenants of such identified 
        properties; and
