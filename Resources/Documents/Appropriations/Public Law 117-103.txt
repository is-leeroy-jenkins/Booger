            (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the secondary

SEC. 202. <<NOTE: 15 USC 2090 note.>>  FINDINGS AND SENSE OF 
                        CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced by 
        burning any fuel. Exposure to unhealthy levels of carbon 
        monoxide can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, a serious health 
        condition that could result in death.
            (2) Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from motor 
        vehicles and improper operation of fuel-burning appliances, such 
        as furnaces, water heaters, portable generators, and stoves, 
        annually kills more than 400 individuals and sends approximately 
        15,000 individuals to hospital emergency rooms for treatment.
            (3) Research shows that installing carbon monoxide alarms 
        close to the sleeping areas in residential homes and other 
        dwelling units can help avoid fatalities.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress 
should promote the installation of carbon monoxide alarms in residential 
homes and dwelling units across the United States in order to promote 
the health and public safety of citizens throughout the United States.

              TITLE III--UNITED <<NOTE: United States Anti-
Doping Agency Reauthorization Act of 2022.>>  STATES ANTI-DOPING AGENCY 
REAUTHORIZATION
SEC. 301. <<NOTE: 21 USC 2001 note.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``United States Anti-Doping Agency 
Reauthorization Act of 2022''.
SEC. 302. <<NOTE: 21 USC 2001 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States Anti-Doping Agency--
                    (A) is the independent national anti-doping 
                organization of the United States; and
                    (B) manages the anti-doping program, results 
                management processes, drug reference resources, and 
                athlete education for all United States Olympic 
                Committee-recognized national governing bodies and the 
                athletes and events of such national governing bodies.
            (2) The United States Anti-Doping Agency contributes to the 
        advancement of clean sport through scientific research, anti-
        doping education, and outreach programs, and the mission of the 
        United States Anti-Doping Agency is to preserve the integrity of 
        competition and protect the rights of athletes.
            (3) Participation in youth sports has the potential to equip 
        young athletes with important skills and values necessary for 
        success in life, and it is essential that the culture of youth 
        sports emphasizes such skills and values.
            (4) The TrueSport program of the United States Anti-Doping 
        Agency partners with youth sport organizations across the United 
        States to promote sportsmanship, character building, and healthy 
        performance through the use of targeted educational materials 
        designed to promote a positive youth sport experience.
            (5) In modifying the authority of the United States Anti-
        Doping Agency to include the promotion of the positive values of 
        youth sport, Congress sends a strong signal that the goals of 
        youth sport should include instilling in young athletes the 
        values of integrity, respect, teamwork, courage, and 
        responsibility.
            (6) Due to the unique leadership position of the United 
        States in the global community, adequate funding of the anti-
        doping and clean sport programs of the United States Anti-Doping 
        Agency is imperative to the preparation for the 2028 Summer 
        Olympic Games, which will be held in Los Angeles, California.

[[Page 136 STAT. 817]]

            (7) Increased appropriations for fiscal years 2023 through 
        2031 would enable the United States Anti-Doping Agency to 
        directly affect the integrity and well-being of sport, both 
        domestically and internationally.

        building, and healthy performance for the athletes, parents, and 
        coaches who participate in youth sports.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

    ``(c) Due Process in Arbitration Proceedings.--Any action taken by

    This division may be cited as the ``Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) 
Act''.
SEC. 102. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5801.>>  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate in more than 
        $200,000,000,000,000 worth of contracts worldwide;
            (2) a significant number of existing contracts that 
        reference LIBOR do not provide for the use of a clearly defined 
        or practicable replacement benchmark rate when LIBOR is 
        discontinued; and

[[Page 136 STAT. 826]]

            (3) the cessation or nonrepresentativeness of LIBOR could 
        result in disruptive litigation related to existing contracts 
        that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or 
        practicable replacement benchmark rate.

    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this division--
            (1) to establish a clear and uniform process, on a 
        nationwide basis, for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts the 
        terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly defined 
        or practicable replacement benchmark rate, without affecting the 
        ability of parties to use any appropriate benchmark rate in new 
        contracts;
            (2) to preclude litigation related to existing contracts the 
        terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly defined 
        or practicable replacement benchmark rate;
            (3) to allow existing contracts that reference LIBOR but 
        provide for the use of a clearly defined and practicable 
        replacement rate, to operate according to their terms; and
            (4) to address LIBOR references in Federal law.

SEC. 104. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5803.>>  LIBOR CONTRACTS.

    (a) In General.--On the LIBOR replacement date, the Board-selected 
benchmark replacement shall be the benchmark replacement for any LIBOR 
contract that, after giving any effect to subsection (b)--
            (1) contains no fallback provisions; or
            (2) contains fallback provisions that identify neither--
                    (A) a specific benchmark replacement; nor
                    (B) a determining person.

    (b) Fallback Provisions.--On the LIBOR replacement date, any 
reference in the fallback provisions of a LIBOR contract to--
            (1) a benchmark replacement that is based in any way on any 
        LIBOR value, except to account for the difference between LIBOR 
        and the benchmark replacement; or
            (2) a requirement that a person (other than a benchmark 
        administrator) conduct a poll, survey, or inquiries for quotes 
        or information concerning interbank lending or deposit rates;

shall be disregarded as if not included in the fallback provisions of 
such LIBOR contract and shall be deemed null and void and without any 
force or effect.
    (c) Authority of Determining Person.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (f)(2), a determining 
        person may select the Board-selected benchmark replacement as 
        the benchmark replacement.
            (2) Selection.--Any selection by a determining person of the 
        Board-selected benchmark replacement pursuant to paragraph (1) 
        shall be--
                    (A) irrevocable;
                    (B) made by the earlier of the LIBOR replacement 
                date and the latest date for selecting a benchmark 
                replacement according to the terms of the LIBOR 
                contract; and
                    (C) used in any determinations of the benchmark 
                under or with respect to the LIBOR contract occurring on 
                and after the LIBOR replacement date.
            (3) No selection.--If a determining person does not select a 
        benchmark replacement by the date specified in paragraph (2)(B), 
        the Board-selected benchmark replacement, on and after

[[Page 136 STAT. 829]]

        the LIBOR replacement date, shall be the benchmark replacement 
        for the LIBOR contract.

    (d) Conforming Changes.--
            (1) In general.--If the Board-selected benchmark replacement 
        becomes the benchmark replacement for a LIBOR contract pursuant 
        to subsection (a) or (c), all benchmark replacement conforming 
        changes shall become an integral part of the LIBOR contract.
            (2) No consent required.--A calculating person shall not be 
        required to obtain consent from any other person prior to the 
        adoption of benchmark replacement conforming changes.

    (e) Adjustment by Board.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), on the 
        LIBOR replacement date, the Board shall adjust the Board-
        selected benchmark replacement for each category of LIBOR 
        contract that the Board may identify to include the relevant 
        tenor spread adjustment.
            (2) Consumer loans.--For LIBOR contracts that are consumer 
        loans, the Board shall adjust the Board-selected benchmark 
        replacement as follows:
                    (A) <<NOTE: Time period.>>  During the 1-year period 
                beginning on the LIBOR replacement date, incorporate an 
                amount, to be determined for any business day during 
                that period, that transitions linearly from the 
                difference between the Board-selected benchmark 
                replacement and the corresponding LIBOR tenor determined 
                as of the day immediately before the LIBOR replacement 
                date to the relevant tenor spread adjustment.
                    (B) On and after the date that is 1 year after the 
                LIBOR replacement date, incorporate the relevant tenor 
                spread adjustment.

    (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this division may be construed 
to alter or impair--
            (1) any written agreement specifying that a LIBOR contract 
        shall not be subject to this division;
            (2) except as provided in subsection (b), any LIBOR contract 
        that contains fallback provisions that identify a benchmark 
        replacement that is not based in any way on any LIBOR value 
        (including the prime rate or the effective Federal funds rate);
            (3) except as provided in subsection (b) or (c)(3), any 
        LIBOR contract subject to subsection (c)(1) as to which a 
        determining person does not elect to use a Board-selected 
        benchmark replacement pursuant to that subsection;
            (4) the application to a Board-selected benchmark 
        replacement of any cap, floor, modifier, or spread adjustment to 
        which LIBOR had been subject pursuant to the terms of a LIBOR 
        contract;
            (5) any provision of Federal consumer financial law that--
                    (A) requires creditors to notify borrowers regarding 
                a change-in-terms; or
                    (B) governs the reevaluation of rate increases on 
                credit card accounts under open-ended (not home-secured) 
                consumer credit plans; or
            (6) except as provided in section 105(c), the rights or 
        obligations of any person, or the authorities of any agency, 
        under Federal consumer financial law, as defined in section 1002

                        HARBOR.

    (a) In General.--A Board-selected benchmark replacement and the 
selection or use of a Board-selected benchmark replacement as a 
benchmark replacement under or with respect to a LIBOR contract, and any 
benchmark replacement conforming changes, shall constitute--
            (1) a commercially reasonable replacement for and a 
        commercially substantial equivalent to LIBOR;
            (2) a reasonable, comparable, or analogous rate, index, or 
        term for LIBOR;
            (3) a replacement that is based on a methodology or 
        information that is similar or comparable to LIBOR;
            (4) substantial performance by any person of any right or 
        obligation relating to or based on LIBOR; and
            (5) a replacement that has historical fluctuations that are 
        substantially similar to those of LIBOR for purposes of the 
        Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 note) and regulations 
        promulgated under that division.

    (b) No Impairment.--Neither the selection or use of a Board-selected 
benchmark replacement as a benchmark replacement nor the determination, 
implementation, or performance of benchmark replacement conforming 
changes under section 104 may--
            (1) be deemed to impair or affect the right of any person to 
        receive a payment, or to affect the amount or timing of such 
        payment, under any LIBOR contract; or
            (2) have the effect of--
                    (A) discharging or excusing performance under any 
                LIBOR contract for any reason, claim, or defense 
                (including any force majeure or other provision in any 
                LIBOR contract);
                    (B) giving any person the right to unilaterally 
                terminate or suspend performance under any LIBOR 
                contract;
                    (C) constituting a breach of any LIBOR contract; or
                    (D) voiding or nullifying any LIBOR contract.

    (c) Safe Harbor.--No person shall be subject to any claim or cause 
of action in law or equity or request for equitable relief, or have 
liability for damages, arising out of--
            (1) the selection or use of a Board-selected benchmark 
        replacement;
            (2) the implementation of benchmark replacement conforming 
        changes; or
            (3) with respect to a LIBOR contract that is not a consumer 
        loan, the determination of benchmark replacement conforming 
        changes,

in each case after giving effect to the provisions of section 104; 
provided, however, that in each case any person (including a calculating 
person) shall remain subject to the terms of a LIBOR contract that are 
not affected by this division and any existing legal, regulatory, or 
contractual obligations to correct servicing or other ministerial errors 
under or with respect to a LIBOR contract.
    (d) Selection.--The selection or use of a Board-selected benchmark 
replacement or the determination, implementation, or performance of 
benchmark replacement conforming changes under section 104 shall not be 
deemed to--

[[Page 136 STAT. 831]]

            (1) be an amendment or modification of any LIBOR contract; 
        or
            (2) prejudice, impair, or affect the rights, interests, or 
        obligations of any person under or with respect to any LIBOR 
        contract.

    (e) No Negative Inference.--Except as provided in subsections (a), 
(b), or (c)(1) of section 104, nothing in this division may be construed 
to create any negative inference or negative presumption regarding the 
validity or enforceability of--
            (1) any benchmark replacement (including any method for 
        calculating, determining, or implementing an adjustment to the 
        benchmark replacement to account for any historical differences 
        between LIBOR and the benchmark replacement) that is not a 
        Board-selected benchmark replacement; or
            (2) any changes, alterations, or modifications to or with 
        respect to a LIBOR contract that are not benchmark replacement 
        conforming changes.

                TITLE VII--ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR VICTIMS

SEC. 701. <<NOTE: 34 USC 12501 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Over 1 in 3 women experience sexual violence, and 1 in 5 
        women have survived completed or attempted rape. Such violence 
        has a devastating impact on women's physical and emotional 
        health, financial security, and ability to maintain their jobs, 
        and thus impacts interstate commerce and economic security.
            (2) Homicide is one of the leading causes of death for women 
        on the job. Domestic partners or relatives commit 43 percent of 
        workplace homicides against women. One study found that intimate 
        partner violence resulted in 142 homicides among women at work 
        in the United States from 2003 to 2008, a figure which 
        represents 22 percent of the 648 workplace homicides among women 
        during the period. In fact, in 2010, homicides against women at 
        work increased by 13 percent despite continuous declines in 
        overall workplace homicides in recent years.
            (3) Violence can have a dramatic impact on the survivor of 
        such violence. Studies indicate that 44 percent of surveyed 
        employed adults experienced the effect of domestic violence in 
        the workplace, and 64 percent indicated their workplace 
        performance was affected by such violence. Another recent survey 
        found that 78 percent of offenders used workplace resources to 
        express anger, check up on, pressure, or threaten a survivor. 
        Sexual assault, whether occurring in or out of the workplace, 
        can impair an employee's work performance, require time away 
        from work, and undermine the employee's ability to maintain a 
        job. Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault survivors lose their 
        jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the assaults.

[[Page 136 STAT. 890]]

            (4) Studies find that 60 percent of single women lack 
        economic security and 81 percent of households with single 
        mothers live in economic insecurity. Significant barriers that 
        survivors confront include access to housing, transportation, 
        and child care. Ninety-two percent of homeless women have 
        experienced domestic violence, and more than 50 percent of such 
        women cite domestic violence as the direct cause for 
        homelessness. Survivors are deprived of their autonomy, liberty, 
        and security, and face tremendous threats to their health and 
        safety.
            (5) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report 
        that survivors of severe intimate partner violence lose nearly 
        8,000,000 days of paid work, which is the equivalent of more 
        than 32,000 full-time jobs and almost 5,600,000 days of 
        household productivity each year. Therefore, women 
        disproportionately need time off to care for their health or to 
        find safety solutions, such as obtaining a restraining order or 
        finding housing, to avoid or prevent further violence.
            (6) Annual costs of intimate partner violence are estimated 
        to be more than $8,300,000,000. According to the Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention, the costs of intimate partner 
        violence against women in 1995 exceeded an estimated 
        $5,800,000,000. These costs included nearly $4,100,000,000 in 
        the direct costs of medical and mental health care and nearly 
        $1,800,000,000 in the indirect costs of lost productivity. These 
        statistics are generally considered to be underestimated because 
        the costs associated with the criminal justice system are not 
        included.
            (7) Fifty-five percent of senior executives recently 
        surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful effect on their 
        company's productivity, and more than 70 percent said domestic 
        violence negatively affects attendance. Seventy-eight percent of 
        human resources professionals consider partner violence a 
        workplace issue. However, more than 70 percent of United States 
        workplaces have no formal program or policy that addresses 
        workplace violence, let alone domestic violence. In fact, only 4 
        percent of employers provided training on domestic violence.
            (8) Harassment is a persistent and significant problem in 
        the workplace in the United States, and the Equal Employment 
        Opportunity Commission found that not less than 25 percent, and 
        as many as 85 percent, of women surveyed report having 
        experienced sexual harassment at work.
            (9) For decades, survivors of sexual violence have come 
        forward to seek justice and demand their right to be free from 
        violence, harassment, and other forms of discrimination. These 
        calls for change reached a tipping point after October 2017 as a 
        result of Tarana Burke's work and #MeToo going viral. Thousands 
        of courageous individuals, from Hollywood to the halls of 
        Congress and the military, to restaurants, agricultural fields, 
        and factory floors, shined a light on the pervasive and 
        insidious nature of workplace harassment and sexual assault.
            (10) Working people can be subjected to multiple forms of 
        harassment in the workplace at the same time.
            (11) According to the Equal Employment Opportunity 
        Commission, approximately 3 out of 4 individuals who experience 
        harassment never talked to a supervisor, manager, or union 
        representative about the harassing conduct.

[[Page 136 STAT. 891]]

            (12) The impact of domestic violence, dating violence, 
        sexual assault, and stalking on the workplace is a part of the 
        challenge of workplace harassment.
            (13) Studies indicate that one of the best predictors of 
        whether a survivor will be able to stay away from his or her 
        abuser is the degree of his or her economic independence. 
        However, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and 
        stalking often negatively impact a survivor's ability to 
        maintain employment.
            (14) Abusers frequently seek to exert financial control over 
        their partners by actively interfering with their ability to 
        work, including preventing their partners from going to work, 
        harassing their partners at work, limiting their partners' 
        access to cash or transportation, and sabotaging their partners' 
        child care arrangements.
            (15) Economic abuse refers to behaviors that control an 
        intimate partner's ability to acquire, use, and maintain access 
        to money, credit, ownership of assets, or governmental or 
        private financial benefits, including defaulting on joint 
        obligations (such as school loans, credit card debt, mortgages, 
        or rent). Other forms of such abuse may include preventing 
        someone from attending school, threatening to or actually 
        terminating employment, controlling or withholding access to 
        cash, checking, or credit accounts, and attempting to damage or 
        sabotage the creditworthiness of an intimate partner, including 
        forcing an intimate partner to write bad checks, forcing an 
        intimate partner to default on payments related to household 
        needs, such as housing, or forcing an intimate partner into 
        bankruptcy.
            (16) This title aims to empower survivors of domestic 
        violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be 
        free from violence, hardship, and control, which restrains basic 
        human rights to freedom and safety in the United States.

                   TITLE VIII--SAFETY FOR INDIAN WOMEN

      Subtitle A--Tools to Enhance Public Safety for Indian Tribes

SEC. 801. <<NOTE: 25 USC 1304 note.>>  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) American Indians and Alaska Natives are--

[[Page 136 STAT. 896]]

                    (A) 2.5 times as likely to experience violent 
                crimes; and
                    (B) at least 2 times more likely to experience rape 
                or sexual assault crimes;
            (2) more than 4 in 5 American Indian and Alaska Native women 
        have experienced violence in their lifetime;
            (3) the vast majority of American Indian and Alaska Native 
        victims of violence--96 percent of women victims and 89 percent 
        of male victims--have experienced sexual violence by a non-
        Indian perpetrator at least once in their lifetime;
            (4) Indian Tribes exercising special domestic violence 
        criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians pursuant to section 204 
        of Public Law 90-284 (25 U.S.C. 1304) (commonly known as the 
        ``Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968''), restored by section 904 of 
        the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public 
        Law 113-4; 127 Stat. 120), have reported significant success 
        holding violent offenders accountable for crimes of domestic 
        violence, dating violence, and civil protection order 
        violations;
            (5) Tribal prosecutors for Indian Tribes exercising special 
        domestic violence criminal jurisdiction report that the majority 
        of domestic violence cases involve children either as witnesses 
        or victims, and the Department of Justice reports that American 
        Indian and Alaska Native children suffer exposure to violence at 
        one of the highest rates in the United States;
            (6) childhood exposure to violence can have immediate and 
        long-term effects, including increased rates of altered 
        neurological development, poor physical and mental health, poor 
        school performance, substance abuse, and overrepresentation in 
        the juvenile justice system;
            (7) according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, homicide is--
                    (A) the third leading cause of death among American 
                Indian and Alaska Native women between 10 and 24 years 
                of age; and
                    (B) the fifth leading cause of death for American 
                Indian and Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 years 
                of age;
            (8) in some areas of the United States, Native American 
        women are murdered at rates more than 10 times the national 
        average;
            (9) according to a 2017 report by the Department of Justice, 
        66 percent of criminal prosecutions for crimes in Indian country 
        that United States Attorneys declined to prosecute involved 
        assault, murder, or sexual assault;
            (10) investigation into cases of missing or murdered 
        Indigenous women is made difficult for Tribal law enforcement 
        agencies due to a lack of resources, including a lack of--
                    (A) necessary personnel, training, equipment, or 
                funding;
                    (B) interagency cooperation;
                    (C) appropriate laws in place; and
                    (D) access to Federal law enforcement databases;
            (11) domestic violence calls are among the most dangerous 
        calls that law enforcement receives;
            (12) the complicated jurisdictional scheme that exists in 
        Indian country--

[[Page 136 STAT. 897]]

                    (A) has a significant impact on public safety in 
                Indian communities;
                    (B) according to Tribal justice officials, has been 
                increasingly exploited by criminals; and
                    (C) requires a high degree of commitment and 
                cooperation among Tribal, Federal, and State law 
                enforcement officials;
            (13) restoring and enhancing Tribal capacity to address 
        violence against women provides for greater local control, 
        safety, accountability, and transparency;
            (14) Indian Tribes with restrictive settlement Acts, such as 
        Indian Tribes in the State of Maine, and Indian Tribes located 
        in States with concurrent authority to prosecute crimes in 
        Indian country under the amendments made by the Act of August 
        15, 1953 (67 Stat. 590, chapter 506), face unique public safety 
        challenges; and
            (15) Native Hawaiians experience a disproportionately high 
        rate of human trafficking, with 64 percent of human trafficking 
        victims in the State of Hawai'i identifying as at least part 
        Native Hawaiian.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--
            (1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, State, 
        Tribal, and local law enforcement agencies with respect to 
        responding to cases of domestic violence, dating violence, 
        stalking, sex trafficking, sexual violence, crimes against 
        children, and assault against Tribal law enforcement officers;
            (2) <<NOTE: Coordination.>>  to increase coordination and 
        communication among Federal, State, Tribal, and local law 
        enforcement agencies;
            (3) to empower Tribal governments and Native American 
        communities, including urban Indian communities and Native 
        Hawaiian communities, with the resources and information 
        necessary to effectively respond to cases of domestic violence, 
        dating violence, stalking, sex trafficking, sexual violence, and 
        missing or murdered Native Americans; and
            (4) <<NOTE: Data.>>  to increase the collection of data 
        related to missing or murdered Native Americans and the sharing 
        of information among Federal, State, Tribal, and local officials 
        responsible for responding to and investigating crimes impacting 
        Indian Tribes and Native American communities, including urban 
        Indian communities and Native Hawaiian communities, especially 
        crimes relating to cases of missing or murdered Native 
        Americans.

                          (i) 19 percent of the population of the State; 
                      but
                          (ii) 47 percent of reported rape victims in 
                      the State; and
                    (C) as compared to the populations of other Indian 
                Tribes, suffer the highest rates of domestic and sexual 
                violence;
            (2) most Alaska Native villages are located in remote areas 
        that--
                    (A) are often inaccessible by road; and
                    (B) have no local law enforcement presence;
            (3) the Commission referred to in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) determined that the Alaska Department of Public 
                Safety--
                          (i) has primary responsibility for law 
                      enforcement in rural Alaska; but
                          (ii) provides only 1 to 1.4 field officers per 
                      1,000,000 acres; and
                    (B) recommended that ``devolving authority to Alaska 
                Native communities is essential for addressing local 
                crime. Their governments are best positioned to 
                effectively arrest,

[[Page 136 STAT. 905]]

                prosecute, and punish, and they should have the 
                authority to do so-or to work out voluntary agreements 
                with each other, and with local governments and the 
                State on mutually beneficial terms''; and
            (4) the unique legal relationship of the United States to 
        Indian Tribes creates a Federal trust responsibility to assist 
        Tribal governments in safeguarding the lives of Indian women.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--
            (1) <<NOTE: Coordination.>>  to increase coordination and 
        communication among Federal, State, Tribal, and local law 
        enforcement agencies; and
            (2) to empower Indian Tribes to effectively respond to cases 
        of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sex 
        trafficking, sexual violence, and missing or murdered Alaska 
        Natives through the exercise of special Tribal criminal 
        jurisdiction.

  TITLE XV--KEEPING <<NOTE: Keeping Children Safe From Family Violence 
Act. Courts. 34 USC 10101 note.>>  CHILDREN SAFE FROM FAMILY VIOLENCE
SEC. 1501. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Keeping Children Safe From Family 
Violence Act'' or ``Kayden's Law''.
SEC. 1502. <<NOTE: 34 USC 10446 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Approximately 1 in 15 children is exposed to domestic 
        violence each year.
            (2) Most child abuse is perpetrated in the family and by a 
        parent. Intimate partner violence and child abuse overlap in the 
        same families at rates between 30 and 60 percent. A child's risk 
        of abuse increases after a perpetrator of intimate partner 
        violence separates from a domestic partner, even when the 
        perpetrator has not previously directly abused the child. 
        Children who have witnessed intimate partner violence are 
        approximately 4 times more likely to experience direct child 
        maltreatment than children who have not witnessed intimate 
        partner violence.
            (3) More than 75 percent of child sexual abuse is 
        perpetrated by a family member or a person known to the child. 
        Data of the Department of Justice shows that family members are 
        49 percent, or almost half, of the perpetrators of crimes 
        against child sex assault victims younger than 6 years of age.
            (4) Research suggests a child's exposure to a batterer is 
        among the strongest indicators of risk of incest victimization.

[[Page 136 STAT. 952]]

        One study found that female children with fathers who are 
        batterers of their mothers were 6.5 times more likely to 
        experience father-daughter incest than female children who do 
        not have abusive fathers.
            (5) Child abuse is a major public health issue in the United 
        States. Total lifetime financial costs associated with just 1 
        year of confirmed cases of child maltreatment, including child 
        physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, and neglect, 
        result in $124,000,000,000 in annual costs to the economy of the 
        United States, or approximately 1 percent of the gross domestic 
        product of the United States.
            (6) Empirical research indicates that courts regularly 
        discount allegations of child physical and sexual abuse when 
        those allegations are raised in child custody cases. Courts 
        believed less than \1/4\ of claims that a father has committed 
        child physical or sexual abuse. With respect to cases in which 
        an allegedly abusive parent claimed the mother ``alienated'' the 
        child, courts believed only 1 out of 51 claims of sexual 
        molestation by a father. Independent research indicates that 
        child sexual abuse allegations are credible between 50 and 70 
        percent of the time.
            (7) Empirical research shows that alleged or known abusive 
        parents are often granted custody or unprotected parenting time 
        by courts. Approximately \1/3\ of parents alleged to have 
        committed child abuse took primary custody from the protective 
        parent reporting the abuse, placing children at ongoing risk.
            (8) Researchers have documented nearly 800 child murders in 
        the United States since 2008 committed by a divorcing or 
        separating parent. More than 100 of these child murders are 
        known to have occurred after a court ordered the child to have 
        contact with the dangerous parent over the objection of a safe 
        parent or caregiver.
            (9) Scientifically unsound theories that treat abuse 
        allegations of mothers as likely false attempts to undermine 
        fathers are frequently applied in family court to minimize or 
        deny reports of abuse of parents and children. Many experts who 
        testify against abuse allegations lack expertise in the relevant 
        type of alleged abuse, relying instead on unsound and unproven 
        theories.
            (10) Judges presiding over custody cases involving 
        allegations of child abuse, child sexual abuse, and domestic 
        violence are rarely required to receive training on these 
        subjects, and most States have not established standards for 
        such training.
SEC. 1503. <<NOTE: 34 USC 10446 note.>>  PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this title are to--
            (1) increase the priority given to child safety in any State 
        court divorce, separation, visitation, paternity, child support, 
        civil protection order, or family custody court proceeding 
        affecting the custody and care of children, excluding child 
        protective, abuse, or neglect proceedings and juvenile justice 
        proceedings;
            (2) strengthen the abilities of courts to--
                    (A) recognize and adjudicate domestic violence and 
                child abuse allegations based on valid, admissible 
                evidence; and
                    (B) enter orders that protect and minimize the risk 
                of harm to children; and

[[Page 136 STAT. 953]]

            (3) ensure that professional personnel involved in cases 
        containing domestic violence or child abuse allegations receive 
        trauma-informed and culturally appropriate training on the 
        dynamics, signs, and impact of domestic violence and child 
        abuse, including child sexual abuse.

SEC. 825. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE ON ESCALATION AND DE-
                        ESCALATION OF GRAY ZONE ACTIVITIES IN 
                        GREAT POWER COMPETITION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The conventional power of the United States has driven 
        foreign adversaries to a level of competition that does not 
        always depend on military confrontation with the United States.

[[Page 136 STAT. 1026]]

            (2) Rather than challenging the United States in a manner 
        that could provoke a kinetic military response, foreign 
        adversaries of the United States have turned to carrying out 
        gray zone activities to advance the interests of such 
        adversaries, weaken the power of the United States, and erode 
        the norms that underpin the United States-led international 
        order.
            (3) Gray zone activity falls on a spectrum of attribution 
        and deniability that ranges from covert adversary operations, to 
        detectible covert adversary operations, to unattributable 
        adversary operations, to deniable adversary operations, to open 
        adversary operations.
            (4) To adequately address such a shift to gray zone 
        activity, the United States must understand what actions tend to 
        either escalate or de-escalate such activity by its adversaries.
            (5) The laws, principles, and values of the United States 
        are strategic advantages in great power competition with 
        authoritarian foreign adversaries that carry out gray zone 
        activities, because such laws, principles, and values increase 
        the appeal of the governance model of the United States, and the 
        United States-led international order, to states and peoples 
        around the world.
            (6) The international security environment has demonstrated 
        numerous examples of gray zone activities carried out by foreign 
        adversaries, including the following activities of foreign 
        adversaries:
                    (A) Information operations, such as efforts by 
                Russia to influence the 2020 United States Federal 
                elections (as described in the March 15, 2021, 
                intelligence community assessment of the Office of the 
                Director of National Intelligence made publicly 
                available on March 15, 2021).
                    (B) Adversary political coercion operations, such as 
                the wielding of energy by Russia, particularly in the 
                context of Ukrainian gas pipelines, to coerce its 
                neighbors into compliance with its policies.
                    (C) Adversary economic coercion operations, such as 
                the threat, and use, by China of economic retaliation to 
                coerce sovereign countries into compliance with its 
                policies or to blunt any criticism of its violations of 
                the rules-based international order and its perpetration 
                of severe human rights abuses.
                    (D) Cyber operations, such as the use by China of 
                cyber tools to conduct industrial espionage.
                    (E) Provision of support to proxy forces, such as 
                the support provided by Iran to Hezbollah and Shia 
                militia groups.
                    (F) Provocation by armed forces controlled by the 
                government of the foreign adversary through measures 
                that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, such 
                as the use of the China Coast Guard and maritime militia 
                by China to harass the fishing vessels of other 
                countries in the South China Sea.
                    (G) Alleged uses of lethal force on foreign soil, 
                such as the 2018 poisoning of Sergei Skripal in London 
                by Russia.
                    (H) The potential use by an adversary of technology 
                that causes anomalous health incidents among United 
                States Government personnel.

[[Page 136 STAT. 1027]]

    (b) National Intelligence Estimate.--
            (1) Requirement.--The Director of National Intelligence, 
        acting through the National Intelligence Council, shall produce 
        a National Intelligence Estimate on how foreign adversaries use 
        gray zone activities to advance interests, what responses by the 
        United States (or the allies or partners of the United States) 
        would tend to result in the escalation or de-escalation of such 
        gray zone activities by foreign adversaries, and any 
        opportunities for the United States to minimize the extent to 
        which foreign adversaries use gray zone activities in 
        furtherance of great power competition.
            (2) <<NOTE: Determination. Assessments.>>  Matters 
        included.--To the extent determined appropriate by the National 
        Intelligence Council, the National Intelligence Estimate 
        produced under paragraph (1) may include an assessment of the 
        following topics:
                    (A) Any potential or actual lethal or harmful gray 
                zone activities carried out against the United States by 
                foreign adversaries, including against United States 
                Government employees and United States persons, whether 
                located within or outside of the United States.
                    (B) To the extent such activities have occurred, or 
                are predicted to occur--
                          (i) opportunities to reduce or deter any such 
                      activities; and
                          (ii) any actions of the United States 
                      Government that would tend to result in the 
                      escalation or de-escalation of such activities.
                    (C) Any incidents in which foreign adversaries could 
                have used, but ultimately did not use, gray zone 
                activities to advance the interests of such adversaries, 
                including an assessment as to why the foreign adversary 
                ultimately did not use gray zone activities.
                    (D) The effect of lowering the United States 
                Government threshold for the public attribution of 
                detectible covert adversary operations, unattributable 
                adversary operations, and deniable adversary operations.
                    (E) The effect of lowering the United States 
                Government threshold for responding to detectible covert 
                adversary operations, unattributable adversary 
                operations, and deniable adversary operations.
                    (F) The extent to which the governments of foreign 
                adversaries exercise control over any proxies or 
                parastate actors used by such governments in carrying 
                out gray zone activities.
                    (G) The extent to which gray zone activities carried 
                out by foreign adversaries affect the private sector of 
                the United States.
                    (H) The international norms that provide the 
                greatest deterrence to gray zone activities carried out 
                by foreign adversaries, and opportunities for 
                strengthening those norms.
                    (I) The effect, if any, of the strengthening of 
                democratic governance abroad on the resilience of United 
                States allies and partners to gray zone activities.
                    (J) Opportunities to strengthen the resilience of 
                United States allies and partners to gray zone 
                activities, and associated tactics, carried out by 
                foreign adversaries.

[[Page 136 STAT. 1028]]

                    (K) Opportunities for the United States to improve 
                the detection of, and early warning for, such activities 
                and tactics.
                    (L) Opportunities for the United States to galvanize 
                international support in responding to such activities 
                and tactics.

   DIVISION Z <<NOTE: Israel Relations Normalization Act of 2022.>> --
ISRAEL RELATIONS NORMALIZATION ACT OF 2022
SEC. 101. <<NOTE: 22 USC 8601 note.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    This division may be cited as the ``Israel Relations Normalization 
Act of 2022''.
SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Support for peace between Israel and its neighbors has 
        longstanding bipartisan support in Congress.
            (2) For decades, Congress has promoted Israel's acceptance 
        among Arab and other relevant countries and regions by passing 
        numerous laws opposing efforts to boycott, isolate, and 
        stigmatize America's ally, Israel.
            (3) The recent peace and normalization agreements between 
        Israel and several Arab states--the United Arab Emirates, 
        Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco--have the potential to fundamentally 
        transform the security, diplomatic, and economic environment in 
        the Middle East and North Africa and advance vital United States 
        national security interests.
            (4) These historic agreements could help advance peace 
        between and among Israel, the Arab states, and other relevant 
        countries and regions, further diplomatic openings, and enhance 
        efforts towards a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
        conflict resulting in two states--a democratic Jewish state of 
        Israel and a viable, democratic Palestinian state--living side 
        by side in peace, security, and mutual recognition.
            (5) These agreements build upon the decades-long leadership 
        of the United States Government in helping Israel broker peace 
        treaties with Egypt and Jordan and promoting peace talks between 
        Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinians.
            (6) These agreements also build on decades of private 
        diplomatic and security engagement between Israel and countries 
        in the region.

[[Page 136 STAT. 1060]]

            (7) These normalization and peace agreements could begin to 
        transform the region by spurring economic growth, investment, 
        and tourism, enhancing technological innovation, promoting 
        security cooperation, bolstering water security and sustainable 
        development, advancing understanding, and forging closer people-
        to-people relations.
SEC. 103. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.

    In this division, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' 
means the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee

SEC. 104. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to expand and strengthen the Abraham Accords to 
        encourage other nations to normalize relations with Israel and 
        ensure that existing agreements reap tangible security and 
        economic benefits for the citizens of those countries;
            (2) to develop and implement a regional strategy to 
        encourage economic cooperation between and among Israel, Arab 
        states, and the Palestinians to enhance the prospects for peace, 
        respect for human rights, transparent governance, and for 
        cooperation to address water scarcity, climate solutions, health 
        care, sustainable development, and other areas that result in 
        benefits for residents of those countries and regions;
            (3) to develop and implement a regional security strategy 
        that recognizes the shared threat posed by Iran and violent 
        extremist organizations, ensures sufficient United States 
        deterrence in the region, builds partner capacity to address 
        shared threats, and explores multilateral security arrangements 
        built around like-minded partners;
            (4) to support and encourage government-to-government and 
        grassroots initiatives aimed at normalizing ties with the state 
        of Israel and promoting people-to-people contact between 
        Israelis, Arabs, and residents of other relevant countries and 
        regions, including by expanding and enhancing the Abraham 
        Accords;
            (5) to support a negotiated solution to the Israeli-
        Palestinian conflict resulting in two states living side by side 
        in peace, security, and mutual recognition;
            (6) to implement the Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership 
        for Peace Act (title VIII of division K of Public Law 116-260), 
        which will support economic development and peacebuilding 
        efforts among Israelis and Palestinians, in a manner which 
        encourages regional allies to become international donors to 
        these efforts;
            (7) to oppose efforts to delegitimize the state of Israel 
        and legal barriers to normalization with Israel; and
            (8) to work to combat anti-Semitism and support 
        normalization with Israel, including by countering anti-Semitic 
        narratives on social media and state media and pressing for 
        curricula reform in education.

                        the Normalization of Relations with Israel 
                        Act of 2022.>>  BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS TO 
                        NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Strengthening 
Reporting of Actions Taken Against the Normalization of Relations with 
Israel Act of 2022''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Arab League, an organization comprising 22 Middle 
        Eastern and African countries and entities, has maintained an 
        official boycott of Israeli companies and Israeli-made goods 
        since the founding of Israel in 1948.
            (2) Longstanding United States policy has encouraged Arab 
        League states to normalize their relations with Israel and has 
        long prioritized funding cooperative programs that promote 
        normalization between Arab League States and Israel, including 
        the Middle East Regional Cooperation program, which promotes 
        Arab-Israeli scientific cooperation.
            (3) While some Arab League governments are signaling 
        enhanced cooperation with the state of Israel on the government-
        to-government level, most continue to persecute their own 
        citizens who establish people-to-people relations with Israelis 
        in nongovernmental fora, through a combination of judicial and 
        extrajudicial retribution.
            (4) Some Arab League states maintain draconian anti-
        normalization laws that punish their citizens for people-to-
        people relations with Israelis, with punishments, including 
        imprisonment, revocation of citizenship, and execution. 
        Extrajudicial punishments by these and other Arab states include 
        summary imprisonment, accusations of ``treason'' in government-
        controlled media, and professional blacklisting.
            (5) Anti-normalization laws, together with the other forms 
        of retribution, effectively condemn these societies to mutual 
        estrangement and, by extension, reduce the possibility of 
        conciliation and compromise.
            (6) Former Israeli President Shimon Peres said in 2008 at 
        the United Nations that Israel agrees with the Arab Peace 
        Initiative that a military solution to the conflict ``will not 
        achieve peace or provide security for the parties''.
            (7) Despite the risk of retaliatory action, a rising tide of 
        Arab civic actors advocate direct engagement with Israeli 
        citizens and residents. These include the Arab Council for 
        Regional Integration, a group of 32 public figures from 15 Arab 
        countries who oppose the boycott of Israel on the grounds that 
        the boycott has denied Arabs the benefits of partnership with 
        Israelis, has blocked Arabs from helping to bridge the

[[Page 136 STAT. 1063]]

        Israeli-Palestinian divide, and inspired divisive intra-Arab 
        boycotts among diverse sects and ethnic groups.
            (8) On February 11, 2020, a delegation of the Arab Council 
        to the French National Assembly in Paris testified to the 
        harmful effects of ``anti-normalization laws'', called on the 
        Assembly to enact a law instructing the relevant French 
        authorities to issue an annual report on instances of Arab 
        government retribution for any of their citizens or residents 
        who call for peace with Israel or engage in direct civil 
        relations with Israeli citizens, and requested democratic 
        legislatures to help defend the region's civil peacemakers.
            (9) On May 11, 2020, 85 leaders in France published an 
        endorsement of the Arab Council's proposal, calling on France 
        and other democratic governments to ``protect Arabs who engage 
        in dialogue with Israeli citizens'' and proposing ``the creation 
        of a study group in the National Assembly as well as in the 
        Senate whose mission would be to ensure a legal and technical 
        monitoring of the obstacles which Arab proponents of dialogue 
        with Israelis face''.
            (10) Arab-Israeli cooperation provides significant symbiotic 
        benefit to the security and economic prosperity of the region.

    (c) Additional Reporting.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Time period.>>  In general.--Not later than 90 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually 
        thereafter for 5 years, the Secretary of State shall submit to 
        the appropriate congressional committees a report on the status 
        of efforts to promote normalization of relations with Israel and 
        other countries .
            (2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall 
        include the following information:
                    (A) The status of ``anti-normalization laws'' in 
                countries comprising the Arab League, including efforts 
                within each country to sharpen existing laws, enact new 
                or additional ``anti-normalization legislation'', or 
                repeal such laws.
                    (B) Instances of the use of state-owned or state-
                operated media outlets to promote anti-Semitic 
                propaganda, the prosecution of citizens or residents of 
                Arab countries for calling for peace with Israel, 
                visiting the state of Israel, or engaging Israeli 
                citizens in any way.
                    (C) Instances of extrajudicial retribution by Arab 
                governments or government-controlled institutions 
                against citizens or residents of Arab countries for any 
                of the same actions referred to in subparagraph (B).

SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) terrorist and violent extremist organizations, such as 
        Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram, the Islamic State 
        of West Africa, and other affiliated groups, have killed tens of 
        thousands of innocent civilians, displaced populations, 
        destabilized local and national governments, and caused mass 
        human suffering in the affected communities;
            (2) poor governance, political and economic marginalization, 
        and lack of accountability for human rights abuses by security 
        forces are drivers of extremism;
            (3) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States--
                    (A) to combat the spread of terrorism and violent 
                extremism; and
                    (B) to build the capacity of partner countries to 
                combat such threats in Africa;
            (4) terrorist and violent extremist organizations exploit 
        vulnerable and marginalized communities suffering from poverty, 
        lack of economic opportunity (particularly among youth 
        populations), corruption, and weak governance; and
            (5) a comprehensive, coordinated, interagency approach is 
        needed to develop an effective strategy--
                    (A) to address the security challenges in the Sahel-
                Maghreb;
                    (B) to appropriately allocate resources and de-
                conflict programs; and
                    (C) to maximize the effectiveness of United States 
                defense, diplomatic, and development capabilities.
SEC. 103. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to assist countries in North 
Africa and West Africa, and other allies and partners that are active in 
those regions, in combating terrorism and violent extremism through a 
coordinated, interagency approach with a consistent strategy that 
appropriately balances security activities with diplomatic and 
development efforts to address the political, socioeconomic, governance, 
and development challenges in North Africa and West Africa that 
contribute to terrorism and violent extremism.

SEC. 202. <<NOTE: 51 USC 20145 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) NASA uses enhanced-use leasing to enter into agreements 
        with private sector entities, State and local governments, 
        academic institutions, and other Federal agencies for lease of 
        non-excess, underutilized NASA properties and facilities.
            (2) NASA uses enhanced-use leasing authority to support 
        responsible management of its real property, including to 
        improve the use of underutilized property for activities that 
        are compatible with NASA's mission and to reduce facility 
        operating and maintenance costs.
            (3) In fiscal year 2019, under its enhanced-use lease 
        authority, NASA leased 65 real properties.
            (4) In fiscal year 2019, NASA's use of enhanced-use leasing 
        resulted in the collection of $10,843,025.77 in net revenue.
            (5) In fiscal year 2019, NASA used a portion of its 
        enhanced-use leasing revenues for repairs of facility control 
        systems such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air 
        conditioning.
            (6) NASA's use of enhanced-use leasing authority can 
        contribute to reducing the rate of increase of the Agency's 
        overall deferred maintenance cost.
