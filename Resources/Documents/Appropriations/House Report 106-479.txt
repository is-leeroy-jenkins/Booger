    Sec. 170. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The District of Columbia has recently witnessed 
        a spate of senseless killings of innocent citizens 
        caught in the crossfire of shootings. A Justice 
        Department crime victimization survey found that while 
        the city saw a decline in the homicide rate between 
        1996 and 1997, the rate was the highest among a dozen 
        cities and more than double the second highest city.
            (2) The District of Columbia has not made adequate 
        funding available to fight drug abuse in recent years, 
        and the city has not deployed its resources as 
        effectively as possible. In fiscal year 1998, 
        $20,900,000 was spent on publicly funded drug treatment 
        in the District compared to $29,000,000 in fiscal year 
        1993. The District's Addiction and Prevention and 
        Recovery Agency currently has only 2,200 treatment 
        slots, a 50 percent drop from 1994, with more than 
        1,100 people on waiting lists.
            (3) The District of Columbia has seen a rash of 
        inmate escapes from halfway houses. According to 
        Department of Corrections records, between October 21, 
        1998 and January 19, 1999, 376 of the 1,125 inmates 
        assigned to halfway houses walked away. Nearly 280 of 
        the 376 escapees were awaiting trial including two 
        charged with murder.
            (4) The District of Columbia public schools system 
        faces serious challenges in correcting chronic 
        problems, particularly long-standing deficiencies in 
        providing special education services to the 1 in 10 
        District students needing program benefits, including 
        backlogged assessments, and repeated failure to meet a 
        compliance agreement on special education reached with 
        the Department of Education.
            (5) Deficiencies in the delivery of basic public 
        services from cleaning streets to waiting time at 
        Department of Motor Vehicles to a rat population 
        estimated earlier this year to exceed the human 
        population have generated considerable public 
        frustration.
            (6) Last year, the District of Columbia forfeited 
        millions of dollars in Federal grants after Federal 
        auditors determined that several agencies exceeded 
        grant restrictions and in other instances, failed to 
        spend funds before the grants expired.
            (7) Findings of a 1999 report by the Annie E. Casey 
        Foundation that measured the well-being of children 
        reflected that, with one exception, the District ranked 
        worst in the United States in every category from 
        infant mortality to the rate of teenage births to 
        statistics chronicling child poverty.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress 
that in considering the District of Columbia's fiscal year 2001 
budget, the Congress will take into consideration progress or 
lack of progress in addressing the following issues:
            (1) Crime, including the homicide rate, 
        implementation of community policing, the number of 
        police officers on local beats, and the closing down of 
        open-air drug markets.
            (2) Access to drug abuse treatment, including the 
        number of treatment slots, the number of people served, 
        the number of people on waiting lists, and the 
        effectiveness of treatment programs.
            (3) Management of parolees and pretrial violent 
        offenders, including the number of halfway house 
        escapes and steps taken to improve monitoring and 
        supervision of halfway house residents to reduce the 
        number of escapes.
            (4) Education, including access to special 
        education services and student achievement.
            (5) Improvement in basic city services, including 
        rat control and abatement.
            (6) Application for and management of Federal 
        grants.
            (7) Indicators of child well-being.
    Sec. 171. The Mayor, prior to using Federal Medicaid 
payments to Disproportionate Share Hospitals to serve a small 
number of childless adults, should consider the recommendations 
of the Health Care Development Commission that has been 
appointed by the Council of the District of Columbia to review 
this program, and consult and report to Congress on the use of 
these funds.
    Sec. 172. GAO Study of District of Columbia Criminal 
Justice System. Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United 
States shall--
            (1) conduct a study of the law enforcement, court, 
        prison, probation, parole, and other components of the 
        criminal justice system of the District of Columbia, in 
        order to identify the components most in need of 
        additional resources, including financial, personnel, 
        and management resources; and
            (2) submit to Congress a report on the results of 
        the study under paragraph (1).
    Sec. 173. Nothing in this Act bars the District of Columbia 
Corporation Counsel from reviewing or commenting on briefs in 
private lawsuits, or from consulting with officials of the 
District government regarding such lawsuits.
    Sec. 174. Wireless Communications.--(a) In General.--Not 
later than 7 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,

the National Park Service, shall--
            (1) implement the notice of decision approved by 
        the National Capital Regional Director, dated April 7, 
        1999, including the provisions of the notice of 
        decision concerning the issuance of right-of-way 
        permits at market rates; and
            (2) expend such sums as are necessary to carry out 
        paragraph (1).
    (b) Antenna Applications.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the 
        receipt of an application, a Federal agency that 
        receives an application submitted after the enactment

        on Federal property in the District of Columbia or 
        surrounding area over which the Federal agency 
        exercises control shall take final action on the 
        application, including action on the issuance of right-
        of-way permits at market rates.
            (2) Existing law.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        be construed to affect the applicability of existing 
        laws regarding--
                    (A) judicial review under chapter 7 of 
                title 5, United States Code (the Administrative

                other applicable Federal statutes; and
                    (C) the authority of a State or local 
                government or instrumentality thereof, 
                including the District of Columbia, in the

                personal wireless service facilities.

       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

    The managers on the part of the House and Senate on the 
disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the 
Senate to the bill (H.R. 3194) making appropriations for the 
District of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole 
or in part against revenues of said District for the fiscal 
year ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes, submit 
the following joint statement to the House and the Senate in 
explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the 
managers and recommended in the accompanying conference report.
    The composition of this conference agreement includes more 
than the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for fiscal 
year 2000. While the House version of H.R. 3194 and the Senate 
amendment in the nature of a substitute dealt only with 
District of Columbia appropriations, the conference report was 
expanded to include appropriations for other departments and 
agencies as well as some authorizing legislation. These 
appropriations are included in Division B.
    Since the conference agreement is expanded to include 
matters beyond those relating to the District of Columbia 
appropriations, the title of the bill is amended to reflect 
this.

                               DIVISION A

                  District of Columbia Appropriations

    The Division A portion of this joint explanatory statement 
includes more than a description of the resolution of the 
differences between the House and Senate versions of H.R. 3194. 
It also provides a fuller description of the matter not in 
disagreement between the two Houses. Since H.R. 2587 and H.R. 
3064, previous District of Columbia Appropriations Acts for 
fiscal year 2000, were vetoed, the conferees have expanded this 
statement to provide an explanation of the additional matter in 
these bills that was not changed in H.R. 3194 as guidance in 
implementing this conference agreement.
    A description of the resolution of the differences between 
the House and Senate on H.R. 3194 follows next.

                           GENERAL STATEMENT

                Blue Plains Waste Water Treatment Plant

    The conferees are concerned over recent reports about 
serious safety problems relating to hazardous chemical storage 
and handling at the Blue Plains Waste Water Treatment Plant, 
especially in Chlorine Building I. In 1998 the District of 
Columbia Water and Sewer Authority reported that the chlorine 
facility's ``control systems are outdated and marginally 
adequate.'' To reduce the risk to human health and the 
environment, the Water and Sewer Authority is directed to 
undertake immediately the design study of an alternate 
disinfection facility that will discontinue use of liquid 
chlorine and to report back to the Congress with its findings 
by December 31, 2000. In addition, the Water and Sewer 
Authority is directed to accelerate the construction schedule 
of the alternate disinfection facility, with the goal of 
completing the new facility by December 31, 2002, instead of 
the end of 2005 as called for in the Water and Sewer 
Authority's Water and Sewer Facilities Master Plan of 1998.

                          Infrastructure Fund

    The FY 1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations Act (Public Law 105-277) provided $50,000,000 
primarily for the repair and maintenance of roads, highways, 
bridges and transit in the District. The conferees are 
concerned that a tentative plan submitted to Congress, as 
required by the FY 1999 conference agreement, includes funding 
for certain projects that do not appear to fulfill the basic 
intent of the appropriation, which is to improve the 
deteriorated infrastructure of the District. The projects in 
question would expend over $6,000,000 (or more than 10 percent 
of the appropriation) for millennium year activities and 
program support functions. The conferees request that the DC 
Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority 
submit a revised spending plan to Congress within 30 days of 
enactment of this Act that focuses on repair and maintenance of 
roads, highways, bridges and transit in the District. The 
conferees note that the FY 1999 Omnibus Consolidated and 
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act also provided 
$25,000,000 in Federal funds for economic development planning, 
project development, capital investments, loans, grants, 
administrative expenses and other purposes. With the District's 
infrastructure being in a state of disrepair, the conferees 
believe the $50,000,000 in the infrastructure fund should be 
used exclusively for infrastructure repairs and maintenance, 
and the $25,000,000 for economic development should be used for 
economic development purposes.

                             FEDERAL FUNDS

            Defender Services in District of Columbia Courts

    The conference action clarifies that interest earned on the 
FY 1999 Federal payment to the District of Columbia courts is 
required to be used to make payments under this heading for 
fiscal years 1999 and 2000. The availability of this additional 
amount is contingent on a certification by the Comptroller 
General. The Courts have reported that they anticipate a 
shortfall of ``approximately $1,000,000'' in fiscal year 1999 
for the Criminal Justice Act program.

         Federal Payment to the General Services Administration

    The conference action appropriates $6,700,000 for 
environmental clean-up costs near three proposed public schools 
that are to be constructed in southern Fairfax County on land 
currently occupied by the Lorton Correctional Complex which is 
scheduled to be closed.

                       DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FUNDS

                       Productivity Bank Savings

    The conference agreement inserts the word ``aggregate'' in 
the second sentence under this heading to clarify the cost 
savings or additional revenues to be derived. This language 
allows the District to finance projects from the Productivity 
Bank even if each project does not generate cost savings or 
additional revenues dollar-for-dollar as long as the total 
amount of projects generate an ``aggregate'' amount of savings 
for the Productivity Bank Savings equal to the total amount 
spent from the Productivity Bank.

                           General Provisions

    The conference action continues the prohibition in section 
150 on using Federal or local funds to support needle exchange 
programs, but without the prohibition on privately-funded 
programs. The conference action also inserts a new subsection 
(b) that requires those who carry out a needle exchange program 
and who receive any funds in this Act to account for all funds 
used for needle exchange programs separately from any funds 
contained in this Act.
    Section 157 in both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 
3194 (as well as the conference agreements on H.R. 2587 and 
H.R. 3064) includes $18,000,000 for severance and payments 
toward the Management Supervisory Service (MSS) program. MSS 
will provide increases in pay for those employees who sever 
themselves from career status and move into the MSS program. 
This classification allows for the termination of managers who 
do not achieve agreed upon performance outcomes. A portion of 
the money may be used as bonus pay for Compensation I and II 
employees, prior to implementing pay-for-performance plans, 
depending upon a plan agreed upon by the Mayor, the DC 
Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, 
the City Council and the Chief Financial Officer.
    The conference action inserts a new section 175 that amends 
the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban 
Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 
(Public Law 106-74), by making certain technical corrections 
and adding language reflecting the intent of the conferees on 
that Act. Language is included in the bill which provides for 
the availability of funds for the National and Community 
Service Programs Operating and Expenses account until September 
30, 2001. Public Law 106-74, which contains the appropriation 
for this account, inadvertently provided for the funding to 
remain available only until September 30, 2000. In the past 
this account has been available for two years and this 
technical correction reinstates that policy.
      The conference action inserts a new section 176 that 
allows $1,000,000 in Federal funds for the Georgetown 
Waterfront Park Fund, initially appropriated in the FY 1999 DC 
Appropriations Act (Public Law 105-277), to remain available 
until expended.

         PRIOR CONFERENCE AGREEMENTS ON H.R. 2587 AND H.R. 3064

    What follows next is a description of the resolution of 
selected differences between the House and Senate on the 
District of Columbia Appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2000 
as contained in H.R. 2587 and H.R. 3064, that were vetoed. Even 
though there were differences between the House and Senate 
versions of H.R. 2587 and H.R. 3064, the resolution of nearly 
all of these differences was incorporated as identical text in 
the House-passed version and the Senate amendment to H.R. 3194. 
A description of the resolution of these differences is 
included in this conference agreement because an understanding 
of them is important to the overall implementation of this Act.
    The conference agreement on H.R. 3194 incorporates some of 
the provisions of both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 
2587 and H.R. 3064. The language and allocations set forth in 
House Report 106-249 and Senate Report 106-88 are to be 
complied with unless specifically addressed in the accompanying 
bill and statement of the managers to the contrary. The 
agreement herein, while repeating some report language for 
emphasis, does not negate the language referenced above unless 
expressly provided. General provisions which were identical in 
the House and Senate passed versions of H.R. 2587 and not 
changed in H.R. 3064 or H.R. 3194 and that are unchanged by 
this conference agreement are approved unless provided to the 
contrary herein.

                             FEDERAL FUNDS

              Federal Payment for Resident Tuition Support

    Appropriates $17,000,000 as proposed by the House and the 
Senate and makes modifications specifying that the entire 
$17,000,000 will be available if the authorized program is a nationwide 
program and $11,000,000 will be available if the program is for a 
limited number of States. The language also allows the District to use 
local tax revenues for this program.

        Federal Payment for Incentives for Adoption of Children

    Appropriates $5,000,000 instead of $8,500,000 as proposed 
by the House and includes language allowing the funds to be

system and for health care needs of the children in accordance 
with legislation to be enacted by the District government.

         Federal Payment to the Citizen Complaint Review Board

    Appropriates $500,000 instead of $1,200,000 as proposed by

in fiscal year 2000. The conferees recognize the importance of 
an independent review body to act as a forum for the review and 
resolution of complaints against officers of the Metropolitan 
Police Department and special officers employed by the District 
of Columbia. The conferees also request that the Mayor's office 
provide a comprehensive plan for the use of the Civilian 
Complaint Review Board. The plan/report should contain 
information about the problems of the previous review board and 
what will be done to avoid these problems with the new board.

unexpected increase in the overall inmate population.

    Appropriates $99,714,000 instead of $100,714,000 as 
proposed by the House and $136,440,000 as proposed by the

information submitted by the Courts with their FY 2001 and 
future budgets include grants and reimbursements from all other

of $13,200,000 and $10,000,000, respectively, as proposed by 
the House.

                   Children's National Medical Center

           Federal Payment for Metropolitan Police Department

    Appropriates $1,000,000 for the Metropolitan Police as 
proposed by the Senate. The conferees recognize the devastating 
problems caused by illegal drug use and fully support this 
program to eliminate open air drug trafficking in all four 
quadrants of the District of Columbia. The conferees have 
included language requiring quarterly reports to the Congress 
on all four quadrants. The reports should include, at a 
minimum, the amounts expended, the number of personnel 
involved, and the overall results and effectiveness of the open 
air drug program in eliminating the drug trafficking problem.

                       DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FUNDS

advised that the Office of Corporation Counsel is responsible 
for developing, operating, and maintaining this system which is 
used by the District's courts to collect child support payments 
from absentee parents, disburse payments to custodial parents, 
and account for these activities. The conferees urge the 
District's Chief Technology Officer to provide the Office of 
Corporation Counsel with the necessary support to ensure that: 
(1) The system is promptly remediated and tested, and (2) a 
business continuity and contingency plan that includes a 
Courts' child support functions is in place. The conferees 
request a report on this matter by November 1, 1999.

other funds as proposed by the House and $778,470,000 including 
$565,211,000 from local funds and $184,247,000 from other funds 
as proposed by the Senate. The increase of $300,000 above the 
Senate allowance will provide a total of $1,200,000 for the 
Citizen Complaint Review Board consisting of $500,000 in 
Federal funds and $700,000 in local funds instead of a total of 
$900,000 in local funds as proposed by the Senate.

    The conferees recommend that the Fire and Emergency Medical 
Services Department conduct a study about the need for 
placement of automated external defibrillators in Federal 
buildings.

                        public education system

    The conference action includes the proviso proposed by the 
Senate concerning the Weighted Student Formula and the setting 
aside of five percent of the total budget which is to be 
apportioned when the current student count for public and 
charter schools has been completed. The conference action also 
includes a proviso proposed by the Senate allowing $500,000 for 
a Schools Without Violence program.
    The conferees to H.R. 3064 are aware of the Values First 
program that is designed to bring character education to the 
District's public elementary schools. The conferees are aware 
that ten schools now have such a program. The conferees 
encourage the public school system to continue to expand the 
Values First program and expend the funds necessary to 
implement this program on a broader basis.

                         human support services

    Appropriates $1,526,361,000 including $635,373,000 from

year 2000 Financial Plan which is the starting point for the 
independent auditor's comparison with actual year-end results 
as required by section 143 of the bill follow:



                           General Provisions

sequential purposes and makes technical revisions in certain 
citations. Unless noted otherwise, the conference action refers 
to H.R. 2587.

bill (new section 128) concerning financial management 
services.

expenses in section 135 (new section 136) to $5,515,379,000

surplus of not less than 4 percent. Any funds in excess of this

bill (new section 163) requiring descriptions of certain budget 
categories.

bill (new section 164) concerning improvements to the Southwest

District of Columbia. The conferees believe that the Commercial 
Revitalization program will be an important tool for the city 
to improve blighted neighborhoods in the District of Columbia.

enterprises into neglected areas of the city. The conferees 
direct the District to review Congressional proposals on this 
issue in order to use the funds effectively.

Accounting Office of the District's criminal justice system. 
The conferees request that this be a comprehensive study of all 
components of the criminal justice system including law 
enforcement, courts, corrections, probation, and parole. The 
report should include recommendations for improving the 
performance of the overall system as well as the individual 
agencies and programs.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Departments of Commerce,

Appropriations Act, 2000''.
      Following is explanatory language on H.R. 3421, as 
introduced on November 17, 1999.
      The conferees on H.R. 3194 agree with the matter inserted 
in this division of this conference agreement and the following 
description of this matter. This matter was developed through 
negotiations on the differences in H.R. 2670, the Departments 
of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000, by members of the 
subcommittees of both the House and Senate with jurisdiction 
over H.R. 2670.
      H.R. 2670 was vetoed. The format of the statement of the 
managers for this division is, in general, a repetition of the 
statement of the managers for the vetoed conference report with 
modifications to reflect the changes to the vetoed bill. 
References in the following statement to appropriations amounts 
or other items proposed by the House bill or Senate amendment 
refer only to those amounts and items recommended in the House-
passed and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2670. Any reference 
to appropriations amounts or other items included in the 
conference agreement reflects the final agreement on H.R. 3194.

                     TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

                         General Administration

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $79,328,000 for General 
Administration as proposed in the House bill, instead of 
$82,485,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The conference 
agreement assumes requested increases for reimbursable 
workyears for the Office of Information and Privacy as proposed 
in the House and Senate reports, and for the Justice Management 
Division as proposed in the House report. No additional funding 
has been provided for additional positions for the Office of 
Intelligence and Policy Review.
      Within the total amount provided, the conference 
agreement includes $8,136,000 for the Department Leadership 
Program as proposed in both the House and Senate bills. In 
addition, the conference agreement includes a provision which 
retains the limitation on the Department Leadership Program to 
the level of augmentation that occurred in these offices in 
fiscal year 1999.
      The conference agreement also includes a provision that 
provides 41 permanent positions and 48 full-time equivalent 
workyears and $4,811,000 for the Offices of Legislative Affairs 
and Public Affairs, modified to allow the use of non-
reimbursable career detailees as proposed in the Senate bill. 
The House bill contained a similar provision, but did not allow 
for the use of non-reimbursable detailees.
      The conference agreement includes a provision that 
provides the Attorney General the authority to transfer 
forfeited property of limited value to a State or local 
government or its designee for certain community-based 
programs, subject to reprogramming requirements, as proposed in 
the House bill. The Senate bill did not contain this provision.
      The House report language with respect to the Department 
of Justice's actions to expeditiously protect the 
constitutional rights of all individuals is adopted by 
reference. In addition, the conferees concur with the direction 
included in the House report regarding comprehensive budget and 
financial reviews of Departmental components. The conferees 
expect the Attorney General to complete these reviews no later 
than January 15, 2000, and to provide a report to the 
Committees on Appropriations no later than February 15, 2000, 
on the results of these reviews and any recommendations for 
improvements in the budget and financial management practices 
of Departmental components.

                     joint automated booking system

      The conference agreement includes $1,800,000 as a 
separate account for the Joint Automated Booking System (JABS) 
program, instead of $6,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. 
The House bill did not provide a separate appropriation for 
JABS. A direct appropriation is provided to fund the 
Departmental program office established to run this program. In 
addition, should funding be available from Super Surplus funds 
under the Assets Forfeiture Fund, the Attorney General is 
expected to make available up to $4,200,000 for JABS 
development and deployment activities. The Senate report 
language regarding centralized funding for this program is 
adopted by reference.

                       narrowband communications

      The conference agreement includes $115,941,000 for 
narrowband communications conversion activities, instead of 
$125,370,000 as proposed in the House bill, and $20,000,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. Of this amount, $10,625,000 is 
provided as a direct appropriation, $92,545,000 is provided 
through transfers from Departmental components, and $12,771,000 
is provided from Super Surplus balances in the Assets 
Forfeiture Fund, should funds be available. The Senate bill 
proposed a direct appropriation of $20,000,000, and the House 
bill provided no direct appropriation but instead made funds 
available through transfers from Departmental components and 
Super Surplus balances from the Assets Forfeiture Fund.
      Within the amount provided, $10,625,000 is to support the 
Wireless Management Office (WMO), including systems planning 
and pilot tests, and $105,316,000 is for wireless replacement 
activities, and operations and maintenance of legacy systems. 
The conferees expect the Department of Justice to move forward 
with the Department-wide consolidated, regional, interagency 
strategy developed by the WMO, and have therefore centralized 
all funding for narrowband communications activities under the 
WMO. The conferees expect the WMO to submit to the Committees 
on Appropriations no later than February 15, 2000, a status 
report on implementation of this plan. The conference agreement 
adopts the recommendations included in the House and Senate 
reports regarding the fiscal year 2001 budget submission for 
narrowband activities, and the House report language regarding 
the transfer of unobligated balances to the WMO.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed in the Senate bill allowing funds to be transferred to 
any Department of Justice organization upon approval by the 
Attorney General, subject to reprogramming procedures. The 
House bill contained no similar provision.

                         counterterrorism fund

      The conference agreement includes $10,000,000 for the 
Counterterrorism Fund as proposed in the House bill, instead of 
$27,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. When combined with 
$22,340,581 in prior year carryover, a total of $32,340,581 
will be available in the Fund in fiscal year 2000 to cover 
unanticipated, extraordinary expenses incurred as a result of a 
terrorist threat or incident. The conferees reiterate the 
concerns expressed in both the House and Senate reports 
regarding the use of the Fund, and expect that the Fund will be 
used only for unanticipated, extraordinary expenses which 
cannot reasonably be accommodated within an agency's regular 
budget. The Attorney General is required to notify the 
Committees on Appropriations in accordance with section 605 of 
this Act, prior to the obligation of any funds from this 
account.
      The conference agreement adopts the direction included in 
the House and Senate reports regarding the National Domestic 
Preparedness Office. The House and Senate report language 
regarding funding for cyberterrorism and related activities, 
and the Senate report language regarding the development of a 
Continuity of Government comprehensive emergency plan is also 
adopted by reference. The Senate report language regarding the 
involvement of State and local governments in the annual update 
of the comprehensive counterterrorism and technology crime plan 
is adopted by reference.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed in the Senate bill allowing the Fund to be used for 
the costs of conducting assessments of Federal agencies and 
facilities. The House bill did not contain this provision.

               telecommunications carrier compliance fund

      The conference agreement includes $15,000,000, as 
proposed in both the House and Senate bills, for the 
Telecommunications Carrier Compliance program to reimburse 
equipment manufacturers and telecommunications carriers and 
providers of telecommunications services for implementation of 
the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 
(CALEA).

                   administrative review and appeals

      The conference agreement includes $148,499,000 for 
Administrative Review and Appeals, instead of $134,563,000 as 
proposed in the House bill and $89,978,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill, of which $50,363,000 is provided from the Violent 
Crime Reduction Trust Fund. Of the total amount provided, 
$146,899,000 is for the Executive Office for Immigration Review 
(EOIR) and $1,600,000 is for the Office of the Pardon Attorney.
      The conferees direct the Executive Office for Immigration 
Review to provide the following: (1) beginning on March 1, 
2000, semiannual reports on the number of immigration judges 
and Board of Immigration Appeals members; the number of cases 
pending and the number of cases completed before each body for 
each 6-month period; and the number of cases completed by type 
of completion (order of removal, termination, administratively 
closed, or relief granted) for those cases in each 6-month 
period; and (2) by April 1, 2000, a report, which should 
include consultation with the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and the private bar, on the feasibility of electronic 
filing of documents, such as Notices to Appear, applications 
for relief, Notices of Appeal, and briefs, with the Offices of 
Immigration Judges and with the Board of Immigration Review.

                      office of inspector general

      The conference agreement includes $40,275,000 for the 
Office of Inspector General, instead of $42,475,000 as proposed 
in the House bill, and $32,049,000 as proposed in the Senate 
bill.
      The conference agreement does not include requested bill 
language which was included in the House bill, but not in the 
Senate bill, to use 0.2 percent of Violent Crime Reduction 
Trust Funds to audit grant programs within the Department. The 
conference agreement includes requested language relating to 
motor vehicles, which was in the House bill but not in the 
Senate bill. The conference agreement includes bill language 
designating a portion of funds to be used for narrowband 
conversion activities and transfers these funds to the 
Department of Justice Wireless Management Office.
      The conferees are deeply concerned that Department 
employees accused of wrongdoing are not enjoying the swift 
justice that is every citizen's right. Though the Inspector 
General has made some progress in working down its backlog of 
``non-judicial cases'', including special investigations, there 
are still far too many investigations that have stretched as 
long as 60 months without action or resolution. The conferees 
direct that all cases opened before April 1, 1999 shall be 
resolved not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act in one of the following ways: (1) referral to the U.S. 
Attorneys for prosecution, (2) referral to the appropriate 
component for administrative punishment, (3) transmittal of a 
letter to the appropriate component for inclusion in the 
personnel jacket of the accused indicating case closure based 
upon a lack of evidence, or (4) transmittal of a letter to an 
appropriate component for inclusion in the personnel jacket of 
the accused indicating case closure based upon exoneration.
      The conferees understand that there may be extenuating 
circumstances for certain extraordinary cases which may not 
allow for compliance with this requirement. In such instances, 
the Office of Inspector General shall report in an appropriate 
manner, so as not to jeopardize the pending investigation, to 
the Committees on Appropriations, the status and anticipated 
completion date for these cases. This report shall be submitted 
no later than 90 days after the date of enactment and shall be 
updated on a semi-annual basis.

                    United States Parole Commission

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $8,527,000 for the U.S. 
Parole Commission, instead of $7,380,000 as proposed in the 
House bill and $7,176,000 as proposed in the Senate bill.

                            Legal Activities

            salaries and expenses, general legal activities

      The conference agreement includes $504,945,000 for 
General Legal Activities instead of $503,620,000 as proposed in 
the House bill, and $485,000,000 as proposed in the Senate 
bill, of which $147,929,000 is provided from the Violent Crime 
Reduction Trust Fund (VCRTF) as proposed in the House bill. Of 
this amount, $582,000 is to be transferred to the Presidential 
Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States.
      Except for amounts provided to the Civil Rights Division, 
the conference agreement includes no other program increases 
for this account, but instead has provided base adjustments 
proportionately distributed among the divisions. The 
distribution of funding included in the conference agreement is 
as follows:

Office of the Solicitor General.........................      $6,770,000
Tax Division............................................      67,200,000
Criminal Division.......................................     104,477,000
Civil Division..........................................     147,616,000
Environment and Natural Resources.......................      65,209,000
Office of Legal Counsel.................................       4,698,000
Civil Rights Division...................................      82,150,000
Interpol--USNCB.........................................       7,360,000
Legal Activities Office Automation......................      18,571,000
Office of Dispute Resolution............................         312,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Total.............................................     504,363,000

      The conference agreement allows $36,666,000 to remain 
available until expended for office automation costs, instead 
of $55,166,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, and $18,166,000 
as proposed in the House bill. The conference agreement adopts 
the Senate position that no funds are provided for the Joint 
Center for Strategic and Environmental Enforcement, and by 
reference adopts the House report language regarding 
extradition tracking systems.

               the national childhood vaccine injury act

      The conference agreement includes a reimbursement of 
$4,028,000 for fiscal year 2000 from the Vaccine Injury 
Compensation Trust Fund to the Department of Justice, as 
proposed in the Senate bill, instead of $3,424,000 as proposed 
in the House bill.

               salaries and expenses, antitrust division

      The conference agreement provides $110,000,000 for the 
Antitrust Division, instead of $112,318,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill, and $105,167,000 as proposed in the House bill. 
The conference agreement assumes that of the amount provided, 
$81,850,000 will be derived from fees collected in fiscal year 
2000, and $28,150,000 will be derived from estimated 
unobligated fee collections available from 1999 and prior 
years, resulting in a net direct appropriation of $0. It is 
intended that any excess fee collections shall remain available 
for the Antitrust Division in future years.
      The conferees are aware that the Division is facing 
increased requirements related to electronic data storage, data 
processing, and automated litigation support which have 
impacted the ability of the Antitrust Division to maintain its 
current base operating level. Therefore, the conference 
agreement has included sufficient funding to address these 
requirements to enable the Division to maintain the current 
operating level.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed in 
the Senate bill making technical corrections to code citations.

             salaries and expenses, united states attorneys

      The conference agreement includes $1,161,957,000 for the 
U.S. Attorneys as proposed in the House bill, instead of 
$1,089,478,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, all of which is 
a direct appropriation, instead of $500,000,000 from the 
Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund (VCRTF) as proposed in the 
Senate bill.
      The conference agreement provides a net increase of 
$60,755,000 for adjustments to base as follows: $69,944,000 is 
provided for annualization of the 96 positions provided in 
fiscal year 1999, as well as other pay and inflationary costs, 
offset by $9,189,000 in base decreases attributable to savings 
from the direction included in the Senate report regarding 
unstaffed offices, the provision of funding for the victims 
witness coordinator and advocate program from the Crime Victims 
Fund, and other non-recurring requirements.
      The conference agreement also includes the following 
program increases:
      Firearms Prosecutions.--The conference agreement provides 
$7,125,000 to continue and expand intensive firearms 
prosecution projects to enforce Federal laws designed to keep 
firearms out of the hands of criminals and to enhance existing 
law enforcement efforts. The conferees direct the Executive 
Office of U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) to submit a spending plan to 
the Committees on Appropriations no later than December 1, 
1999. This spending plan shall give priority consideration to 
the needs of those areas referenced in the Senate-passed bill, 
as well as other areas with high incidences of firearms 
violations.
      Legal Education.--The conference agreement provides a 
program increase of $2,300,000 to establish a distance learning 
facility at the National Advocacy Center (NAC) in accordance 
with the direction included in the Senate report. When combined 
with $15,015,000 included within base resources, as requested 
in the budget, a total of $17,315,000 is included under this 
account for legal education at the National Advocacy Center 
(NAC).
      Courtroom Technology.--The conference agreement provides 
$1,399,000 for technology demonstration projects, with priority 
given to the locations referred to in the Senate report.
      In addition, $1,000,000 is included from within base 
resources to continue a violent crime task force demonstration 
project to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of Internet 
sexual exploitation of children, to be administered under the 
auspices of Operation Streetsweeper, as proposed in the Senate 
bill.
      The conference agreement does not adopt the 
recommendations included in the Senate report regarding term 
appointments, civil defensive litigation, or child support 
enforcement.
      In addition to identical provisions that were included in 
both the House and Senate bills, the conference agreement 
includes the following provisions: (1) providing for 9,120 
positions and 9,398 workyears for the U.S. Attorneys, instead 
of 9,044 positions and 9,360 workyears as proposed in the House 
bill, and 9,044 positions and 9,312 workyears as proposed in 
the Senate bill; (2) allowing not to exceed $2,500,000 for debt 
collection activities to remain available for two years as 
proposed in the House bill; and (3) allowing not to exceed 
$2,500,000 for the National Advocacy Center and $1,000,000 for 
violent crime task forces to remain available until expended as 
proposed in the Senate bill. The conference agreement does not 
include language proposed in the Senate bill designating 
funding for civil defensive litigation, allowing the transfer 
of up to $20,000,000 from this account to the Federal Prisoner 
Detention account, and designating funding for certain task 
force activities.

                   united states trustee system fund

      The conference agreement provides $112,775,000 in budget 
authority for the U.S. Trustees, of which $106,775,000 is 
derived from fiscal year 2000 offsetting fee collections, and 
$6,000,000 is derived from interest earned on Fund investments, 
insteadof $112,775,000 in budget authority and fiscal year 2000 
offsetting fee collections as proposed in the Senate bill, and 
$114,248,000 in budget authority, of which $108,248,000 is derived from 
fiscal year 2000 offsetting fee collections and $6,000,000 in interest 
earnings as proposed in the House bill.
      The conference agreement assumes that $9,319,000 in prior 
year carryover will be available to the U.S. Trustees in fiscal 
year 2000, providing a total operating level of $122,094,000, 
the full amount necessary to maintain the current operating 
level of 1,128 positions and 1,059 workyears. The conferees 
remind the U.S. Trustees that amounts collected or otherwise 
available in excess of the total operating level assumed in the 
conference agreement are subject to section 605 of this Act. In 
addition, the conferees adopt by reference the Senate report 
language on the National Advocacy Center (NAC). The conferees 
direct the U.S. Trustees to report to the Committees on 
Appropriations no later than December 31, 1999, on the planned 
number and type of bankruptcy classes to be conducted at the 
NAC.
      The conference agreement includes a provision as proposed 
in the House bill to allow interest earned on Fund investment 
to be used for expenses in this appropriation. The Senate bill 
did not contain this provision.

      salaries and expenses, foreign claims settlement commission

      The conference agreement provides $1,175,000 for the 
Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, as requested and as 
provided in both the House and Senate bills, and assumes 
funding in accordance with both the House and Senate bills.

         salaries and expenses, united states marshals service

      The conference agreement includes $543,365,000 for the 
U.S. Marshals Service Salaries and Expenses account, instead of 
$538,909,000 as proposed in the House bill and $547,253,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. Of this amount, the conference 
agreement provides that $209,620,000 will be derived from the 
Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund (VCRTF) as proposed in the 
House bill, instead of $138,000,000 as proposed in the Senate 
bill.
      The amount included in the conference agreement includes 
a $29,832,000 net increase for inflationary and other base 
adjustments, including $1,600,000 to continue and expand the 
Marshals Service's subscriptions to credit bureau and personal 
and commercial property on-line services. The conferees remain 
seriously concerned about the Marshals Service's inability to 
accurately project its funding requirements and effectively 
manage the resources provided. Therefore, the conference 
agreement adopts by reference the language and direction 
included in the House report regarding budget and financial 
management practices.
      In addition, the conference agreement includes 
$20,424,000 in program increases for the following: (1) 
$4,003,000 (56 positions and 28 workyears) for courthouse 
security personnel related to activation of new courthouses 
opening in fiscal year 2000; (2) $2,600,000 for electronic 
surveillance unit equipment; and (3) $13,821,000 for courthouse 
security equipment, of which $9,000,000 is to be derived from 
the Working Capital Fund, to be provided for newly opening 
courthouses as follows:

      The conferees expect the Marshals Service to give 
priority to those facilities scheduled to come on line in the 
first half of fiscal year 2000, and expect to be notified in 
accordance with section 605 of this Act prior to any deviation 
from the above distribution.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
proposed in the Senate bill requiring a judge to submit a 
written request to the Attorney General for approval prior to 
the service of process by a Marshals Service employee. The 
conferees are aware of concerns regarding the impact that 
service of process duties is having on the Marshals Service. 
Therefore, the conferees direct the Attorney General and the 
Marshals Service to work with the Administrative Office of the 
Courts to study alternatives for service of process in certain 
cases in which no law enforcement presence is required, and to 
report back to the Committees on Appropriations no later than 
February 1, 2000, on the impact of such alternatives on the 
Marshals Service and the Federal Courts.
      In addition, the conferees concur with the recommendation 
included in the Senate report regarding the reallocation of 
personnel resulting from the defederalization of District of 
Columbia Superior Court operations. Should defederalization 
occur, the Marshals Service is directed to notify the 
Committees of such reallocation in accordance with section 605 
of this Act.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed in the Senate bill which limits the use of contract 
officers and limits the use of employees of the Marshals 
Service to serve process.

                              CONSTRUCTION

      The conference agreement includes $6,000,000 in direct 
appropriations for the U.S. Marshals Service Construction 
account instead of $9,632,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, 
and $4,600,000 as proposed in the House bill. An additional 
$2,600,000 is to be provided for this account should funds be 
available from Super Surplus balances in the Assets Forfeiture 
Fund. The conference agreement includes the following 
distribution of funds:

      The conferees expect to be notified in accordance with 
section 605 of this Act prior to any deviation from the above 
distribution.

         JUSTICE PRISONER AND ALIEN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FUND

      The conference report includes requested language 
permanently establishing a revolving fund for the operation of 
the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS), 
as provided in both the House and Senate bills. The conference 
agreement does not include direct funding of $9,000,000 
proposed in the Senate bill to pay for Marshals Service 
payments to the JPATS revolving fund. The conferees expect the 
Marshals Service to adequately budget for its own requirements 
for prisoner movements within its own base budget under the 
Salaries and Expenses account, as is the practice for all other 
agencies, and have addressed the Marshals Service's needs under 
that account.
      The conference agreement adopts the direction included in 
the House and Senate reports regarding full cost recovery, the 
direction included in the House report regarding system 
enhancements, and the direction included in the Senate report 
regarding surplus Department of Defense aircraft.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
amending the definition of public aircraft with respect to 
JPATS activities, which was proposed in the Senate bill.

                       FEDERAL PRISONER DETENTION

      The conference agreement provides $525,000,000 for 
Federal Prisoner Detention as proposed in the House bill, 
instead of $500,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, which 
is a $100,000,000 increase over the fiscal year 1999 level. 
This amount, combined with approximately $14,000,000 in 
carryover, will provide total funding of $539,000,000 in fiscal 
year 2000. The conferees remain extremely concerned about the 
inability of the Marshals Service to accurately project and 
manage the resources provided under this account. While the 
conferees appreciate the difficulty in projecting funding 
requirements, the wide fluctuations which have occurred in 
recent years are unacceptable. Given the conferees' continued 
concern about the ability of the Marshals Service to provide 
accurate cost projections, the recommendation includes the 
amount of funding identified as necessary to detain the current 
average population, adjusted for anticipated increases in jail 
day costs, as well as allows for additional growth in the 
detainee population. A general provision has also been included 
elsewhere in this title, as requested, addressing medical 
services costs, which should result in savings to the program. 
Should additional funding be required, the conferees would be 
willing to entertain a reprogramming in accordance with Section 
605 of this Act. In addition, the conference agreement adopts 
the direction included in the Senate report requiring quarterly 
reports on cost savings initiatives, as well as a report on 
sentencing delays.

                     FEES AND EXPENSES OF WITNESSES

      The conference agreement includes $95,000,000 for Fees 
and Expenses of Witnesses as proposed in the House bill, 
instead of $110,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The 
conference agreement does not include a provision allowing up 
to$15,000,000 to be transferred from this account to the 
Federal Prisoner Detention account, which was proposed in the Senate 
bill.

                      COMMUNITY RELATIONS SERVICE

      The conference agreement includes $7,199,000 for the 
Community Relations Service, as proposed in both the House and 
Senate bills. In addition, the conference agreement includes a 
provision allowing the Attorney General to transfer up to 
$1,000,000 of funds available to the Department of Justice to 
this program, as proposed in the House bill. The Attorney 
General is expected to report to the Committees on 
Appropriations of the House and Senate if this transfer 
authority is exercised. In addition, a provision is included 
allowing the Attorney General to transfer additional resources, 
subject to reprogramming procedures, upon a determination that 
emergent circumstances warrant additional funding, as proposed 
in the House bill. The Senate bill did not include either 
transfer provision.

                         ASSETS FORFEITURE FUND

      The conference agreement provides $23,000,000 for the 
Assets Forfeiture Fund as proposed in Senate bill, instead of 
no funding as proposed in the House bill.

                    Radiation Exposure Compensation

                        ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      The conference agreement recommends $2,000,000 for fiscal 
year 2000, the full amount requested, the same amount proposed 
in both the House and Senate bills, and in accordance with the 
House and Senate bills.

         PAYMENT TO RADIATION COMPENSATION EXPOSURE TRUST FUND

      The conference agreement provides $3,200,000 in direct 
appropriations and assumes prior year carryover funding of 
$7,800,000 for total of $11,000,000 for the Compensation Trust 
Fund.
      The Administration's fiscal year 2000 request was 
predicated on the passage of legislation that increased both 
the amount ofpayments to qualifying individuals and the number 
of categories of claimants. The proposed legislation has not been acted 
on and future passage is uncertain. The conferees are concerned that 
the Administration has expanded the number of claimants through the 
issuing of regulations when Congress has not chosen to do so through 
the normal legislative process. The conferees have provided adequate 
funding to cover the payments of the three categories of claimants 
currently provided for in statute. No additional funding is provided to 
cover the claims of individuals provided for by 29 CFR Part 79.

                      Interagency Law Enforcement

                 INTERAGENCY CRIME AND DRUG ENFORCEMENT

      The conference agreement includes a total of $316,792,000 
for Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement (ICDE) as proposed 
in the House bill, instead of $304,014,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill. The distribution of funding provided is as 
follows:

Reimbursements by Agency

                        [In thousands of dollars]

Drug Enforcement Administration...............................  $104,000
Federal Bureau of Investigation...............................   108,544
Immigration and Naturalization Service........................    15,300
Marshals Service..............................................     1,900
U.S. Attorneys................................................    83,300
Criminal Division.............................................       790
Tax Division..................................................     1,344
Administrative Office.........................................     1,614
                    --------------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________

      Total...................................................   316,792

      The conferees continue to believe that a dedicated, 
focused effort is needed for this activity. Therefore, the 
conference agreement adopts the approach included in both the 
House and Senate bills to continue funding for Department of 
Justice components' participation in ICDE activities as a 
separate appropriations account, instead of providing funding 
directly to individual components as proposed in the 
President's budget. The conferees recognize that in order to be 
truly successful, all participants must remain committed to the 
program, and the program must be implemented as efficiently as 
possible. The conferees direct the Department of Justice to 
conduct a comprehensive review of the program and provide a 
report to the Committees on Appropriations no later than 
January 15, 2000, with any recommendations to improve the 
program.
      The conference agreement includes language allowing up to 
$50,000,000 to remain available until expended as proposed in 
the House bill, instead of $20,000,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill.

                    Federal Bureau of Investigation

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $3,089,868,000 for the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Salaries and Expenses 
account as proposed in the House bill, instead of 
$2,973,292,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, of which 
$752,853,000 is provided from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust 
Fund (VCRTF) as recommended in the House bill, instead of 
$280,501,000 as recommended in the Senate bill. In addition, 
the conference agreement provides that not less than 
$292,473,000 shall be used for counterterrorism investigations, 
foreign counterintelligence, and other activities related to 
national security as proposed in the House bill, instead of 
$260,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. This statement of 
managers reflects the agreement of the conferees on how the 
funds provided in the conference report are to be spent.
      The conference agreement includes a net increase of 
$100,836,000 for adjustments to base, as follows: increases 
totaling $182,935,000 for costs associated with the 
annualization of new positions provided in fiscal year 1999, 
the 2000 pay raise, increased rent, continued direct funding of 
the National Instant Check System, and other inflationary 
adjustments; offset by decreases totaling $82,099,000 for non-
recurring costs associated with the completion of the 
Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) 
and one-time equipment purchases provided for in fiscal year 
1999, the transfer of the State Identification grants programto 
the Office of Justice Programs, the rebaselining of certain programs to 
match actual expenditures, and reductions for vehicle and furniture 
purchases. In addition, the conference agreement includes program 
increases totaling $7,484,000, which are described below:
      National Infrastructure Protection/Computer Intrusion.--
The conference agreement adopts the direction included in the 
Senate report requiring the conversion of 95 part-time 
positions for Computer Analysis Response Teams (CART) to 62 
full-time positions, which will enable the FBI to increase its 
total effort by 20%. The conferees believe that the complexity 
of computer forensic examinations necessitates a cadre of 
personnel dedicated to this activity, which can provide the 
necessary investigative support to field offices, and expect 
the FBI to deploy these personnel in a manner which maximizes 
coverage and support to field offices. To ensure that these 
teams can effectively respond to the needs of the field, a 
program increase of $3,399,000 has been provided for training, 
equipment, supplies and technology upgrades for these teams. 
The conferees direct the FBI to submit a spending plan to the 
Committees on Appropriations prior to the release of these 
funds. In addition, the conferees expect the FBI to comply with 
the direction included in the Senate report regarding the 
adequacy of examiner training, and the development of a master 
plan regarding current and planned capabilities to combat 
computer crime and intrusion.
      In addition, the conference agreement provides a total of 
$18,596,000 for the National Infrastructure Protection Center 
(NIPC), of which $1,250,000 is for a cybercrime partnership 
with the Thayer School of Engineering, as proposed in the 
Senate report. This amount, when combined with $2,069,436 in 
carryover funding, will provide a total of $20,880,032 for the 
NIPC in fiscal year 2000, approximately the same level of 
funding available in fiscal year 1999, adjusted for costs 
associated with certain non-recurring requirements. It has come 
to the conferees' attention that concerns have been expressed 
regarding the adequacy of staffing levels at the NIPC. The 
conferees are concerned that the current FBI on-board staffing 
level at the NIPC is only at 80% of its authorized and funded 
level, and other agency participation is only at 70% of the 
authorized level. The conferees direct the FBI to provide a 
report to the Committees no later than December 1, 1999, on the 
actions it is taking to rectify this situation.
      Mitochondrial DNA.--The conference agreement includes a 
program increase of $2,835,000 (5 positions and 3 workyears) 
for the development of the use of mitochondrial DNA to assist 
in the identification of missing persons, as proposed in the 
Senate report.
      Criminal Justice Services.--The conference agreement 
includes a total of $212,566,000 for the Criminal Justice 
Information Services Division (CJIS), which includes the 
National Instant Check System (NICS), an increase of 
$81,500,000 above the request. Of this amount, $70,235,000 is 
for NICS, including $2,500,000 to be funded from prior year 
carryover, and $142,331,000 is for non-NICS activities, 
including $11,265,000 for an operations and maintenance 
shortfall affecting the Integrated Automated Fingerprint 
Identification System (IAFIS) and the National Crime 
Information Center (NCIC).
      The fiscal year 2000 budget for the FBI included no 
direct funding for the NICS, and instead proposed to finance 
the costs of this system through a user fee. The conference 
agreement includes a provision under Title VI of this Act which 
prohibits the FBI from charging a fee for NICS checks, and 
instead provides funding to the FBI for its costs in operating 
the NICS.
      Indian Country Law Enforcement.--The conferees share the 
concerns expressed in the Senate report regarding sexual 
assaults on Indian reservations. The conferees direct the FBI 
to reallocate not less than 25 agents to existing DOJ offices 
nearest to the Indian reservations identified in the Senate 
report. The conferees assume these agents will serve as part of 
multi-agency task forces dedicated to addressing this problem. 
While the conferees do not intend for this to be a permanent 
redirection of FBI resources, the conferees expect the FBI to 
implement this direction in the most cost effective manner 
possible. Therefore, the conferees direct the FBI to submit an 
implementation plan to the Committees on Appropriations no 
later than December 1, 1999, and to provide a report on the 
success of its investigative efforts not later than June 1, 
2000.
      Information Sharing Initiative (ISI).--The conference 
agreement does not include program increases for ISI. Within 
the total amount available to the FBI, $20,000,000 is available 
from fiscal year 2000 base funding, and $60,000,000 is 
available from unobligated balances from fiscal year 1999. The 
Bureau is again directed not to obligate any of these funds 
until approval by the Committees of an ISI plan.
      The conferees reiterate the concerns expressed in the 
House report regarding the FBI's information technology 
initiatives. The FBI is expected to comply with the direction 
included in the House report regarding the submission of an 
Information Technology report, and is directed to provide this 
report to the Committees on Appropriations no later than 
November 1, 1999, and an updated report as part of the fiscal 
year 2001 budget submission.
      National Domestic Preparedness Office (NDPO).--The FBI is 
considered the lead agency for crisis management; the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is considered the lead 
agency for consequence management; and various other Federal 
agencies share additional responsibilities in the event of a 
terrorist attack. In the past, there has been no coordinated 
effort to prepare State and local governments to respond to 
terrorist incidents. The Department of Justice has proposed the 
establishment of an interagency National Domestic Preparedness 
Office (NDPO) to coordinate Federal assistance programs for 
State and local first responders, provide a single point of 
contact among Federal programs, and create a national standard 
for domestic preparedness, thereby improving the responsiveness 
of Federal domestic preparedness programs, while reducing 
duplication of effort. The conferees approve the Department's 
request to create the NDPO and direct the Department of Justice 
to submit to the Committees no later than December 15, 1999, 
the final blueprint for this office. Within the total amount 
available to the FBI, up to $6,000,000 may be used to provide 
funding for the NDPO in fiscal year 2000, subject to the 
submission of a reprogramming in accordance with section 605 of 
thisAct. Further, the conferees expect the five-year 
interagency counterterrorism plan, which is to be submitted to the 
Committees no later than March 1, 2000, to identify and incorporate the 
NDPO's role and function.
      Other.--From within the total amount provided under this 
account, the FBI is directed to provide not less than 
$5,204,000 to maintain the Crimes Against Children initiative 
as recommended in the Senate report. In addition, not less than 
$1,500,000 and 11 positions are to be provided to continue the 
Housing Fraud initiative as recommended in the House report. 
The conferees are concerned about the delay in fully 
implementing the Housing Fraud initiative provided for in 
fiscal year 1999, and expect the FBI to take all necessary 
actions to fully implement this initiative and report back to 
the Committees on Appropriations no later than December 1, 
1999, on its actions.
      The Senate report language regarding intelligence 
collection management officers, background checks for school 
bus drivers, the Northern New Mexico anti-drug initiative, and 
continued collaboration with the Southwest Surety Institute is 
adopted by reference. The conference agreement also adopts by 
reference the House report language regarding the National 
Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN).
      In addition to identical provisions that were included in 
both the House and Senate bills, the conference agreement 
includes provisions, modified from language proposed in the 
House bill, authorizing the purchase of not to exceed 1,236 
passenger motor vehicles, and designating $50,000,000 for 
narrowband communications activities to be transferred to the 
Department of Justice Wireless Management Office. The Senate 
bill did not include provisions on these matters. The 
conference agreement also includes language allowing up to 
$45,000 to be used for official reception and representation 
expenses as proposed in the House bill, instead of $65,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill, and contains statutory citations 
under the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund proposed in the 
House bill, which were not included in the Senate bill.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed in the Senate bill regarding the independent program 
office dedicated to the automation of fingerprint 
identification services, nor is language included limiting the 
total number of positions and workyears available to the FBI in 
fiscal year 2000. The House bill did not include similar 
provisions on these matters. However, the conferees are 
concerned about the continued variances between the FBI's 
funded and actual staffing levels. Therefore, the conferees 
direct the FBI to provide quarterly reports to the Committees 
on Appropriations which delineate the funded and the actual 
agent and non-agent staffing level for each decision unit, with 
the first report to be provided no later than December 1, 1999.

                              construction

      The conference agreement includes $1,287,000 in direct 
appropriations for construction for the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), as provided for in the House bill, instead 
of $10,287,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The agreement 
includes the funding necessary to continue necessary 
improvements and maintenance at the FBI Academy.

                    Drug Enforcement Administration

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $1,276,250,000 for the 
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Salaries and Expenses 
account as proposed in the House bill, instead of 
$1,217,646,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, of which 
$343,250,000 is provided from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust 
Fund (VCRTF), instead of $344,250,000 as proposed in the House 
bill, and $419,459,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. In 
addition, $80,330,000 is derived from the Diversion Control 
Fund for diversion control activities. This statement of 
managers reflects the agreement of the conferees on how the 
funds provided in the conference report are to be spent.
      Budget and Financial Management.--The conferees share the 
concerns expressed in both the House and Senate reports 
regarding DEA's budget and financial management practices, 
includingDEA's failure to comply with section 605 of the 
appropriations Acts, resulting in resources being expended in a manner 
inconsistent with the appropriations Acts. As a result of these 
concerns, a comprehensive review was conducted by the Department of 
Justice and DEA, and a report was provided to the Committees on 
Appropriations on July 8, 1999, which recommended a series of 
management reforms to be implemented by DEA and included a revised 
budget submission for fiscal year 2000. The conferees expect DEA to 
expeditiously implement all management reforms recommended in that 
report. Further, the conference agreement has used the revised budget 
submission as the basis for funding provided for fiscal year 2000. The 
following table represents funding provided under this account:

section 605 of this Act.
      The conference agreement provides a net increase of 
$20,312,000 for pay and other inflationary costs to maintain 
current operations, as follows: increases totaling $50,220,000 
for costs associated with annualization of 617 new positions 
provided in fiscal year 1999, the 2000 pay raise, increased 
rent, and other inflationary increases; offset by decreases 
totaling $29,908,000 for costs associated with one-time and 
non-recurring equipment purchases and other items provided for 
in fiscal year 1999, and a general reduction in administrative 
overhead.
      In addition, the conference agreement includes program 
increases totaling $41,925,000, as follows:
      Caribbean Initiative.--The conference agreement includes 
a total of $5,500,000 (17 positions, including 11 agents) to 
augment the Caribbean Initiative funded in fiscal years 1998 
and 1999, as follows:
      --$1,900,000 within Domestic Enforcement for 17 positions 
and 9 workyears for new agents and support in Puerto Rico;
      --$500,000 within Domestic Enforcement to address law 
enforcement retention efforts in Puerto Rico, including the 
development of a community liaison office and center to provide 
assistance to Department of Justice employees and their 
families;
      --$3,100,000 within Research, Engineering, Test and 
Operations (RETO) to purchase four MWIR airborne thermal 
imaging systems and eight installation kits for UH-60 aircraft 
to support multi-agency operations in the Bahamas and North 
Caribbean. The conferees expect these aircraft to be configured 
like the US Customs Service UH-60 counter-drug aircraft to 
enhance interoperability.
      The conferees direct DEA to provide quarterly status 
reports on the implementation of these initiatives. Further, 
the conference agreement adopts by reference the House report 
language regarding requirements related to the Caribbean.
      Source Country/International Strategy.--Within the amount 
provided for Foreign Cooperative Investigations, the conference 
agreement includes program increases totaling $5,000,000 (19 
positions, including 8 agents) to enhance staffing in Central 
and South America, as follows:
      --$1,500,000 for 6 positions, including 2 agents, to 
enhance staffing in Panama (3 positions, including 2 agents), 
Nicaragua (1 position), and Belize (2 positions); and
      --$3,500,000 for 13 positions, including 6 agents, to 
enhance staffing in Argentina (2 positions, including 1 agent), 
Brazil (3 positions, including 2 agents); Chile (2 positions, 
including 1 agent); Peru (2 positions); and Venezuela (4 
positions, including 2 agents).
      The conferees are aware of concerns expressed regarding 
the adequacy of non-agent personnel in source countries, 
resulting in agent resources being used to perform functions 
more efficiently performed by non-agent personnel. Therefore, 
the conference agreement has included additional non-agent 
positions to address this problem. The conferees urge the DEA 
to review the adequacy of non-agent personnel in source 
countries to ensure that adequate support is provided. DEA is 
expected to provide quarterly reports on investigative and non-
investigative workyears and funding, by type, within source and 
transit countries, including the Caribbean, delineated by 
country and function, with the first report to be provided not 
later than November 15, 1999.
      Domestic Enhancements.--The conference agreement includes 
program increases totaling $10,700,000 for domestic counter-
drug activities, exclusive of the Caribbean Initiative. 
Included are the following program increases:
      --$4,600,000 within Domestic Enforcement for 25 positions 
(15 agents) and 13 workyears for Regional Enforcement Teams 
(RETS),to provide a total of $17,400,000 for RETS in fiscal 
year 2000. The conferees expect the additional personnel and resources 
provided to be dedicated to locations in the Western United States as 
determined by DEA, and to focus primarily on the methamphetamine 
problem in that geographic region;
      --$2,800,000 within State and Local Task Forces for 20 
positions (12 agents) and 10 workyears for Mobile Enforcement 
Teams (METS), to provide a total of $53,900,000 for METS in 
fiscal year 2000. The conferees expect the additional personnel 
and resources provided to be dedicated to locations as 
determined by DEA, and to focus primarily on the problems of 
black tar heroin and methamphetamines;
      --$1,500,000 within State and Local Task Forces for State 
and local methamphetamine training, as recommended in the 
Senate report;
      --$1,000,000 within Domestic Enforcement for Drug Demand 
Reduction programs, as recommended in the House report;
      --$400,000 within Domestic Enforcement for black tar 
heroin and methamphetamine enforcement along the Southwest 
border to address this problem in cooperation with other 
Federal law enforcement agencies, with particular emphasis on 
the illegal drug trafficking problem in Northern New Mexico;
      --$400,000 within State and Local Task Forces for support 
for methamphetamine enforcement in Iowa, as directed in the 
Senate report.
      In addition, DEA is expected to comply with the direction 
included in the House report regarding DEA's continued 
participation in the HIDTA program, and support for DEA's newly 
established office in Madisonville, Kentucky. DEA is also 
expected to comply with the direction included in the Senate 
report regarding Operation Pipeline.
      Investigative Support Requirements.--The conference 
agreement includes $20,725,000 to address critical 
infrastructure needs, as follows:
      --$7,725,000 within RETO to consolidate and enhance DEA's 
electronic surveillance capabilities to support multi-agency, 
multi-jurisdictional investigations;
      --$13,000,000 within ADP to accelerate the completion of 
Phase II of FIREBIRD to December 2001. This amount will provide 
a total of $44,890,000 in fiscal year 2000 for FIREBIRD, of 
which $37,490,000 is to be for deployment only, and $7,400,000 
is for operations and maintenance (O&M) of the system, the full 
amount requested in the budget. Should additional funds be 
required for O&M, the Committees would be willing to entertain 
a reprogramming in accordance with section 605 of the Act. The 
conferees share the concerns expressed in the House report 
regarding this program, and direct DEA to provide a full 
program plan for completion of Phase II of FIREBIRD, including 
deployment and O&M costs, to the Committees on Appropriations 
not later than December 1, 1999, and to provide quarterly 
status reports thereafter on deployment and O&M, delineated by 
location and function.
      Drug Diversion Control Fee Account.--The conference 
agreement provides $80,330,000 for DEA's Drug Diversion Control 
Program, including $3,260,000 in adjustments to base and 
program increases, as requested. In addition, the Senate report 
language regarding development of electronic reporting and 
records systems is adopted by reference. The conference 
agreement assumes that the level of balances in the Fee Account 
are sufficient to fully support diversion control programs in 
fiscal year 2000. As was the case in fiscal year 1999, no funds 
are provided in the DEA Salaries and Expenses appropriation for 
this account in fiscal year 2000.

                              CONSTRUCTION

      The conference agreement includes $5,500,000 in direct 
appropriations for construction for the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) as proposed in the Senate bill, instead of 
$8,000,000 as proposed in the House bill.

                 Immigration and Naturalization Service

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $2,909,665,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service (INS), instead of $2,932,266,000 as provided in the 
House bill, and $2,570,164,000 as provided in the Senate bill, 
of which $1,267,225,000 is from the Violent Crime Reduction 
Trust Fund, instead of $1,311,225,000 as proposed in the House 
bill and $873,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. In 
addition to the amounts appropriated, the conference agreement 
assumes that $1,269,597,000 will be available from offsetting 
fee collections instead of $1,285,475,000 as proposed by the 
House and $1,290,162,000 as proposed by the Senate. Thus, 
including resources provided under construction, the conference 
agreement provides a total operating level of $4,260,416,000 
for INS, instead of $4,289,231,000 as proposed by the House and 
$3,999,290,000 as proposed by the Senate. This statement of 
managers reflects the agreement of the conferees on how the 
funds provided in the conference report are to be spent.
      Base adjustments.--The conference agreement provides 
$54,740,000 for base restoration, instead of the requested 
$55,830,000, and provides $7,112,000 for the annualization of 
the fiscal year 1999 pay raise, instead of the requested 
$14,961,000, the remaining amount of which has already been 
paid in the current fiscal year. Additionally, the conference 
agreement includes $30,000,000 for the annualization of the 
Working Capital Fund base transfer, $3,794,000 for the National 
Archives records project, and $1,090,000 of the base 
restoration for fiscal year 1999 adjustments to base which are 
funded in the Examinations Fee account, since sufficient funds 
are available. The conference agreement does not include 
$11,240,000 for the Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement 
funds, which are provided in a separate account or $20,000,000 
for the annualization of border patrol agents not hired. The 
conference agreement does not include the transfers to the 
Examinations Fee account, H-1b account, or the breached bond/
detention account, as proposed by the Senate report.
      INS Organization and Management.--The conference 
agreement includes the concerns expressed in the House report 
that a lack of resources is no longer an acceptable response to 
INS's inability to adequately address its mission 
responsibilities. The conference agreement includes the 
establishment of clearer chains of command--one for enforcement 
activities and one for service to non-citizens--as one step 
towards making the INS a more efficient, accountable, and 
effective agency, as proposed in both the House and Senate 
reports. Consistent with the concept of separating immigration 
enforcement from service, the conference agreement continues to 
provide for a separation of funds, as in fiscal year 1999 and 
in the House bill. The conference agreement includes the 
separation of funds into two accounts, as requested and as 
proposed in the House bill: Enforcement and Border Affairs, and 
Citizenship and Benefits, Immigration Support and Program 
Direction. INS enforcement funds are placed under the 
Enforcement and Border Affairs account. All immigration-related 
benefits and naturalization, support and program resources are 
placed under the Citizenship and Benefits, Immigration Support 
and Program Direction account. Neither account includes 
revenues generated in various fee accounts to fund program 
activities in both enforcement and functions, which are in 
addition to the appropriated funds and are discussed below. 
Funds for INS construction projects continue to fall within the 
INS construction account.
      The conference agreement includes bill language which 
provides authority for the Attorney General to transfer funds 
from one account to another in order to ensure that funds are 
properly aligned. Such transfers may occur notwithstanding any 
transfer limitations imposed under this Act but such transfers 
are still subject to the reprogramming requirements under 
Section 605 of this Act. It is expected that any request for 
transfer of funds will remain within the activities under those 
headings.
      The conference agreement includes $1,107,429,000 for 
Enforcement and Border Affairs, $535,011,000 for Citizenship 
and Benefits, Immigration Support and Program Direction, and 
$1,267,225,000 from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund.
      The Enforcement and Border Affairs account is comprised 
of the following amounts: $922,224,000 for existing base 
activities for Border Patrol, Investigations,Detention and 
Deportation, and Intelligence; less $11,240,000 for the Interagency 
Crime and Drug Enforcement funds, which are provided in a separate 
account, less $20,000,000 for the annualization of border patrol agents 
not hired and less $7,555,000 for part of the fiscal year 1999 
annualized pay raise, the remaining amount of which has already been 
paid in the current fiscal year.
      The Citizenship and Benefits, Immigration Support and 
Program Direction account includes $539,099,000 (plus VCRTF 
funds) for the existing activities of citizenship and benefits, 
immigration support, and management and administration; less 
$294,000 of the annualized fiscal year 1999 pay raise which has 
already been paid within the current year, and less $3,794,000 
for archives and records, which are now funded within the 
Examinations Fee account. The requested $30,000,000 base 
restoration and the $1,090,000 base restoration for fiscal year 
1999 adjustments to base need not be funded in the Salaries and 
Expenses base since sufficient funds are available within the 
Examinations Fee account. None of these amounts include 
offsetting fees, which are used to fund both enforcement and 
service functions.
      Border Control.--The conference agreement includes 
$50,000,000 for 1,000 new border patrol agents and 475 FTEs, of 
which $1,500,000 is for border patrol recruitment devices, such 
as language proficiency bonuses, recruitment bonuses, and costs 
for improved recruitment outreach programs, including the 
possibility of expanding testing capabilities and other hiring 
steps, as described in the Senate report, and the establishment 
of an Office of Border Patrol Recruitment and Retention, as 
described in the Senate report, including the submission of 
recommendations on pay and benefits. Owing to INS's failure to 
hire 1,000 border patrol agents in fiscal year 1999, INS may 
provide a recruiting bonus to new agents hired after January 1, 
2000. Should the INS be unableto recruit the required agents by 
June 1, 2000, the only other allowable purpose to which the $48,500,000 
may be put is an increase in pay for non-supervisory agents who have 
served at a GS-9 level for more than one year. The Committees on 
Appropriations expect to be notified prior to the use of funds for a 
pay raise.
      The conference report also includes $22,000,000 for 
additional border patrol equipment and technology, to be funded 
from existing base resources for information resource 
management, as follows: $9,350,000 for infrared night vision 
scopes; $6,375,000 for night vision goggles; $4,050,000 for 
pocket scopes; and $2,225,000 for laser aiming modules and 
infrared target pointers/illuminators. Additionally, the 
conference agreement includes $3,000,000, funded from the 
existing base for information resource management, for the Law 
Enforcement Support Center, as described in the Senate report.
      The conference agreement includes the following reports 
on border-related activities and technologies: (1) hand-held 
night-vision binocular report by March 1, 2000, as in the House 
report; (2) night vision obligation report by December 15, 
1999, as in the House report; (3) all-light, all-weather ground 
surveillance capability report by March 1, 2000, as in the 
House report; (4) border patrol hiring and spending plan for 
fiscal year 1999 by September 15, 1999, as in the House report; 
(5) report on the situation in the Tucson sector by October 1, 
1999, as in the House report; (6) fiscal year 1999 border 
patrol aviation final report; and (7) a feasibility report on 
the participation of the Tucson sector in the ambulance 
reimbursement program by January 15, 2000. All overdue reports 
are still expected to be submitted to the Committees. The 
conferees are aware of a recently filed lawsuit against the INS 
and the Army Corps of Engineers challenging the major drug 
interdiction effort known as Operation Rio Grande and its 
impact on the environment. The conferees are concerned about 
the potential adverse effects that this suit may have on drug 
interdiction efforts. The conferees, therefore, direct the 
Department of Justice, within 30 days of enactment, to provide 
the House and Senate Appropriations Committees with a report on 
the status of this lawsuit.
      IAFIS/IDENT.--The conferees direct the Assistant Attorney 
General for Administration to submit a plan by November 1, 
1999, to integrate the INS IDENT and the FBI IAFIS systems. 
This plan should address Congressional concerns that the 
current environment does not provide other Federal, State and 
local law enforcement agencies with access to fingerprint 
identification information captured by INS Border Patrol 
agents, nor does it provide the Border Patrol with the full 
benefit of FBI criminal history records when searching criminal 
histories of persons apprehended at the border.
      The conferees direct that the following studies be 
undertaken: a system design effort; a joint INS-FBI criminality 
study, involving a matching of IDENT recidivist records against 
the Criminal Master File; a study to determine the operational 
impact of 10-printing apprehended illegal crossers at the 
border; and an engineering proposal for the first phase to 
determine the validity of the systems development costs that 
have been estimated by the FBI. These studies will provide the 
data necessary to project accurate costs for the remainder of 
the development and implementation. The conferees expect that 
the Justice Management Division will oversee the integration 
effort and that all existing INS base funds for IDENT will be 
controlled by the Assistant Attorney General for 
Administration. The Assistant Attorney General for 
Administration shall submit tothe Committees a proposed 
spending plan on the use of existing base funds available for IDENT for 
these studies and other related expenditures no later than December 15, 
1999.
      Deployment of border patrol resources.--The conference 
agreement directs the INS to continue its consultation with the 
Committees on Appropriations of both the House and Senate 
before deployment of new border patrol agents included in this 
conference agreement. In recognition of the increased problems 
in and around El Centro, California; Tucson, Arizona; the 
Southeastern states; and around the Northern border, as 
described in both the House and Senate reports, the conferees 
expect that the proposed deployment plan submitted to the 
Committees by INS will include an appropriate distribution to 
address these needs.
      Interior enforcement.--The conference agreement includes 
$5,000,000 in additional funding within existing resources to 
continue and to expand the local jail program pursuant to 
Public Law 105-141. The conferees direct the INS to staff the 
Anaheim City Jail portion of this program with trained INS 
personnel on a full-time basis, especially the portions of the 
day or night when the greatest number of individuals are 
incarcerated prior to arraignment.
      The conference agreement includes the following reports: 
(1) by January 15, 2000, a report on possible new quick 
response teams (QRTs), as described in the House report; (2) by 
November 30, 1999, the revised interior enforcement plan, as 
described in the House report; and (3) by January 15, 2000, the 
local jail program status report, as described in the House 
report.
      Detention.--The conference agreement provides 
$200,000,000 for additional detention space for detaining 
criminal and illegal aliens, as described in the House report, 
of which $174,000,000 is in direct appropriations and 
$26,000,000 is from recoveries from the Violent Crime Reduction 
Trust Fund for fiscal year 1995. This amount is $30,000,000 
less than the budget request and is funded from direct 
appropriations instead of the requested combination of 
appropriated funds, reinstatement of Section 245(i), transfer 
of funds from the Crime Victims Fund and a reallocation of 
funds within the account. The conference agreement continues 
funding for the $80,000,000 for detention provided in fiscal 
year 1999 supplemental appropriations and provides an 
additional 1,216 new beds for a total of approximately 18,535 
detention beds in fiscal year 2000, and provides 176 additional 
detention and deportation staff to support these beds and 
$4,000,000 and 10 positions to begin implementation of 
standards at detention facilities.
      The conference agreement includes the concerns raised in 
the House report about the INS's ability to plan for, request 
in a timely fashion, and manage sufficient detention space. 
Accordingly, the conference agreement includes the following 
reports: (1) by September 1, 1999, recommendations by the 
Attorney General on a Department-wide strategy on detention, as 
described in the House report; (2) by January 15, 2000, a 
detailed assessment of INS's current and projected detention 
needs for the next 3 years, as described in both the House and 
Senate reports, and including possible supplemental detention 
locations such as Etowah County Detention Center near Atlanta 
and Tallahatchie County prison in Tutwiler, a hiring plan for 
the additional detention and deportation personnel, and a 
proposal for the expansion of the number of juvenile detention 
beds; (3) by December 1, 1999, a report on the detention needs 
and costs associated with Operation Vanguard, as described in 
the House report; and (4) by March 1, 2000, a feasibility study 
and implementation plan for utilizing the Justice Prisoner and 
Alien Transportation System for a greater number of 
deportations. All overdue reports are still expected to be 
submitted to the Committees.
      Naturalization.--The conference agreement includes full 
funding to continue the fiscal year 1999 Backlog Reduction 
Action Teams (BRAT) and accompanying resources during fiscal 
year 2000. The conference agreement includes the concerns 
raised in the House report about recently-discovered 
naturalization cases processed during the Citizenship USA 
initiative and requests a report on these cases by March 1, 
2000, as described in the House report.
      Institutional Removal Program.--The conferees assume 
that, in the implementation of the Institutional Removal 
Program (IRP), priority is given to violent offenders and those 
arrested for drug violations. The conferees direct the INS, in 
consultation with the Executive Office of Immigration Review, 
to report to the Committees on Appropriations on IRP caseload, 
by case type, for fiscal years 1997-1999. If the IRP caseload 
does not give priority to aliens imprisoned for serious violent 
felonies or drug trafficking, the INS is directed to explain 
why and to outline the steps it will take to focus IRP efforts 
on the most dangerous incarcerated aliens. The report shall be 
delivered not later than March 31, 2000.
      Other.--In spite of the direction in the fiscal year 1999 
supplemental appropriations Act to promptly submit all 
previously requested and overdue reports, the INS has failed to 
do so. Therefore, the conference agreement again includes the 
direction to INS tosubmit all outstanding reports to the 
Committees no later than November 1, 1999. The conference agreement 
also includes the following items: (1) Senate report language on 
special agent deployments aimed at forcing the INS to execute 
directives contained in both the fiscal year 1999 INS deployment plan 
and the conference report; (2) Senate direction to INS on assessment of 
staffing along the U.S.-Canadian border; and (3) Senate direction for 
INS-proposed periodic visits to the upper Shenandoah Valley.

                       OFFSETTING FEE COLLECTIONS

      The conference agreement assumes $1,269,597,000 will be 
available from offsetting fee collections, instead of 
$1,285,475,000 as proposed by the House and $1,290,162,000 as 
proposed by the Senate, to support activities related to the 
legal admission of persons into the United States. These 
activities are entirely funded by fees paid by persons who are 
either traveling internationally or are applying for 
immigration benefits. The following levels are recommended:
      Immigration Examinations Fees.--The conference agreement 
assumes $708,500,000 of spending from Immigration Examinations 
Fee account resources, instead of $712,800,000 as proposed by 
both the House and Senate. This is an increase of $19,921,000 
over fiscal year 1999 and is due to an increase in the estimate 
of the number of applications that will be received in fiscal 
year 2000. The conference agreement assumes that the requested 
$3,794,000 for archives and records, the requested $30,000,000 
for base restoration, and the requested $1,090,000 base for 
fiscal year 1999 adjustments to base are funded in this 
account, and not in the Salaries and Expenses, Citizenship and 
Benefits, Immigration Support and Program Direction account, 
since sufficient funds are available.
      The conference agreement includes full funding to 
continue the fiscal year 1999 Backlog Reduction Action Teams 
(BRAT) and accompanying resources for fiscal year 2000. The 
agreement also continues funding for the implementation of a 
telephone customer service center to assist applicants for 
immigration benefits, for the indexing and conversion of INS 
microfilm images and for the records centralization initiative, 
and all projects which were funded in fiscal year 1999. The 
conferees have a strong interest in and supported in fiscal 
year 1999 the INS effort to modernize its records program, that 
is fundamental to improved services and enforcement activities. 
INS is therefore directed to fully fund the records 
centralization and redesign activities in Harrisonburg, VA and 
Lee Summit, MO and provide a progress report on records 
centralization to the Committee on Appropriations no later than 
January 15, 2000.
      The agreement does not include the transfer to the 
Executive Office for Immigration Review, as proposed by the 
Senate report.
      Inspections User Fee.--The conference agreement includes 
$446,151,000 of spending from offsetting collections in this 
account, the same amount proposed in both the House and Senate 
reports, and does not assume the addition of any new or 
increased fees on airline or cruise ship passengers. The 
recommendation does not include $9,918,000 for ``re-evaluation 
of receipts'' nor $888,000 for a portion of the annualization 
of 1999 pay raise which has already been paid in the current 
fiscal year. The agreement includes the data collection pilot 
program at J.F. Kennedy airport, as described in the House 
report, and the resulting report, to be submitted to the 
Committees no later than August 1, 2000, as well as the 
directive to submit certain documents by September 31, 1999, as 
described in the House report. The agreement does not include 
the transfer from the inspections user fee, as proposed in the 
Senate report.
      Land border inspections fees.--The conference agreement 
includes $1,548,000 in spending from the Land Border Inspection 
Fund, a decrease of $1,727,000 under the current year due to 
lower projected receipts. The current revenues generated in 
this account are from Dedicated Commuter Lanes in Blaine and 
Port Roberts, Washington, Detroit Tunnel and Ambassador Bridge, 
Michigan, and Otay Mesa, California and from Automated Permit 
Ports that provide pre-screened local border residents' border 
crossing privileges by means of automated inspections. The 
conference agreement includes the report on the feasibility of 
adding a secure electronic network for travelers rapid 
inspection program for dedicated commuter lanes at San Luis, 
Arizona by March 1, 2000, as described in the House report.
      Immigration Breached Bond/Detention account.--The 
conference agreement includes $110,423,000 in spending from the 
Breached Bond/Detention account, instead of $117,501,000 in the 
House report and $127,771,000 in the Senate report, a decrease 
in $66,527,000 from fiscal year 1999 due to a decrease in 
revenue and $6,477,000 below the request. The level of spending 
assumed in the conference agreement is based on estimated 
revenues in this account totaling $55,683,000, which includes 
revenue projected for fiscal year 1999 and assumes the 
availability of funds from penalty fees from applications under 
245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which expired on 
January 14, 1998. The conference agreement assumes $54,740,000 
of expenses for alien detention costs provided under the 
salaries and expenses account for base restoration. The 
agreement does not include the base transfer to the breached 
bond/detention account, as proposed by the Senate report.
      Immigration Enforcement Fines.--The conference agreement 
includes $1,850,000 in spending from Immigration Enforcement 
fines, instead of $1,303,000 assumed in both the House and 
Senate. The increase is due to new projections of carryover

2000.
      H-1B fees.--The conference agreement includes $1,125,000 
in spending from the new H-1B fee account, the amount requested

checkpoints are open and traffic is being checked on a continuous 24-
hour basis; (10) a specific level of funding for the Offices of 
Legislative and Public Affairs with a modification, and incorporating 
by reference House direction including that the level is not to affect 
the number of employees dedicated to casework; (11) a limit on the 
amount of funding available for non-career positions; (12) direction 
and authorization to the Attorney General to impose disciplinary 
actions, including termination of employment, for any INS employee who 
violates Department policies and procedures relative to granting 
citizenship or who willfully deceives the Congress or Department 
leadership on any matter; and (13) separate headings for Enforcement 
and Border Affairs and Citizenship and Benefits, Immigration Support, 
and Program Direction. In addition, new bill language is included 
designating a portion of funds to be used for narrowband conversion 
activities and transfers these funds to the Department of Justice 
Wireless Management Office. The agreement does not include the Senate 
provisions on fee payments by cash or cashier's checks or the cap on 
the number of positions.

                              CONSTRUCTION

      The conference agreement includes $99,664,000 for 
construction for INS, instead of $90,000,000 as proposed in the 
House bill and $138,964,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The 
conference agreement assumes funding of $51,468,000, of which 
$35,968,000 is for border patrol and ports of entry new 
construction (seven stations or sector headquarters and two 
ports of entry housing) as proposed in the Senate report; 
$6,500,000 for the Douglas, Arizonaborder patrol station; and 
$9,000,000 for maintenance and renovations to the Charleston Border 
Patrol Academy. The agreement includes $2,340,000 for planning, site 
acquisition and design of 5 border patrol stations and Texas 
checkpoints, as in the House report; $6,000,000 for military 
engineering support to border construction, pursuant to both House and 
Senate reports; $500,000 for planning, site acquisition and design, 
pursuant to the House report; $10,308,000 for one-time build out costs;

                         Federal Prison System

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

      The conference agreement includes $3,111,634,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Federal Prison System, instead of 
$3,072,528,000 as proposed in the House bill and $3,163,373,000 
as proposed in the Senate bill. Of this amount, the conference 
agreement provides $22,524,000 from the Violent Crime Reduction 
Trust Fund (VCRTF), as proposed in the House bill, instead of 
$46,599,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The agreement 
assumes that, in addition to the amounts appropriated, 
$90,000,000 will be available for necessary operations in 
fiscal year 2001 from unobligated carryover balances as 
proposed by the House bill, instead of $50,000,000, to be made 
available for one fiscal year for activation of new facilities, 
as proposed by the Senate bill.
      The conference agreement reduces the appropriation 
required for the Federal prison system by $46,793,000 without 
affecting requested program levels. Specifically, $31,808,000 
in savings is achieved as a result of delays in scheduled 
activations and $4,985,000 is due to a reduction in the number 
of contract beds for the transfer of detainees from the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service required in fiscal year 
2000. The conference agreementincludes the notation on a recent 
report by the General Accounting Office, as in the House report.
      The conference agreement includes bill language 
designating a portion of funds to be used for narrowband 
conversion activities and tranfers these funds to the 
Department of Justice Wireless Management Office.

and detention facilities housing Federal prisoners, as proposed 
in the House bill, instead of $549,791,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill, and assumes funding in accordance with the House 
bill.
      The conferees direct the Bureau of Prisons to submit to 
the Committees a study of the feasibility of constructing 
additional medium or high security prisons or work camps at 
existing Federal prison sites, including those currently being 
constructed, and including Yazoo City, by May 1, 2000.

                Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated

                (LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES)

      The conference agreement includes a limitation on 
administrative expenses of $3,429,000, as requested and as 
proposed in the Senate bill, instead of $2,490,000 as proposed 
in the House bill.

                       Office of Justice Programs

                           JUSTICE ASSISTANCE

      The conference agreement includes $307,611,000 for 
Justice Assistance, instead of $217,436,000 as proposed in the 
House bill, and $373,092,000 as proposed in the Senate bill.

      This statement of managers reflects the agreement of the 
conferees on how funds provided for all programs under the 
Office of Justice Programs in this conference report are to be 
spent.
      National Institute of Justice (NIJ).--The conference 
agreement provides $43,448,000 for the National Institute of 
Justice, instead of $42,438,000 as proposed in the House bill 
and $50,948,000 in the Senate bill. Additionally, $5,200,000 
for NIJ research and evaluation on the causes and impact of 
domestic violence is provided under the Violence Against Women 
Grants program; $15,000,000 is provided from within technology 
funding in the State and Local Law Enforcement account to be 
available toNIJ to develop new, more effective safety 
technologies for safe schools; and $20,000,000 is provided to NIJ, as 
was provided in previous fiscal years, from the Local Law Enforcement 
Block Grant for assisting local units to identify, select, develop, 
modernize and purchase new technologies for use by law enforcement.
      The conference agreement adopts the recommendation in the 
House and Senate reports that within the overall amount 
provided to NIJ, the Office of Justice Programs is expected to 
review proposals, provide a grant if warranted, and report to 
the Committees on its intentions regarding: a grant for the 
current year level for information technology applications for 
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas; a grant for the current 
year level for a pilot program with a Department of Criminal 
Justice Training and a College of Criminal Justice for rural 
law enforcement needs, as described in the House report; a 
grant for $300,000 to the U.S.-Mexico Border Counties Coalition 
for the development of a uniform accounting proposal to 
determine the costs to border States for the processing of 
criminal illegal aliens; a grant for $250,000 to study the 
casework increase on U.S. District Courts; $360,000 to the 
Center for Child and Family studies to conduct research into 
intra-family violence; a grant for $750,000 for the University 
of Connecticut Prison Health Center for prison health research; 
a grant for $1,000,000 for the University of Mississippi School 
of Psychiatry for research in addictive disorders and their 
connection to youth violence; and a grant for $300,000 for 
research into a non-toxic drug detection and identification 
aerosol technology, as described in the Senate report. Within 
available funds NIJ is directed to carry out a broad-based 
demonstration of computerized live scan fingerprint capture 
services and report to the Committees with the results.
      Defense/Law Enforcement Technology Transfer.--Within the 
total amount provided to NIJ, the conference agreement includes 
$10,277,000 to assist NIJ, in conjunction with the Department 
of Defense, to convert non-lethal defense technology to law 
enforcement use. Within the amount is the continuation at the 
current year level of the law enforcement technology center 
network, which provides States with information on new 
equipment and technologies, as well as assists law enforcement 
agencies in locating high cost/low use equipment for use on a 
temporary or emergency basis, of which the current year level 
is provided for the technology commercialization initiative at 
the National Technology Transfer Center and other law 
enforcement technology centers.
      DNA Technology Research and Development Program.--Within 
the amount provided, the conference agreement includes 
$5,000,000 to develop improved DNA testing capabilities, as 
proposed in the House and Senate reports.
      Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).--The conference 
agreement provides $25,505,000 for the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics, instead of $22,124,000 as proposed in the House 
bill and $28,886,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The 
recommendation includes $400,000 to support the National 
Victims of Crime survey and $400,000 to compile statistics on 
victims of crime with disabilities. The conferees direct BJS to 
implement a voluntary annual reporting system of all deaths 
occurring in law enforcement custody, and provide a report to 
the Committees on its progress no later than July 1, 2000, as 
provided in the House report.
      Missing Children.--The conference agreement provides 
$19,952,000 for the Missing Children Program as proposed in the 
Senate bill, instead of the $17,168,000 as proposed in the 
House bill. The conference agreement provides a significant 
increase and further expands the Missing Children initiative 
included in the 1999 conference report, to combat crimes 
against children, particularly kidnapping and sexual 
exploitation. Within the amounts provided, the conference 
agreement assumes funding in accordance with the Senate report 
including:
      (1) $8,798,000 for the Missing Children Program within 
the Office of Justice Programs, Justice Assistance, including 
the following: $6,000,000 for State and local law enforcement 
to continue specialized cyberunits and to form new units to 
investigate and prevent child sexual exploitation which are 
based on the protocols for conducting investigations involving 
the Internet and online service providers that have been 
established by the Department of Justice and the National 
Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
      (2) $9,654,000 for the National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children, of which $2,125,000 is provided to operate 
the Cyber Tip Line and to conduct Cyberspace training. The 
confereesexpect the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children to continue to consult with participating law enforcement 
agencies to ensure the curriculum, training, and programs provided with 
this additional funding are consistent with the protocols for 
conducting investigations involving the Internet and online service 
providers that have been established by the Department of Justice. The 
conferees have included additional funding for the expansion of the 
Cyber Tip Line. The conference agreement includes $50,000 to duplicate 
the America OnLine law enforcement training tape and disseminate it to 
law enforcement training academies and police departments within the 
United States. The conference agreement also includes additional funds 
for case management.
      (3) $1,500,000 for the Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement 
Training Center for training of State and local law enforcement 
officials investigating missing and exploited children cases. 
The conference agreement includes an increase for expansion of 
the Center to train additional law enforcement officers. The 
conferees direct the Center to create courses for judges and 
prosecutors to improve the handling of child pornography cases. 
To accomplish this effort, the conference agreement directs the 
Center to expand its in-house legal division so that it can 
provide increased legal technical assistance.
      Regional Information Sharing System (RISS).--The 
conference agreement includes $20,000,000 as proposed in both 
the House and Senate bills. An additional $5,000,000 is 
provided for fiscal year 2000 under the Community Oriented 
Policing Services (COPS) law enforcement technology program in 
accordance with the House report.
      White Collar Crime Center.--The conference agreement 
includes $9,250,000 for the National White Collar Crime Center 
(NWCCC), to assist the Center in forming partnerships and 
working on model projects with the private sector to address 
economic crimes issues, as proposed in the House bill, instead 
of $5,350,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The additional 
funding is to be used in accordance with the House report.
      Counterterrorism Assistance.--The conference agreement 
includes a total of $152,000,000 to continue the initiative to 
prepare, equip, and train State and local entities to respond 
to incidents of chemical, biological, radiological, and other 
types of domestic terrorism, instead of $74,000,000 as proposed 
in the House bill and $204,500,000 as proposed in the Senate 
bill. Funding is provided as follows:
      --Equipment Grants.--$75,000,000 is provided for general 
equipment grants for State and local first responders, 
including, but not limited to, firefighters and emergency 
services personnel. The conferees reiterate that these 
resources are to be used to meet the needs of the maximum 
number of communities possible, based upon a comprehensive 
needs assessment which takes into account the relative risk to 
a community, as well as the availability of other Federal, 
State and local resources to address this problem. The 
conferees understand that such needs and risk assessments are 
currently being conducted by each State, and State-wide plans 
are being developed. The conferees intend, and expect, that 
such plans will address the needs of local communities. The 
conferees expect these plans to be reviewed by the interagency 
National Domestic Preparedness Office (NDPO). The conferees 
direct that funds provided for general grants in fiscal year 
2000 be expended only upon completion of, and in accordance 
with, such State-wide plans.
      --State and Local Bomb Technician Equipment.--$10,000,000 
is provided for equipment grants for State and local bomb 
technicians. This amount, when combined with $3,000,000 in 
prior year carryover, will provide a total of $13,000,000 for 
this purpose in fiscal year 2000. The conferees note that State 
and local bomb technicians play an integral role in any 
response to a terrorist threat or incident, and as such should 
be integrated into a State's counterterrorism plan. The 
conferees request that the NDPO conduct an assessment of the 
assistance currently provided to State and local bomb 
technicians under this and other programs, the relationship of 
this program to other State and local first responders 
assistance programs, and the extent to which State and local 
bomb technician equipment needs have been integrated into, and 
addressed, as part of a State's overall counterterrorism plan. 
TheNDPO should provide a report on its assessment to the 
Committees on Appropriations no later than February 1, 2000.
      --Training.--$37,000,000 is provided for training 
programs for State and local first responders, to be 
distributed as follows:
      (1) $27,000,000 is for the National Domestic Preparedness 
Consortium, of which $13,000,000 is for the Center for Domestic 
Preparedness at Ft. McClellan, Alabama, including $500,000 for 
management and administration of the Center; and $14,000,000 is 
to be equally divided among the four other Consortium members;
      (2) $8,000,000 is for additional training programs to 
address emerging training needs not provided for by the 
Consortium or elsewhere. In distributing these funds, the 
conferees expect OJP to consider the needs of firefighters and 
emergency services personnel, and State and local law 
enforcement, as well as the need for State and local 
antiterrorism training and equipment sustainment training. The 
conferees encourage OJP to consider developing and 
strengthening its partnerships with the Department of Defense 
to provide training and technical assistance, such as those 
services offered by U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground and the 
U.S. Army Pine Bluff Arsenal; and
      (3) $2,000,000 is provided for distance learning training 
programs at the National Terrorism Preparedness Institute at 
the Southeastern Public Safety Institute to train 11,000 
students, particularly in medium and small communities, through 
advanced distributive learning technology and other mechanisms.
      The conferees are aware that the Department of Justice 
has recently agreed to assume control of the Ft. McClellan 
facility from the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2000. In 
addition, the conferees are aware that discussions are 
occurring which could result in the transfer of ownership of 
the entire facility from the Department of Defense to the 
Department of Justice. Such actions will result in the 
Department of Justice assuming a significant additional 
financial burden to operate and maintain the facility which 
previously was not anticipated, and may impact OJP's ability to 
provide support for all training programs. While the conferees 
recognize the importance of the training provided at Ft. 
McClellan, a comprehensive assessment of DOJ's needs at the 
facility is warranted to ensure that such needs are met in the 
most cost-effective manner possible. The Attorney General is 
directed to conduct this assessment and provide a report to the 
Committees on Appropriations no later than February 1, 2000. 
Further, the Department is directed not to pursue or assume any 
other relationships which may result in the Department of 
Justice assuming facilities management responsibility or 
ownership of any other training facility, without prior 
consultation with the Committees.
      The Senate report language regarding utilization of 
Consortium members is adopted by reference. In addition, the 
conferees encourage OJP to collaborate with the National Guard 
to make use of the National Guard Distance Learning Network to 
deliver training programs, thereby capitalizing on investments 
made by the Department of Defense to provide low cost training 
to first responders.
      Counterterrorism Research and Development.--The 
conference agreement provides $30,000,000 to the National 
Institute of Justice for research into the social and political 
causes and effects of terrorism and development of technologies 
to counter biological, nuclear and chemical weapons of mass 
destruction, as well as cyberterrorism through our automated 
information systems. These funds shall be equally divided 
between the Oklahoma City Memorial Institute for the Prevention 
of Terrorism and the Dartmouth Institute for Security Studies, 
and shall be administered by NIJ to ensure collaboration and 
coordination among the two institutes and NIJ, as well as with 
the National Domestic Preparedness Office and the Office of 
State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support. These institutes 
will also serve as national points of contact for antiterrorism 
information sharing among Federal, State and local preparedness 
agencies, as well as private and public organizations dealing 
with these issues. The conferees agree that such a 
collaborative approach is essential to production of a national 
research and technology development agenda and expect a status 
report by July 30, 2000.
      The conference agreement includes language providing 
funding for counterterrorism programs in accordance with 
sections 819, 821, and 822 of the Antiterrorism and Effective 
Death Penalty Act of 1996, as proposed in the House bill. The 
conference agreement does not include language, proposed in the 
Senate bill, prohibiting the Bureau of Justice Assistance from 
providing funding to States that have failed to establish a 
comprehensive terrorism plan. The House bill did not include a 
similar provision.
      Management and Administration.--The conference agreement 
includes $37,456,000 for Management and Administration, instead 
of $31,456,000 as proposed in the House, and $43,456,000 as 
proposed in the Senate. Within the amount, $2,000,000 is 
provided for Counterterrorism program activities. In addition, 
reimbursable funding from Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund 
programs, Community Oriented Policing Services, and a transfer 
from the Juvenile Justice account will be provided for the 
administration of grants under these activities. Total funding 
for the administration of grants assumed in the conference 
agreement is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       Amount       FTE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Direct appropriations............................    $37,456,000    338
    (Counterterrorism programs)..................     (2,000,000)   (16)
Transfer from Juvenile Justice programs..........      6,647,000     87
Reimbursement from VCRTF.........................     56,288,000    434
Reimbursement from COPS..........................      4,700,000     39
                                                  ----------------------
      Total......................................   $105,091,000    898
------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The conferees commend OJP's restructuring report, 
submitted to the Committees during fiscal year 1999, and 
support the current comprehensive review undertaken by the 
authorizing committees. To further the goals of eliminating 
possible duplication and overlap among OJP's programs, 
improving responsiveness to State and local needs, and ensuring 
that appropriated funds are targeted in a planned, 
comprehensive and well-coordinated way, the conferees direct 
the Assistant Attorney General for OJP to submit a formal 
reorganization proposal no later than February 1, 2000, on the 
following limited items: the creation of a ``one-stop'' 
information center; the establishment of ``state desks'' for 
geographically-based grant administration; and the 
administration of grants by subject area.
      The conference agreement includes $2,000,000 for 
management and administration of Department of Justice 
counterterrorism programs. The conferees understand that the 
Department of Justice has submitted a reprogramming to 
establish an Office of State and Local Domestic Preparedness to 
administer these programs. The conferees have no objection to 
the establishment of this office.
      The conference agreement does not include additional 
funding proposed in the Senate bill to enable the Department of 
Justice to begin to assume responsibility for counterterrorism 
assistance programs currently funded and administered by the 
Department of Defense. Such action could significantly impact 
ongoing Department of Justice programs, and absent careful 
consideration and study, may result in the duplication and 
inefficient use of limited resources to meet the needs of State 
and local first responders. Therefore, the conferees direct the 
Department of Justice, working through the National Domestic 
Preparedness Office, to review this matter and provide to the 
Committees on Appropriations no later than December 15, 1999, a 
comprehensive plan for the transition and integration of 
Department of Defense programs into ongoing Department of 
Justice and other Federal agency programs in the most efficient 
and cost-effective manner. The conferees expect the Department 
not to take any further actions to assume responsibility for 
these programs until such a review has been completed, and the 
Committees on Appropriations have been consulted. Upon 
completion of these actions, should additional funding be 
required by OJP, the Committees would be willing to entertain a 
reprogramming in accordance with section 605 of this Act.

               STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE

      The conference agreement includes a total of 
$2,828,950,000 for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance, 
instead of$2,822,950,000 as proposed in the House bill and 
$1,959,550,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. Of this amount, the 
conference agreement provides that $1,194,450,000 shall be derived from 
the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund (VCRTF), instead of 
$1,193,450,000 as proposed in the House bill and $1,407,450,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill.
      The conference agreement provides for the following

should report back to the Committees with its proposal as to 
how the program may be administered. The conferees note the 
special needs of the Wapka Sica Historical Society of South 
Dakota.

House; Oregon Partnership; and Westcare.
      The conferees are aware that, on certain limited 
occasions, the Office of Justice Programs has provided or made 
grants to pay overtime costs for State and local law 
enforcement personnel. The conferees expect OJP to submit, no

circumstances that might warrant a waiver of existing 
procedures, and (3) the process by which such a waiver could be 
granted.

of listing those terms and conditions.
      Violence Against Women Grants.--The conference agreement 
includes $283,750,000 for grants to support the Violence 
Against Women Act, as proposed in the Senate bill, instead of 
$282,750,000 as proposed in the House bill. Grants provided

                  Community Oriented Policing Services

$325,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill and $268,000,000 as 
proposed in the House bill. Of this amount, $45,000,000 is from 
the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. This statement of 
managers reflects the conference agreement on how funds 
provided for all programs under the Community Oriented Policing 
Services program in this conference report are to be spent.
      Police Hiring Initiatives.--Funds have been provided 
since fiscal year 1994 to support grants for the hiring of 
100,000 police officers, a goal which the President announced 
had been met in May of 1999. The conference agreement 
includes$537,500,000 for police hiring initiatives as follows: 
$180,000,000 from direct appropriations for school resource officers; 
$209,500,000 from direct appropriations for the universal hiring 
program (UHP); $40,000,000 from unobligated carryover balances for 
hiring police officers for Indian Country; and $108,000,000 from 
unobligated carryover balances from the fiscal year 1999 universal 
hiring program to continue to be used for the universal hiring program.
      Safe schools initiative (SSI).--The conference agreement 
supports the concern expressed in the Senate and House reports 
regarding the level of violence in our children's schools as 
evidenced by the tragic events that have occurred around the 
Nation. In the past year, guns and explosives have been used by 
children against children and teachers more than ever before, 
leading many to believe this violence is ``out of control.'' To 
address this issue, the conference agreement includes 
$225,000,000 for the Safe Schools Initiative (SSI), including 
funds for technology development, prevention, community 
planning and school safety officers. Within this total, 
$180,000,000 is from the COPS hiring program to provide school 
resource officers who will work in partnership with schools and 
other community-based entities to develop programs to improve 
the safety of elementary and secondary school children and 
educators in and around schools; $15,000,000 is from the 
Juvenile Justice At-Risk Children's Program and $15,000,000 is 
from the COPS program ($30,000,000 total) for programs aimed at 
preventing violence in schools through partnerships with 
schools and community-based organizations; $15,000,000 is 
provided from the Crime Identification Technology Program to 
NIJ to develop technologies to improve school safety. Special 
note is made of the need for additional school resource 
officers in King County, Washington.
      Indian Country.--The conference agreement includes 
$40,000,000 from unobligated carryover balances to improve law 
enforcement capabilities on Indian lands, both for hiring 
uniformed officers and for the purchase of equipment and 
training for new and existing officers, as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Management and Administration.--The conference agreement 
also includes a provision that provides that not to exceed 
$29,825,000 shall be expended for management and administration 
of the program, instead of $17,325,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill, and $25,500,000, as proposed in the House bill. A 
request for reprogramming or transfer of funds, pursuant to 
section 605 of this Act, would be entertained to increase this 
amount.
      Non-Hiring Initiatives.--The conferees understand that 
the COPS program reached its goal of funding 100,000 officers 
in May of 1999. Having reached the original goals of the 
program, the conferees want to ensure there is adequate 
infrastructure for the new police officers, similar to the 
focus that has been provided Federal law enforcement over the 
past several years. The conferees believe this approach will 
enable police officers to work more efficiently, equipped with 
the protection, tools, and technology they need: to address 
crime in and around schools, provide law enforcement technology 
for local law enforcement, combat the emergence of 
methamphetamine in new areas and provide policing of ``hot 
spots'' of drug market activity, and provide bullet proof and 
stab proof vests for local law enforcement officers and 
correctional officers.
      Specifically, the conferees direct the program to use 
$335,675,000, to be made available from a combination of 
$170,000,000 from unobligated carryover balances and the 
$165,675,000 from direct appropriations in this Act for COPS, 
to fund initiatives that will result in more effective 
policing. The conferees believe that these funds should be used 
to address these critical law enforcement requirements and 
direct the program to establish the following non-hiring grant 
programs:
      1. COPS Technology Program.--The conference agreement 
includes the direction of $100,000,000 to be used for continued 
development of technologies and automated systems to assist 
State and local law enforcement agencies in investigating, 
responding to and preventing crime. In particular, there is 
recognition of the importance of the sharing of criminal 
information and intelligence between State and local law 
enforcement to address multi-jurisdictional crimes.
      Within the amounts made available under this program, the 
conference agreement includes the expectation that the COPS 
office will award grants for the following technology 
proposals:

      Sec. 115.--The conference agreement includes section 115, 
modified from language proposed in the Senate bill, which 
prohibits funds in this Act from being used to pay premium pay 
to an individual employed as an attorney by the Department of 
Justice for any work performed in fiscal year 2000. The House 
bill did not include a provision on this matter.
      Sec. 116.--The conference agreement includes section 116, 
proposed as section 117 in the Senate bill, which makes 
permanent a provision included in the fiscal year 1999 Act, and 
amended by Public Law 106-31, to clarify the term ``tribal'' 
for the purpose of making grant awards under title I of this 
Act. The House bill did not include a provision on this matter.
      Sec. 117.--The conference agreement includes section 117, 
modified from language proposed as section 119 in the Senate 
bill, which provides a procedure to grant national interest 
waivers to physicians if they have served an aggregate of five 
years and will continue to serve in areas designated as 
medically underserved or at facilities under the jurisdiction 
of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. This provision 
essentially restores the situation that existed for alien 
physicians prior to the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
decision in New York State Department of Transportation, and 
those physicians who filed prior to November 1, 1998, shall be 
granted a national interest waiver if they agree to serve three 
years in medically underserved areas or at facilities under the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The House 
bill did not include a provision on this matter.
      Sec. 118.--The conference agreement includes section 118, 
proposed as section 121 in the Senate bill, which permanently 
authorizes the land border inspection fee account. The House 
bill did not include a provision on this matter.
      Sec. 119.--The conference agreement includes a new 
provision, section 119, to extend the authorities included in 
the fiscal year 1998 Act which authorized funds to be provided 
for the U.S. Attorneys victim witness coordinator and advocate 
program from the Crime Victims Fund. The conferees expect 
$6,838,000 will be used under this provision to continue to 
support the 93 victim witness coordinators and advocates who 
are assigned to various U.S. Attorneys offices, including 
victim support for the D.C. Superior Court, and $7,552,000 will 
be used to provide funding for the U.S. Attorneys to support 
the 77 victim witness workyears from pre-1998 allocations. The 
conferees expect that appropriate sums will be made available 
under this provision in succeeding fiscal years to continue 
this program at the current level.
      Sec. 120.--The conference agreement includes a new 
provision, section 120, which authorizes the collection and 
analysis of DNA samples voluntarily contributed from the 
relatives of missing persons.
      Sec. 121.--The conference agreement includes a new 
provision, section 121, which changes the entity to which 
electronic communication service providers report instances of 
child pornography.

         TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND RELATED AGENCIES

                  TRADE AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

                            RELATED AGENCIES

            Office of the United States Trade Representative

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $25,635,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative, instead of $25,205,000 as proposed in the House 
bill, and $26,067,000 as proposed in the Senate bill.
      The increase over the fiscal year 1999 appropriation 
provides for adjustments to base operations to maintain the 
current level of operations, and program increases requested 
for Washington-based security, travel, and translation 
services. The conferees concur with language in the House 
report related to the upcoming World Trade Organization 
Ministerial Meeting.

                     International Trade Commission

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $44,495,000 and 
$2,500,000 in carryover for the salaries and expenses of the 
International Trade Commission (ITC) as proposed in the House 
bill, instead of $45,700,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. 
The recommended funding will allow the ITC to operate at a 
level very close to the amount of the budget request, and 
permit the Commission to carry out planned activities.

                         DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

                   International Trade Administration

                     operations and administration

      The conference agreement includes $311,503,000 in new 
budgetary resources for the operations and administration of 
the International Trade Administration for fiscal year 2000, of 
which $3,000,000 is derived from fee collections, instead of 
$298,236,000 as proposed by the House bill, and $311,344,000 as 
proposed by the Senate bill. In addition to this amount, the 
conference agreement assumes $2,000,000 in prior year 
carryover, resulting in a total fiscal year 2000 availability 
of $313,503,000.
      The following table reflects the distribution of funds by 
activity included in the conference agreement:

Trade Development.......................................     $62,376,000
Market Access and Compliance............................      19,755,000
Import Administration...................................      32,473,000
U.S. & F.C.S............................................     186,693,000
Executive Direction and Administration..................      12,206,000
Fee Collections.........................................     (3,000,000)
Prior Year Carryover....................................     (2,000,000)
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
    Total, ITA..........................................     308,503,000

      Trade Development (TD).--The conference agreement 
provides $62,376,000 for this activity. Of the amounts 
provided, $49,621,000 is for the TD base program, $9,000,000 is 
for the National Textile Consortium, and $3,000,000 is provided 
for the Textile/Clothing Technology Corporation. Further, the 
conference agreement includes $255,000 for the Access Mexico 
program and $500,000 for continuation of the international 
global competitiveness initiative recommended in the House 
report.
      Market Access and Compliance (MAC).--The conference 
agreement includes a total of $19,755,000 for this activity. Of 
the amounts provided, $18,755,000 is for the base program, 
$500,000 is for the strike force teams initiative proposed in 
the budget, and $500,000 is for the trade enforcement and 
compliance initiative proposed in the budget.
      Import Administration.--The conference agreement provides 
$32,473,000 for the Import Administration.
      U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (U.S. & FCS).--The 
conference agreement includes $186,693,000 for the programs of 
the U.S. & FCS, to maintain the current level of operations. 
The conferees concur with language in the House report 
concerning the Rural Export Initiative and the Global Diversity 
Initiative.
      Executive Direction and Administration.--The conference 
agreement includes $12,206,000 for the administrative and 
policy functions of the ITA. This amount does not include 
funding requested for transfer to centralized services.
      ITA should also follow the direction included in the 
House report regarding trade missions, and the direction in the 
Senate report relating to the Hannover World Fair. ITA is also 
expected to follow the direction and submit the reports 
referenced in both the House and Senate reports relating to 
foreign currency exchange rate gains, and to provide the report 
on trade show revenues requested in the House report.

                         Export Administration

                     operations and administration

      The conference agreement includes $54,038,000 for the 
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA), instead of $49,527,000 
as proposed in the House bill and $55,931,000 as proposed in 
the Senate bill. The conference agreement assumes $739,000 will 
be available from prior year carryover, resulting in total 
availability of $54,777,000. Of this amount, $23,878,000 is for 
Export Administration, including a program increase of $750,000 
for Chemical Weapons Convention inspection activities; 
$23,534,000 is for Export Enforcement, including a program 
increase of $500,000 for computer export verification; 
$4,365,000 is for Management and Policy Coordination, including 
a program increase of $1,000,000 for the redesign and 
replacement of the Export Control Automated Support System; and 
$3,000,000 is for the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office 
(CIAO).
      The CIAO was created by Presidential Decision Directive 
63 (PDD-63) as an interim agency to facilitate coordination and 
integration among Federal agencies as those agencies develop 
and implement their own critical infrastructure protection and 
awareness plans. The conferees are concerned that the fiscal 
year 2000 budget for the CIAO proposes a number of initiatives 
which would expandthe role of the CIAO beyond its coordination 
and integration function, and create new programs and activities which 
may be duplicative of activities and responsibilities assigned to other 
Federal agencies. The conferees believe the amount provided, which also 
reflects the fact that, in fiscal year 2000, 25 staff detailed from 
other agencies will now be provided to the CIAO on a non-reimbursable 
basis, will enable the CIAO to perform its functions as provided for in 
PDD-63. The conferees expect the CIAO to provide a spending plan for 
fiscal year 2000 to the Committees on Appropriations no later than 
December 1, 1999.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
included in the Senate bill, allowing funds to be used for 
rental of space abroad and expenses of alteration, repair, or 
improvement.

                  Economic Development Administration

                economic development assistance programs

      The conference agreement includes $361,879,000 for 
Economic Development Administration grant programs, instead of 
$364,379,000 as proposed in the House bill, and $203,379,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill.
      Of the amounts provided, $205,850,000 is for Public Works 
and Economic Development, $34,629,000 is for Economic 
Adjustment Assistance, $77,300,000 is for Defense Conversion, 
$24,000,000 is for Planning, $9,100,000 is for Technical 
Assistance, including University Centers, $10,500,000 is for 
Trade Adjustment Assistance, and $500,000 is for Research. EDA 
is expected to allocate this funding in accordance with the 
direction included in the House report.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
included in the House bill relating to attorneys' fees, since 
that language was included in the EDA reauthorization 
legislation (P.L. 105-393) enacted in 1998. The conference 
agreement makes funding under this account available until 
expended, as proposed in the Senate bill.

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $26,500,000 for 
salaries and expenses of the EDA, instead of $24,000,000 as 
proposed in the House bill, and $24,937,000 included in the 
Senate bill. This funding is to enable EDA to maintain its 
existing level of operations, which in the past has been 
partially funded by non-appropriated sources of funding that 
are not expected to be available in fiscal year 2000.

                  Minority Business Development Agency

                     minority business development

      The conference agreement includes $27,314,000 for the 
programs of the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), 
instead of $27,000,000 included in the House bill and 
$27,627,000 included in the Senate bill. The conference 
agreement assumes that MBDA will continue its support for the 
Entrepreneurial Technology Apprenticeship Program at the 
current level, as directed in the House report.

                ECONOMIC AND INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE

                   Economic and Statistical Analysis

                         salaries and expenses

      The conferees have provided $49,499,000 for salaries and 
expenses of the activities funded under the Economic and 
Statistical Analysis account, instead of $48,490,000 as 
proposed in the House bill and $51,158,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill. The conferees support the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis' initiative of updating and improving statistical 
measurements of the U.S. economy and its measurement of 
international transactions. The conference agreement concurs 
with the directive included in the House report regarding the 
Integrated Environmental-Economic Accounting initiative.
      The travel and tourism industry makes a substantial 
contribution to the economy. A satellite account for travel and 
tourism hasthe potential to provide objective, thorough data to 
inform policy decisions. The Bureau is directed to provide a report on 
the advisability, utility, and relative priority of establishing a 
satellite account for travel and tourism by March 1, 2000.

                          Bureau of the Census

      The conference agreement includes a total of 
$4,758,573,000 for the Bureau of the Census for fiscal year 
2000, of which $4,476,253,000 is provided as an emergency 
appropriation, instead of $4,754,720,000 as proposed in the 
House bill, of which $4,476,253,000 was proposed as an 
emergency appropriation, and $3,071,698,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill as a direct appropriation.

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $140,000,000 for the 
Salaries and Expenses of the Bureau of the Census for fiscal 
year 2000, instead of $136,147,000 as proposed in the House 
bill, and $156,944,000 as proposed in the Senate bill.

                     periodic censuses and programs

      The conference agreement includes $4,618,573,000, of 
which $4,476,253,000 is an emergency appropriation, as proposed 
in the House bill, instead of $2,914,754,000 in direct 
appropriations as proposed in the Senate bill.
      Decennial Census Programs.--The conference agreement 
includes an emergency appropriation of $4,476,253,000 for the 
2000 decennial census as proposed in the House bill, instead of 
$2,764,545,000 in direct appropriations as proposed in the 
Senate bill. The following represents the distribution of funds 
provided for the 2000 Census:

Program Development and Management......................     $20,240,000
Data Content and Products...............................     194,623,000
Field Data Collection and Support Systems...............   3,449,952,000
Address List Development................................      43,663,000
Automated Data Process and Telecommunications Support...     477,379,000
Testing and Evaluation..................................      15,988,000
Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and Pacific Areas...........      71,416,000
Marketing, Communications and Partnerships..............     199,492,000
Census Monitoring Board.................................       3,500,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Total, Decennial Census...........................   4,476,253,000

      The conference agreement does not provide funding for the 
Continuous Measurement program in the decennial census program 
as proposed in the Senate bill,but instead continues funding 
for this program under Other Periodic Programs as proposed in the House 
bill.
      The conferees share the concerns expressed in the House 
report regarding the Bureau's ability to accurately project its 
funding requirements, and provide timely information regarding 
its needs to the Committees. The conferees expect the Bureau to 
follow the direction included in the House report requiring 
monthly reports on the obligation of funds against each 
framework. The conferees remind the Bureau that reallocation of 
resources among the frameworks listed above are subject to the 
requirements of section 605 of this Act.
      The conferees remain concerned about the implementation 
of the decennial census in areas like Alaska, where most of the 
State is not accessible by road and many people speak languages 
other than English. The conferees encourage the Bureau to 
continue working with all interested parties in Alaska to 
ensure that full and complete census data is received from 
remote locations and the State's migratory populations.
      In addition, the conferees encourage the Bureau to 
continue to explore the possible use of data collected in the 
decennial census from Puerto Rico in national summary data 
products and expect the Bureau to report to the Committees as 
directed in the House report. The conference agreement adopts 
by reference the House report language regarding enumeration of 
deaf persons in the 2000 Census.
      The conference agreement includes language designating 
the amounts provided for each decennial framework as proposed 
in the House bill. Should the operational needs of the 
decennial censusnecessitate the transfer of funds between these 
frameworks, the Bureau may transfer such funds as necessary subject to 
modified transfer and reprogramming procedures. Language is also 
included designating the entire amount provided for the decennial 
census as an emergency requirement as proposed in the House bill. The 
Senate bill did not contain similar provisions. In addition, the 
conference agreement includes language designating funding under this 
account for the expenses of the Census Monitoring Board as proposed in 
the House bill. The Senate bill did not include a similar provision, 
but instead included funding for the Board as a separate appropriation 
under Title V.
      Other Periodic Programs.--The conference agreement 
includes $142,320,000 for other periodic censuses and programs 
as proposed in the House bill, instead of $125,209,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. The following table represents the 
distribution of funds provided for other non-decennial periodic 
censuses and related programs:

Economic Censuses.......................................     $46,444,000
Census of Governments...................................       3,735,000
Intercensal Demographic Estimates.......................       5,260,000
Continuous Measurement..................................      20,000,000
Demographic Survey Sample Redesign......................       4,478,000
Electronic Information Collection (CASIC)...............       6,000,000
Geographic Support......................................      33,406,000
Data Processing Systems.................................      22,997,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Total.............................................     142,320,000

       National Telecommunications and Information Administration

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $10,975,000 for 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(NTIA) salaries and expenses, instead of $10,940,000 as 
proposed in the House bill, and $11,009,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill. The conference agreement assumes that NTIA will 
receive an additional $20,844,000 through reimbursements from 
other agencies for the costs of providing spectrum management, 
analysis and research services to those agencies.
      The conferees direct the General Accounting Office to 
review the relationship between the Department of Commerce and 
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 
and to issue a report no later than June, 2000. The conferees 
request that GAO review: (1) the legal basis for the selection 
of U.S. representatives to ICANN's interim board and for the 
expenditure of funds by the Department for the costs of U.S. 
representation and participation in ICANN's proceedings; (2) 
whether U.S. participation in ICANN proceedings is consistent 
with U.S. law, including the Administrative Procedures Act; (3) 
a legal analysis of the Department of Commerce's opinion that 
OMB Circular A-25 provides ICANN, as a ``project partner'' with 
the Department of Commerce, authority to impose fees on 
Internet users for ICANN's operating costs; and (4) whether the 
Department has the legal authority to transfer control of the 
authoritative root server to ICANN. In addition, the conferees 
seek GAO's evaluation and recommendations regarding placing 
responsibility for U.S. participation in ICANN under the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology rather than 
NTIA, and request that GAO review the adequacy of security 
arrangements under existing Departmental cooperative 
agreements.

    public telecommunications facilities, planning and construction

      The conference agreement includes $26,500,000 for the 
Public Telecommunications Facilities, Planning and Construction 
(PTFP) program, instead of $18,000,000 as proposed in the House 
bill, and $30,000,000 as proposed in the Senatebill. NTIA is 
expected to use this funding for the existing equipment and facilities 
replacement program, and to maintain an acceptable balance between 
traditional grants and those stations converting to digital 
broadcasting.
      The conference agreement contains language, similar to a 
provision carried in fiscal year 1999, permanently making the 
Pan-Pacific Education and Communications Experiments by 
Satellite (PEACESAT) program eligible to compete for funding 
under this account, as proposed in the Senate bill.
      The conference agreement retains the statutory citation 
for the program as proposed in the House bill, instead of the 
citations proposed in the Senate bill.

                   information infrastructure grants

      The conference agreement includes $15,500,000 for NTIA's 
Information Infrastructure Grant program, instead of 
$13,000,000 as proposed in the House bill, and $18,102,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill.
      The conferees concur with both the House and Senate 
reports, which identify overlap between funding provided under 
this program and funding provided under Department of Justice, 
Office of Justice Programs, with respect to law enforcement 
communication and information networks, and which recommend 
that this program not be used to fund projects for which other 
sources of funding are available. The conferees also concur 
with language in the House report emphasizing the importance of 
increased telecommunications access in areas where service is 
not readily available and where assistance is not available 
through other mechanisms.

                      Patent and Trademark Office

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement provides a total funding level 
of $871,000,000 for the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), 
instead of $851,538,000 as proposed in the House bill, and 
$901,750,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. Of this amount, 
$755,000,000 is to be derived from fiscal year 2000 offsetting 
fee collections, and $116,000,000 is to be derived from 
carryover of prior year fee collections. This amount represents 
an increase of $86,000,000, or 11%, above the fiscal year 1999 
operating level of the PTO.
      The conference agreement includes language limiting the 
amount of carryover that may be obligated in fiscal year 2000 
to $116,000,000, to conform to recently enacted authorization 
legislation, as proposed in the House bill.
      The conference agreement also includes new language 
limiting the amount of fees in excess of $755,000,000 that 
becomes available for obligation on October 1, 2000 to 
$229,000,000.
      The PTO is expected to follow the direction included in 
the House report concerning its partnership with the National 
Inventor's Hall of Fame and Inventure Place.

                         SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

                       Technology Administration

       under secretary for technology/office of technology policy

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $7,972,000 for the 
Technology Administration, as proposed in both the House and 
Senate bills. No funds are made available beyond fiscal year 
2000, as proposed in the House bill, instead of $600,000 made 
available through fiscal year 2001, as proposed in the Senate 
bill. The conferees concur with the direction contained in both 
the House and Senate reports.

             National Institute of Standards and Technology

             scientific and technical research and services

      The conference agreement includes $283,132,000 for the 
internal (core) research account of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology, instead of $280,136,000 as proposed 
in the House bill, and $288,128,000 as proposed in the Senate 
bill.
      The conference agreement provides funds for the core 
research programs of NIST as follows:

Electronics and Electrical Engineering..................     $38,771,000
Manufacturing Engineering...............................      19,560,000
Chemical Science and Technology.........................      32,493,000

      Total, STRS.......................................     283,132,000

      The increase provided in the conference agreement above 
fiscal year 1999 is largely to fund increases in base 
requirements. The conference agreement also includes sufficient 
funding for selected program increases for the highest priority 
programs in computer science and applied mathematics and in 
technology assistance, and $1,600,000 to continue the disaster 
research program on effects of windstorms on protective 
structures and other technologies begun in fiscal year 1998. 
NIST is directed to follow the guidance included in the House 
report regarding the placement of NIST personnel overseas.

                     industrial technology services

      The conference agreement includes $247,436,000 for the 
NIST external research account instead of $99,836,000 as 
proposed in the House bill, and $336,336,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill.
      Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program.--The 
conference agreement includes $104,836,000 for the 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program (MEP), instead of 
$99,836,000 as proposed in the House bill, and $109,836,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. The conference agreement does not 
contain the limitation on a Center's level of funding proposed 
in the House bill.
      The conferees concur with the Senate direction that the 
Northern Great Plains Initiative e-commerce project should 
assist small manufacturers for marketing and business 
development purposes in rural areas.
      Advanced Technology Program.--The conference agreement 
includes $142,600,000 for the Advanced Technology Program 
(ATP), instead of $226,500,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, 
and no funding as proposed in the House bill. This is 
$60,900,000 below the fiscal year 1999 appropriation, and 
$96,100,000 below the original request. At the end of fiscal 
year 1999, the Administration revised the overall level 
requested for the program downward from $251,500,000 to 
$215,000,000, in part because the amount awarded for new grants 
in fiscal year 1999 totaled $41,500,000, which was $24,500,000 
below the amount available for new awards. The amount of 
carryover into fiscal year 2000 was also substantially higher 
than had been anticipated. The requested level of new awards 
for fiscal year 2000 was also revised downward from $73,000,000 
to $54,700,000. The funding levels contained in the conference 
agreement were considered in response to that revised request.
      The recommendation provides the following: (1) 
$115,100,000 for continued funding requirements for awards made 
in fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999, to be derived from 
$46,700,000 in fiscal year 2000 funding, $64,600,000 from 
excess balances available from prior years, and $3,800,000 in 
anticipated deobligations in fiscal year 2000; (2) $50,700,000 
for new awards in fiscal year 2000; and (3) $45,200,000 for 
administration, internal NIST lab support and Small Business 
Innovation Research requirements.
      The conference agreement permits up to $500,000 of 
funding to be transferred to the Working Capital Fund, as 
proposed in the Senate bill.

                  construction of research facilities

      The conference agreement provides $108,414,000 for 
construction, renovation and maintenance of NIST facilities, 
instead of $56,714,000 as proposed in the House bill, and 
$117,500,000 as proposed in the Senate bill.
      Of this amount, $84,916,000 is for construction of the 
Advanced Metrology Laboratory. This will provide the balance of 
funds needed to initiate construction. Total funding available 
for construction, including funding provided in previous years, 
is $203,300,000. The conference agreement includes bill 
language making the $84,916,000 provided for this Laboratory 
available upon submission of a spending plan in accordance with 
Section 605 of this Act.
      In addition, $11,798,000 is provided for safety, 
capacity, maintenance and major repair of NIST facilities.
      In addition, $11,700,000 is provided for grants and 
cooperative agreements.

            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

      The conference agreement provides a total funding level 
of $2,343,736,000 for all programs of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), instead of $1,956,838,000 as 
proposed by the House, and $2,556,876,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Of these amounts, the conferees have included 
$1,688,189,000 in the Operations, Research, and Facilities 
(ORF) account, $596,067,000 in the Procurement, Acquisition and 
Construction (PAC) account, and $59,480,000 in other NOAA 
accounts.

                  operations, research, and facilities

                     (including transfers of funds)

      The conference agreement includes $1,688,189,000 for the 
Operations, Research, and Facilities account of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration instead of 
$1,475,128,000 as proposed by the House, and $1,783,118,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      In addition to the new budget authority provided, the 
conference agreement allows a transfer of $68,000,000 from 
balances in the account titled ``Promote and Develop Fishery 
Products and Research Related to American Fisheries'', instead 
of $67,226,000 as proposed by the House, and instead of 
$66,426,000 as proposed by the Senate. In addition, the 
conference agreement reflects prior year deobligations totaling 
$36,000,000, unobligated balances of $2,652,000, and $4,000,000 
in offsets from fee collections.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed in the House bill designating the amounts provided 
under this account for the six NOAA line offices. The Senate 
bill contained no similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language, as proposed 
by the House, which was adopted in the fiscal year 1999 
appropriations Act, designating the amounts available for 
Executive Direction and Administration, and prohibiting 
augmentation of such offices through formal or informal 
personnel details, transfers, or reimbursements above the 
current level.
      The conference agreement does not include or assume 
language proposed by the House, making the use of deobligated 
balances subject to standard reprogramming procedures. The 
conferees direct that any use of deobligations over and above 
the $36,000,000 assumed by the conference agreement will be 
undertaken only under the procedures set forth in section 605 
of this Act.
      The conference agreement does not include $34,000,000 in 
controversial new fisheries and navigation safety fees that 
were proposed in the budget request, although no details on the 
proposal were forthcoming. The House bill did not legislate the 
fees, but did assume the revenue from those fees would be 
available.
      Budgetary and Financial Matters.--Language in the House 
report is adopted by reference relating to: (1) a revised 
budget structure, with the requested reports due by February 1, 
2000; and (2) an operating plan for expenditure of funds, with 
the report due 60 days after the date of enactment.
      Peer Review.--Language in the House report requiring peer 
review of all NOAA research is adopted by reference.
      NOAA Commissioned Corps.--The conference agreement does 
not include bill language, as proposed by the House, setting a 
ceiling on the number of commissioned corps officers at not 
more than 250 by September 30, 2000. The Senate bill did not 
include a similar provision. With respect to the commissioned 
corps, as it is authorized by P.L. 105-384, the conferees 
understand that NOAA plans to reach a level of about 250 
officers by the end of the fiscal year, up from the current 
level of 224, and expect to be notified if plans change 
significantly from that level.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the House, providing such funds as may be necessary for NOAA 
commissioned corps retirement costs.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision, as 
proposed by the Senate, permitting the Secretary to have NOAA 
occupy and operate research facilities at Lafayette, Louisiana.
      NOAA is directed to report by March 1, 2000, on any 
requirement for new space for NOAA employees in the Gulf of 
Mexico area, including an explanation of the need for such 
space, and options for, and estimated costs of, obtaining the 
space. The report should also address the existing space that 
NOAA occupies in the area, and what would happen to the 
existing space.
      The following table reflects the distribution of the 
funds provided in this conference agreement:

and software development, including $750,000 for the Pacific 
Marine Fisheries Commission to develop catch reporting software 
in connection with West Coast States, which will allow 
electronic reporting of fish ticket information in a manner 
compatible with systems utilized in various regulatory and 
monitoring agencies as well as private industry.
      The conferees understand that NMFS was using funds to 
develop its own computer software rather than seeking readily 
available software. In addition, the software that it was 
developing may not be compatible with State data collection 
programs, which means that States may be required to make 
changes in their systems to accommodate the federal system. In 
addition, NMFS was not consulting with the affected States and 
regulatory agencies as required by section 401 of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act.
      To address this inadequacy, the managers direct NMFS to 
develop catch data standards which set guidelines on the 
content of information it requires and the format for 
transmitting it. That will enable States and private industry 
to continue to use their existing systems so long as they 
comply with NMFS standards and guidelines. NMFS may also use 
the funds provided to develop its own internal software program 
to manipulate the data it receives fromfishermen and state 
regulators and produce the reports it needs to effectively manage the 
fisheries.
      Under the Acquisition of Data line, within the total of 
$25,943,000, an additional $650,000 is provided for additional 
days at sea for the Gordon Gunter.
      Fisheries Management Programs.--The conference agreement 
includes $39,060,000 for this activity. Within this amount, 
$33,330,000 is provided for base activities, including 
$3,500,000 for NMFS facilities at Sandy Hook and Kodiak. Within 
funding determined to be available, if initial funding is 
required, the conferees also expect funds to be provided for 
the Santa Cruz Fisheries Laboratory. Also, the conferees expect 
the Atlantic Salmon Recovery Plan and the State of Maine 
Recovery Plan to continue to be funded from within base 
resources. In addition, $230,000 is provided for the Pacific 
Coral Reef fisheries management plan, as described in the 
Senate report; $500,000 is provided for Bronx River recovery 
and restoration; $5,000,000 for American Fisheries Act 
Implementation, including $500,000 each for the North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council and the State of Alaska.
      The conference agreement appropriates a total of 
$15,420,000 for NOAA support of Columbia River hatcheries 
programs, including $12,055,000 under the NMFS. Within the 
amount provided under the line item Columbia River hatcheries, 
NMFS is expected to support hatchery operations at a level of 
$11,400,000, and to use the additional funding to support 
salmon marking activities as described in the Senate report.
      Under the Pacific Tuna Management line, $400,000 is for 
swordfish research as referenced in the Senate report, and the 
balance for JIMAR.
      For New England Fisheries Management, $4,000,000 is for 
NMFS cooperative research, management, and enforcement, 
including enhanced stock assessments and discard mortality 
monitoring. In addition, $2,000,000 is for Northeast Consortium 
activities, as referenced in the Senate report. The conferees 
direct NMFS to collaborate with the New England Fisheries 
Management Council and affected stakeholders to design and 
prioritize cooperative research programs, and to develop a 
long-term, comprehensive strategy to rebuild Northeast 
groundfish stocks.
      Protected Species Management.--Within the funds provided 
for protected species management, $750,000 is for continuation 
of a study on the impacts of California sea lions and harbor 
seals on salmonids and the West Coast ecosystem.
      Driftnet Act Implementation.--Within the funds provided 
for Driftnet Act Implementation, $75,000 is for the Pacific Rim 
Fisheries Program, and $25,000 is for Washington and Alaska 
participation.
      Endangered Species Recovery Plans.--A total of 
$43,500,000 is provided for this activity. Of these amounts, 
$43,000,000 is for the base program, $250,000 is to be made 
available for the State of Alaska for technical support to 
analyze proposed salmon recovery plans, and $250,000 is for the 
North Pacific Fishery Management Council for the purposes 
directed in the Senate report. The amount for the base program 
represents an increase of $17,250,000. Of this increase, 
$3,250,000 is provided for additional Pacific salmon-related 
activities, and $3,000,000 is provided for additional right 
whale activities. Together with the amount already in the base 
for right whales, this will result in a $4,100,000 funding 
level for right whale activities, which is to be expended in 
accordance with the Senate report. Other than salmon and right 
whales, the conferees expect that all activities will be kept 
at least at the fiscal year 1999 level, including Steller sea 
lion activities.
      The conference agreement adds $11,000,000 to the 
$32,500,000 included in the previous conference report for the 
Endangered Species Act recovery plan. The conferees expect 
these funds to be used for recovery plans for all endangered 
fish, marine mammals and sea turtles and not just for salmon in 
the northwest. In addition, the conferees expect NOAA to submit 
a staffing plan for the allocation of any new employees hired 
for this program in fiscal year 2000 and their proposed 
allocation by region.
      Native Marine Mammal Commissions.--The conference 
agreement recommends that funding be distributed as follows: 
(1) $400,000 for the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission; (2) 
$150,000 for the Alaska Harbor Seal Commission; (3) $225,000 
for the Beluga Whale Committee; (4) $50,000 for the Bristol Bay

Pacific Fishery Observer Training Program; (2) $1,875,000 for 
North Pacific marine resource observers; and (3) $350,000 for 
east coast observers.Before initiating funding for a West Coast 
observer program, the conferees request that NMFS provide a report on 
the options for funding such a program, and include a comparison of how 
current programs in the North Pacific and the East Coast are funded 
with the proposal for the West Coast.
      Interstate Fish Commissions.--The conference agreement 
includes $7,750,000 for this activity, of which $750,000 is to 
be equally divided among the three commissions, and $7,000,000 
is for implementation of the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries 
Cooperative Management Act.
      Fisheries Development Program.--Within the amount 
provided for the Fisheries Development Program, funding for the 
administrative costs of the Fisheries Finance program has been 
retained under this account, as provided in the House bill, 
instead of transferred to the Fisheries Finance Program 
account, as provided in the Senate bill. Language with respect 
to the administration of the Hawaiian Fisheries Development 
program and Hawaii Stock Enhancement included in the Senate 
report is adopted by reference.
      Other.--In addition, within the funds available for the 
Saltonstall-Kennedy grants program, the conferees direct that 
funding be provided to the Alaska Fisheries Development 
Foundation to be used in accordance with the direction included 
in the Senate report, and that funds be provided pursuant to 
the direction included in both the House and Senate reports to 
support ongoing efforts related to Vibrio vulnificus.

program, to be expended only if other countries involved in the 
project are also providing funding.
      Climate and Global Change Research.--The conference 
agreement includes $67,000,000 for the Climate and Global 
Change research program, an increase of $4,000,000 above the 
amounts provided in fiscal year 1999. Of this amount, the 
conference agreement includes an increase of $2,000,000 for the 
International Research Institute for Climate Prediction to fund 
planned modeling initiatives in water, agriculture, and public 
health, and will result in improved forecasting related to 
major climate events. Program increases of $1,000,000 for the 
Variability Beyond ENSO and $1,000,000 for Climate Forming 
Agents are also provided.
      Long-term Climate and Air Quality Research.--The 
conference agreement provides $30,000,000 for this activity, as 
proposed by the House, instead of $32,000,000 as proposed by 
the Senate. Funding is distributed in the same manner as in 
fiscal year 1999. The conferees concur with language in the 
House report regarding research and a report on natural sources 
and removal for low-atmosphere ozone.
      GLOBE.--A total of $3,000,000 is provided for this 
program, instead of $2,500,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
House bill did not include funding for this program. NOAA is 
expected to comply with the direction included in the Senate 
report regarding this program.

for Lake Champlain studies. Due to recently enacted changes in 
the National Sea Grant Program Authorization Act, future 
activities related to Lake Champlain are expected to be funded 
through the regular Sea Grant program.
      GLERL.--Within the $6,825,000 provided for the Great 
Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, the conference 
agreement assumes continued support for the Great Lakes 
nearshore research and zebra mussel research programs at 
current levels.
      Sea Grant.--The conference agreement appropriates 
$59,250,000 for the National Sea Grant program, of which 
$53,750,000 is for the base program, a $1,550,000 base increase 
over fiscal year 1999. The conferees expect NOAA to continue to 
fund the existing oyster disease research programs at their 
current levels and the zebra mussel research program at 
$3,000,000 within these amounts. The Sea Grant program and NMFS 
are urged to work with the West Coast Harmful Algal Bloom 
Workgroup to develop a research plan to address the causes of 
harmful algal blooms and a monitoring and prevention program.
      National Undersea Research Program (NURP).--The 
conference agreement provides $13,800,000 for the National 
Undersea Research Program (NURP). The conferees expect the 
funds to be distributed to the east coast NURP centers 
according to fiscal year 1999 allocations, and to the west 
coast centers according to fiscal year 1998 allocations. The 
conferees expect level funding will be made available for the 
Aquarius, ALVIN and program administration. The fiscal year 
2000 amount above these distributions shall be equally divided 
between east and west coast NURP centers.

                        national weather service

      The conference agreement includes a total of $603,870,000

creation of afine-scale numerical weather analysis and 
prediction capability, as referenced in the House report. The 
conference agreement also includes funding, as requested, for data 
buoys and coastal marine automated network stations. Funding of 
$3,250,000 for WFO maintenance is provided under this heading.
      The conferees concur with the language in the House and 
Senate reports relating to the Modernization Transition 
Committee/mitigation process to address the adequacy of NEXRAD 
coverage in certain areas. NOAA is expected to follow the 
recommendations contained in reports or applicable agreements 
requiring mitigation activities. The conferees also reiterate 
language in the fiscal year 1999 conference agreement 
addressing continued radar obstruction at the Jackson NEXRAD 
facility.
      In addition, the conferees expect the NWS to continue the 
activities of NOAA's Cooperative Institute for Regional 
Prediction related to the 2002 Winter Olympic games.

     national environmental satellite, data and information service

      The conference agreement includes $111,085,000 for NOAA's 
satellite and data management programs. In addition, the 
conference agreement includes $457,594,000 under the NOAA PAC 
account for satellite systems acquisition and related 
activities.
      Satellite Observing Systems.--The conferees have included 
$57,300,000 for this activity, the same amount and the same 
distribution as in fiscal year 1999. Funding for the wind 
demonstration project is to be provided in accordance with the 
Senate report.
      Environment Data Management.--The conferees have included 
$53,785,000 for EDMS activities. Under EDMS base activities, 
the conference agreement includes $24,000,000, an increase of 
$650,000, to be expended as directed in the House report. No 
funds are included to continue weather record rescue and 
preservation activities or the environmental data rescue 
program. The conference agreement includes $500,000 for the 
Cooperative Observers Network modernization. In addition, 
$4,000,000 is included for the Coastal Ocean Data Development 
Center, as referenced in the Senate report. In addition, the 
conferees have provided $10,200,000 to initiate a new, multi-
year program for climate database modernization and 
utilization, to include but not be limited to key entry of 
valuable climate records, archive services, and database 
development. The conferees note the Administration's recent 
initiatives in support of reinvestment in economically 
distressed communities within Appalachia and intend that work 
under this program must be performed by existing and 
experienced concerns currently located in the Appalachian 
counties of Laurel and Mineral, which are experiencing high 
unemployment and poverty. The conference agreement includes 
$2,750,000 for the Regional Climate Centers.

                            program support

      The conference agreement provides $62,553,000 for NOAA 
program support, instead of $54,594,000 as provided in the 
House bill, and $72,887,000, as provided in the Senate bill. 
Included in this total is $36,350,000 for Central 
Administrative Support, which is comprised of $31,850,000 for 
base activities and $4,500,000 for the Commerce Automated 
Management System.

                     fleet planning and maintenance

      The conference agreement includes an appropriation of 
$13,243,000 for this activity, as recommended in the Senate 
bill, instead of $7,000,000 included in the House bill. This 
amount includes $1,000,000 for equipping the RAINIER and 
$3,000,000 for NOPP-related activities.

                               facilities

      The conference agreement includes $11,204,000 for 
facilities maintenance, lease costs, and environmental 
compliance, instead of $10,165,000 as recommended in the House 
bill, and $9,829,000 as recommended in the Senate bill. 
Included in this total is $3,850,000 in lease payments to the 
General Services Administration (GSA) for the new Boulder 
facility. The conferees are aware that the GSA is applying 8% 
return-on-investment pricing to determine the rent that NOAA 
pays for the facility, with the possibility that the percentage 
will increase significantly in future years. The 
confereesbelieve that this results in an excessive rental charge that 
is not justified by the facts, and that a fair and reasonable return 
would be 6.25% amortized over 30 years. NOAA is directed to provide to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations at the earliest 
opportunity the options that exist to moderate the cost of rental 
payments, and to consult with the Committees on the next steps to take 
to assure that NOAA does not get saddled with an excessive rental 
payment.

               procurement, acquisition and construction

                     (including transfers of funds)

      Subtotal, Fleet Replacement.......................      51,567,000

      Systems Acquisition.--The conference agreement provides 
$16,000,000 to initiate AWIPS Build 5.0. NWS is requested to 
provide quarterly reports on the status of the project, 
progress in meeting milestones, amount expended to date, 
expected overall cost, and problems encountered.
      Construction.--The funds appropriated for the National 
Estuarine Research Reserve construction are to be distributed 
as follows: $6,000,000 is for overall NERRS requirements, 
$4,000,000 is for the Great Bay NERR, $2,500,000 is for the 
Kachemak Bay NERR, the latter two as recommended in the Senate 
report, and $750,000 is for the Jacques Cousteau NERR. The 
funds appropriated for Alaska facilities are to be distributed 
as follows: $750,000 is for the Juneau Lab, $3,500,000 is for 
Ship Creek, and $5,500,000 is for the SeaLife Center. The 
conference agreement provides $3,000,000 for preliminary design 
work for a new building in the Suitland Federal Center to be 
built by the General Services Administration. Prior to 
obligating these funds, the conferees expect NOAA to provide a 
report detailing the total estimated cost of the new building, 
including a breakout by fiscal year of the amounts proposed to 
be paid by both the GSA and NOAA, as well as a recapitulation 
of the options that were considered in reaching a decision on 
the proposed facility, and then consult with the Committees on 
the report.
      The conferees are also interested in receiving a report 
on any planning for new space related to other facilities in 
the area by January 15, 2000.

                    pacific coastal salmon recovery

      In addition to $20,000,000 provided elsewhere in this 
bill for initial capital for implementation of the 1999 Pacific 
Salmon agreement, the conference agreement includes $58,000,000 
for salmon habitat restoration, stock enhancement, and 
research. Of this amount, $18,000,000 is provided to the State 
of Washington, $14,000,000 is provided to the State of Alaska, 
$9,000,000 is provided to the State of Oregon, and $9,000,000 
is provided to the State of California. In addition, $6,000,000 
is provided to the Pacific Coastal tribes (as defined by the 
Secretary of Commerce) and $2,000,000 is provided to Columbia 
River tribes.
      The States of Alaska, Oregon, and California, and the 
tribes are strongly encouraged to each enter into a Memorandum 
of Understanding (MOU) with NMFS regarding projects funded 
under this section. The MOU should not require federal approval 
of individual projects, but should define salmon recovery 
strategies. All states and tribes that receive funding shall 
report to the Secretary of Commerce, the Senate and House 
Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation, and the House Committee on 
Resources on progress of salmon recovery efforts funded under 
this heading by not later than September 1, 2000.
      The 1999 Pacific Salmon Treaty Agreement provides a 
comprehensive, coastwide conservation program for the 
protection of Pacific salmon, including domestic andCanadian 
fisheries. In particular, it provides significant harvest reductions in 
Alaska below previous restrictions implemented in 1985 and 1995, each 
of which further reduced the impact of Alaska's fisheries on listed 
stocks. Therefore, any recovery efforts shall not be based on or 
anticipate exploitation rates in Alaska not included in the 1999 
Agreement, but should include other quantifiable goals and objectives, 
such as escapement and production, required for the recovery of listed 
salmon.
      The conference agreement provides $18,000,000 for the 
State of Washington which is to be provided directly to the 
Washington State Salmon Recovery Board to distribute for salmon 
habitat projects, other salmon recovery activities, and to 
implement the Washington Forest and Fish Agreement authorized 
by the Washington State Legislature. The conferees urge, with 
input from the Board, local governments, local watershed 
organizations, tribes, and other interested parties, that 
clear, scientifically-based goals and objectives for salmon 
recovery in Washington State be established by NMFS and be 
rendered in the form of numerical goals and objectives for the 
recovery of each species of salmon listed under the Endangered 
Species Act in Washington State. The conferees expect such 
goals and objectives to specify the outcome to be achieved for 
the salmon resource in order to satisfy the requirements of the 
Endangered Species Act. The conferees anticipate that by July 
1, 2000, NMFS will have established numerical goals and 
objectives for the recovery of salmon in the Puget Sound ESU, 
and will have produced a schedule for completion of numerical 
goals and objectives for all other parts of the State. The 
conferees expect that the Board will establish performance 
standards to inform its project funding decisions, and will 
give due deference to the project prioritization work being 
performed by local watershed organizations. Entities eligible 
to receive federal funds for salmon recovery projects and 
activities from the Board include local governments, tribes, 
and non-profit organizations, such as the Puget Sound 
Foundation. Funds appropriated by this Act may be distributed 
by the Board on a project-by-project basis or advanced in the 
form of block grants. Not more than one percent of these 
federal funds shall be used for the Board's administrative 
expenses, and not more than one percent of the remaining 
federal monies distributed by the Board for habitat projects 
and recovery activities shall be used by the eligible entities 
for administrative expenses. None of the $18,000,000 shall be 
used for the buy back of commercial fishing licenses or

                             court security

      The conference agreement includes $193,028,000 for the

as proposed in the Senate bill.
      The recommendation provides for requested adjustments to 
base, the requested program increases to hire additional 
security officers and for perimeter security, and the balance 
for additional security equipment. The language in the House 
report related to a report on changes in security officer

      The conference report allows $10,000,000 in security

this heading, as proposed in the Senate bill.

           Administrative Office of the United States Courts

                         salaries and expenses

                        Federal Judicial Center

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $18,000,000 for the 
fiscal year 2000 salaries and expenses of the Federal Judicial 
Center, instead of $17,716,000 as proposed in the House bill 
and $18,476,000 as proposed in the Senate bill.

                       Judicial Retirement Funds

                  payment to the judiciary trust funds

      The conference agreement includes $8,500,000 for the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission, as provided in the House bill, instead 
of $9,743,000 as provided in the Senate bill. Additional funds 
are available from carryover and from the Judiciary automation 
fund. There continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the 
requirements for the Commission in fiscal year 2000, but should 
the situation clarify, the conferees believe there is 
flexibility in the Judiciary appropriation to address any 
resulting additional requirements.

                   General Provisions--The Judiciary

      Section 301.--The conference agreement includes a 
provision included in both the House and Senate bills allowing

as included in the House bill, providing the Judiciary with the

limited the increase to 20 percent.

allowing up to $11,000 of salaries and expenses funds provided

            TITLE IV--DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCY

                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE

                   Administration of Foreign Affairs

                    DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS

      The conference agreement includes a total of 
$2,823,825,000 for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, instead of 
$2,726,825,000 as included in the House bill and $2,671,429,000 
as included in the Senate bill. The conference agreement 
includes $2,569,825,000 for ongoing activities under this 
account, and an additional $254,000,000 to remain available 
until expended for worldwide security upgrades.
      The conference agreement includes language not included 
in either the House or Senate bills making fees collected in 
fiscal year 2000 relating to affidavits of support available 
until expended.
      The conference agreement includes language designating 
$236,291,000 for public diplomacy international information 
programs instead of $306,057,000 as proposed in the House bill. 
The Senate bill did not contain a similar provision. This 
amount represents current services funding for program 
activities previously carried out by USIA, and includes the 
program and personnel costs associated with former USIA 
activities. The amount specified in the House bill included 
$59,247,000 in ICASS costs, and $10,519,000 for other overseas 
support costs. The conferees have excluded these support costs 
from the amount separately designated for public diplomacy 
international information programs.
      The conference agreement includes language making 
available $500,000 for the National Law Center for Inter-
American Free Trade, as provided in the Senate bill. The House 
bill did not include a similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language transferring 
$1,162,000 to the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust 
Assets in the United States, as proposed in the House bill. 
Language is also included limiting the amount transferred from 
all Federal sources to the authorized amount. The Senate bill 
did not include a similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language making 
$2,500,000 available for overseas continuing language 
education, instead of $5,000,000 as proposed in the Senate 
bill. The House bill did not include a similar provision.
      The conference report also includes a provision to 
collect and deposit as an offsetting collection to this account 
Machine Readable Visa fees in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 to 
recover authorized costs. The Senate bill included a similar 
provision but would have made it permanent. The House bill did 
not include a provision on this matter. The conference 
agreement does not include a provision in the House bill 
limiting the use of Machine Readable Visa fees to $267,000,000 
in fiscal year 2000. The Senate bill did not contain a similar 
provision.
      The conference agreement includes language designating 
$10,000,000 for activities associated with the implementation 
of the Pacific salmon treaty. The conference agreement does not 
include language that this funding must be designated from 
within amounts available for the Bureau of Oceans and 
International Environment and Scientific Affairs, as proposed 
in the Senate bill. The House bill did not contain a similar 
provision.
      The conference agreement includes $9,000,000 for the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls, instead of $11,000,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. The House bill did not have a 
similar provision. House report language directed the 
Department to maintain the increased fiscal year 1999 funding 
level for the Office. The conferees expect that increased 
funding for this Office will result in increased scrutiny of 
export license applications, enhanced end-use monitoring, and 
stronger compliance enforcement measures to ensure that U.S. 
technology is properly safeguarded when exported.
      The conference agreement also includes language allowing 
the transfer of not to exceed $4,500,000 to the International 
Broadcasting Operations account only to avoid reductions in 
force at the Voice of America.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
transferring $13,500,000 to the East-West Center, a provision 
making $6,000,000 available for overseas representation, a 
provision making $125,000 available for the Maui Pacific 
Center, or provisions placing limitations on details of State 
Department employees to other agencies or organizations. These 
provisions were proposed in the Senate bill, and the House bill 
did not contain similar provisions.
      The conference agreement does not include funding for any 
program increases requested by the Department. Within the 
amount provided, and including any savings the Department 
identifies, the Department will have the ability to propose 
that funds be used for purposes not funded by the conference 
agreement, including high priority program increases such as 
China 2000 and a Hispanic and minority recruitment initiative, 
through the normal reprogramming process. The conferees agree 
that no funds shall be used for the requested market 
development pilot project. With respect to China 2000, it is 
expected that the Department will comply with program direction 
in the Senate report regarding information resource center 
upgrades.
      The conference agreement includes $42,000,000, of which 
not to exceed $5,000,000 is for costs related to the WTO 
Ministerial in Seattle and the balance is for costs of 
additional staffing and support costs related to increased 
diplomatic activity in the Kosovo region. The Department may 
also use funding under this account for the participation costs 
of official delegates to the WTO Ministerial.
      The conferees agree that the Department shall follow the 
program direction and reporting requirements related to 
worldwide security in both the House and Senate reports. The 
language in the House report under this heading is to be 
followed in expending fiscal year 2000 funds, including 
language on the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, the 
implementation of Public Law 105-319, and on specific reporting 
requirements, including a report oncompensation provided to the 
families of the Americans killed in the terrorist bombing of the U.S. 
Embassy in Nairobi. In addition, this statement of managers adopts by 
reference the provisions in the Senate report addressing the Arctic 
Council and the Bering Straits Commission.
      The conference agreement does not adopt Senate report 
language on arms control treaty verification technology, and 
staffing levels in Berlin and Beijing.
      The conferees agree that the Department shall report to 
the Committees, no later than January 15, 2000, on the 
Department's plan for implementing recommendations in OIG 
Memorandum Report 99-SP-013 regarding foreign service tour 
length, and on the Bureau of Consular Affairs' plan to manage 
issues related to the entry into the United States of foreign 
nationals for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
      The conferees are concerned with what appears to be a 
large number of State Department employees staffing the Office 
of the Secretary and the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. The 
conferees believe the Secretary should be served by the best 
possible insight and advice, and it is important that 
potentially overlapping responsibilities among the regional and 
functional bureaus and the ``Secretariat'' do not produce a 
confusion of voices on key policy issues. Similarly, the 
conferees are concerned that unclear lines of responsibility 
and authority between the Bureau of Legislative Affairs and the 
various Congressional affairs offices in the regional and 
functional bureaus have resulted in confused or incomplete 
liaison with Congress. As a result, the conferees direct the 
Department to undertake staffing reassessments in these two 
offices. The Department should develop a plan to streamline 
staffing authorities and responsibilities and to rationalize 
the inclusion of staff and functions from USIA and ACDA, and 
report to the Committees on Appropriations no later than 
January 15, 2000.

                        CAPITAL INVESTMENT FUND

      The conference agreement includes $80,000,000 for the 
Capital Investment Fund, the amount included in the House bill, 
instead of $50,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The 
provisions in the House report are adopted by reference.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

      The conference agreement includes $27,495,000 for the 
Office of Inspector General, which has jurisdiction over the 
Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, 
instead of $28,495,000 as proposed in the House bill and 
$26,495,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The conferees 
expect that within the funds provided, the Inspector General 
will continue the current level of security-related audit and 
oversight activity. The conferees encourage the Inspector 
General to exercise appropriate oversight over the 
International Commissions and international broadcasting 
entities funded under this title.

               EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS

      The conference agreement includes $205,000,000 for 
Educational and Cultural Exchange Programs of the Department of 
State, instead of $175,000,000 as proposed in the House bill 
and $216,476,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The conference 
agreement also provides that not to exceed $800,000 may be 
credited to this appropriation from fees and other payments.
      The availability of significant carryover and recovered 
funds in this account is noted, and the Department is directed 
to submit a proposed distribution of the total resources 
available under this account no later than December 31, 1999, 
through the normal reprogramming process. The conferees intend 
that the distribution of funds under this account shall 
support, to the maximum extent possible, Fulbright Scholarship 
Programs, Humphrey Fellowships, educational advising and 
counseling, Citizen Exchange Programs, Pepper Scholarships, the 
Regional Scholar Exchange Program, the Disability Exchange 
Clearinghouse, the National Youth Science Camp, and exchanges 
with Tibet, the South Pacific, and East Timor. Such a 
distribution shall also include funding at not less than the 
amounts designated for the following programs: $42,800,000 for 
the International Visitor Program; $2,656,000 forEnglish 
language programs; $2,000,000 for American Overseas Research Centers; 
and $4,000,000 for Muskie Fellowships. To the extent that the 
Department allocates resources to civic education programs, these 
programs shall be separately identified and explained in the 
reprogramming submission.
      The conferees agree that enabling Muskie Fellowship 
Program participants to undertake doctoral graduate study in 
the social sciences, including economics, in universities in 
the United States is an appropriate extension of this program. 
Therefore, the conferees recommend that funding be provided for 
not more than thirty percent of the program participants to 
pursue Ph.D. programs. As a condition of participation in the 
doctoral program, fellows shall perform one year of service in 
their home countries for every year their study is supported by 
this program. The conferees expect that not less than thirty 
percent of each participant's doctoral study be funded from 
non-Federal sources.
      In addition, the conference agreement includes: 
$2,400,000 for Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchanges; $2,200,000 
for Mansfield Fellowships; $100,000 for the Montana Technical 
Foreign Exchange Program; $400,000 for the Institute for 
Representative Government; $500,000 for the Irish Institute; 
$638,000 for the 2001 Special Olympic Winter Games; $500,000 
for Olympic and Paralympic Games Youth Camps; and $150,000 for 
Interparliamentary Exchanges with Korea and China.
      The statement of managers adopts by reference language in 
the House report on NIS exchanges, the number of Congress-
Bundestag Youth Exchanges, competition for grant programs, and 
cooperation between the State Department and non-governmental 
exchange organizations, as well as language in the Senate 
report on the U.S./Mexico Conflict Resolution Center.

                       REPRESENTATION ALLOWANCES

      The conference agreement includes $5,850,000 for 
Representation Allowances, as proposed in the Senate bill, 
instead of $4,350,000 as proposed in the House bill.

              PROTECTION OF FOREIGN MISSIONS AND OFFICIALS

      The conference agreement includes $8,100,000 for 
Protection of Foreign Missions and Officials, as provided in 
both the House and Senate bills. The provisions in both the 
House and Senate reports are adopted by reference.

           SECURITY AND MAINTENANCE OF UNITED STATES MISSIONS

      The conference agreement includes $742,178,000 for this 
account instead of $717,178,000 as proposed in the House bill 
and $583,496,000 as proposed in the Senate bill.
      The conference agreement includes $313,617,000 for the 
costs of worldwide security upgrades, including $300,000,000 
for capital security projects, as proposed in the House bill. 
The conferees direct the Department to comply with the program 
direction related to security upgrades in the House report, 
including the submission of a spending plan within sixty days 
of the date of enactment of this Act. In proposing such a 
spending plan, the conferees direct the Department to include 
an assessment of the need for security upgrades related to 
housing, schools, and Marine quarters, as described in the 
Senate report.
      The conference agreement includes $25,657,000 in capital 
program activities for the costs of pending projects in 
Chengdu, Shenyang and Guangzhou.
      The conferees note that the budget request included 
planned expenditures of $92,500,000 from proceeds of sale of 
surplus property for opportunity purchases and capital 
projects. The conferees expect the Department to submit a 
spending plan for these funds that includes: at least 
$42,500,000 for opportunity purchases to replace uneconomical 
leases; at least $25,000,000 for capital security projects; and 
$5,000,000 for Taiwan design costs. Any additional use of these 
funds is subject to reprogramming.
      The conferees are aware that high operating costs in 
Paris have prompted a review of the post with the intent of 
transferring personnel and functions to lower cost cities. The 
conferees direct the Department to review the operations of the 
Paris Financial Service Center and determine if any services 
could be performed inthe United States at the Charleston 
Financial Service Center. The Department shall develop plans to 
transfer any such services to the United States consistent with the 
Department's overall financial systems improvement schedule and on a 
time line that is cost effective. A progress report on Financial 
Service Center consolidation shall be submitted to the House and Senate 
Appropriations Committees not later than June 1, 2000.
      The conferees are aware the Department is projecting a 
need for diversity visa processing capacity, and expect the 
Department to implement plans for a facility to meet such a 
need in a State previously designated for the purpose of 
passport processing.
      The Department is directed to submit, and receive 
approval for, a financial plan for the funding provided under 
this account, whether from direct appropriations or proceeds of 
sales, prior to the obligation or expenditure of funds for 
capital and rehabilitation projects. The conferees expect that 
the amount in the plan for the leasehold program will not 
exceed $138,210,000. The Department may include in the plan the 
costs of physical security upgrades including the costs of 
expanding Marine posts to new locations. The conferees agree 
that any such amount for expanding Marine posts to new 
locations shall not exceed half the total costs, in accordance 
with the existing cost-sharing arrangement.
      The overall spending plan shall include project-level 
detail, and shall be provided to the Appropriations Committees 
not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act. 
Any deviation from the plan after approval shall be treated as 
a reprogramming in the case of an addition greater than 
$500,000 or as a notification in the case of a deletion, a 
project cost overrun exceeding 25 percent, or a project 
schedule delay exceeding 6 months. Notification requirements 
also extend to the rebaselining of a given project's cost 
estimate, schedule, or scope of work.
      The conferees agree that no additional funding shall be 
allocated in fiscal year 2000 for the ongoing rehabilitation of 
the Ambassador's residence in London.
      The conferees direct the Department to submit to the 
Committees a plan to implement the September 1998 
recommendation of the Inspector General to sell a certain 
property in France, referenced in the Senate report.
      As in the past, immediate notification is expected if 
there are facilities that the Department believes pose serious 
security risks.

           EMERGENCIES IN THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE

      The conference agreement includes $5,500,000 for 
Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Service account, as 
provided in the House bill, instead of $7,000,000, as provided 
in the Senate bill. The conference agreement does not adopt the 
provision in the Senate report designating not more than 
$5,000,000 under this account for costs associated with the 
World Trade Organization conference in Seattle, Washington. The 
conferees address funding for these costs under the Diplomatic 
and Consular Programs account.

                   REPATRIATION LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      The conference agreement includes a total appropriation 
of $1,200,000 for the Repatriation Loans Program account, as 
provided in both the House and Senate bills.

              PAYMENT TO THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE IN TAIWAN

      The conference agreement includes $15,375,000 for the 
Payment to the American Institute in Taiwan account, instead of 
$14,750,000 as proposed in the House bill and $16,000,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. Increased funding over the fiscal 
year 1999 level may be used for costs of security upgrades as 
described in the Senate report. The conferees expect the 
Department to submit a spending plan to the Committees, as 
indicated in the House report.

     PAYMENT TO THE FOREIGN SERVICE RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY FUND

      The conference agreement includes $128,541,000 for the 
Payment to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund 
account, as provided in both the House and Senate bills.

              International Organizations and Conferences

              CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

      The conference agreement includes $885,203,000 for 
Contributions to International Organizations to pay the costs 
assessed to the United States for membership in international 
organizations, instead of $842,937,000 as proposed in the House 
bill, and $943,308,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, of which 
$836,308,000 was for current year assessments, and $107,000,000 
was for payment of arrearages to the United Nations. The 
conference agreement includes all arrearage payments under a 
separate account.
      The conference agreement includes language providing that 
none of the funds can be used for the U.S. share of interest 
costs for loans incurred after October 1, 1984 through external 
borrowings, as provided in the House bill. The Senate bill did 
not contain a similar provision.
      The conference agreement includes language providing that 
funds under this account may be used to pay the full United 
States assessment to the NATO civil budget, as proposed in the 
House bill. The Senate bill did not contain a similar 
provision.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
making $100,000,000 available only upon certifications that the 
United Nations is staying within a zero nominal growth budget 
for both the 1998-1999 and 2000-2001 biennial budgets, as 
proposed in the House bill. The conferees expect that the 
Department will make every effort to ensure that the United 
Nations stays within the expected 1998-1999 budget of 
$2,533,000,000 and accomplishes a zero nominal growth 2000-2001 
budget at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in 
December 1999. The Department shall report to the Committees on 
these efforts by January 15, 2000.
      The conference agreement does not contain a number of 
provisions in the Senate bill relating to payment of 
arrearages. Arrearages are addressed in a separate account.
      The $885,203,000 provided by the conference agreement is 
expected to be sufficient to fully pay assessments to 
international organizations. With excess fiscal year 1999 
funds, including a transfer from the Contributions for 
International Peacekeeping account, the conferees expect the 
Department to prepay $47,040,000 of the fiscal year 2000 
assessment for the United Nations regular budget. Consequently, 
although the budget requested $963,308,000 for this account, 
based on the prepayment of U.N. assessments and further 
exchange rate gains, the adjusted request is $885,842,000. The 
conference agreement does not include requested funding for the 
Inter-American Indian Institute, the Interparliamentary Union, 
and the Bureau of International Expositions.
      The conference agreement provides funding under this 
account for assessments for all international organizations. 
The Senate report proposed to transfer funding for commodity-
based organizations to the Commerce Department and funding for 
the International Telecommunications Union to the Federal 
Communications Commission. The conferees direct the Department 
to take the necessary steps to ensure that full and timely 
payments are made to these organizations.
      Provisions in the House report relating to reports on 
reforms in international organizations, tax equalization 
adjustments, and the Pan American Health Organization are 
adopted by reference.

        CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES

      The conference agreement provides $500,000,000 for 
Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities instead 
of $200,000,000 as proposed in the House bill, and $387,925,000 
as proposed in the Senate bill, of which $143,925,000 was for 
payment of current year peacekeeping assessments and 
$244,000,000 was for payment of peacekeeping arrearages. The 
conference agreement addresses arrearages under a separate 
account.
      The conference agreement includes a provision that, of 
the total funding provided under this heading, not to exceed 
$20,000,000 shall remain available until September 30, 2001. 
The Senate bill made $28,093,000 available until September 30, 
2001 and the House bill had no provision on the matter. The 
conferees intend that before any excess funding shall be 
carried over into fiscal year 2001 in this account, the 
Department shall transfer the maximum allowable amount to the 
Contributions to International Organizations account to prepay 
the fiscal year 2001 assessment for the United Nations regular 
budget.
      The conference agreement includes a provision that 
prohibits obligation or expenditure of funds for new or 
expanded U.N. peacekeeping missions unless, at least 15 days 
prior to the Security Council vote, the appropriate Committees 
of the Congress are notified of the estimated cost and length 
of the mission, the vital national interest that will be 
served, and the planned exit strategy; and a reprogramming of 
funds is submitted setting forth the source of funds that will 
be used to pay for the cost of the new or expanded mission, as 
included in the House bill. The Senate bill did not contain a 
provision on this matter.
      The conference agreement contains a provision requiring a 
certification that American manufacturers and suppliers are 
being given opportunities to provide equipment, services, and 
material for U.N. peacekeeping activities equal to those being 
given to foreign manufacturers and suppliers, as provided in 
the House bill. The Senate bill did not contain a provision on 
this matter.
      In addition, the conference agreement includes a 
provision prohibiting funds from being used to pay the United 
States share of the cost of judicial monitoring that is part of 
any United Nations peacekeeping mission, as proposed in the 
House bill. Thus, if any current or future peacekeeping 
operation includes judicial monitoring as one of its functions, 
the U.S. will have to withhold its proportionate share of the 
cost of any court monitoring that is included in such a 
mission. This provision was not included in the Senate bill.
      The conference agreement does not include several 
provisions relating to arrearages that were included in the 
Senate bill, as arrearages are addressed under a separate 
account.
      The conference agreement includes funding for anticipated 
assessments for peacekeeping missions including those in the 
Golan Heights, Lebanon, Iraq/Kuwait, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Cyprus, Georgia, Tajikistan, as well as War Crimes Tribunals 
for Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The conference agreement does not 
include requested funding for missions in Western Sahara or 
Haiti. The conference agreement includes additional resources, 
which may be applied to additional assessments subject to 
reprogramming requirements. The conferees are aware that 
additional assessments are expected in fiscal year 2000 for new 
and expanded peacekeeping missions, including those in Kosovo, 
Sierra Leone and East Timor.
      The statement of managers adopts by reference language in 
the House report making it clear that the Department is 
expected to live within the appropriation, to support the work 
of the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Service, and 
to take all actions necessary to prevent conversion of loaned 
employees into permanent positions at the United Nations.

                           ARREARAGE PAYMENTS

      The conference agreement includes a total of $351,000,000 
for arrearage payments, as proposed in the House bill under 
this account, instead of $107,000,000 and $244,000,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill under Contributions to 
International Organizations and Contributions for International 
Peacekeeping, respectively. The conference agreement includes 
$244,000,000 for the payment of arrearages, and an additional 
$107,000,000 to reduce the total amount of arrearages owed to 
the United Nations.
      The conference agreement does not include language, as 
proposed in the House bill, making the amounts provided under 
this heading subject to enactment of authorizing legislation 
that makes payment of arrearages contingent upon United Nations 
reform. The conferees understand that such authorization will 
be included as a separate division in this Act, and that the 
amounts provided under this heading will be used pursuant to 
the reform conditions contained in that division.
      The conference agreement makes the expenditure of the 
$244,000,000 provided for payment of arrearages contingent upon 
a reduction in the U.S. assessment rate for the designated 
specialized agencies to not more than 22 percent, and upon the 
achievement of zero nominal growth budgets in the designated 
specialized agencies for the 2000-2001 biennium. These 
conditions are included among the conditions pending as part of 
the authorization, and are intended to assure that real and 
substantial reforms are achieved at the U.N. and other 
international organizations prior to payment of arrearage 
funding, and that assessment reductions are made that will 
provide long-term savings to the American tax-payer.
      The conferees expect the Department to provide the 
Committees with a report on the payment of arrearages to 
international organizations as specified in the House report.

Senate reports. The conference agreement adopts, by reference, 
language in the House report regarding the reallocation of 
funds subject to reprogramming, and a reporting requirement on 
a certain wastewater treatment situation.

both the House and Senate bills. The conference level will 
provide funding for all three commissions at the fiscal year 
1999 levels.

bill, instead of $14,549,000 as proposed in the House bill.
      The conference agreement does not include provisions in 
the Senate bill limiting the amount to be obligated and 
expended by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and 
prohibiting the importation of tuna from certain countries 
under certain conditions. The House bill did not contain 
similar provisions.
      The conference agreement adopts, by reference, language 
in the House report regarding the application of reductions if 
necessary, and language in the Senate report on funding for the 
Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC), including sea lamprey 
operations and research, costs of treating Lake Champlain, and 
priority to States providing matching funds.

      The conference agreement includes $12,500,000 for 
operations of the East-West Center as proposed in the Senate 
bill, instead of no funds as proposed in the House bill. The 
conference agreement does not include a transfer of $13,500,000 
from the Department ofState, Diplomatic and Consular Programs

reference, the reporting requirement in the Senate report on immersion 
programs.

                           NORTH/SOUTH CENTER

      The conference agreement includes $1,750,000 for

                 INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING OPERATIONS

      The conference agreement includes $388,421,000 for 
International Broadcasting Operations, instead of $410,404,000 
as proposed in the House bill, and instead of $362,365,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. Rather than funding broadcasting 
to Cuba under this account, as proposed by the House, all 
funding for broadcasting to Cuba is included under a separate 
account, as proposed by the Senate and consistent with the 
fiscal year 1999 appropriations Act.
      The amount provided represents a freeze at fiscal year 
1999 funding levels for all broadcast entities funded under 
this account, as provided in the House bill. The Broadcasting 
Board of Governors is directed to submit to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations, no later than sixty days 
from the date of enactment of this Act, a financial plan 
including a distribution of the total resources available under

available resources shall include amounts sufficient to avoid 
reductions in force at the grantee broadcasting entities.
      The conference agreement adopts by reference language in 
the House report requiring a report on management responses to 
Inspector General recommendations on Radio Marti, and language 
in the Senate report requiring the submission of a master plan

Broadcasting to Cuba under a separate account, instead of 
$23,664,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, and instead of 
$22,095,000 within the total for International Broadcasting

agreement includes language, as proposed in the Senate bill, 
that funds may be used for aircraft to house television 
broadcasting equipment. The House bill did not contain a 
provision on this matter.

                   BROADCASTING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

      The conference agreement includes $11,258,000 for the 
Broadcasting Capital Improvements account, as proposed in the 
House bill, instead of $13,245,000 as proposed in the Senate 
bill under the heading ``Radio Construction''. The conference 
agreement adopts a new name for this account, as requested. 
This account provides funding for maintenance, improvements, 
replacements and repairs; satellite and terrestrial program 
feeds; engineering support activities; and broadcast facility 
leases and land rentals.
      The conferees expect the Broadcasting Board of Governors 
(BBG) to submit a spending plan within sixty days from the date 
of enactment of this Act allocating funds available in this 
account, including carryover balances, to various activities. 
The conferees encourage the BBG to consider, among other 
priorities, allocating funding for rotatable transmitting 
antennas.
      The conference agreement includes, by reference, language 
in the House report regarding ongoing digital conversion 
efforts.

                       maritime security program

      The conference agreement includes $96,200,000 for the 
Maritime Security Program instead of $98,700,000 as proposed in 
both the House and Senate bills. The conferees understand that 
at least $2,500,000 in carryover funding is available, in 
addition to the amount provided, to allow full funding for the 
fiscal year 2000 requirements of the program.

                        operations and training

      The conference agreement includes $72,073,000 for the 
Maritime Administration Operations and Training account instead 
of $71,303,000 as proposed in the House bill and $72,664,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. Within this amount, $34,073,000 
shall be for the operation and maintenance of the U.S. Merchant 
Marine Academy, including $2,000,000 to address maintenance 
backlogs.
      The conference agreement includes $7,000,000 for the 
State Maritime Academies. Within the amount for State Maritime 
Academies, $1,200,000 shall be for student incentive payments, 
the same amount as provided in 1999. The conference agreement 
includes by reference the language in the Senate report 
regarding the Great Lakes Maritime Academy.
      The conferees agree that the amounts designated for the 
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and the State Maritime Academies 
shall not be used to cover Maritime Administration 
administrative costs associated with the Academies, as was 
proposed inthe budget request. Such costs shall be covered from 
funding in this account for MARAD general administration. The 
conference agreement also includes funding under MARAD general 
administration under this account to conduct a needs assessment on 
infrastructure improvements at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, as 
described in the House report. The conference agreement includes no 
funds for the Ready Reserve Force for fiscal year 2000. In fiscal year 
1996, funding for this account was transferred to the Department of 
Defense.

          maritime guaranteed loan (title xi) program account

      The conference agreement provides $6,000,000 in subsidy 
appropriations for the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program instead 
of $5,400,000 as proposed in the House bill and $11,000,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. This amount will subsidize a 
program level of not more than $1,000,000,000 as proposed in 
both the House and Senate bills.
      The conference agreement also includes $3,809,000 for 
administrative expenses associated with the Maritime Guaranteed 
Loan Program instead of $3,725,000 as proposed in the House 
bill, and $3,893,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The amount 
for administrative expenses may be transferred to and merged 
with amounts under the MARAD Operations and Training account.
      The conferees understand that MARAD expects to carry over 
approximately $63,600,000 in this account which may be used as 
additional subsidy budget authority in fiscal year 2000. The 
conferees direct MARAD to submit quarterly reports to the 
Committees on Title XI obligations, including information on 
total loan principal guaranteed by each separate fiscal year's 
subsidy appropriation.

           administrative provisions--maritime administration

      The conference agreement includes provisions involving 
Government property controlled by MARAD, the accounting for 
certain funds received by MARAD, and a prohibition on 
obligations from the MARAD construction fund. The conference 
agreement includes these provisions with the modification as 
proposed in the House bill, instead of as proposed in the 
Senate bill.

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement provides $490,000 for the 
Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad, 
as proposed in the Senate bill, instead of $265,000 as proposed 
in the House bill. Within the amount provided, the conferees 
agree that $100,000 is provided as a one-time increase to 
support Commission efforts to attract private funding for a 
restoration project in Sarajevo, as described in the House 
report. The conference agreement includes, by reference, 
language in the Senate report regarding the completion of 
surveys in progress.

      The conference agreement includes $8,900,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Commission on Civil Rights as 
proposed in both the House and Senate bills.
      The conferees direct the Commission to expedite the 
completion of its report on the public hearing conducted on May 
26, 1999, in New York on Police Practices and Civil Rights.
      The Conferees expect the Commission to keep the 
Committees informed on the status of management improvements, 
including developing the ability to plan and budget for 
projects and to track the progress and ongoing costs of such 
projects.

               Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $1,400,000 for the 
Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. The Commission was 
created by Public Law 105-277. The House and Senate bills did 
not contain funding for the Commission.

            Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $1,182,000 for the 
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe instead of

proposed in the Senate bill.

                Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $282,000,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, instead of $279,000,000 as proposed in both the

      Within the total amount, the conference agreement 
includes $29,000,000 for payments to State and local Fair 
Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs) for specific services to 
the Commission, as proposed in both the House and Senate bills. 
The conferees encourage the EEOC to utilize the experience the 
FEPAs have in mediation as the Commission implements its 
alternative dispute resolution programs. The Committeesare 
willing to entertain proposals to reprogram additional funds to the 
FEPAs for this purpose.
      The conferees expect the EEOC to submit a spending plan 
to the Committees before December 31, 1999, describing the 
allocation of funding to various Commission activities, 
including private sector charge backlog reduction, ADR and 
mediation initiatives, litigation, and automation improvements. 
The conferees expect the EEOC to allocate funds as necessary to 
achieve private sector charge backlog reduction targets, as 
noted in the House report.

                   Federal Communications Commission

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes a total $210,000,000 
for the salaries and expenses of the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) instead of $192,000,000 as proposed in the 
House bill and $232,805,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. Of 
the amounts provided, $185,754,000 is to be derived from 
offsetting fee collections, as proposed in both the House and 
Senate bills, resulting in a net direct appropriation of 
$24,246,000, instead of $6,246,000 included in the House bill, 
and $47,051,000 included in the Senate bill.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision, 
proposed in the Senate bill, giving the FCC the authority to 
independently operate the FCC headquarters building. The House 
bill did not contain a provision on this matter.
      The conferees did not retain Senate bill language 
regarding area code conservation. The conferees are aware that 
the Commission has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(NPRM) to assist the State public utility commissions in their 
efforts to conserve numbers in specific area codes. The 
Commission anticipates issuing an order by the end of the first 
quarter of 2000. The conferees expect the Commission to keep to 
this schedule and issue a final order on area code conservation 
measures no later than March 31, 2000.

                      Federal Maritime Commission

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $14,150,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Federal Maritime Commission, as 
proposed in both the House and Senate bills.

                        Federal Trade Commission

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes a total operating level 
of $125,024,000 for the Federal Trade Commission, instead of 
$116,679,000 as proposed in the House bill, and $133,368,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. The conference agreement assumes 
that, of the amount provided, $104,024,000 will be derived from 
fees collected in fiscal year 2000 and $21,000,000 will be 
derived from estimated unobligated fee collections available 
from Fiscal Year 1999. These actions result in a final 
appropriated level of $0, as proposed in both the House and 
Senate bills.
      The conferees intend that any excess fee collections 
shall remain available for the Federal Trade Commission in 
future years. The conference agreement includes language, not 
included in either the House or Senate bills, specifying that 
fees may be retained and used notwithstanding a specific 
provision of law, rather than notwithstanding any provision of 
law.
      The conferees agree that increased resources in this 
account shall be used to help safeguard consumers and nurture 
the development of the electronic marketplace, consistent with 
language in the Senate report.
      The conferees support the Commission on its efforts to 
study the marketing practices of the entertainment industry. 
The intent of the study is to determine whether and to what 
extent the industry markets violent material rated for adults 
to children.
      The conferees understand that the FTC recently completed 
a report raising questions regarding the health effects of 
regular cigar smoking. The conferees are aware of concerns that 
cigar and pipe tobacco remain as the last major tobacco 
products without a uniform Federal health warning label. The 
conferees direct the FTC to report back to the Committees on 
Commission plans for implementing new requirements to address 
this issue.

                       Legal Services Corporation

               payment to the legal services corporation

      The conference agreement includes $305,000,000 for 
payment to the Legal Services Corporation, instead of 
$300,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill, and $250,000,000 
as proposed in the House bill.
      The conference agreement provides $289,000,000 for grants 
to basic field programs and independent audits, $8,900,000 for 
management and administration, and $2,100,000 for the Office of 
the Inspector General, as proposed by the Senate. The agreement 
also includes $5,000,000 to provide technology grants to Legal 
Services Corporation grantees to be used to improve pro se 
clinic methods and acquire computerized systems that make basic 
legal information and court forms accessible to pro se 
litigants. These grants are made with the understanding, as 
stated in the Legal Services Corporation budget request, that 
the grantees make a commitment to include in their budgets for 
future years amounts sufficient to maintain and upgrade their 
equipment. The conferees note that $28,000,000 is provided for 
civil legal assistance under the Violence Against Women Act 
program funded under title I of this bill.
      The conferees expect that any unobligated balances 
remaining available at the end of the fiscal year may be 
reallocated among participating programs for technology 
enhancements and demonstration projects in succeeding fiscal 
years, subject to the reprogramming procedures in Section 605 
of this Act.
      The conferees have concerns about the case service 
reporting and associated data reports submitted annually by the 
Corporation's grantees and the case statistical reports 
submitted by the Corporation to the Congress, and the conferees 
direct the Corporation to make improvement of the accuracy of 
these submissions a top priority, per directions in the House 
report. The conferees also direct the Corporation to submit its 
1999 annual case service reports and associated data reports to 
Congress no later than April 30, 2000. The Office of the 
Inspector General will assess the case service information 
provided by the grantees, and will report to the Committees no 
later than July 30, 2000, as to its accuracy, as described in 
the House report. The conference agreement alsoincludes the two 
feasibility reports described in the House report, due no later than 
June 1, 2000. The conferees urge the Corporation to provide its annual 
case service reports by May 1 of each following fiscal year, as 
described in the House report. The conferees direct the Corporation to 
keep the Committees fully informed on its study of the issue of the 
statutory requirement that aliens be ``present in the United States'', 
as described in the House report.

          administrative provision--legal services corporation

      The Conference recommendation includes bill language to 
continue the terms and conditions included under this section 
in the fiscal year 1999 bill, as proposed in the House. The 
Senate bill contained similar language, but did not propose to 
continue provisions regarding public disclosure of certain 
information and treatment of assets and income for certain 
clients.

                        Marine Mammal Commission

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $1,270,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Marine Mammal Commission, instead 
of $1,240,000 as proposed in the House bill and $1,300,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill.

                   Securities and Exchange Commission

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement includes $367,900,000 for the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, instead of $324,000,000 as 
proposed in the House bill and $370,800,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill. The conference agreement includes bill language 
appropriating separate amounts from offsetting fee collections 
from fiscal years 1998 and 2000, as proposed in both the House 
and Senate bills. The conference agreement includes 
$194,000,000 in fees collected in fiscal year 1998, and 
$173,800,000 in fees to be collected in fiscal year 2000.
      The conference agreement provides for the Commission's 
adjustments to base and the requested program increases for 
additional staff and litigation support. Additional amounts are 
provided to improve enforcement and investor education related 
to Internet securities fraud as described in the Senate report.
      The conferees intend that any offsetting fee collections 
in fiscal year 2000 in excess of $173,800,000 will remain 
available for the Securities and Exchange Commission in future 
years through the regular appropriations process.
      The conferees agree that the Commission shall conduct a 
study on the effects on securities markets of electronic 
communications networks and extended trading hours, as provided 
in the Senate bill. This report shall be submitted to the 
Committees no later than March 1, 2000.

                     Small Business Administration

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement provides an appropriation of 
$282,300,000 for the Small Business Administration (SBA) 
Salaries and Expenses account, instead of $245,500,000 as 
proposed in the House bill and $246,300,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill. In addition, the conference agreement includes 
$10,500,000 for programs related to the New Markets Venture 
Capital Program subject to the authorization of that program, 
including $1,500,000 for BusinessLINC and $9,000,000 for 
technical assistance.
      In addition to amounts made available under this heading, 
the conference agreement includes $129,000,000 for 
administrative expenses under the Business Loans Program 
account. This amount is transferred to and merged with amounts 
available under Salaries and Expenses. The conference agreement 
includes an additional $136,000,000 for administrative expenses 
under the Disaster Loans Program account,which may under 
certain conditions be transferred to and merged with amounts available 
under Salaries and Expenses. These conditions are described under the 
Disaster Loans Program account.
      The conference agreement provides a total of $107,695,000 
for SBA's regular operating expenses under this account. This 
amount includes $2,000,000 for necessary expenses of the 
HUBZone program, and $8,000,000 for initiatives to continue the 
improvement of SBA's management and oversight of its loan 
portfolio. The SBA shall submit a plan, prior to the 
expenditure of resources for portfolio management, in 
accordance with section 605 of this Act.
      With the exceptions noted above, the conference agreement 
does not include new program initiatives requested by the SBA 
for fiscal year 2000. The conference agreement includes the 
following amounts for noncredit programs:

                    ____________________________________________________
      Total.............................................     138,605,000

      Small Business Development Centers (SBDC).--Of the 
amounts provided for SBDCs, the conference agreement includes 
$2,000,000 to continue the SBDC Defense transition program, and 
$1,000,000 to continue the Environmental Compliance Project, as 
directed in the House report. In addition, the conference 
agreement includes language proposed in the Senate bill making 
funds for the SBDC program available for two years.
      Microloan Technical Assistance.--The conference agreement 
includes $23,200,000 for the Microloan Technical Assistance 
program. The conferees intend that, in addition, any 
unobligated fiscal year 1999 funds associated with this program 
will be applied to the fiscal year 2000 program.
      Advocacy Research.--The conference includes $1,100,000 
for Advocacy Research. The conferees encourage the Office of 
Advocacy to pursue the study identified in the House report on 
the livestock and agriculture industries.
      The conference agreement adopts language included in the 
House report directing the SBA to fully LowDoc Processing 
Centers, and to continue activities assisting small businesses 
to adapt to a paperless procurement environment, as well as 
activities which assist small businesses in making the 
transition to meet both military and ISO 9000 quality systems 
requirements.

                      office of inspector general

      The conference agreement provides $11,000,000 for the SBA 
Office of Inspector General, instead of $10,800,000 as proposed 
in the House bill and $13,250,000 recommended in the Senate 
bill.
      An additional $500,000 has been provided under the 
administrative expenses of the Disaster Loans Program to be 
made available to the Office of Inspector General for work 
associated with oversight of the Disaster Loans Program.
      The conferees agree that the OIG should allocate 
resources to the priority areas mentioned in the Senate report.

                     business loans program account

      The conference agreement includes $266,800,000 under the 
SBA Business Loans Program Account, instead of $222,792,000 as 
proposed in the House bill, and $297,368,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill. Within the amount provided, $6,000,000 shall be 
available only for the New Markets Venture Capital Program, 
subject to the enactment of authorizing legislation in fiscal 
year 2000.
      No appropriation is provided for the costs of direct 
loans. The conferees understand that $2,500,000 in carryover is 
available for the Microloan Direct Loan Program, and will 
support an estimated 2000 program level of over $29,000,000. 
The conferees direct the SBA to submit the report on Microloan 
programs requested in the House report.
      The conference agreement includes $137,800,000 for the 
costs of guaranteed loans, including the following programs:
      7(a) General Business Loans.--The conference agreement 
provides $107,500,000 in subsidy appropriations for the 7(a) 
general business guaranteed loan program, instead of 
$106,400,000 as proposed in the House bill and $118,500,000 as 
proposed in the Senate bill. When combined with $7,000,000 in 
available carryover balances and recoveries, this amount will 
subsidize an estimated 2000 program level of $9,871,000,000, 
assuming a subsidy rate of 1.16%. In addition, the conference 
agreement includes a provision, as proposed in the House bill, 
requiring the SBA tonotify the Committees on Appropriations in 
accordance with section 605 of this Act prior to providing a total 
program level greater than $10,000,000,000, instead of greater than 
$10,500,000,000 as proposed in the Senate bill. The conferees agree 
with the concerns expressed by the Senate that many small businesses 
are not adequately prepared for the problems they may face from Y2K 
computer problems and about the impact that the Y2K computer problem 
may have on the economy and, in particular, on small business owners 
and their employees. Consequently, the conferees agree that the Small 
Business Administration must give the highest priority to loans to 
small businesses to correct Y2K computer problems affecting their own 
information technology systems or other automated systems, and loans to 
provide relief for small businesses from economic injuries suffered as 
a direct result of their own Y2K computer problems or some other 
entity's Y2K computer problems.
      Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC).--The 
conference agreement provides $24,300,000 for the SBIC 
participating securities program, instead of $21,630,000 as 
proposed in the House bill, and $25,868,000 as proposed in the 
Senate bill. This amount will result in an estimated total 
program level of $1,350,000,000 in fiscal year 2000. No 
appropriation is provided for the debentures program, as the 
program will operate with a zero subsidy rate in fiscal year 
2000. The conference agreement includes language proposed in 
the House bill limiting the debentures program to the 
authorized program level, instead of similar language in the 
Senate bill.
      Microloan Guaranty Programs.--The conference agreement 
does not include new appropriations for the Microloan Guaranty 
Program, as none were requested. Available carryover will 
provide for the subsidy costs of, at least, the requested 2000 
program level of $15,998,000.
      In addition, the conference agreement includes 
$129,000,000 for administrative expenses to carry out the 
direct and guaranteedloan programs as proposed in the Senate 
bill, and instead of $94,000,000 as proposed in the House bill, and 
makes such funds available to be transferred to and merged with 
appropriations for Salaries and Expenses.

                     disaster loans program account

      The conference agreement includes a total of $276,400,000 
for this account, of which $140,400,000 is for the subsidy 
costs for disaster loans and $136,000,000 is for administrative 
expenses associated with the disaster loans program. The House 
bill proposed $139,400,000 for loans and $116,000,000 for 
administrative expenses. The Senate bill provided $77,700,000 
for loans and $86,000,000 for administrative expenses.
      For disaster loans, the conference agreement assumes that 
the $140,400,000 subsidy appropriation, when combined with 
$72,000,000 in carryover balances and $10,000,000 in 
recoveries, will provide a total disaster loan program level of 
$1,000,000,000. The conference agreement takes into account 
that the Administration requested only $39,400,000 for disaster 
loan subsidies, which would have supported less than one 
quarter of an average annual program. The Administration is 
directed to realistically assess the level of need for the 
disaster loans program and budget accordingly.
      The conference agreement includes language, as proposed 
in the Senate bill, allowing appropriations for administrative 
costs to be transferred to and merged with appropriations for 
Salaries and Expenses. The House bill did not include language 
allowing such transfers. The conference agreement includes a 
provision that any amount to be transferred to Salaries and 
Expenses from the Disaster Loans Program account in excess of 
$20,000,000 shall be treated as a reprogramming of funds under 
section 605 of this Act. In addition, the conferees agree that 
any such reprogramming shall be accompanied by a report from 
the administrator on the anticipated effect of the proposed 
transfer on the ability of the SBA to cover the full annual 
requirements for direct administrative costs of disaster loan 
making and servicing.
      Of the amounts provided for administrative expenses under 
this heading, $500,000 is to be transferred to and merged with 
the Office of Inspector General account for oversight and audit 
activities related to the Disaster Loans program.

        administrative provision--small business administration

      The conference agreement includes a provision providing 
SBA with the authority to transfer funds between appropriations 
accounts as proposed in the House bill, instead of a similar 
provision in the Senate bill.

                        State Justice Institute

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement provides $6,850,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the State Justice Institute (SJI) as 
proposed in the Senate bill, instead of no funding as proposed 
in the House bill. The conference agreement does not include 
the transfer of an additional $8,000,000 to this account from 
the Courts of Appeals, District Courts and Other Judicial 
Services account in Title III as proposed in the Senate report.

                      TITLE VI--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      The conference agreement includes the following general 
provisions:
      Section 601.--The conference agreement includes section 
601, identical in both the House and Senate bills, regarding 
the use of appropriations for publicity or propaganda purposes.
      Sec. 602.--The conference agreement includes section 602, 
identical in both the House and Senate bills, regarding the

      Sec. 604.--The conference agreement includes section 604, 
identical in both the House and Senate bills, providing that 
should any provision of the Act be held to be invalid, the 
remainder of the Act would not be affected.
      Sec. 605.--The conference agreement includes section 605, 
as included in the House bill, establishing the policy by which 
funding available to the agencies funded under this Act may be 
reprogrammed for other purposes, instead of the slightly 
modified Senate version.
      Sec. 606.--The conference agreement includes section 606, 
identical in both the House and Senate bills, regarding the 
construction, repair or modification of National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration vessels in overseas shipyards.
      Sec. 607.--The conference agreement includes section 607, 
identical in both the House and Senate bills, regarding the 
purchase of American-made products.
      Sec. 608.--The conference agreement includes section 608, 
identical in both the House and Senate bills, which prohibits 
funds in the bill from being used to implement, administer, or 
enforce any guidelines of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission similar to proposed guidelines covering harassment 
based on religion published by the EEOC in October, 1993.
      Sec. 609.--The conference agreement includes section 609, 
proposed in the House bill as section 610, prohibiting the use 
of funds for any United Nations peacekeeping mission that 
involves U.S. Armed Forces under the command or operational 
control of a foreign national, unless the President certifies 
that the involvement is in the national security interest, as 
proposed in the House bill. The Senate bill did not contain a 
provision on this matter.
      Sec. 610.--The conference agreement includes section 610, 
proposed in the Senate bill as section 609, that prohibits use 
of funds to expand U.S. diplomatic presence in Vietnam beyond 
the level in effect on July 11, 1995, unless the President 
makes a certification that several conditions have been met 
regarding Vietnam's cooperation with the United States on POW/
MIA issues. The House bill included a similar provision, with 
minor technical differences.
      Sec. 611.--The conference agreement includes section 611, 
modified from section 610 proposed in the Senate bill, which 
prohibits more than 20% of any account that is available for 
obligation only in the current fiscal year from being obligated 
during the last two months of the fiscal year unless the 
Committees on Appropriations are notified in accordance with 
standard reprogramming procedures, with an exemption to this 
limitation for grant programs. The House bill did not contain a 
provision on this matter.
      Sec. 612.--The conference agreement includes section 612, 
identical in both the House and Senate bills, which prohibits 
the use of funds to provide certain amenities for Federal 
prisoners.
      Sec. 613.--The conference agreement includes section 613, 
proposed as section 612 in the House bill, restricting the use 
of funds provided under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration for fleet modernization activities. The Senate 
bill did not contain a provision on this matter.
      Sec. 614.--The conference agreement includes section 614, 
proposed as section 612 in the Senate bill, which requires 
agencies and departments funded in this Act to absorb any 
necessary costs related to downsizing or consolidations within 
the amounts provided to the agency or department. The House 
bill included this provision as section 613, with minor 
technical differences.
      Sec. 615.--The conference agreement includes section 615, 
as proposed in both the House and Senate bills, which prohibits 
funds made available to the Federal Bureau of Prisons from 
being used to make available any commercially published 
information or material that is sexually explicit or features 
nudity to a prisoner.
      Sec. 616.--The conference agreement includes section 616, 
as proposed in both the House and Senate bills, which limits 
funding under the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant to 90 
percent to an entity that does not provide public safety 
officers injured in the line of duty, and as a result separated 
or retired from their jobs, with health insurance benefits 
equal to the insurance they received while on duty.
      Sec. 617.--The conference agreement includes a provision, 
proposed as section 616 in the House bill, which prohibits 
funds provided in this Act from being used to promote the sale 
or export of tobacco or tobacco products, or to seek the 
reduction or removal of foreign restrictions on the marketing 
of tobacco products, provided such restrictions are applied 
equally to all tobacco or tobacco products of the same type. 
This provision is not intended to impact routine international 
trade services provided to all U.S. citizens, including the 
processing of applications to establish foreign trade zones. 
The Senate bill did not contain a provision on this matter.
      Sec. 618.--The conference agreement includes section 618, 
proposed as section 615 in the Senate bill, which extends the 
prohibition in last year's bill on use of funds to issue a visa 
to any alien involved in extrajudicial and political killings 
in Haiti. The provision also adds two names to the list of 
victims, and extends the exemption and reporting requirements 
from last year's provision. The House bill did not contain a 
provision on this matter.
      Sec. 619.--The conference agreement includes section 619, 
proposed as section 617 in the House bill and carried in the 
fiscal year 1999 Act, which prohibits a user fee from being 
charged for background checks conducted pursuant to the Brady 
Handgun Control Act of 1993, and prohibits implementation of a 
background check system which does not require or result in 
destruction of certain information. The Senate bill included a 
similar provision as section 616, requiring immediate 
destruction of such information.
      Sec. 620.--The conference agreement includes section 620, 
proposed as section 618 in the House bill, which delays 
obligation of any receipts deposited into the Crime Victims 
Fund in excess of $500,000,000 until October 1, 2000. The 
conferees have taken this action to protect against wide 
fluctuations in receipts into the Fund, and to ensure that a 
stable level of funding will remain available for these 
programs in future years.
      Sec. 621.--The conference agreement includes section 621, 
proposed as section 620 in the House bill, which prohibits the 
use of funds to implement or prepare to implement the Kyoto 
Protocol on Climate Change prior to Senate ratification of the 
treaty. The Senate bill did not contain a provision on this 
matter.

      Sec. 623.--The conference agreement includes a section, 
modified from the Senate bill, that authorizes the 
establishment and initial capitalization of two funds: the 
Northern Boundary and Transboundary Rivers Restoration and 
Enhancement Fund; and the Southern Boundary Restoration and 
Enhancement Fund. This section withholds funding to implement 
the 1999 Pacific Salmon Treaty Agreement until anticipated 
judicial and regulatory actions have been taken. This section 
also requires NMFS to make a jeopardy determination in southern 
United States fisheries before it may revisit its decision in 
Alaska. It allows the Pacific Salmon Commission to implement 
harvest responses under the Pacific Salmon Treaty before NMFS 
may reinitiate consultation in Alaska. The Pacific Salmon 
Commission can regulate salmon harvests in the United States 
and Canada in response to low escapement numbers, whereas NMFS 
may only address U.S. fisheries using the Endangered Species 
Act. Additionally, this section makes changes to the voting 
structure of the Pacific Salmon Commission. This section also 
authorizes funds in fiscal year 2000 for Pacific Coastal Salmon 
Recovery that are appropriated under title II of this Act, 
subject to requirements for a 25 percent non-federal match and 
a 3 percent limitation on administrative expenses, with certain 
exceptions.
      Sec. 624.--The conference agreement includes section 624, 
proposed as section 627 in the Senate bill, which makes fiscal 
year 1999 appropriations associated with implementation of the 
American Fisheries Act of 1999 available until expended. The 
House bill did not contain a similar provision.
      Sec. 625.--The conference agreement includes a new 
provision, numbered as section 625, which amends section 635 of 
Public Law 106-58 by inserting the words ``the carrier for'' 
after ``if'' in subsection (b)(2), and ``or otherwise provide 
for'' after ``to prescribe'' in subsection (c).
      Sec. 626.--The conference agreement includes section 626, 
proposed as section 801 in the House bill, which prohibits the 
use of Department of Justice funds for programs which 
discriminate against or denigrate the religious beliefs of 
students participating in such programs. The Senate bill did 
not contain a provision on this matter.
      Sec. 627.--The conference agreement includes section 627, 
proposed as section 802 in the House bill, which prohibits the 
use of funds to process visas for citizens of countries that 
the Attorney General has determined deny or delay accepting the 
return of deported citizens. The Senate bill did not contain a 
provision on this matter.
      Sec. 628.--The conference agreement includes section 628, 
proposed as section 803 in the House bill, which prohibits the 
use of Department of Justice funds to transport a high security 
prisoner to any facility other than to a facility certified by 
the Bureau of Prisons as appropriately secure to house such a 
prisoner. The Senate bill did not contain a similar provision.
      Sec. 629.--The conference agreement includes section 629, 
modified from language proposed as section 804 in the House 
bill,which prohibits funds from being used for the 
participation of United States delegates to the Standing Consultative 
Commission unless the President submits a certification that the U.S. 
Government is not implementing a 1997 memorandum of understanding 
regarding the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the U.S. and 
the U.S.S.R., or the Senate ratifies the memorandum of understanding. 
The Senate bill did not include a provision on this matter.
      Sec. 630.--The conference agreement includes section 630, 
proposed as section 805 in the House bill, which prohibits 
funds for any activity in support of adding or maintaining any 
World Heritage Site in the U.S. on the List of World Heritage 
in Danger. The Senate bill did not include a provision on this 
matter.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision, 
proposed as section 619 in the House bill, regarding Global 
Change Research assessments. However, the conferees direct that 
funds provided in this Act not be used to publish Global Change 
Research assessments unless the research has been subjected to 
peer review and made available to the public, and the draft 
assessment has been published in the Federal Register for a 60 
day public comment period.

$35,000,000 from the amounts otherwise available for obligation 
in fiscal year 2000 for the ``Drug Diversion Fee Account'', as 
proposed in the Senate bill. The House bill did not include a 
rescission from this account.

as the SBIC debentures program will have a zero subsidy rate in 
fiscal year 2000.

                         clean coal technology


    Sec. 599A. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The United States is the world leader in the 
        development of environmental technologies, particularly 
        clean coal technology.
            (2) Severe pollution problems affecting people in 
        developing countries, and the serious health problems 
        that result from such pollution, can be effectively 
        addressed through the application of United States 
        technology.
            (3) During the next century, developing countries, 
        particularly countries in Asia such as China and India, 
        will dramatically increase their consumption of 
        electricity, and low quality coal will be a major 
        source of fuel for power generation.
            (4) Without the use of modern clean coal 
        technology, the resultant pollution will cause 
enormoushealth and environmental problems leading to diminished 
economic growth in developing countries and, thus, diminished United 
States exports to those growing markets.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United 
States to promote the export of United States clean coal 
technology. In furtherance of that policy, the Secretary of 
State, the Secretary of the Treasury (acting through the United 
States executive directors to international financial 
institutions), the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator 
of the United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) should, as appropriate, vigorously promote the use of 
United States clean coal technology in environmental and energy 
infrastructure programs, projects and activities. Programs, 
projects and activities for which the use of such technology 
should be considered include reconstruction assistance for the 
Balkans, activities carried out by the Global Environment 
Facility, and activities funded from USAID's Development Credit 
Authority.

introduced on November 17, 1999.

      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS 
                             APPROPRIATIONS

      This joint explanatory statement includes a description 
of the resolution of differences between the House and Senate 
on both H.R. 2606, vetoed by the President on October 18, 1999, 
and H.R. 3196. References in the following statement to 
appropriations amounts or other items proposed by the House 
bill or Senate amendment refer only to those amounts and items 
recommended in the House-passed and Senate-passed versions of 
H.R. 2606. Appropriation amounts, bill language, and general 
provisions contained in this conference agreement which were 
identical in the House-passed and Senate-passed versions of 
H.R. 2606 are not referenced in the following joint explanatory 
statement. In some instances, appropriations amounts or other 
items in H.R. 3196 are not referenced in the statement as being 
part of the House-passed version of that bill. However, any 
reference to appropriations amounts or other items being 
included in the conference agreement does reflect the final 
agreement with regard to both H.R. 2606 and H.R. 3196.
      The managers expect that each agency affected by this 
conference agreement consult with the Committees on 
Appropriations not later than December 15, 1999, regarding the 
directives and recommendations included in House Report No. 
106-254 and Senate Report No. 106-81, which accompanied their 
respective versions of H.R. 2606:

               TITLE I--EXPORT AND INVESTMENT ASSISTANCE

     Export-Import Bank of the United States Subsidy Appropriation

      The conference agreement appropriates $759,000,000 for 
the subsidy appropriation of the Export-Import Bank as proposed 
by the House instead of $785,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

       Overseas Private Investment Corporation Non-Credit Account

      The conference agreement provides $35,000,000 for 
administrative expenses of the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation (OPIC) as proposed by the House instead of 
$31,500,000 as proposed by the Senate.

        Overseas Private Investment Corporation Program Account

      The conference agreement provides $24,000,000 for program 
expenses of OPIC as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$20,500,000 as proposed by the House.
      The managers have included language allowing OPIC to use 
the authorities of Section 234(g) of the Foreign Assistance Act 
of 1961 as proposed by the House, instead of repealing said 
subsection as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement 
also includes a general provision urging OPIC to establish 
within one year of enactment a maritime fund for the purpose of 
leveraging United States commercial maritime expertise to 
support international maritime projects.
      The managers on the part of the House request OPIC and 
the Department of State to take all necessary actions to 
protect the interests of American investors in Gaza supported 
by OPIC financing or insurance.
      Under Sec. 599E, authority is provided for OPIC to 
continue operations until November 1, 2000.

                  Funds Appropriated to the President

                      Trade and Development Agency

      The conference agreement appropriates $44,000,000 for the 
Trade and Development Agency as proposed by the House instead 
of $43,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                TITLE II--BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE

                  Agency for International Development

                Child Survival and Disease Programs Fund

      The conference agreement appropriates $715,000,000 for 
the Child Survival and Disease Programs Fund instead of 
$685,000,000 as proposed by the House. The Senate bill 
contained no provisionon this matter, but included funds for 
these activities under ``Development Assistance''. The managers agree 
with and endorse House Report No. 106-254 regarding the use of funds 
appropriated under this heading, including $110,000,000 for a grant to 
UNICEF for programs consistent with the purpose of the Child Survival 
and Disease Programs Fund. The grant for UNICEF does not preclude AID 
from providing additional funding for specific UNICEF projects as may 
be appropriate. The managers have been assured that the success of the 
polio eradication program is likely to result in a significantly lower 
requirement for this effort in future years. The managers have included 
$35,000,000 for a special initiative to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa and 
India. This is in addition to the $145,000,000 provided in this Fund 
and elsewhere in the bill for ongoing HIV/AIDS programs. At least 
$10,000,000 additionally is designated for children affected by the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic.
      In implementing programs, projects, and activities to 
combat infectious diseases, including long-standing programs 
relating to malaria and measles, as well as the more recent 
emphasis on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, surveillance, and anti-
microbial resistance, the conferees expect AID to continue to 
consult closely with the Appropriations Committees, the Centers 
for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, and 
other relevant agencies involved in international health 
issues. In addition to the increase for HIV/AIDS, funding for 
AID's other infectious disease programs should exceed the 
fiscal year 1999 level. The managers also direct AID to provide 
the Committees with a detailed report not later than February 
15, 2000, on the programs, projects, and activities undertaken 
by the Child Survival and Disease Programs Fund during fiscal 
year 1999.
      The managers strongly encourage AID to reserve funds from 
the Child Survival and Disease Programs Fund for the 
establishment of a Global Infectious Diseases Reserve. The 
Reserve is intended to provide a mechanism for rapid and 
flexible response to initiate or expand a limited number of 
programs in developing countries with high potential to respond 
to infectious disease outbreaks that threaten more than one 
region and to serve as seed money to attract other donors and 
partners.
      The global health threat from tuberculosis is another 
priority for the funds provided in this Act. Because of 
difficulties encountered in implementing tuberculosis language 
accompanying last year's Act, the managers welcome AID's 
proposal to allocate $3,000,000 in fiscal year 2000 to 
tuberculosis control programs in Mexico, with an emphasis on 
cost-sharing with Mexico on programs that focus on Mexico's 
border states.
      In addition to increasing support for tuberculosis 
control worldwide, the managers urge AID to contribute up to 
$5,000,000 toward the effort led by the Atlanta-based Carter 
Center to eradicate illness caused by the African guinea worm.
      The managers are aware that significant new private 
resources are now available to augment AID's immunization 
programs, and commend the partners in this effort.
      The managers are working with the General Accounting 
Office and experts from the public and private sectors to 
consider options for Congress to address childhood vaccine 
shortfalls in developing countries. The managers encourage AID 
to lend its support to this initiative.
      The managers direct that core child survival activities 
focus on effective interventions to reduce infant mortality 
during the first month of life through activities that focus on 
the health and nutrition needs of pregnant women and new 
mothers, a vital aspect of child survival that has not yet 
attracted sufficient private funds. The managers also support 
expansion of core child survival programs in Africa.
      The managers will consider the use of not more than three 
percent of the amount provided for the Child Survival and 
Disease Programs Fund in countries funded under SEED and 
FREEDOM Support Act authorities. In particular, the managers 
urge AID to provide up to $2,000,000 to support non-
governmental organizations that work with older orphans, 
including those with cognitive disabilities and mild mental 
retardation, to teach life and job skills. The conference 
agreement also continues existing limitations on the use of the 
Fund for non-project assistance.
      The managers note that Morehouse School of Medicine is 
establishing an International Center for Health and 
Development. This center will be dedicated to forming local and 
international partnerships to address the health problems that 
are devastating Africa today. The conferees encourage AID to 
provide assistance for these efforts.

                         Development Assistance

                     (including transfer of funds)

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,228,000,000 for 
``Development Assistance'' instead of $1,201,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $1,928,500,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The Senate included funding for the ``Child Survival 
and Disease Programs Fund'' under its ``Development 
Assistance'' account.
      The conference agreement appropriates up to $5,000,000 
for the Inter-American Foundation from funds made available 
under this heading and up to $14,400,000 directly to the 
African Development Foundation, as proposed in the House bill. 
The Senate amendment provided authority to transfer funds from 
this account to the Inter-American Foundation, but did not 
specify an amount. Also, the Senate amendment provided 
$12,500,000 for the African Development Foundation. Section 586 
of the conference agreement provides the President with the 
authority to abolish the Inter-American Foundation during 
fiscal year 2000. The managers note that the funding level 
provided for the Inter-American Foundation is sufficient for 
meeting existing grant, contract, and lease obligations and to 
wind up any other outstanding affairs of the Foundation.
      The conference agreement continues current law regarding 
certain requirements on quotas and numerical targets for family 
planning providers participating in voluntary family planning 
projectsthat are funded through the ``Development Assistance'' 
account, as included in the House bill. The Senate amendment did not 
address this matter.
      The conference agreement also includes House language 
providing that $2,500,000 may be transferred from this account 
to the ``International Organizations and Programs'' account for 
a contribution to the International Fund for Agricultural 
Development (IFAD). The Senate amendment included similar 
language. The managers recognize the need for the type of 
expertise IFAD offers; therefore, the managers affirm the House 
and Senate support for continued United States contributions to 
IFAD. The Administration is expected to consult with the 
Appropriations Committees regarding IFAD's future resource 
requirements.
      The conference agreement continues current law which 
prohibits funds from being made available for any activity in 
contravention of the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) as proposed by 
the House. The Senate bill did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement includes language from the 
Senate amendment not in the House bill that provides not to 
exceed $25,000, in addition to funds otherwise made available 
for such purposes, to monitor and provide oversight for 
assistance programs for displaced and orphan children and 
victims of war.
      The conference agreement does not include bill language 
in the Senate amendment mandating a specific sum for the 
International Law Institute. The managers continue to be 
concerned by the lack of adherence to the rule of law in the 
Independent States. Therefore, the managers direct that 
$250,000 shall be made available to the International Law 
Institute to continue its training and support of lawyers and 
judges in the Independent States.
      The managers encourage AID to support the Financial 
Services Volunteer Corps (FSVC), which contributes to the 
process of building sound financial infrastructure in countries 
that are seeking to develop transparent, market-oriented 
economies. FSVC, as a not-for-profit organization, leverages 
its funding resources with expert volunteers from the U.S. 
financial services community to provide assistance that is 
objective, independent and free of commercial interest.
      The conference agreement provides that not less than 
$500,000 should be made available for support of the United 
States Telecommunications Training Institute. The Senate 
amendment included bill language mandating that such funds be 
made available for this purpose. The House bill did not address 
this matter.
      The conference agreement includes language similar to a 
provision in the Senate amendment that requires that not less 
than 50 percent of the funds made available for the 
Microenterprise Initiative should be made available for loans 
of $300 or less for very poor people, particularly women, or 
for institutional support of organizations primarily engaged in 
making such loans. The House bill contained a similar provision 
which continued existing law.

                              agriculture

      The conference agreement does not contain language from 
the Senate amendment regarding the minimum level of funding for 
agriculture programs. However, the managers remain concerned 
about the decline in AID funding for international agriculture 
activities and recommend at least $305,000,000 be provided for 
such programs in fiscal year 2000. Further, the managers note 
that both House Report No. 106-254 and Senate Report No. 106-81 
signal the deep concern for the level of funding provided for 
international agricultural development. In addition, the 
managers support the language in House Report No. 106-254 
regarding funding levels for the Collaborative Research Support 
Programs (CRSPs). Prior to the submission of the report 
required by section 653 of the Foreign Assistance Act, AID is 
directed to consult with the Committees on Appropriations 
regarding the proposed allocation of sector resources, 
including those intended for agriculture and for the CRSPs.

                         rural electrification

      The managers endorse Senate Report No. 106-81 regarding 
rural electrification as a key component of development. The 
managers recommend AID provide not less than $5,000,000 in 
fiscal year 2000 for rural electrification in Guatemala, El 
Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. Further, the managers 
recommend that AID provide $3,000,000 for the Republic of 
Georgia to assist rural electric cooperatives in rehabilitation 
and privatization efforts.

                  aid global programs and biodiversity

      The managers note the positive role AID's central offices 
and mechanisms can serve in providing policy and technical 
support in critical areas such as economic growth, energy, 
agriculture, biodiversity, democracy and women in development. 
The managers endorse House Report No. 106-254 on global issues 
such as these, and encourage AID to adequately fund these 
central offices and mechanisms. To ensure that the Committees' 
priorities are addressed in a timely manner, the managers 
direct AID to provide, within 30 days of enactment of this Act, 
a brief written report to the Appropriations Committees on its 
planned fiscal year 2000 allocation of funds to the central 
offices in the Global Bureau.
      The conference agreement does not include a Senate 
provision regarding the proportion of funds utilized in support 
of biodiversity. The managers continue to believe that 
protecting biodiversity and tropical forests in developing 
countries is critical to the global environment and U.S. 
economic prosperity, especially for the agricultural and 
pharmaceutical industries. The managers note that House Report 
No. 106-254 and Senate Report No. 106-81 recognize the slight 
increase in AID biodiversity funding in fiscal year 1999, but 
remain concerned that the proportion of development assistance 
allocated for biodiversity activities remains less than the 
amount provided five years ago. Therefore, the managers direct 
AID to restore overall biodiversity funding as well as funding 
to the Office of Environment and Natural Resources to levels 
that reflect the proportion of funding of development 
assistance provided in fiscal year 1995.

                          education in africa

      The managers recognize that providing increased 
educational opportunities, including at the doctoral level, is 
a key component of development efforts in Africa. The managers 
are aware of AID's minority-serving institution initiative and 
commend the agency for engaging Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCU) in its program for Africa. Consistent with 
these efforts, the managers encourage AID to consider up to 
$700,000 for the implementation of a distance education 
doctoral degree initiative in collaboration with an HBCU that 
can offer advanced training in the areas of educational 
leadership, pharmacy, environmental sciences and engineering.

                 american schools and hospitals abroad

      The conference agreement does not contain Senate language 
requiring that not less than $15,000,000 shall be available 
only for the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad (ASHA) 
program. However, the managers direct the Agency for 
International Development to fully uphold its commitment to the 
Appropriations Committees to obligate at least $15,000,000 for 
the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program in fiscal 
year 2000. It is the intention of the managers that the 
increase in funding for the Lebanon country program (addressed 
below under the heading ``Lebanon'') should not result in a 
decrease in funding that has been traditionally allocated to 
Lebanese educational institutions through the American Schools 
and Hospitals Abroad program provided under ``Development 
Assistance''.

                     patrick leahy war victims fund

      The conferees direct $12,000,000 for medical, orthopedic, 
and related rehabilitative and preventive assistance for war 
victims, particularly those who have been severely disabled 
from landmines and other unexploded ordnance. Of this amount, 
up to $10,000,000 is to be funded from the ``Development 
Assistance'' account and the ``Economic Support Fund''. The 
balance should be funded from Office of Transition Initiatives 
resources, and with funds from the demining budget of the 
``Nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining and related 
programs'' account.
      The managers note the great needs, especially for 
children, in Sierra Leone for medical, orthopedic, and related 
rehabilitative services as a result of civil war. The managers 
direct that not less than $750,000 from this account be used 
for programs such as those carried out by UNICEF and other 
international organizations and non-governmental organizations 
with experience in addressing such needs.
      As in previous years, the managers expect that any such 
programs to assist war victims should be designed and 
implemented in consultation with AID's manager of the Leahy War 
Victims Fund.

                                 Cyprus

      The conference agreement includes language from the 
Senate amendment that provides that not less than $15,000,000 
shall be made available for Cyprus to be used only for 
scholarships, administrative support of the scholarship 
program, bicommunal projects, and measures aimed at 
reunification of the island and designed to reduce tensions and 
promote peace and cooperation between the two communities on 
Cyprus. Funds are to be derived from ``Development Assistance'' 
and ``Economic Support Fund''. The House bill did not contain a 
provision on this matter.

                                Lebanon

      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that from the Senate amendment that provides that not less than 
$15,000,000 of the funds appropriated under ``Development 
Assistance'' and ``Economic Support Fund'' should be made 
available for Lebanon to be used, among other purposes, for 
scholarships and direct support of the American educational 
institutions in Lebanon. The Senate language is identical to 
the conference agreement, except it would have required the 
allocation of these funds. The House bill did not address this 
matter.
      The increase of $3,000,000 for Lebanon is being provided 
for the direct support of the American educational institutions 
in that country. It is the intention of the managers that the 
increase in funding for the Lebanon country program should not 
result in a decrease in funding that has been traditionally 
allocated to Lebanese educational institutions through the 
American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program provided under 
``Development Assistance''.

                                 Burma

      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that from the Senate amendment that provides that, of the funds 
made available under ``Development Assistance'', ``Child 
Survival and Disease Programs Fund'', and ``Economic Support 
Fund'', not less than $6,500,000 shall be made available to 
support democracy activitiesin Burma, democracy and 
humanitarian activities along the Burma-Thailand border, and for 
Burmese student groups and other organizations located outside Burma. 
These funds are to be made available notwithstanding any other 
provision of law and shall be subject to the regular notification 
procedures of the Committees on Appropriations, as proposed by the 
Senate. Language proposed by the Senate that would have allocated not 
less than $800,000 of these funds for certain specified activities is 
not included, nor is language providing that funds made available under 
this heading shall be subject to consultation and guidelines provided 
by the leadership of the Burmese government elected in 1990.
      The House bill did not address this matter.

                                Cambodia

      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the Senate that would have prohibited funds for the 
Central Government of Cambodia until the Secretary of State 
determines and reports to the Committees on Appropriations and 
the Committee on Foreign Relations that the Government of 
Cambodia has established a tribunal consistent with the 
requirements of international law and justice and including the 
participation of international jurists and prosecutors for the 
trial of those who committed genocide or crimes against 
humanity and that the Government of Cambodia is making 
significant progress in establishing an independent and 
accountable judicial system, a professional military 
subordinate to civilian control, and a neutral and accountable 
police force. The funding restriction proposed by the Senate 
would not have applied to demining and other humanitarian 
programs.
      The House did not address this matter under title II. The 
House provision on Cambodia, section 573 of the House bill, is 
included in modified form in the conference report under title 
V.

                             Southeast Asia

      The conference agreement does not include reservations of 
specific minimum funding allocations for Indonesia as proposed 
by the Senate. The House bill did not address this matter.
      The managers support the highest possible level of 
assistance to promote the economic recovery of the Philippines, 
Thailand, and Indonesia from the Asian financial crisis. 
Effective support for private investment, better governance, 
and less corruption in these countries should be given a higher 
priority in development assistance and Economic Support Fund 
allocation decisions. The Accelerated Economic Recovery in Asia 
and United States-Asia Environmental Partnership programs 
should be augmented by specific efforts to retain existing 
major United States private sector investments in the region, 
especially in the infrastructure sector. The renewed security 
relationship between the Philippines and the United States 
provides additional justification for increased support to that 
country.
      The managers encourage support for the democratic 
transition now underway in Indonesia. The managers recognize 
that humanitarian and economic assistance from many nations 
will be needed to enable East Timor to recover from the 
violence and destruction perpetrated by anti-independence 
forces following the referendum of August 30, 1999. The 
recovery of East Timor will also depend on the cooperation of 
its Indonesian neighbors. The conference agreement provides 
that not less than $25,000,000 from the ``Economic Support 
Fund'' account should be made available for a United States 
contribution to the recovery of East Timor.
      The managers suggest a modest program of assistance for 
the people of Vietnam, mostly for humanitarian activities. The 
managers urge AID to work with the U.S. Embassy to support a 
safety awareness campaign in Vietnam to reverse the increase in 
preventable accidents, especially those affecting children.
      The managers continue to be concerned about the status of 
religious groups in Vietnam. The Secretary of State is 
requested to report to the Committees on Appropriations not 
later than six months after enactment of this Act on the extent 
to which the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is facilitating the 
following: (1) the operation of independent churches; (2) the 
return of church properties confiscated since 1974; (3) visits 
to the Supreme Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of 
Vietnam by a delegation of American religious leaders and 
medical doctors; and (4) participation of democracy and human 
rights advocates in United States education and cultural 
exchange programs.

                           Conservation Fund

      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
from the Senate amendment mandating $500,000 from ``Development 
Assistance'' for the Charles Darwin Research Station and the 
Charles Darwin Foundation. The House bill did not address this 
matter.
      The managers direct that $500,000 be provided from 
``Development Assistance'' for research, training, and related 
activities to support conservation efforts in the Galapagos. 
Because AID has made plans to sustain a commitment to the 
Galapagos, the managers expect fiscal year 2000 to be the final 
year for congressional mandates.

                          Conflict Resolution

      The conference agreement does not include Senate language 
earmarking $1,000,000 from ``Economic Support Fund'', 
``Development Assistance'', and ``Assistance for Eastern Europe 
and the Baltic States'' accounts to support conflict resolution 
programs. However, the managers urge the State Department and 
AID to support such programs where appropriate. The managers 
especially commend Seeds of Peace, a widely respected 
organization which promotes understanding between Arab and 
Israeli teenagers, and Turkish and Greek Cypriot teenagers, and 
direct the Agency for International Development to provide up 
to $861,000 to Seeds of Peace in fiscal year 2000.

                  Private and Voluntary Organizations

      The conference agreement includes language from the House 
bill providing that funds appropriated for development 
assistance should be available to private and voluntary 
organizations at a level which is at least equivalent to the 
level provided in fiscal year 1995. The Senate amendment 
included similar language.

                   International Disaster Assistance

      The conference agreement appropriates $202,880,000 for 
``International Disaster Assistance'' instead of $200,880,000 
as proposed by the House and $175,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The managers note that Congress provided $388,000,000 
for this account in fiscal year 1999, including $188,000,000 in 
emergency supplemental funds, and that AID expects to carry 
over into fiscal year 2000 the unobligated fiscal year 1999 
balances. Further, the managers note that section 492(b) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act provides the President with the 
authority to obligate up to $50,000,000 from other assistance 
accounts in order to provide disaster assistance, if necessary.
      The conference agreement requires greater accountability 
on disaster assistance funds utilized in support of AID's 
Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). OTI activities have 
been effective in many countries, but the managers are 
increasingly concerned that scarce emergency disaster aid may 
be unavailable due to longer-term OTI commitments. Therefore, 
the conference agreement requires that AID submit a report to 
the Appropriations Committees not less than five days prior to 
initiating an OTI program in a country in which OTI did not 
operate in fiscal year 1999. The managers believe this 
reporting requirement will help ensure that the Appropriations 
Committees receive timely information regarding the nature of 
OTI programs so they can better evaluate these transition 
activities in the future.
      The managers note that OTI may utilize funds from other 
development and economic accounts in addition to the Disaster 
Assistance account and expect AID to report on the country 
allocations of all funds under OTI management in the annual 
report required under section 653 of the Foreign Assistance Act 
beginning in fiscal year 2000.

         Micro and Small Enterprise Development Program Account

      The conference agreement continues existing law regarding 
the level of guarantees provided in support of micro and small 
enterprise activities. The Senate amendment proposed making the 
guarantee level permanent law.

             Urban and Environmental Credit Program Account

      The conference agreement provides $1,500,000 for subsidy 
budget authority for the Urban and Environmental Credit program 
as proposed by the Senate. In addition, the conference 
agreement appropriates $5,000,000 for administrative expenses 
as proposed by the House, instead of $4,000,000 as proposed by 
the Senate.

              Development Credit Authority Program Account

      The conference agreement provides up to $3,000,000 for 
the cost of loans and loan guarantees for AID's Development 
Credit Authority (DCA) from funds transferred from existing 
development and economic accounts administered by AID. Up to 
$500,000 of this amount may be transferred to and merged with 
AID's ``Operating Expenses'' account. The managers urge that 
programs in the Russian Far East be given priority. The House 
bill did not provide authority for a development credit 
program. The Senate amendment provided $7,500,000 for this 
purpose.
      The managers recognize the serious effort made by the 
Administration during the past two fiscal years to guarantee 
the financial integrity of the DCA, including the establishment 
of a credit review board to approve individual DCA loan and 
loan guarantee projects. However, the managers continue to be 
concerned about the larger development policy implications of 
AID conducting new loan and guarantee programs. Given the 
significant problems developing nations have experienced in 
repaying existing U.S. loans and the subsequent rescheduling 
and cancellation of these debts, the managers urge caution in 
extending new loans and guarantees.

     Operating Expenses of the Agency for International Development

      The conference agreement appropriates $520,000,000 
instead of $495,000,000 as proposed by the Senate and 
$479,950,000 as proposed by the House. The conference agreement 
does not include language proposed by the Senate to extend the 
availability of these funds until September 30, 2001. Also, the 
conference agreement does not provide $1,500,000 from Operating 
Expenses for the purchase of land in northern India as proposed 
by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar provision.
      The conference agreement prohibits the use of funds in 
this account to finance the construction or long-term lease of 
offices for use by AID unless the administrator of AID reports 
in writing to the Appropriations Committees at least 15 days 
prior to the obligation of funds for such purposes. This 
reporting requirement applies only when the total cost of 
construction (including architect and engineering services), 
purchase, or lease commitment, exceeds $1,000,000. The House 
bill and the Senate amendment contained similar provisions.
      The managers expect that $15,000,000 from this account 
will be used only for costs associated with construction of a 
new AID mission in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, as requested by the 
President in a budget amendment submitted to Congress on 
September 21, 1999, or for other overseas physical security 
requirements of the agency. Further, the managers endorse House 
Report No. 106-254 which directs AID to report to the 
Committees on Appropriations on the agency's long-term physical 
security needs around the world.

                  Other Bilateral Economic Assistance

                         Economic Support Fund

      The conference agreement appropriates $2,345,500,000 
instead of $2,227,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$2,195,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. In addition, it 
provides not less than $960,000,000 for Israel and not less 
than $735,000,000 for Egypt as proposed by the Senate instead 
of not to exceed $960,000,000 for Israel and not to exceed 
$735,000,000 for Egypt as proposed by the House. The conference 
agreement also includes language providing that not less than 
$200,000,000 of the funds appropriated for Egypt shall be used 
for Commodity Import Program assistance as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement also includes language providing 
that not less than $150,000,000 should be provided for Jordan 
as proposed by the Senate. The House bill did not address this 
matter.
      The conference agreement also includes Senate language 
providing that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, not 
to exceed $11,000,000 may be used to support victims of and 
programs related to the Holocaust. The House bill did not 
address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include language from 
the Senate amendment, not in the House bill, that would have 
prohibited funds appropriated under this heading from being 
made available to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development 
Organization.
      The conference agreement also includes language that, 
notwithstanding any other provision of law, $1,000,000 shall be 
made available to nongovernmental organizations located outside 
of the People's Republic of China to support activities which 
preserve cultural traditions and promote sustainable 
development and environmental conservation in Tibetan 
communities in that country. The managers are aware of the 
important work of the Bridge Fund in this regard, and strongly 
support funding for this organization.
      Senate language under this heading that authorized 
$10,000,000 for activities for Iraqi opposition groups is 
addressed under title V of the conference report.
      The managers strongly support assistance programs for 
Yemen and urge the Department of State and the Agency for 
International Development to maintain and, if possible, enhance 
such programs.
      The managers recognize the critical importance that water 
and energy policies play in the implementation of the Wye River 
Accord. Therefore they reiterate the support expressed in the 
House and Senate reports for the desertification program for 
the Middle East and southern Mediterranean proposed by San 
Diego State University. The managers also support the Middle 
East Water and Energy Resource Institute's program to provide 
technical assistance and conduct research and education 
programs coordinated through the International Arid Lands 
Consortium.
      The conference agreement includes language stating that 
not less than $25,000,000 should be made available for 
assistance for East Timor.
      The managers direct that $5,000,000 in funding from this 
account be used to support the activities authorized under the 
Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Program Act of 1998 
(Public Law 105-319).
      The managers direct $2,000,000 to support the 
demobilization of the Estado Mayor Presidencial in Guatemala.

                     International Fund for Ireland

      The conference agreement appropriates $19,600,000 for the 
International Fund for Ireland, as proposed by the House. The 
Senate amendment did not address this matter.
      The conferees encourage the International Fund for 
Ireland (IFI) to consider direct funding of locally-based 
organizations dedicated to attracting investment to their 
municipalities and regions. In doing so, the conferees believe 
the IFI will further its goals of increasing domestic and 
international interest in continued cooperation and stability.

          Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States

      The conference agreement appropriates $535,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $393,000,000 as proposed by 
the House.
      The conference agreement also includes language stating 
that $150,000,000 should be provided for Kosova. The Senate 
amendment had provided for six country earmarks which are not 
included in the conference agreement. The House bill did not 
address this matter.
      The conference agreement also includes language that 
prohibits funds for Kosova until the Secretary of State 
certifies that the resources pledged by the United States at 
the upcoming Kosova donors conference shall not exceed 15 
percent of the total resources pledged by all donors. In 
addition, language has been included stating that funds for 
Kosova shall not be made available for large scale physical 
infrastructure reconstruction.
      In addition, the conference report includes Senate 
language that provides not more than $130,000,000 for Bosnia 
and Herzegovina from the funds appropriated under this account 
and under ``International Narcotics Control and Law 
Enforcement'' and ``Economic Support Fund''. The House bill did 
not address this matter.
      The conference agreement also includes House language 
prohibiting funds from being used for new housing construction 
or repair or reconstruction of existing housing in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina unless directly related to the efforts of United 
States troops to promote peace in said country. The Senate 
amendment did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement also includes language from the 
House bill that applies the provisions of section 532 
(``Separate Accounts'') to all funds provided under this 
heading, rather than just to funds made available for Bosnia 
and Herzegovina as proposed by the Senate. In addition, it 
includes language proposed by the House that authorizes the 
President to withhold funds for economic reconstruction 
programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina if he certifies that the 
Bosnian Federation is not complying with requirements in the 
Dayton Peace Accord to remove foreign forces, and has not 
terminated intelligence cooperation with Iranian officials. The 
Senate amendment did not address this matter.

                     romanian children and orphans

      The managers direct that up to $4,400,000 be provided for 
emergency aid for the child victims of the present economic 
crisis in Romania. The program should be administered through, 
or in close coordination with, the Romanian Department of Child 
Protection. It should focus on supplemental food support and 
maintenance, support for in-home foster care, and supplemental 
support for special needs residential care.

    Assistance for the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union

      The conference agreement appropriates $839,000,000 
instead of $725,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$780,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The word ``New'' is 
deleted from the heading, as proposed by the House. The 
managers have included a ceiling on management costs for 
nuclear safety activities as proposed by the Senate and a 
limitation of 25 percent on the percentage of funds (other than 
for nonproliferation and disarmament programs) that may be 
allocated for any single country as proposed by the House.
      The managers also encourage the Coordinator and AID to 
move as rapidly as possible to implement programs that focus on 
the social transition in the region as it affects ordinary 
citizens, to reward reform-oriented countries such as Moldova 
and Kyrgystan, and to accelerate the focus on regional efforts 
in reform-oriented secondary cities in Russia, Ukraine, and 
Kazakhstan.

                              russia-iran

      The conference agreement continues the current 
restrictions on assistance to the Government of the Russian 
Federation as long as Russian enterprises and institutes 
continue to collaborate with Iran to increase Iranian 
capability to develop and deploy nuclear and ballistic missile 
technology. The managers agree that assistance to combat 
infectious diseases, child survival and non-proliferation 
activities, support for regional and municipal governments, and 
partnerships between United States hospitals, universities, 
judicial training institutions and environmental organizations 
and counterparts in Russia should not be affected by this 
subsection.

           expanded nonproliferation and security cooperation

      The managers note that $241,000,000 from this account was 
requested by the President for threat reduction activities in 
the former Soviet Union. The managers encourage the 
Administration to provide the Foundation established by section 
511 of the FREEDOM Support Act not less than the $23,500,000 
requested for this purpose.
      The managers request that the Coordinator for Assistance 
to the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union provide 
written reports on the allocation, obligation, and disbursement 
of appropriations during fiscal year 2000 for expanded 
nonproliferation and security cooperation from this and prior 
year acts not later than December 15, 1999, March 15, 2000, and 
July 15, 2000. The reports should, at a minimum, compare the 
allocation and obligation of funds by project, activity, and 
country with comparable data contained in the April 1999 
justification documents subsequently provided to the 
Committees, and explain in detail any circumstances that 
resulted in reductions or other changes from the original 
justification.
      The managers are concerned that none of the assistance 
provided to Russia for security cooperation be used for the 
benefit of military units credibly reported to be engaged in 
combat activities against civilian populations in the Northern 
Caucasus region of the Russian Federation. The Secretary of 
State is requested to inform the Committees in writing of steps 
taken to prevent United States assistance benefiting such units 
of the armed forces of the Russian Federation.

                   maternal and infant health crisis

      The conference agreement sets aside $14,700,000 from 
funds provided under this title for maternal and infant health 
programs to begin the process of addressing the demographic 
crisis in Russia and the other independent states.

                            russian far east

      The conference agreement includes new language providing 
not less than $20,000,000 for the Russian Far East. This matter 
was not addressed in the House bill or the Senate amendment. 
Under the heading ``Development Credit Authority'' in title II, 
the managers also directed that additional funds be made 
available to stimulate ventures in the Russian Far East led by 
American firms with expertise in primary industries, including 
natural resource development, telecommunications and basic 
infrastructure, finance, and consumer goods.

                        southern caucasus region

      The managers support regional cooperation efforts among 
the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, including 
United States efforts through the Caucasus Cooperation Forum. 
To further regional cooperation, the conference agreement 
continues the current six exemptions from the statutory 
restrictions on assistance to the Government of Azerbaijan. The 
managers include a requirement that 15 percent of the funds 
available for the Southern Caucasus region be used for 
confidence-building measures and other activities related to 
the resolution of regional conflicts instead of 17.5 percent as 
proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement includes a provision that not 
less than 12.92 percent of the funds under this heading be made 
available for Georgia and not less than 12.2 percent for 
Armenia. Similar language was proposed by the Senate but not 
included in the House bill. The managers are concerned that 
little progress has been made to improve conditions in the 
regions of Armenia affected by the 1988 earthquake. The 
conferees direct the Coordinator and AID to allocate up to 
$15,000,000 to support recovery and economic reconstruction 
initiatives in the regions most severely affected. In addition, 
at least $25,000,000 of the funds made available for Georgia 
should be obligated for border security and law enforcement 
training.
      The managers continue to support funding of the judicial 
reform initiatives in Georgia, but are aware of concerns 
regarding thelegal rights of Loren Wille, an American working 
for Catholic Relief Services who was recently arrested in Georgia. The 
conferees urge the State Department to use the influence of the United 
States to ensure fairness and transparency in the treatment of Mr. 
Wille, and request a report from the Department no later than December 
1, 1999, on the extent to which Mr. Wille's rights have been respected 
during the Georgian judicial process.

                                ukraine

      The managers include bill language that $180,000,000 
should be made available for Ukraine instead of a mandatory 
$210,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The managers recommend 
$25,000,000 for nuclear safety programs in Ukraine and up to 
$10,000,000 for regional initiatives that include industrial 
study tours, technology business incubators, and community 
based telecommunications projects. The conference agreement 
does not include any provision withholding funds for Ukraine as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate language 
regarding the destruction of stockpiles of landmines in 
Ukraine. However, the managers strongly support the elimination 
of some 10 million mines stockpiled in Ukraine and Moldova that 
could otherwise be exported to areas of conflict and cause 
egregious harm to innocent civilians. The managers intend and 
expect that of the funds made available in this Act for Ukraine 
and Moldova, $5,000,000 will be contributed to a multinational 
effort to destroy these landmines and similar munitions.

                       russian leadership program

      The conference agreement includes new language providing 
an additional $10,000,000 to carry out the Russian Leadership 
Program enacted on May 21, 1999. The statutory authority is 
modified to extend the pilot program administered by the 
Library of Congress for 1 year and to postpone transfer of the 
program to the Executive branch by 1 year.

                            russian orphans

      The conferees strongly support AID's new strategy for 
addressing the needs of Russian orphans and concur with the 
House report language on this matter. The managers are 
concerned about the immediate needs of orphans in some of the 
most economically disadvantaged parts of the Russian 
Federation, such as Magadan. The conferees encourage AID to 
supplement its orphan strategy by identifying reform-minded and 
committed orphanage and child welfare officials in those 
regions and developing a program to improve the basic 
conditions of orphans there.

                           medical assistance

      The conference agreement does not include a Senate 
earmark for Carelift International. However, the managers are 
aware that large amounts of used high-technology medical 
equipment no longer needed by American hospitals can be put to 
good use in the former Soviet Union and other regions unable to 
afford high-technology medical equipment. Carelift 
International and other organizations provide such equipment 
and provide training on its proper use and maintenance. The 
conferees expect AID to support such private initiatives in its 
social transition strategy for the Independent States and 
Central Europe and direct that $3,000,000 be made available to 
Carelift International upon receipt of a detailed proposal.

                                mongolia

      The conference agreement retains authority for funds 
provided under this heading to be used in Mongolia. The amount 
provided for Mongolia from this heading is $6,000,000. The 
remainder of the amount requested is to be made available from 
other accounts in title II of this Act, including not less than 
$750,000 for child survival activities.

                           Independent Agency

                              Peace Corps

      The conference agreement appropriates $245,000,000 
instead of $240,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$220,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                          Department of State

          International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement

      The conference agreement appropriates $305,000,000 
instead of $285,000,000 as proposed by the House for 
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement. The Senate 
amendment proposed $215,000,000.
      The conference agreement does not include the ceiling of 
$20,000,000 on anti-crime activities within the account as 
proposed by the House. However, the agreement does require that 
all anti-crime programs are subject to the regular notification 
procedures of the Committees on Appropriations.
      The conference agreement contains House language allowing 
the Department of State to utilize section 608 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act to receive excess property from other U.S. 
federal agencies for use in a foreign country. The Senate 
amendment did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement provides that not less than 
$10,000,000 should be available for Law Enforcement Training 
and Demand Reduction, which is similar to the Senate amendment. 
The House did not address this matter. The managers urge up to 
$4,000,000 of this amount be for demand reduction programs.
      The conference agreement contains $5,000,000 to establish 
and operate the International Law Enforcement Academy for the 
Western Hemisphere at Roswell, New Mexico as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill did not address this matter. Given the 
proximity of the United States to Latin America, it is 
appropriate for such a center to be located in the United 
States. The managers are frustrated by the Department of 
State's seeming unwillingness to cooperate in this matter and 
direct the Department to establish the training center at 
Roswell.
      The conference agreement does not contain a Senate 
amendment providing not less than $10,000,000 for mycoherbicide 
counter drug research and development. The House did not 
address this matter. However, the managers recognize that the 
development of plant pathogens which are capable of destroying 
illicit drug crops, including opium poppy, coca and marijuana, 
offer a potential weapon forUnited States counter-narcotics 
efforts. The managers understand that all current funding requirements 
have been met for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Consistent with the 
position taken in the fiscal year 1999 supplemental appropriations 
conference report, the managers recommend that the responsibility for 
this funding should be assumed by the Office of the National Drug 
Control Policy to support any additional future needs for counterdrug 
research and development for the following: mycoherbicide product 
research and development; narcotic crop eradication technologies; 
narcotic plant identification and biotechnology; worldwide narcotic 
crop identification; and alternative crop research and development.
      The managers are concerned about the deteriorating 
conditions in Colombia. In 1998, 308,000 Colombians were 
internally displaced and during the past decade 35,000 
Colombians have been killed in the violence between government 
forces, paramilitaries, and the FARC and ELN. The managers 
commend President Pastrana for his efforts to end this 
protracted conflict. The managers encourage the Department of 
State and other Executive agencies to continue their efforts to 
assist President Pastrana and the Colombian government toward a 
peaceful resolution of this conflict.
      The managers affirm House Report No. 106-254 and Senate 
Report No. 106-81 regarding counter-narcotics programs and 
encourage the Assistant Secretary of State for International 
Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement to develop a 
comprehensive proposal to upgrade helicopter lift capability 
for anti-drug operations in Latin America.
      Given the instability in the region, the managers have 
been concerned by the consistently low levels of support during 
the past several years provided to the Government of Ecuador in 
its efforts to stem the flow of drugs transiting through 
Ecuador from both Colombia and Peru. Therefore, the managers 
direct the State Department Bureau of International Narcotics 
Control and Law Enforcement to provide a report, 60 days after 
the date of enactment, on its revised plans to assist Ecuador 
in improving its counter-narcotics efforts. Further, the 
managers expect that all funds in this Act designed to support 
Ecuador's joint regional economic development program with Peru 
be informed in advance to the Committees on Appropriations.
      Because of budgetary limitations, $21,000,000 of the 
amount provided under this heading and $21,000,000 provided 
under the heading ``Migration and Refugee Assistance'' is 
withheld from obligation until September 30, 2000. Both 
programs were augmented by sizable supplemental appropriations 
during fiscal year 1999.

                    Migration and Refugee Assistance

      The conference agreement appropriates $625,000,000, 
instead of $640,000,000 as proposed by the House bill and 
$610,000,000 as proposed in the Senate amendment. The 
conference agreement makes available $13,800,000, as proposed 
in the House bill, for administrative expenses. The Senate 
amendment proposed $13,500,000.
      The conference agreement also includes Senate language, 
not included in the House bill, that provides not less than 
$60,000,000 for refugees from the former Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe and other refugees resettling in Israel.

     United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund

      The conference agreement appropriates $12,500,000 instead 
of $30,000,000 as proposed by the House and $20,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.

    Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs

      The conference agreement appropriates $216,600,000 
instead of $181,630,000 as proposed by the House and 
$175,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement also includes language proposed 
by the House, that was not in the Senate amendment, that 
authorizes a United States contribution to the Comprehensive 
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Preparatory Commission, and requires 
that the Secretary of State must inform the Committees on 
Appropriations at least 20 days prior to the obligation of 
funds for such Commission.
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that proposed by the Senate, that was not in the House bill, 
that provides that $40,000,000 should be used for demining, 
clearance of unexploded ordnance and related activities, and 
that not to exceed $500,000 may be used for related 
administrative expenses.
      The conference agreement does not include language from 
the Senate amendment that limited funding for the contribution 
to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to 
$40,000,000.
      Funding limitations affecting the Korean Peninsula 
Economic Development Organization (KEDO) are addressed under 
title V of this statement and accompanying conference report.
      The managers intend that funds appropriated under this 
heading be allocated as follows:

                        [In thousands of dollars]

                       Department of the Treasury

               International Affairs Technical Assistance

      Both the House and the Senate provided $1,500,000 for the 
International Affairs Technical Assistance program of the 
Department ofthe Treasury. The managers encourage the 
Administration to meet the requested level for this program by 
transferring funds to the Department of the Treasury from other funds 
appropriated in title II of this Act.

                           Debt Restructuring

      The conference agreement includes $123,000,000 of the 
$320,000,000 requested by the President on September 21, 1999, 
for bilateral debt restructuring instead of $33,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $43,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The $123,000,000 includes at least $13,000,000 for 
implementation of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act.
      The managers urge the Department of the Treasury to 
consider debt forgiveness for these countries only as a final 
option. Debt forgiveness reflects the inability of some nations 
to repay existing loans. This issue raises the urgent need to 
establish new benchmarks or conditions prior to initiating new 
lending. The managers expect that debt relief will be made 
available only to the poorest nations pursuing market-based 
economic reform and which commit to dedicate freed-up resources 
to improving health care, infrastructure, education and other 
pressing domestic needs. None of the funds in this account may 
be used to provide debt relief for any country that is engaged 
in offensive military action since any such relief would likely 
be used to facilitate the purchase of lethal weapons or to 
otherwise increase military expenditures.
      The managers urge caution regarding new lending within 
the next five years to governments benefiting from debt 
forgiveness. The managers anticipate that legislation detailing 
the actual implementation of proposed debt restructuring 
involving United States payment of debts owed by heavily 
indebted poor countries to international and multilateral 
financial institutions will have been enacted separately and 
hearings on the President's request of September 21, 1999, held 
by the Committees on Appropriations prior to consideration of 
additional appropriations for debt restructuring.
      The managers endorse language in House Report No. 106-254 
regarding reports to the Committees on Appropriations on the 
use of funds in this account and intend to work with the 
Treasury Department to ensure this information is made 
available to the Committees without undue burden on the 
Department.
      The managers expect that beginning with the fiscal year 
2001 budget submission, the value of debt relief provided in 
the previous fiscal year for each country will be reported to 
Congress in all relevant presentation documents and summary 
tables. Further, the managers encourage the Treasury Department 
to undertake a review of United States lending policies to 
nations considered for debt relief and request a report to the 
Committees on Appropriations not later than March 1, 2000, 
regarding future bilateral lending, including the conditions 
under which any new lending could take place.

       United States Community Adjustment and Investment Program

      The conference agreement appropriates $10,000,000 for the 
United States Community Adjustment and Investment Program, a 
domestic program affiliated with the North American Development 
Bank. The House bill and Senate amendment did not address this 
matter.

                     TITLE III--MILITARY ASSISTANCE

             International Military Education and Training

      The conference agreement appropriates $50,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $45,000,000 as proposed by 
the House. It also provides that up to $1,000,000 may remain 
available until expended as proposed by the House; the Senate 
amendment did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement also includes language proposed 
by the House that limits Guatemala and Indonesia to Expanded 
IMET only, and provides for regular notification procedures for 
funds allocated for Guatemala as proposed by the House. The 
Senate amendment would have limited Guatemala to Expanded IMET 
only, but did not address funding for Indonesia and did not 
require notification for Guatemala.
      The conference agreement also includes language from the 
House bill providing that funding for the School of the 
Americas is contingent upon a certification by the Secretary of 
Defense that the instruction provided by the School is fully 
consistent with training provided by the Department of Defense 
to United States military training students at U.S. military 
institutions. It also includes House language requiring a 
report by the Secretary of Defense on training activities at 
the School of the Americas during 1997 and 1998.
      The Senate amendment did not address these matters.

                   Foreign Military Financing Program

      The conference agreement appropriates $3,420,000,000 
instead of $3,470,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$3,410,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. In addition, it 
includes language proposed by the Senate that provides not less 
than $1,920,000,000 for grants for Israel and not less than 
$1,300,000,000 for grants for Egypt instead of not to exceed 
$1,920,000,000 for Israel and not to exceed $1,300,000,000 for 
Egypt as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement also includes language similar 
to that proposed by the Senate providing that not less than 
26.3 percent of the funds made available for Israel shall be 
available for procurement in Israel. The House bill included 
language stating that not to exceed $505,000,000 should be made 
available for such procurement.
      The conference agreement also includes House language 
providing that no Partnership for Peace funds may be made 
available to a non-NATO country except through the regular 
notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations. 
The Senate amendment did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the Senate that would have allowed direct loans to 
be converted to grants, and grants to direct loans. The House 
bill did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement provides not less than 
$3,000,000 in grant assistance for Tunisia and directs the 
drawdown of not less than $4,000,000 in defense articles, 
defense services, and military education and training. The 
Senate amendment would have directed $10,000,000 for Tunisia. 
The House bill did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement also includes language providing 
up to $1,000,000 for Ecuador, subject to the regular 
notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations.
      The conference agreement provides a ceiling of 
$30,495,000 for administrative expenses as proposed by the 
House instead of $30,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement also includes language directing 
that, forty-five days after enactment, the Secretary of Defense 
shall report to the Committees on Appropriations regarding an 
appropriate host institution to support and advance the efforts 
of the Defense Institute for International and Legal Studies in 
both legal and political education. The Senate amendment would 
have provided not less than $1,000,000 for the Defense 
Institute of International Studies for various activities under 
``International Military Education and Training''. The House 
bill did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement does not include an earmark of 
$5,000,000 for the Philippines. However, the managers are 
strongly supportive of efforts to increase defense cooperation 
with that nation and are aware the Administration provided 
$1,000,000 in grant funds for the Philippines in fiscal year 
1999.

                        Peacekeeping Operations

      The conference agreement appropriates $153,000,000 
instead of $76,500,000 as proposed by the House and $80,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate.

               TITLE IV--MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE

                  International Financial Institutions

                      Global Environment Facility

      The conference agreement appropriates $35,800,000 for the 
Global Environment Facility instead of $50,000,000 as proposed 
by the House and $25,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

       Contribution to the International Development Association

      The conference agreement appropriates $775,000,000 
instead of $776,600,000 as proposed by the Senate and 
$568,600,000 as proposed by the House.

      Contribution to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency

      The conference agreement appropriates $4,000,000 for 
paid-in capital issued by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee 
Agency instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
House bill did not include any appropriation for this purpose. 
Approval for subscription to the appropriate amount of callable 
capital is also included in the conference agreement.

       Contribution to the Inter-American Investment Corporation

      The conference agreement appropriates $16,000,000 in 
paid-in capital for the Inter-American Investment Corporation. 
The House bill and the Senate amendment did not contain any 
appropriation for this purpose.
      The Inter-American Investment Corporation began 
operations in 1989 to promote the economic development of its 
Latin American and Caribbean member countries through co-
financing and syndication, supporting security underwritings, 
and identifying joint venture partners for small and medium-
size private enterprises.

               Contribution to the Asian Development Fund

      The conference agreement appropriates $77,000,000 for the 
Asian Development Fund instead of $50,000,000 as proposed by 
the Senate and $100,000,000 as proposed by the House. The 
entire amount is for contributions previously due.
      The Committees anticipate providing in subsequent acts 
additional appropriations requested for the Asian Development 
Fund, with the understanding that the senior management of the 
Asian Development Bank fully implements its anti-corruption 
policy and finalizes its private sector and poverty alleviation 
strategies.

              Contribution to the African Development Bank

      The conference agreement appropriates $4,100,000 for 
paid-in capital issued by the African Development Bank instead 
of $5,100,000 as proposed by the Senate. The House bill did not 
include an appropriation for this purpose. Approval for 
subscription to $64,000,000 in callable capital is also 
included in the conference agreement. No later than February 
15, 2000, the Committees request the Secretary of the Treasury 
to provide an original, comprehensive evaluation of the 
financial outlook for the Bank, based on the appropriations 
provided in this Act. The evaluation may include such other 
assumptions that the Secretary may select and, as attachments, 
the most recent private credit evaluations of the Bank.

              Contribution to the African Development Fund

      The conference agreement appropriates $128,000,000 for 
the African Development Fund instead of $108,000,000 as 
proposed by the House. The Senate amendment did not include any 
appropriation for this purpose.

                International Organizations and Programs

      The conference agreement provides $183,000,000. The House 
bill appropriated $167,000,000 and the Senate amendment 
proposed $170,000,000.
      The conference agreement does not contain a provision in 
the House bill regarding the Climate Stabilization Fund. The 
Senate amendment did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement continues current law indicating 
that $5,000,000 should be made available for the World Food 
Program, which is similar to the Senate amendment. The House 
bill did not address this matter.

                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      (Note.--If House and Senate language is identical except 
for a different section number or minor technical differences, 
the section is not discussed in the Statement of Managers.)
Sec. 502. Prohibition of bilateral funding for international 
        institutions
      The conference agreement modifies existing law to 
prohibit funds from title II of this Act to be transferred by 
AID directly to an international financial institution for the 
purpose of repaying a foreign country's loan obligations, as 
proposed by the House. The Senate amendment made no change to 
existing law.
Sec. 509. Transfers between accounts
      The conference agreement deletes the requirement for the 
President to notify the Appropriations Committees, through 
their regular notification procedures, when exercising the 
transfer authority provided under the section.
Sec. 512. Limitation on assistance to countries in default
      The conference agreement ends the exemption for 
Nicaragua, Brazil, and Liberia from requirements under section 
620(q) of the Foreign Assistance Act and under this section 
regarding default on loans made by the U.S. This language is 
the same as the Senate amendment. The House bill retained the 
exemption for these countries.
Sec. 514. Surplus commodities
      The conference agreement deletes subsection (b) of the 
House general provision, as proposed by the Senate. This 
subsection would have required the Secretary of the Treasury to 
direct the U.S. executive directors of the international 
financial institutions to support the purchase of American 
produced agricultural commodities.
Sec. 515. Notification requirements
      The conference agreement deletes ``International Affairs 
Technical Assistance'' from the notification requirements under 
this section as proposed by the House.
Sec. 520. Special notification requirements
      The conference agreement adds ``Panama'' as proposed by 
the House bill to the list of countries subject to the special 
notification procedures of this section. The conference 
agreement does not include ``India'' as proposed in the Senate 
amendment.
Sec. 522. Child survival and disease prevention activities
      The conference agreement modifies existing law to clarify 
the intent of this section that allows AID to use $10,000,000 
appropriated under the ``Child Survival and Disease Programs 
Fund'' for technical experts from other government agencies, 
universities, and other institutions. Since Congress 
established a separate Child Survival and Disease Programs 
account in 1996, the previous language has been obsolete. The 
conference agreement is similar to the House provision, but 
includes new language regarding the use of up to $1,500,000 
from the ``Development Assistance'' account for technical 
experts.
Sec. 526. Democracy in China
      The conference agreement contains language from the House 
bill that authorizes the use of funds from ``Economic Support 
Fund'' for the support of nongovernmental organizations located 
outside of China for the support of democracy activities, and 
requires notification on the use of this authority. The Senate 
amendment did not address this matter.
      The conference agreement also allows for funding for the 
National Endowment for Democracy (NED) or its grantees 
notwithstanding any other provision of law and notwithstanding 
the first proviso of this section. The intent of this language 
is to allow for the continuation of a program promoting 
democratic village elections and for related activities that is 
currently being conducted by a NED grantee. It is not intended 
to provide authority for the initiation of major new programs 
in China.
      The conference agreement includes language that provides, 
notwithstanding any other provision of law that restricts 
assistance to foreign countries, $1,000,000 from the Economic 
Support Fund shall be made available to the Robert F. Kennedy 
Memorial Center for Human Rights for a project to disseminate 
information and support research about the People's Republic of 
China.
Sec. 537. Funding prohibition for Serbia
      The conference agreement includes House language that 
prohibits assistance for Serbia, except for aid to Kosova or 
Montenegro or to promote democracy. The Senate amendment did 
not address this matter.
Sec. 538. Special authorities
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the House that allows for funding from appropriations under 
title I for certain specified countries and activities, and for 
Montenegro, notwithstanding any other provision of law. The 
Senate amendment did not include these exemptions. It also 
includes language not in the House bill but in the Senate 
amendment that conditions assistance for Cambodia on the 
provisions of section 531(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961 and section 906 of the International Security and 
Development Cooperation Act of 1985.
      The conference agreement also includes House language 
that authorizes the President to waive for six months a 
provision of Public Law 100-204, if he determines and certifies 
that doing so is important to the national security interests 
of the United States. The Senate amendment did not address this 
matter.
Sec. 539. Policy on terminating the Arab League boycott of Israel
      The conference agreement contains House language on this 
matter. The Senate amendment did not include subsections (2) 
and (3) of the House general provision, dealing with the 
decision by the Arab League to reinstate the boycott in 1997, 
and calling on the League to immediately rescind its decision; 
and deleted language from subsection (4)(C) regarding a report 
on the specific steps that should be taken by the President to 
``expand the process of normalizing ties between Arab League 
countries and Israel''.
Sec. 540. Anti-narcotics activities
      The conference agreement contains House bill language 
waiving certain provisions of section 534 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act to allow for administration of justice programs 
in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Senate amendment 
contained a similar provision.
Sec. 541. Eligibility for assistance
      The conference agreement includes language regarding 
eligibility of assistance provided under this Act, as proposed 
by the House bill. The conference agreement does not include a 
modification, as proposed in the Senate amendment, regarding 
the prohibition on assistance to countries that violate 
internationally recognized human rights.
Sec. 544. Prohibition on publicity or propaganda
      The conference agreement maintains current law limiting 
to $750,000 the amount that may be made available to carry out 
the provision of section 316 of Public Law 96-533 relating to 
hunger and development education as proposed by the Senate 
amendment. The House bill provided no funding limitation. The 
managers expect AID to select the recipients of these grants 
through a public competition during fiscal year 2000.
Sec. 545. Purchase of American-made equipment and products
      The conference agreement includes language proposed in 
the Senate amendment directing the Secretary of the Treasury to 
report annually to Congress on compliance with this provision.
Sec. 546. Prohibition of payments to United Nations members
      The conference agreement modifies current law to prohibit 
the use of certain funds to pay the cost for attendance for 
another country's delegation at international conferences held 
under the auspices of multilateral or international 
organizations. This is similar to the House bill. The Senate 
amendment included a similar provision.
Sec. 549. Prohibition on assistance to foreign governments that export 
        lethal military equipment to countries supporting international 
        terrorism
      The conference agreement includes the Senate version of 
this general provision, which is the same as House language 
except that under subsection (a) the reference to ``any other 
comparable provision of law'' is deleted and under subsection 
(c) the word ``estimated'' is deleted.
Sec. 552. War crimes tribunals drawdown
      The conference agreement includes Senate language that 
authorizes a Presidential drawdown of up to $30,000,000 of 
commodities and services for the United Nations War Crimes 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia or similar tribunals or 
commissions. It also specifies that such drawdowns are subject 
to the notification process and that drawdowns made under this 
section shall not be construed as an endorsement or precedent 
for the establishment of any standing or permanent 
international criminal tribunal or court. The House bill 
included similar language, but would not have exempted the 
tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda from the notification 
requirements of the provision as in the Senate amendment.
Sec. 553. Landmines
      The conference agreement includes language that amends 
section 1365(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484) by extending until 
October 23, 2003, the ban on the export of landmines.
Sec. 555. Prohibition on payment of certain expenses
      Section 555 prohibits the use of funds from 
``International Military Education and Training''; ``Foreign 
Military Financing''; ``Child Survival and Disease Programs 
Fund''; ``Development Assistance''; and ``Economic Support 
Fund'' to pay for alcoholic beverages or entertainment expenses 
of a substantially recreational character.
Sec. 556. Competitive pricing for sales of defense articles
      The conference agreement includes language from the 
Senate amendment that provides that direct costs associated 
with meeting a foreign customer's additional or unique 
requirements will continue to be allowable under the Arms 
Export Control Act. The House bill did not address this matter.
Sec. 559. Limitation on assistance for Haiti
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that proposed by both Houses. It sunsets the required reports 
after two years as proposed by the House and includes a 
provision limiting the percentage of funds that can be 
allocated to any single Latin American or Caribbean country. 
The latter limitation is a separate general provision in 
current law and in the House bill. The limitation was not 
included in the Senate amendment.
Sec. 563. Limitation on assistance to the Palestinian Authority
      The conference agreement includes House language that 
prohibits funds for the Palestinian Authority unless the 
President certifies that waiving such prohibition is important 
to the national security interests of the United States. Such 
waiver shall apply no more than 6 months and shall not apply 
beyond 12 months after enactment. The Senate amendment did not 
address this matter.
Sec. 565. Limitations on transfer of military equipment to East Timor
      The conference agreement includes language from the 
Senate amendment that requires that in any agreement for 
military assistance or sales a statement shall be included that 
the items will not be used in East Timor. The House language 
included a proviso that stated nothing in this section shall be 
construed to limit Indonesia's inherent right to self-defense 
as recognized under the UN charter and in international law, 
and that military sales, assistance, or lease agreements 
include the statement that the United States ``expects'' that 
the military assistance will not be used in East Timor.
      The conferees direct the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Defense and other 
appropriate agencies, to submit a report to the Committees on 
Appropriations not later than February 1, 2000, identifying all 
Indonesian commanding officers and units deployed in East Timor 
during 1999, and providing any available information linking 
those officers and units to the violence prior to and after the 
August 30, 1999 referendum in East Timor. Such report may be 
provided in classified form, if appropriate.
Sec. 566. Restrictions on assistance to countries providing sanctuary 
        to indicted war criminals
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that of the House bill. It substitutes the word 
``municipality'' for ``canton'', includes a special rule that 
allows for assistance to an entity that would otherwise be 
sanctioned under the terms of this section, and imposes certain 
recordkeeping requirements on the Secretary of State. The 
Senate amendment would have made a number of technical and 
substantive changes to the House bill, including: establishment 
of a policy for support of the International Criminal Tribunal 
for the former Yugoslavia; establishment of a special rule 
exempting certain specified entities and communities from 
sanctions under certain provisions of this section; a 
requirement for public information regarding certain assistance 
provided to the countries inthe former Yugoslavia; and a 
provision for certain exemptions by types of assistance. The conference 
agreement defines ``Montenegro'' and ``Kosova'' separately for purposes 
of applying this provision of law.
Sec. 568. Greenhouse gas emissions
      The conference agreement includes a modification of 
current laws as proposed by the House, primarily to obtain more 
detailed information from AID in an annual report submitted by 
the President.
Sec. 569. Excess defense articles for certain European countries
      The conference agreement includes language from the 
Senate amendment that extends a provision of permanent law that 
expired in 1997 through 2000. The law authorizes the provision 
of excess defense articles to certain European countries. The 
House bill did not address this matter.
Sec. 570. Aid to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo
      The conference agreement prohibits any assistance to the 
central Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo as 
proposed in the Senate amendment. The House bill included a 
similar provision.
Sec. 571. Assistance for the Middle East
      The conference agreement contains language similar to the 
House bill that imposes a spending ceiling of $5,321,150,000 on 
specified assistance in titles II and III of this Act for the 
Middle East. The Senate amendment did not address this matter.
Sec. 572. Enterprise Fund restrictions
      The conference agreement includes language in the House 
bill that was not in the Senate amendment that requires that, 
prior to the distribution of any assets resulting from any 
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of an Enterprise Fund, 
in whole or in part, the President shall submit a plan for the 
distribution of the assets of the Enterprise Fund to the 
Committees on Appropriations in accordance with regular 
notification procedures.
Sec. 573. Cambodia
      The conference agreement includes language that prohibits 
funds for the central Government of Cambodia and states that 
the Secretary of the Treasury should instruct the Executive 
Directors of international financial institutions to use the 
voice and vote of the United States to oppose loans to that 
government. The House bill contained similar language, but 
would have imposed the funding prohibition on all government 
assistance. The Senate amendment would have required the 
Secretary of the Treasury to instruct U.S. executive directors 
of international financial institutions to use the voice and 
vote of the U.S. to oppose loans to the Government of Cambodia, 
except to support basic human needs, unless: (1) Cambodia has 
held free and fair elections; (2) all political candidates were 
permitted freedom of speech, assembly, and equal access to the 
media; (3) the Central Election Commission was comprised of 
representatives from all parties, and (4) the Government had 
begun the prosecution of Khmer Rouge leaders to include six 
named individuals. The Senate also addressed this matter under 
title II.
      It is the intention of the managers that if the 
Administration proposes to provide assistance to or through 
provincial or municipal governments in Cambodia it will first 
consult with the appropriate committees of the Congress prior 
to the obligation of funds.
Sec. 574. Customs assistance
      The conference agreement amends the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961 regarding the prohibition on the use of certain 
bilateral assistance for police training by allowing assistance 
to foreign customs authorities and personnel, including 
training, technical assistance, and equipment for customs law 
enforcement. The conference agreement is identical to the 
Senate amendment. The House bill did not address this matter.
      The managers expect this authority to be exercised to 
support U.S. private sector trade and investment opportunities.
Sec. 575. Foreign military training report
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that in the House bill requiring a joint report by the 
Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense on all overseas 
military training (excluding military sales) provided to non-
NATO foreign military personnel under programs administered by 
the Departments of Defense and State during 1999 and 2000, 
including those proposed for 2000. The language specifies the 
scope of the report, and allows for a classified annex, if 
deemed necessary and appropriate. The report shall be due no 
later than March 1, 2000. The Senate amendment included similar 
language, but did not provide for an exemption for NATO 
countries.
Sec. 576. Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO)
      The conference agreement includes language similar to 
that in the House bill that up to $15,000,000 may be made 
available for KEDO prior to June 1, 2000, if, 30 days prior to 
such obligation of funds, the President certifies and so 
reports to Congress that (1) the parties to the Agreed 
Framework have taken and continue to take demonstrable steps to 
implement the Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of Korea; 
(2) the parties have taken and continue to take demonstrable 
steps to pursue the North-South dialogue; (3) North Korea is 
complying with all provisions of the Agreed Framework; (4) 
North Korea has not diverted assistance for purposes for which 
it was not intended; and (5) North Korea is not seeking to 
develop or acquire the capability to enrich uranium, or any 
additional capability to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. In 
addition, up to $20,000,000 may be made available for KEDO on 
or after June 1, 2000, if, 30 days prior to the obligation of 
such funds, the President certifies and so reports to Congress 
that (1) the effort to can and safely store all spent fuel from 
North Korea's nuclear reactors has been successfully concluded; 
(2) North Korea is complying with its obligations regarding 
access to suspect underground construction; (3) North Korea has 
terminated its nuclear weapons program, including all efforts 
to acquire, develop, test, produce, or deploy such weapons, and 
(4) the United States has made and continues to make 
significant progress on eliminating the North Korean ballistic 
missile threat, including further missile tests and its 
ballistic missile exports. The language allows for the 
President to waive thecertification requirements of this 
section if he determines that it is vital to the national security 
interests of the United States, 30 days after a written submission to 
the appropriate congressional committees. It also requires a report 
from the Secretary of State on the fiscal year 2001 budget request for 
KEDO, with certain specified information to be included in such report.
      The House bill contained identical language, except it 
did not allow for the use of certain authorities of the Foreign 
Assistance Act to provide for a reprogramming of funds above 
the level of $35,000,000 specified for KEDO.
      The Senate amendment contained language similar to the 
House bill. In addition, it required a report from the Director 
of Central Intelligence on all relevant intelligence bearing on 
North Korea's compliance with the above provisions; specified 
the timing of the report; and specified the types of 
intelligence covered by the report.
Sec. 577. African Development Foundation
      The conference agreement provides that funds to grantees 
of the Foundation may be invested pending expenditure and that 
interest earned must be used for the same purpose for which the 
grant was made. Further, this section allows the Foundation's 
board of directors, in exceptional circumstances, to waive the 
existing $250,000 project limitation, subject to reporting to 
the Committees on Appropriations. This section is identical to 
the House bill. The Senate amendment included these same 
authorities within its ``Development Assistance'' account.
Sec. 578. Prohibition on assistance to the Palestinian Broadcasting 
        Corporation
      The conference agreement includes House language not in 
the Senate amendment that provides that none of the funds made 
available by this Act may be used to provide equipment, 
technical support, consulting services, or any other form of 
assistance to the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation.
Sec. 579. Voluntary separation incentives for employees of the U.S. 
        Agency for International Development
      The conference agreement provides for the payment of 
voluntary separation incentives to AID employees for the 
purpose of eliminating positions and functions at AID. The 
conference agreement is similar to the Senate amendment. The 
House bill did not address this matter.
      The managers have included in this section a requirement 
that the AID administrator submit to the Committees on 
Appropriations, in addition to the Office of Management and 
Budget, a strategic plan outlining the intended use of 
incentive payments and a proposed organizational chart for AID 
once such incentives payments have been completed. The managers 
direct that AID consult regularly with the Committees on 
Appropriations on the strategic plan prior to implementing the 
separation program authorized by this section. Consistent with 
the Administration's request, the managers expect this 
authority to be used by AID to reduce its employment levels in 
Washington, D.C.
Sec. 580. Iraq opposition
      The conference report includes language similar to that 
in the House bill and the Senate amendment that, 
notwithstanding any other provision of law, $10,000,000 shall 
be made available to support efforts to bring about a political 
transition in Iraq, of which not less than $8,000,000 shall be 
made available only to Iraqi opposition groups designated under 
the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law 105-338), for political, 
economic, humanitarian, and other activities of such groups. It 
also provides that not more than $2,000,000 of such funds may 
be made available for groups and activities seeking the 
prosecution of Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi government 
officials for war crimes.
      The conference agreement does not contain Senate language 
providing $250,000 for the Iraq Foundation. However, the 
conferees believe that the Foundation should receive funding 
made available by this Act for activities associated with 
pursuing war crimes.
Sec. 581. Agency for International Development budget submission
      The conference agreement instructs the Agency for 
International Development to submit its 2001 budget in a format 
more useful to the Committees as proposed by the House. The 
Senate did not address this matter. AID is also requested to 
provide to the Committees not later than 45 days after 
enactment of this Act a report identifying each program, 
project, or intermediate result funded from appropriations 
provided under the heading ``Development Assistance'' for which 
the unexpended pipeline on October 1, 1999, exceeded either 
$15,000,000, or the total amount expended for each such 
program, activity, or intermediate result in fiscal years 1998 
and 1999.
Sec. 582. American churchwomen in El Salvador
      The conference agreement includes language regarding the 
murder of four American churchwomen in El Salvador. The 
conference agreement requires a report from the Attorney 
General to the Committees on Appropriations and requires the 
President to order all Federal agencies and departments that 
possess relevant information to make every effort to declassify 
and release that information to the victims' families. The 
House bill and Senate amendment included similar provisions.
Sec. 583. Kyoto Protocol
      The conference agreement includes language regarding the 
Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Agreement on Global Climate 
Change as proposed by the House. The Senate amendment did not 
address this matter.
Sec. 584. Additional requirements relating to stockpiling of defense 
        articles for foreign countries
      The conference agreement includes language from the 
Senate amendment not in the House bill that amends the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961 to provide authority to increase the war 
reserve stockpiles in Korea and Thailand by $60,000,000 for 
fiscal year 2000.
Sec. 585. Russian leadership program
      The conference agreement includes new language amending 
the statutory authority for the Russian Leadership Exchange 
Program.
Sec. 586. Abolition of the Inter-American Foundation
      The conference agreement provides authority from the 
President to abolish the Inter-American Foundation and 
terminate its functions. The House bill and Senate amendment 
did not address this matter.
Sec. 587. West Bank and Gaza Program
      The conference agreement includes language that provides 
that, 30 days prior to the initial obligation of funds for the 
bilateral West Bank and Gaza Program, the Secretary of State 
shall certify to the appropriate committees of Congress that 
procedures have been established to assure the Comptroller 
General of the United States will have access to appropriate 
United States financial information in order to review the uses 
of United States assistance for the programs funded under 
``Economic Support Fund'' for the West Bank and Gaza Program.
      The Senate amendment included language that specified 
requirements for auditing assistance that may be provided to 
the Palestinian Authority. The House bill did not address this 
matter.
Sec. 588. Human rights assistance
      The conference agreement includes language providing 
recommendations on the use of funds available from the 
``International Narcotics Control'' account. The language 
states that not less than $500,000 should be provided to the 
Colombia Attorney General's Human Rights unit; not less than 
$500,000 should be made available to support Colombian 
nongovernmental organizations involved in human rights 
monitoring, particularly to assist in protecting the physical 
safety of their personnel; and not less than $250,000 should be 
made available to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights for human rights assistance for the Colombian 
government. Further, not less than $1,000,000 should be 
provided for assistance to enhance U.S. embassy monitoring of 
assistance to Colombian security forces and in responding to 
reports of human rights violations. The conference agreement 
also includes language that not less than $5,000,000 should be 
made available for administration of justice programs, 
including support for the Colombia Attorney General's Technical 
Investigations Unit. The managers direct the Department of 
State's Bureau for International Narcotics Control and Law 
Enforcement Affairs to report to the Committees on 
Appropriations not later than January 15, 2000, regarding its 
plans to meet the requirements of this section.
Sec. 589. Indonesia
      The conference agreement includes new language that 
conditions the obligations of funds appropriated by this Act 
under the headings ``International Military Education and 
Training'' and ``Foreign Military Financing Program'' on a 
Presidential determination and report to Congress that the 
Government of Indonesia and the Indonesian Armed Forces are 
meeting specified criteria regarding accountability for past 
acts and ongoing activities in Indonesia and East Timor.
Sec. 590. Man and the Biosphere Program
      The conference agreement prohibits the provision of funds 
made available by the Act for the United Nations Man and the 
Biosphere Program of the United Nations World Heritage Fund if 
the Program or the Fund engage in activities affecting sites in 
the United States during the current fiscal year.
Sec. 591. Immunity for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
      The conference agreement includes language that provides 
that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall be deemed to be a 
state sponsor of terrorism for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 
1605(a)(7). The section shall not apply to Montenegro or 
Kosova, and shall become null and void when the President 
certifies in writing to the Congress that the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia (other than Montenegro and Kosova) has completed 
a democratic reform process that results in a newly elected 
government that respects the rights of ethnic minorities, is 
committed to the rule of law and respects the sovereignty of 
its neighbor states. However, the language provides that the 
certification shall not affect the continuation of ongoing 
litigation.
      The Senate amendment would have applied all sanctions 
applicable to a terrorist state to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. The House bill did not address this matter.
Sec. 592. United States assistance policy for opposition-controlled 
        areas of Sudan
      The conference agreement provides the President the 
authority to provide food assistance to groups engaged in the 
protection of civilian populations in opposition-controlled 
areas of Sudan. In support of this effort, the managers urge 
AID to provide up to $500,000 for the People-to-People peace 
and reconciliation process designed to unite ethnic groups and 
communities in southern Sudan. Further, the conference 
agreement requires the President to submit to the Committees on 
Appropriations a report on United States bilateral assistance 
to opposition-controlled areas of Sudan. The managers expect 
this report to be provided in both classified and unclassified 
forms, if necessary. The report is to include an accounting of 
U.S. assistance to opposition-controlled areas of Sudan in 
certain fiscal years and the goals and objectives of such 
assistance. Further, the President is to report on the policy 
implications, costs, and sources of funds associated with 
providing humanitarian assistance, including food, directly to 
National Democratic Alliance participants and the U.S. agencies 
best suited to administer these activities. Also, the President 
is to report on the policy implications of increasing 
substantially the amount of development assistance for certain 
activities in opposition-controlled areas of Sudan, the 
identification (by organization) of all proposed beneficiaries 
of such assistance, and the obstacles to administering a 
development assistance program in this region.
      The Senate amendment included three provisions relating 
to U.S. assistance programs in opposition-controlled areas of 
Sudan. The House bill did not address this matter.
Sec. 593. Consultations on arms sales to Taiwan
      The conference agreement includes Senate language that 
directs the Secretary of State to consult with the Congress 
regarding amechanism to provide for congressional input into 
the nature or quantity of defense articles and services for Taiwan. The 
House bill did not address this matter.
Sec. 594. Authorizations
      The conference agreement authorizes appropriations for 
various international financial institutions, as proposed in 
the Senate amendment. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 595. Assistance for Costa Rica
      The conference agreement provides that $8,000,000 of the 
funds appropriated in Public Law 106-31, under the heading 
``Central America and the Caribbean Emergency Disaster Recovery 
Fund'' be provided to Costa Rica.
Sec. 596. Silk Road Strategy Act of 1999
      The conference agreement is the same as the Senate 
amendment regarding policy toward Central Asia, with the 
addition of language relating to trade disputes.
Sec. 597. Country reports on human rights practices
      The conference agreement includes language, similar to 
the Senate amendment, which amends the Foreign Assistance Act 
of 1961 to require that the annual State Department ``Country 
Reports on Human Rights Practices'' include a new section 
regarding the trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 598. OPIC maritime fund
      The conference agreement expresses the sense of the 
Congress that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation shall 
within one year from the date of enactment of this Act select a 
fund manager for the purpose of creating a maritime fund with 
total capitalization of up to $200,000,000. This fund shall 
leverage United States commercial maritime expertise to support 
international maritime projects.
Sec. 599. Sanctions against Serbia
      The conference report includes language similar to that 
in the Senate amendment that requires that a number of 
specified sanctions against Serbia remain in place until a 
certification is issued by the President. The certification 
requires that Serbia comply with a number of international 
agreements, and provides an exemption for Montenegro and Kosova 
for the sanctions imposed through international financial 
institutions. It also allows for a waiver of all sanctions if 
necessary to meet emergency humanitarian needs.
      The House bill did not address this matter.
Sec. 599A. Clean coal technology
      The conference agreement includes a section contained in 
the Senate amendment making a number of Congressional findings 
regarding clean coal technology. The House bill did not address 
this matter.
Sec. 599B. Restriction on United States assistance for certain 
        reconstruction efforts in the Balkans region
      The conference agreement includes language that provides 
that funds made available by this Act for assistance for 
reconstruction efforts in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or 
any contiguous country should to the maximum extent practicable 
be used for the procurement of articles and services of United 
States origin. Under the terms of this section, the term 
``article'' means any agricultural commodity, steel, 
communications equipment, farm machinery or petrochemical 
refinery equipment.
      The Senate amendment would have prohibited the use of 
reconstruction funds in this Act for the former Yugoslavia or 
any contiguous country for the procurement of any article 
purchased outside the United States, the recipient country, or 
least developed countries, or any service provided by a foreign 
person, subject to certain exceptions. The House bill did not 
address this matter.
Sec. 599C. United Nations Population Fund
      The conference agreement provides that, of amounts under 
``International Organizations and Programs'', not more than 
$25,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 shall be available for the 
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) subject to certain 
prohibitions and conditions. This section prohibits funds for 
the UNFPA from being made available for a country program in 
the People's Republic of China. Also, fiscal year 2000 funds 
are prohibited for UNFPA unless (1) UNFPA maintains these funds 
in an account separate from other UNFPA accounts (2) UNFPA does 
not commingle these funds with other sums and (3) UNFPA does 
not fund abortions.
      This section requires that the Secretary of State report 
to Congress not later than February 15, 2000, indicating the 
amount of funds that the UNFPA is budgeting for the year in 
which the report is submitted for a country program in the 
People's Republic of China. If this report indicates that the 
UNFPA plans to spend funds for a country program in the 
People's Republic of China in the year covered by the report, 
then the amount of such funds that the UNFPA plans to spend in 
China shall be deducted from the funds made available to the 
UNFPA after March 1 for obligation for the remainder of the 
fiscal year in which the report was submitted.
      This section is identical to the House bill. The Senate 
amendment included similar language.
Sec. 599D. Authorization for population planning
      The conference agreement includes language which limits 
the amount of funds appropriated in title II of this Act for 
population planning activities or other population assistance 
to $385,000,000. This section requires that any foreign 
private, nongovernmental or multilateral organization meet 
certain requirements in order to receive such assistance and 
contains the authority for the President to waive these 
restrictions.
Sec. 599E. OPIC authorization
      The conference agreement includes language that provides 
authority for the operations of the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation (OPIC) until November 1, 2000.

                PROVISIONS NOT ADOPTED BY THE CONFEREES

                Distinguished Development Service Award

      The conference agreement does not include the section in 
the Senate amendment regarding the distinguished development 
service award. The House bill did not address this matter.

Withholding Assistance to Countries Violating United Nations Sanctions 
                             Against Libya

      The conference agreement deletes a House provision that 
imposed a reduction in United States assistance of at least 5 
percent when a country violates specified United Nations 
sanctions against Libya. The Senate amendment did not address 
this matter. The provision is no longer relevant, since the 
United Nations has suspended the application of sanctions 
against Libya.

 Limitation on Funds for Foreign Organizations That Perform or Promote 
                               Abortions

the ``Mexico City'' policy regarding restrictions on U.S. 
assistance to foreign organizations that perform or actively 
promote abortion, includinglobbying or any other effort to 
alter laws of any foreign country concerning abortion. The Senate did 
not address this matter.

   Restriction on Population Planning Activities or Other Population 
                               Assistance

      The conference agreement does not include a provision

for population planning activities for foreign nongovernmental 
organizations under certain conditions.

contained in the Senate amendment regarding Colombia.

      The conference agreement deletes language from the Senate 
amendment that provided general authority to promote democracy 
and civil society in Yugoslavia, including an authorization of 
appropriations of $100,000,000; included a prohibition on 
assistance to the Government of Serbia; and included authority 
to provide assistance to the Government of Montenegro subject 
to certain conditions. The House bill did not address this 
matter.

the House bill that prohibits funds from titles I, II, or III 
for any foreign government if the funds are used to purchase 
equipment or products made in a country other than the foreign 
country itself or from the United States. The Senate amendment 
did not address this matter.
      This issue is further addressed in section 545 of the 
conference report, ``Purchase of American-Made Equipment and 
Products''.

            Limitation on Assistance for School of Americas

      The conference agreement does not contain language from 
the House bill that would have prohibited funding for the 
School of the Americas located at Fort Benning, Georgia. The 
Senate amendment did not address this matter.

            To Promote an International Arms Transfer Regime

      The conference agreement does not include language from 
the Senate amendment that would have authorized the President 
to continue and expand efforts through the United Nations and 
other international fora to limit arms transfers worldwide, and 
that specified the transfers that should be limited. The Senate 
language would also have required a semiannual report on 
progress in such negotiations to accomplish this goal. The 
House bill did not address this matter.

   Sense of the Senate Regarding United States Commitments Under the 
               United States-North Korea Agreed Framework

      The conference agreement deletes Senate language that 
expressed the Sense of the Senate regarding the Agreed 
Framework and deliveries of heavy fuel oil to KEDO and North 
Korea. The House bill did not address this matter.

   Sense of the Senate Regarding an International Conference on the 
                                Balkans

      The conference agreement deletes Senate language

international conference on the Balkans. The House bill did not 
address this matter.

                    Accountability of Saddam Hussein

      The conference agreement deletes Senate language 
regarding accountability for Saddam Hussein. The House bill did 
not address this matter.
      The managers agree with the intent of the language of the 
Senate amendment on the need for accountability on the part of 
Saddam Hussein.

Sense of the Senate Regarding Assistance Provided to Lithuania, Latvia, 
                              and Estonia

nations should not be interpreted as expressing the will of the 
Senate to accelerate membership of those nations into NATO.

expressing the Sense of the Senate on elimination of the 
international problem of tuberculosis. The House bill did not 
address this matter.

  Limitation on Assistance to the Government of the Russian Federation

      The conference agreement does not include language 
contained in the House bill limiting assistance to the 
government of the Russian Federation at $172,000,000. The 
Senate amendment did not include a similar provision. This 
matter is addressed in title II under the heading ``Assistance 
to the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union''.

                       Expanded Threat Reduction

      The conference agreement does not include two sections 
from the Senate amendment regarding the Expanded Threat 
Reduction Initiative. The House bill did not contain similar 
provisions.

      TITLE VI--INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS

                     BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE

                  Funds Appropriated to the President

                  other bilateral economic assistance

                         economic support fund

      The conference agreement appropriates $450,000,000 in 
supplemental funds for assistance for Jordan and for the West 
Bank and Gaza, to remain available until September 30, 2002, of 
which $100,000,000 shall become available for obligation on 
September 30, 2000. Pursuant to the budget request, $50,000,000 
is intended for assistance for Jordan and $400,000,000 is 
intended for assistance for the West Bank and Gaza. These funds 
are designated an emergency for the purposes of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, 
and shall only be available to the extent that an official 
budget request that designates the entire amount as an 
emergency requirement pursuant to said Act is transmitted to 
the Congress.
      The funds provided under this heading, and in this title 
under the heading ``Foreign Military Financing Program'', are 
associated with implementation of the Wye River Accord. It is 
the intention of the managers that the information provided in 
budget justification documents for both accounts regarding this 
request, including the information submitted on October 15, 
1999, will be used as the baseline for any proposed 
reprogramming of funds.

                          MILITARY ASSISTANCE

                  Funds Appropriated to the President

                   foreign military financing program

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,375,000,000 in 
supplemental funds for this account, of which $1,200,000,000 
shall be for grants only for Israel, $25,000,000 shall be for 
grants only for Egypt, and $150,000,000 shall be for grants 
only for Jordan. Of the total appropriated, $400,000,000 shall 
become available for obligation on September 30, 2000. These 
funds are designated an emergency for the purposes of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as 
amended, and shall only be available to the extent that an 
official budget request that designates the entire amount as an 
emergency requirement pursuant to said Act is transmitted to 
the Congress.
      The bill language reiterates the grant nature of this 
assistance and that funds are to be expended at the minimum 
rate necessary to make timely payments for defense articles and 
services. These provisions are restated in the supplemental for 
emphasis even though their inclusion is not legally necessary. 
Indeed, all the terms and conditions applicable to funds under 
this heading in title III apply to this supplemental 
appropriation unless there is an explicit exception made.
      The conference agreement also includes bill language to 
maintain procurement of defense articles and defense services 
in Israel at the current rate of 26.3 percent of the funds 
appropriated for military assistance. It also provides that, 
notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, not to exceed 
$1,370,000,000 of the funds appropriated in title III under 
this heading shall be disbursed within 30 days of enactment of 
this Act.

                for payment from the loan proceeds under this 
                section;
                    (D) other debts regardless of total amount 
                owed or purpose for which incurred, wherein the

                percent of the amount owed, shall be given the 
                fourth highest priority for payment from the

                    (E) debts described in subparagraphs (A), 
                (B), (C), and (D) of this paragraph, wherein 
                the creditor declines to compromise and settle 
                the debt for the percentage of the amount owed 
                as specified under the applicable subparagraph, 
                shall be given the lowest priority for payment 
                from the loan proceeds under this section.
            (2) The agreement described in subsection (b)(2) 
        shall also generally provide a framework whereby the 
        Governor of American Samoa shall, from time-to-time, be 
        required to give 10 businessdays notice to the 
Secretary that ASG will make payment in accordance with this section to 
specified creditors and the amount which will be paid to each of such 
creditors. Upon issuance of payments in accordance with the notice, the 
Governor shall immediately confirm such payments to the Secretary, and 
the Secretary shall within three business days following receipt of 
such confirmation transfer from the loan proceeds an amount sufficient 
to reimburse ASG for the payments made to creditors.
            (3) The agreement may contain such other provisions 
        as are mutually agreeable, and which are calculated to 
        simplify and expedite the payment of existing debt 
        under this section and ensure the greatest level of 
        compromise and settlement with creditors in order to 
        maximize the retirement of ASG debt.
    (d) Fiscal and Managerial Reform Program.--
            (1) The initial plan of fiscal and managerial 
        reform, designed to bring ASG's annual operating 
        expenses into balance with projected revenues for the 
        years 2003 and beyond as required under subsection 
        (b)(3), should identify specific measures which will be 
        implemented by ASG to accomplish such goal, the 
        anticipated reduction in government operating expense 
        which will be achieved by each measure, and should 
        include a timetable for attainment of each reform 
        measure identified therein.
            (2) The initial plan should also identify with 
        specificity the manner in which approximately 
        $4,300,000 of the loan proceeds will be utilized to 
        assist in meeting the reform plan's targets within the 
        timetable specified through the use of incentives for 
        early retirement, severance pay packages, outsourcing 
        services, or any other expenditures for program 
        elements reasonably calculated to result in reduced 
        future operating expenses for ASG on a long term basis.
            (3) Upon receipt of the initial plan, the Secretary 
        shall consult with the Governor of American Samoa, and 
        shall make any recommendations deemed reasonable and 
        prudent to ensure the goals of reform are achieved. The 
        reform plan shall contain objective criteria that can 
        be documented by a competent third party, mutually 
        agreeable to the Governor and the Secretary. The plan 
        shall include specific targets for reducing the amounts 
        of ASG local revenues expended on government payroll 
        and overhead (including contracts for consulting 
        services), and may include provisions which allow 
        modest increases in support of the LBJ Hospital 
        Authority reasonably calculated to assist the Authority 
        implement reforms which will lead to an independent 
        audit indicating annual expenditures at or below annual 
        Authority receipts.
            (4) The Secretary shall enter into an agreement 
        with the Governor similar to that specified in 
        subsection (c)(2) of this section, enabling ASG to make 
        payments as contemplated in the reform plan and then to 
        receive reimbursement from the Secretary out of the 
        portion of loan proceeds allocated for the 
        implementation of fiscal reforms.
            (5) Within 60 days following receipt of the initial 
        plan, the Secretary shall approve an interim final plan 
        reasonably calculated to make substantial progress 
        toward overall reform. The Secretary shall provide 
        copies of the plan, and any subsequent modifications, 
        to the House Committee on Resources, the House 
        Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on the 
        Department of the Interior and Related Agencies, the 
        Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and 
        the Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on 
        the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies.
            (6) From time-to-time as deemed necessary, the 
        Secretary shall consult further with the Governor of 
        American Samoa, and shall approve such mutually 
        agreeable modifications to the interim final plan as 
        circumstances warrant in order to achieve the overall 
        goals of ASG fiscal and managerial reforms.
    (e) Release of Loan Proceeds.--From the total proceeds of 
the loan described in this section, the Secretary shall make 
available--
            (1) upon compliance by ASG with paragraphs (b)(1) 
        and (b)(2) of this section and in accordance with 
        subsection (c), approximately $14,300,000 in 
        reimbursements as requested from time-to-time by the 
        Governor for payments to creditors;
            (2) upon compliance by ASG with paragraphs (b)(1) 
        and (b)(3) of this section and in accordance with 
        subsection (d), approximately $4,300,000 in 
        reimbursements as requested from time-to-time by the 
        Governor for payments associated with implementation of 
        the interim final reform plan; and
            (3) notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) of this 
        subsection, at any time the Secretary and the Governor 
        mutually determine that the amount necessary to fund 
        payments under paragraph (2) will total less than 
        $4,300,000 then the Secretary may approve the amount of 
        any unused portion of suchsum for additional payments 
against ASG debt under paragraph (1).
    (f ) Exception.--Proceeds from the loan under this section 
shall be used solely for the purposes of debt payments and 
reform plan implementation as specified herein, except that the 
Secretary may provide an amount equal to not more than 2 
percent of the total loan proceeds for the purpose of retaining 
the services of an individual or business entity to provide 
direct assistance and management expertise in carrying out the 
purposes of this section. Such individual or business entity 
shall be mutually agreeable to the Governor and the Secretary, 
may not be a current or former employee of, or contractor for, 
and may not be a creditor of ASG. Notwithstanding the preceding 
two sentences, the Governor and the Secretary may agree to also 
retain the services of any semi-autonomous agency of ASG which 
has established a record of sound management and fiscal 
responsibility, as evidenced by audited financial reports for 
at least three of the past 5 years, to coordinate with and 
assist any individual or entity retained under this subsection.
    (g) Construction.--The provisions of this section are 
expressly applicable only to the utilization of proceeds from 
the loan described in this section, and nothing herein shall be 
construed to relieve ASG from any lawful debt or obligation 
except to the extent a creditor shall voluntarily enter into an 
arms length agreement to compromise and settle outstanding 
amounts under subsection (c).
    (h) Termination.--The payment of debt and the payments 
associated with implementation of the interim final reform plan 
shall be completed not later than October 1, 2003. On such 
date, any unused loan proceeds totaling $1,000,000 or less 
shall be transferred by the Secretary directly to ASG. If the 
amount of unused loan proceeds exceeds $1,000,000, then such 
amount shall be credited to the total of loan repayments 
specified in paragraph (b)(1). With approval of the Secretary, 
ASG may designate additional payments from time-to-time from 
funds available from any source, without regard to the original 
purpose of such funds.
    Sec. 126. The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the 
Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and in

circumstances of dual enrollment, overlapping service areas or 
inaccurate distribution methodologies, the 10 percent 
limitation does not apply.

        efforts was attempted at St. Croix Island in Calais, 
        Maine;
            (2) St. Croix Island settlement predated both the 
        Jamestown and Plymouth colonies;
            (3) St. Croix Island offers a rare opportunity to 
        preserve and interpret early interactions between 
        European explorers and colonists and Native Americans;
            (4) St. Croix Island is one of only two 
        international historic sites comprised of land 
        administered by the National Park Service;
            (5) the quadricentennial commemorative celebration 
        honoring the importance of the St. Croix Island 
        settlement to the countries and people of both Canada 
        and the United States is rapidly approaching;

        and long-range interpretive plan call for enhancing 
        visitor facilities at both Red Beach and downtown

        extremely limited or nonexistent for a site of this

that--
            (1) using funds made available by this Act, the

deficit when appraised under the transaction evidence appraisal 
system using domestic Alaska values for western red cedar may 
be advertised upon receipt of a written request by a 
prospective, informed bidder, who has the opportunity to review 
the Forest Service's cruiseand harvest cost estimate for that 
timber. Program accomplishments shall be based on volume sold. Should 
Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2000, the annual average portion of the 
decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current Tongass Land 
Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised under the 
transaction evidence appraisal system using domestic Alaska values for 
western red cedar, all of the western red cedar timber from those sales 
which is surplus to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska, shall 
be made available to domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United 
States at prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal 
year 2000, less than the annual average portion of the decadal 
allowable sale quantity called for in the current Tongass Land 
Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised under the 
transaction evidence appraisal system using domestic Alaska values for 
western red cedar, the volume of western red cedar timber available to 
domestic processors at prevailing domestic prices in the contiguous 48 
United States shall be that volume: (i) which is surplus to the needs 
of domestic processors in Alaska; and (ii) is that percent of the 
surplus western red cedar volume determined by calculating the ratio of 
the total timber volume which has been sold on the Tongass to the 
annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity called 
for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan. The percentage shall 
be calculated by Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is sold (for 
purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the 
determination of how much western red cedar is eligible for sale to 
various markets shall be made at the time each sale is awarded). 
Western red cedar shall be deemed ``surplus to the needs of domestic 
processors in Alaska'' when the timber sale holder has presented to the 
Forest Service documentation of the inability to sell western red cedar 
logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska processors at price equal to 
or greater than the log selling value stated in the contract. All 
additional western red cedar volume not sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 
United States domestic processors may be exported to foreign markets at 
the election of the timber sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be 
sold at prevailing export prices at the election of the timber sale 
holder.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Department of the Interior 
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000''.
      Following is explanatory language on H.R. 3423, as 
introduced on November 17, 1999.

     DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS

      The conferees on H.R. 3194 agree with the matter inserted 
in this division of this conference agreement and the following 
description of this matter. This matter was developed through 
negotiations on the differences in H.R. 2466, the Department of 
the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000, by 
members of the subcommittee of both the House and Senate with 
jurisdiction over H.R. 2466.
      The conference agreement with respect to fiscal year 2000 
appropriations for the Department of the Interior and Related 
Agencies incorporates some of the provisions of House Report 
106-222 and Senate Report 106-99. Report language and 
allocations set forth in either of those reports, which are not 
changed by the conference agreement, are approved. The 
agreement described herein, while repeating some report 
language for emphasis, does not negate the language referenced 
above unless expressly provided. Administrative provisions and 
general provisions which are identical in the House-passed and 
Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2466 that are unchanged by the 
conference agreement are approved unless provided to the 
contrary herein.

             Allocation of Congressional Funding Priorities

      When Congressional instructions are provided, these 
instructions are to be closely monitored and followed. In this 
and future years, earmarks for Congressional funding priorities 
shall be allocated for those projects or programs prior to 
determining and allocating the remaining funds. Field units or 
programs should not have their allocations reduced because of 
earmarks for Congressional priorities without direction from or 
approval of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. 
Further, it is a Congressional responsibility to determine the 
level of funds provided for Federal agencies and how those 
funds should be distributed. It is not useful or productive to 
have Administration officials refer to Congressional directives 
as condescending and encroaching on executive responsibility to 
direct agency operations.

                  TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

                       Bureau of Land Management

                   management of lands and resources

      The conference agreement provides $646,218,000 for 
management of lands and resources instead of $631,068,000 as 
proposed by the House and $634,321,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Increases above the House include $2,500,000 for grazing 
permits, $1,500,000 for invasive species, $1,000,000 for 
riparian management, $750,000 for Idaho weed control, $50,000 
for Rio Puerco, $1,000,000 for the Colorado plateau ecosystem 
study, $500,000 for the national laboratory grazing study, 
$1,400,000 for fisheries, $900,000 for salmon restoration on 
the Yukon River and Caribou-Poker Creek, $1,330,000 for 
recreation resource management, $400,000 for the National 
Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, $4,400,000 for Alaska Conveyance, 
$300,000 for the Utah wilderness study, $350,000 for the 
Montana mapping project, and a $1,000,000 restoration of the 
general decrease.
      Decreases below the House include $500,000 from standards 
and guidelines, $400,000 from wildlife, and $1,330,000 from 
recreation operations.
      In addition to the increase of $2,500,000 as proposed by 
the House and provided in the conference agreement for the 
processing of permits for coalbed methane activities, the 
conference agreement includes bill language that makes the use 
of some of the Bureau's funds contingent upon a written 
agreement between the coal mine operator and the gas producer 
prior to permit issuance if the permitted activity is in an 
area where there is a conflict between coal mining operations 
and coalbed methane production. This restrictive language only 
applies to the additional $2,500,000.
      The conference agreement earmarks $750,000 for the Couer 
d'Alene Basin Commission for mining related cleanup activities 
with the clear understanding that funding will be provided only 
on a one-time basis.
      The Senate bill calls for a report by USDA's Forest 
Service dealing with integration of watershed and community 
needs. It is expected that this report be a joint Forest 
Service and Bureau of Land Management report as stated on page 
75 of Senate Report 106-99.
      The Bureau appears to be introducing new burdensome and 
questionable requirements on domestic oil and gas applications 
for permits to drill, and it is expected that the Bureau to 
cease requiring companies to apply paint to ground that will be 
disturbed by drilling activities.
      The conference agreement concurs with the Senate report 
language providing guidance on the Southern Nevada Public Lands 
Management Act as stated in Senate Report 106-99.
      The conference agreement maintains the funding level for 
Kane and Garfield counties at the fiscal year 1999 level of 
$250,000.
      The conference agreement contains modified bill language 
in Title III as proposed by the Senate to allow the Bureau to 
use up to $1,000,000 for the Youth Conservation Corps.

                        wildland fire management

      The conference agreement provides $292,282,000 for 
wildland fire management instead of $292,399,000 as proposed by 
the House and $283,805,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Changes to the House include an increase of $57,500 to 
reimburse Trinity County for expenses incurred as part of the 
July 2, 1999, Lowden fire, and a decrease of $175,000 as an 
offset against the Weber Dam project.

                    central hazardous materials fund

      The conference agreement provides $10,000,000 for the 
central hazardous materials fund as proposed by the House and 
Senate.

                              construction

      The conference agreement provides $11,425,000 for 
construction instead of $11,100,000 as proposed by the House 
and $12,418,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Increases above the House include $50,000 for the La 
Puebla pit tank, $250,000 for the California Trail Interpretive 
Center, and $25,000 for uncontrollable costs.

                       payments in lieu of taxes

      The conference agreement provides $135,000,000 for 
payments in lieu of taxes as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$145,000,000 as proposed by the House.

                            land acquisition

      The conference agreement provides $15,500,000 for land 
acquisition instead of $15,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$17,400,000 as proposed by the Senate. Funds should be 
distributed as follows:

      The $250,000 provided for Grafton, Utah is for 
acquisition of a 30-acre portion of the 220-acre Stout 
property. The 30 acres are foothill land adjacent to BLM 
managed public land and are appropriate for BLM acquisition. It 
is expected that the Grafton Heritage Project and the Grand 
Canyon Trust will be responsible for acquisition and management 
of the balance of the Stout property.
      The conference agreement provides $5,000,000 to the 
National Park Service (NPS) and $5,000,000 to the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM) for land acquisition within the 
California desert. This funding is based on the understanding 
that the Wildlands Conservancy will acquire 8,000 additional 
acres, in consultation with the NPS and BLM, from willing 
seller and small private inholdings within Joshua Tree National 
Park and the Mojave National Preserve within the next year. An 
additional $5,000,000 is provided in Title VI for this 
acquisition.
      No additional funds will be provided for Catellus land 
acquisition in future years unless and until the Department of 
the Interior and the Department of Defense completely resolve 
remaining issues relating to desert tortoise mitigation and 
land acquisition and expansion at the National Training Center 
for the Army at Fort Irwin, California.
      Furthermore, the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations will consider an additional $15,000,000 for 
California desert land acquisition of the Catellus lands up to 
a total of $30,000,000. Future funding decisions will be based 
upon resolution by the two departments of the issues concerning 
desert tortoise mitigation and land acquisition and expansion 
at the National Training Center for the Army of Fort Irwin.

                   oregon and california grant lands

      The conference agreement provides $99,225,000 for Oregon

      Bill Language.--The conference agreement provides that 
the amount of funding for certain endangered species listing 
programs may not exceed $6,232,000 instead of $6,532,000 as 
proposed by the House and $5,932,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement makes permanent the authority 
provided in the Senate bill for National Wildlife Refuges in 
Louisiana and Texas to retain funds collected from oil and gas 
related damages under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act, the Oil Pollution Act and the 
Clean Water Act. The Senate provision extended the authority 
only through fiscal year 2000. The House had no similar 
provision.
      Under General Provisions, Department of the Interior, the 
conference agreement modifies Senate Section 127 limiting the 
use of funds to implement Secretarial Order 3206. The 
modification permits implementation of the order except for two 
provisions. The first would give preferential treatment to 
Indian activities at the expense of non-Indian activities in 
determining conservation restrictions to species listed under 
the Endangered Species Act. The second would give preferential 
treatment to tribal lands at the expense of other privately 
owned lands in designating critical habitat under the 
Endangered Species Act. The House had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement provides for the following:
      1. The Service should continue to support the Nez Perce 
Tribe's wolf monitoring efforts. This program has been very 
successful and it should be continued at least at the funding 
level provided in fiscal year 1999.
      2. Small landowner partnerships under the ESA recovery 
program are not transferred to the landowner incentive program 
as proposed by the House, but the Service should consider 
seriously consolidating these programs in the fiscal year 2001 
budget.
      3. The $200,000 for a Weber Dam Study should be used by 
the Service, through a contract or memorandum of understanding 
with the Bureau of Reclamation, to (1) investigate alternatives 
to the modification of Weber Dam on the Walker River Paiute 
Reservation in Nevada; (2) evaluate the feasibility and 
effectiveness of the installation of a fish ladder at Weber 
Dam; and (3) evaluate opportunities for Lahontan cutthroat 
trout restoration in the Walker River Basin. Any future funding 
requirements identified for program implementation should not 
be the responsibility of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
      4. The $600,000 provided to assist with the Tongass Land 
Management Plan is included with the understanding that the 
State of Alaska should receive assistance as a partner.
      5. The Long Live the Kings salmon program is funded at 
$393,000 in the coastal program, and $171,500 of that amount is 
to be provided directly to the Hood Canal Salmon Enhancement 
Group.
      6. The continuing unmet maintenance needs at Ohio River 
Islands National Wildlife Refuge that not been addressed 
adequately in Service budget requests. The Service should 
ensure that: (1) the Refuge's maintenance requirements are 
fully included by Region 9 in the Maintenance Management System 
and (2) future budget requests include sufficient funding for 
the Ohio River Islands National Wildlife Refuge to cover 
adequately its growing maintenance needs.
      7. The funding provided for Caribou-Poker Creek salmon 
restoration is for one-time fish passage assistance by the 
Service. Any future operations and maintenance costs associated 
with this project should not be borne by the Service.
      8. The funding for fish passage improvements in Maine, 
related to removal of Edwards Dam, is provided on a one-time 
basis to help address a first-year shortfall in funding for 
fish passage assistance and restoration as anticipated by the 
Lower Kennebec River Comprehensive Hydropower Settlement 
Accord, of which the Service is a partner. The Service, as a 
partner in the Accord, should consider its responsibilities 
under the Accord as it prepares future budget requests.
      9. The funding provided for the Washington Department of 
Fish and Wildlife for a prototype machine to mark hatchery 
reared salmon completes the Federal funding for this project.
      10. The strategic plan required by the House for dealing 
with over-populations of snow geese and Canada geese should 
consider lethal means, including hunting, as possible 
solutions.
      11. The conference agreement notes the Service's failure 
to gather the necessary information to delist the concho water 
snake. Before distributing the ESA recovery program increase, 
the Service should provide $300,000 for the activities required 
to process the delisting of the concho water snake. It is 
expected the Service will proceed as quickly as possible, with 
the goal of gathering the necessary information within one year 
or as soon thereafter as possible.
      12. The House Committee on Appropriations has received 
several expressions of concern about uncooperative responses 
from the Carlsbad ecological services office in California. The 
Service should report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations on actions taken to improve communications 
between that office and State and local agencies and the 
public. Such actions should not involve increases in 
operational funding.
      13. The increase provided for the coastal program is not 
limited to any particular coastal areas. The Senate reference 
to South Carolina and Texas is not intended to limit increased 
funding to those areas. The Maine coastal program is also 
commended.
      14. Within the funds provided for resource management, 
the Service should set aside $500,000 for the Blackwater NWR, 
MD nutria eradication program. There is no objection to the use 
of carryover funds for a portion of this earmark. This program 
should serve as a prototype for nutria eradication throughout 
the country. The Service should notify the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations of what funds will be used for 
this program within 30 days of enactment of this Act and prior 
to distribution of program increases to the field. Sufficient 
funds should be included in the fiscal year 2001 budget request 
to complete this important project, the cost of which is being 
shared by several non-Federal partners.
      15. The conference agreement notes that the Fish and 
Wildlife Service designated critical habitat for the cactus 
ferruginous pygmy-owl on July 12, 1999, and expresses concern 
regarding the impact this designation will have on activities 
in southern Arizona. The Service should devote the necessary 
resources to respond adequately and efficiently to the needs of 
the people who are affected by this new rule and to conduct 
appropriate scientific studies.
      16. In 1997 Congress requested the Northwest Power 
Planning Council to conduct a review of all Federally funded 
fish hatcheries in the Columbia River Basin and to make 
recommendations for a coordinated hatchery policy. Congress 
also requested the Council toprovide the direction necessary to 
implement such a policy. The Council's report, ``Artificial Production 
Review, Report and Recommendations of the Northwest Power Planning 
Council,'' identifies several immediate actions to begin implementation 
of its recommendations. The Service should cooperate with the Council, 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, State fish and wildlife 
agencies, and the Columbia Basin Indian tribes to begin implementing 
the report's recommendations. The Service should begin identifying the 
amount needed for these reforms and to request initial funds in its FY 
2001 budget.
      17. The $100,000 provided in the ESA consultation account 
for the Broughton Ranch should be provided as a grant to the 
Washington Agriculture and Forestry Education Foundation for a 
demonstration project on the Broughton Ranch in Walla Walla, 
Washington. This project should serve as a template for how 
small private landowners can establish habitat conservation 
plans in cooperation with Federal agencies.
      18. To conserve and restore Pacific salmon, the 
conference agreement includes $3,857,000 in the recovery 
program for a competitively awarded matching grant program in 
Washington State. The funds should be provided in an advance 
payment of the entire amount on October 1, or as soon as 
practicable thereafter, to the National Fish and Wildlife 
Foundation, a Congressionally chartered, non-profit 
organization with a substantial record of leveraging Federal 
funds with non-Federal funds, coordinating private and public 
partnerships, managing peer reviewed challenge grant programs, 
and tracking the expenditure of funds. The funds will be 
available for award to community-based organizations in 
Washington State for on-the-ground projects that may include 
conservation and restoration of in-stream habitat, riparian 
zones, upland areas, wetlands, and fish passage projects. 
Within the amount provided, $451,000 is for the River CPR Puget 
Sound Drain Guard Campaign. The Foundation should work with the 
affected local community in the Methow Valley in Okanogan 
County, Washington, on salmon enhancement projects. The 
Foundation should give priority in awarding funds to 
cooperative projects in rural communities throughout the State.
      19. The funding for Washington State hatchery improvement 
activities is to support this new program as follows: The 
$3,600,000 provided for hatchery reform in Washington State 
should be deposited with the Washington State Interagency 
Council for Outdoor Recreation. The director of the Interagency 
Council for Outdoor Recreation shall ensure these funds are 
expended as specified in the report of May 7, 1999, titled 
``The Reform of Salmon and Steelhead Hatcheries in Puget Sound 
and Coastal Washington to Recover Natural Stocks While 
Providing Fisheries'', and at the direction of the Hatchery 
Scientific Review Group (as discussed below).
      Funds should be used for the improvement of hatcheries in 
the Puget Sound area and other coastal communities as follows: 
(1) $300,000 for activities associated with the Hatchery 
Scientific Review Group which will work with agencies to 
produce guidelines and recommended actions and ensure that the 
goals of hatchery reform are carried out, identify scientific 
needs, and make recommendations on further experimentation; (2) 
$800,000 for agencies and tribes to establish a team of 
scientists to generate and maintain data bases, analyze 
existing data, determine and undertake needed experiments, 
purchase scientific equipment, develop technical support 
infrastructures, initiate changes to the hatcheries based on 
their findings and establish a science-based decision making 
process; (3) $1,400,000 to improve hatchery management 
practices to augment fisheries, protect genetic resources, 
avoid negative ecological interactions between wild and 
hatchery fish, promote recovery of naturally spawning 
populations, and employ new rearing protocols to improve 
survival and operational efficiencies; (4) $900,000 to conduct 
scientific research evaluating hatchery management operations; 
and (5) $200,000 to Long Live the Kings to facilitate co-
managers' design and implementation of Puget Sound hatchery 
reform.
      A leading group of scientists representing Federal, 
State, and tribal agencies has been meeting for the past year 
to discuss the role of fish hatcheries in the Pacific 
Northwest. The listing of over 10 salmon species in the 
Columbia River over the past decade and the most recent the 
listing of 3 salmon species in other parts of the State have 
led many in the Northwest to question and challenge the role of 
fish hatcheries in the recovery of the listed wild salmon 
stocks.
      Hatcheries can play a positive role in salmon management 
and the recovery of wild salmon stocks. Scientists are testing 
ways hatcheries can be retrofitted and managed to provide 
hatchery stocks to maintain a vibrant fishery in the Pacific 
Northwest without significantly impacting precious wild stocks.
      The efforts of the advisory team that has established a 
framework designed to guide an effort to reform more than 100 
State, tribal, Federal, and private hatcheries in Puget Sound 
and the Washington coast are commended. Many watersheds on the 
west coast of Washington have multiple hatcheries run by 
different agencies and tribes. Hatchery operations must be 
coordinated within logical geographical management units. There 
must be a coordinated effort among all levels of government to 
obtain the positive results expected by hatchery management 
reform. The framework outlined by the advisory committee should 
be implemented at hatcheries in Puget Sound and the west coast 
of Washington.
      There is to be established a Hatchery Scientific Review 
Group which will serve as an independent panel. It should be 
comprised of five independent scientists selected by the 
advisory team from a pool of nine candidates nominated by the 
American Fisheries Society and four agency representatives; one 
each designated by the Washington Department of Fish and 
Wildlife, the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, the 
National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. Each of these designees should have technical 
skills in relevant fields such as fish biology or fish 
genetics. All appointments should be made no later than 30 days 
after enactment of this Act. The members of the group may be 
compensated for time and travel through this appropriation. The 
chair of the Hatchery Scientific Review Group should be one of 
the independent scientists chosen from the American Fisheries 
Society nominations and should be selected by the group itself. 
Hereafter, when an independent scientist on the group steps 
down, a replacement should be selected by the group from a list 
of three nominees provided by the American Fisheries Society.
      The Hatchery Scientific Review Group should report to 
Congress by June 1, 2000, on progress made and work remaining 
in reforming Puget Sound hatcheries. Long Live the Kings should 
report to Congress by June 1, 2000, on its progress.

                              Construction

      The conference agreement provides $54,583,000 for

      Bill Language.--The conference agreement includes bill 
language proposed by the Senate authorizing a single 
procurement for construction of the headquarters and visitors 
center at the Alaska Maritime NWR.
      The conference agreement provides for the following:
      1. The funding provided for construction of the 
headquarters and visitors center at Alaska Maritime NWR 
completes the Federal funding for this project by the Fish and 
Wildlife Service.
      2. The funding for the education center at the Silvio O. 
Conte NWR, VT is provided with the understanding that the 
Federal commitment will not exceed $2,900,000 and that the cost 
share will be substantially more than 50 percent.
      3. Funding for the Tern Island seawall is provided with 
the understanding that the total cost of the project will not 
exceed $12,000,000 and that project initiation will be delayed 
until appropriated funding is sufficient to provide for 
uninterrupted construction. Such an approach will avoid costly 
shut down and start up costs associated with piecemeal 
construction in this remote location. Although the Fish and 
Wildlife Service's efforts to obtain logistical support from 
the Navy have been, so far, unsuccessful, the Service is 
encouraged to continue to pursue such support.
      4. Funding provided for the Upper Mississippi River 
Discovery Center, IA represents the full Federal funding by the 
Fish and Wildlife Service. Within the $1,200,000 provided, 
$300,000 is for construction and installation of exhibits 
detailing the mission of the Fish and Wildlife Service and 
interpreting the Upper Mississippi River NWR, IA.
      5. The $615,000 decrease to the House recommended level 
for construction management eliminates the proposed increase 
for seismic compliance. Seismic compliance should be 
incorporated into overall priorities.
      6. The conference agreement notes with concern that the 
Service has allowed the floodgates on and around Mattamuskeet 
NWR, North Carolina, to deteriorate substantially over the past 
15 years, thus permitting saltwater intrusion onto surrounding 
farmlands of Hyde County, North Carolina. This situation has 
been exacerbated by the recent flooding in eastern North 
Carolina due to hurricanes, including Hurricane Floyd. While 
the Service has legitimate concerns with respect to water 
salinity and quality on the refuge, the Service should 
cooperate with other water users and landowners to ensure that 
their interests are adequately protected.

                            Land Acquisition

      The conference agreement provides $50,513,000 in new land 
acquisition funds and a reprogramming of $8,000,000 in prior 
year funds instead of $42,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$56,444,000 as proposed by the Senate. Funds should be 
distributed as follows:

      The $8,000,000 allocated in fiscal year 1999 for the 
acquisition of Palmyra Atoll has been reprogrammed because the 
non-Federal matching funds essential to purchase the property 
are not available at this time. The House and Senate Committees 
on Appropriations recognize the unique biological value of this 
tropical habitat and will consider providing funding in the 
future should the non-Federal share be secured.
      In addition to the funds provided in this account for the 
Rhode Island Refuge Complex, there is $2,000,000 provided in 
Title VI.
      The House and Senate Committee on Appropriations have 
conducted a preliminary review of the Federal land management 
agencies' definition of acquisition management costs. These 
initial findings indicate that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service is out of sync with the other agencies and the 
Committees are concerned about several issues, including the 
fact that only 65 percent of the acquisition management staff 
of the Service is accounted for in its acquisition management 
account, and that other costs are being assessed against the 
individual projects such as 10 percent thirdparty costs. The 
other agencies do not consider such costs. The Department should 
prepare a complete analysis of land acquisition costs, which includes 
the Forest Service program, and report to the Committees no later than 
March 15, 2000, with recommendations for standardizing the situation.

            Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund

      The conference agreement provides $23,000,000 for the 
cooperative endangered species conservation fund instead of 
$15,000,000 as proposed by the House and $21,480,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The increase above the House is for 
habitat conservation planning land acquisition. Bill language 
is included, as proposed by the Senate, to ensure that these 
funds are derived from the cooperative endangered species 
conservation fund.

                     National Wildlife Refuge Fund

      The conference agreement provides $10,779,000 for the 
national wildlife refuge fund as proposed by the House instead 
of $10,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

               North American Wetlands Conservation Fund

      The conference agreement provides $15,000,000 for the 
North American wetlands conservation fund as proposed by both 
the House and the Senate.

              Wildlife Conservation and Appreciation Fund

      The conference agreement provides $800,000 for the 
wildlife conservation and appreciation fund as proposed by both 
the House and the Senate.

                Multinational Species Conservation Fund

      The conference agreement provides $2,400,000 for the 
multinational species conservation fund as proposed by the 
Senate instead of $2,000,000 as proposed by the House.

              Commercial Salmon Fishery Capacity Reduction

      The conference agreement provides $5,000,000 for the 
Federal share of a salmon fishery capacity reduction program. 
The funds should be given as a grant to the State of Washington 
Department of Fish and Wildlife and will be used to reimburse 
commercial fishermen for forfeiting their commercial fishing 
licenses for Fraser River Sockeye. The program will support the 
implementation of the 1999 Pacific Salmon Treaty Agreement 
between the United States and Canada.

                         National Park Service

                 Operation of the National Park System

      The conference agreement provides $1,365,059,000 for 
operation of the National Park System instead of $1,387,307,000 
as proposed by the House and $1,355,176,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The agreement provides $255,399,000 for Resources 
Stewardship instead of $265,114,000 as proposed by the House 
and $247,905,000 as proposed by the Senate. Changes to the 
House level include decreases of $6,915,000 for special need 
parks, $500,000 to natural resources preservation, $500,000 to 
native and exotic species, $500,000 to inventory and 
monitoring, $500,000 to cultural resources preservation, 
elimination of $500,000 for the new resource protection act 
initiative, and a $300,000 decrease for collections management. 
Despite these reductions from the House position, the 
conference agreement still provides significant funding for the 
new science data initiative, as well as increases above the 
budget request for special need parks and increases to both 
cultural resource preservation and collections management above 
current year funding levels. The amount provided does not 
include funds specifically for the Civil War initiative as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides $318,970,000 for 
Visitor Services instead of $320,558,000 as proposed by the 
House and $317,806,000 as proposed by the Senate. Changes to 
the House level include a $3,908,000 decrease to special need 
parks and an increase of $2,320,000 for anti-terrorism base 
costs.
      The conference agreement provides $432,923,000 for 
Maintenance instead of $442,881,000 as proposed by the House 
and $432,081,000 as proposed by the Senate. Changes to the 
House level include decreases of $4,458,000 to special need 
parks, $3,000,000 for cyclic maintenance and $2,500,000 for 
repair and rehabilitation. Therefore, the conference agreement 
provides a $1,000,000 increase for cyclic maintenance and a 
$2,500,000 increase for repair and rehabilitation above the 
current year funding levels.
      The conference agreement provides $248,482,000 for park 
support instead of $248,895,000 as proposed by the House and 
$248,099,000 as proposed by the Senate. Changes to the 
Houselevel include an increase of $137,000 for special need parks, a 
decrease of $250,000 for partners for parks, a decrease of $500,000 for 
the challenge cost share program and an increase of $200,000 for 
cooperative agreements on the Lamprey Wild and Scenic River.
      The conference agreement provides $109,285,000 for 
external administrative costs as proposed by the Senate instead 
of $109,859,000 as proposed by the House. Changes to the House 
level include a decrease of $800,000 for GSA space and an 
increase of $226,000 for electronic acquisition system.
      The success of the bear management program at Yosemite 
National Park is noted and is encouraged by the Park Service to 
continue this worthwhile effort.
      The conference agreement does not provide an earmark for 
the Kawerak Eskimo Heritage Program within the funds provided 
for Beringia as proposed by the Senate.
      The beneficial uses at the Lake Roosevelt National 
Recreation Area include historical and traditional agriculture, 
grazing, recreation and cultural uses pursuant to a permit 
issued by the Service. Pursuant to the Lake Roosevelt National 
Recreation Area's new general management plan, existing and 
past historical use, and community moorage/public access 
facilities permitted by the Service at the Area may remain 
permitted under Service authority until it is determined by the 
Service that the permitted facility or activity is in conflict 
with a new or expanded concession facility. At such time the 
Service may choose to terminate that specific permit.
      The Civil War battlefields throughout the country hold 
great significance and provide vital historic educational 
opportunities for millions of Americans. There is concern, 
however, about the isolated existence of these Civil War battle 
sites in that they are often not placed in the proper 
historical context.
      The Service does an outstanding job of documenting and 
describing the particular battle at any given site, but in the 
public displays and multi-media presentations, it does not 
always do a similarly good job of documenting and describing 
the historical social, economic, legal, cultural and political 
forces and events that originally led to the larger war which 
eventually manifested themselves in specific battles. In 
particular, the Civil War battlefields are often weak or 
missing vital information about the role that the institution 
of slavery played in causing the American Civil War.
      The Secretary of the Interior is directed to encourage 
the National Park Service managers of Civil War battle sites to 
recognize and include in all of their public displays and 
multi-media educational presentations the unique role that the 
institution of slavery played in causing the Civil War and its 
role, if any, at the individual battle sites. The Secretary is 
further directed to prepare a report by January 15, 2000, on 
the status of the educational information currently included at 
Civil War sites that are consistent with and reflect this 
concern.
      The conference agreement expresses concern over the 
unsafe conditions at the intersection of Routes 29 and 234 in 
Manassas National Battlefield, in Prince William County, 
Virginia which remain hazardous to local residents and visitors 
traveling through the intersection. The safety concerns at 
Routes 29 and 234 have been a long-standing problem for the 
local communities. The National Park Service and the Virginia 
Department of Transportation are strongly encouraged to 
finalize plans to allow for construction to begin by March, 
2000.
      The conference agreement has not provided funding as 
proposed in the budget request for full implementation of a new 
maintenance management system. The Service is approved to 
pursue a pilot demonstration program for a new facility 
management system, and understand that base funds will be 
applied toward this effort during fiscal year 2000. The Service 
is expected to provide an update on the results of the pilot 
program before proceeding with service-wide implementation.
      The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
continue to monitor closely the Recreational Fee Demonstration 
program authorized in fiscal year 1996, particularly the 
National Park Service portion because of the size of that 
particular program. It is the Appropriations Committees' 
understanding that the Assistant Secretary for Policy, 
Management and Budget and the Assistant Secretary for Fish and 
Wildlife and Parks have both agreed upon a procedure for the 
National Park Service to follow in obtaining review and 
approval of expenditures of Recreational Fee Demonstration 
funds. All 80 percent projects for which the estimated total 
cost is $500,000 or greater are reviewed by the NPS Development 
Advisory Board and require approval by the Director and both 
Assistant Secretaries, and are then submitted to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations for approval prior to the 
obligation of funds for the project. For 80 percent projects 
for which the estimated total cost is $100,000 or less, 
projects are reviewed against established program criteria and 
are approved by the respective NPS Regional Directors. All 80 
percent projects over $100,000 but less than $500,000 require 
approval by the NPS Director and the Assistant Secretary for 
Fish and Wildlife and Parks, unless the project is replacement 
in kind or routine maintenance that protects prior investments, 
for which approval authority remains with the Regional 
Director. All 20 percent projects require approval by the NPS 
Director and both Assistant Secretaries, and those over 
$500,000 are submitted to the Committees for approval. Listings 
of all projects, regardless of dollar amounts, are to be 
provided quarterly to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations. Once the lists have been provided to the 
Committees for approval, any subsequent changes to these lists 
must also be forwarded to the Appropriations Committees for 
approval.
      The Committees are aware of proposals to address needs in 
parks through the pursuit of non-Federal sponsors. The 
Committees have been, and continue to be, supportive of 
partnerships that further the Service's mission. The need for a 
certain degree of flexibility in order to respond to private 
philanthropic opportunities is understood. However, the 
conference agreement reiterates that partnerships should be 
linked to the accomplishment of service-wide goals and not 
pursued strictly for enhancing park infrastructure.
      Partnership arrangements, including those where no 
Federal funds are involved, are not to be viewed as a way to 
bypass compliance with or adherence to existing policies, 
procedures, and approval requirements. Partnerships that 
benefit NPS sites or programs must have active involvement by 
NPS managers, and should be subject to the same review and 
approval requirements as projects funded with NPS funds. Review 
by the Development Advisory Board is expected for all 
partnership donation projects with a total cost above $500,000. 
While some projects may be proposed to be accomplished without 
any Federal funds, the operation and maintenance requirements 
are frequently assumed to be the responsibility of the Service, 
and for this reason full review is expected before commitments 
are made.
      Within the amounts provided, not less than $500,000 is 
for maintenance activities at Isle Royale National Park to 
address infrastructure and visitor facility deterioration.
      The National Park Service is directed to prepare a 
General Management Plan for the Lower East Side Tenement 
National Historic Site by November 2000 pursuant to section 
104(c) of Public Law 105-378.
      South Florida.--The conference agreement retains bill 
language in the land acquisition and state assistance account, 
as proposed by the House, that makes the $10,000,000 grant to 
the State of Florida in the land acquisition account and the 
$35,000,000 in Title VI subject to a fifty percent match of 
newly appropriated non-Federal funds. The State may not use 
funds for land acquisition which were previously provided in 
another fiscal year as the match. These funds are also subject 
to an agreement that the lands to be acquired will be managed 
in perpetuity for the restoration of the Everglades and other 
natural areas.
      The conference agreement includes modified bill language 
in the land acquisition account which makes the release of the 
$10,000,000 State grant funds subject to the Administration 
submitting legislative language that will ensure a guaranteed 
water supply to Everglades National Park and the remaining 
natural system areas located in the Everglades watershed, 
including but not limited to Big Cypress National Preserve, 
Biscayne National Park, Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge 
and Water Conservation Areas 2 and 3, as well as Biscayne Bay. 
While there has been recent testimony by the other partners, 
including the Army Corps of Engineers and the Florida Water 
Management District, assuring the Congress that there will be 
adequate water supply to the natural areas, the water supply 
must include high-quality water and not merely storm water 
runoff.
      It would be useful to have a complete estimate of the 
total costs to restore the South Florida ecosystem. The House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations believe that this new 
estimate will exceed the $7,800,000,000 estimate that has been 
used over the last five years. This recalculated estimate 
should include all three goals of this initiative, namely, (1) 
getting the water right, (2) restoring and enhancing the 
natural habitat, and (3) transforming the built environment. 
The Congress and the American people are committed to this 
project. Over $1,300,000,000 has been appropriated to date; 
however, and the public deserves to know how much this project 
will truly cost. This information should be submitted to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than 
February 1, 2000, and should be updated biennially.
      The Secretary of the Interior, in his capacity as Chair 
of the South Florida Restoration Task Force, is directed to 
develop a region-wide strategic plan as recommended by the 
General Accounting Office. The plan should coordinate and 
integrate Federal and non-Federal activities necessary to 
achieve the three ecosystem restoration goals. The Secretary is 
directed to submit a progress report to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations inFebruary, 2000, and the final 
strategic plan no later than July 31, 2000. This plan should be updated 
every two years.
      The timely resolution of disputes regarding South Florida 
ecosystem restoration is important to avoid cost overruns and 
unnecessary delays in attaining the goals and benefits of the 
initiative. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to 
develop recommendations for resolving the most difficult 
conflicts and submit recommendations to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations by February 15, 2000. These 
recommendations should be developed in consultation with the 
other major partners in this effort.
      The Committees, through previous appropriations, have 
supported the preparation of a new General Management Plan for 
Gettysburg NMP to enable the NPS to interpret more adequately 
the Battle of Gettysburg and to preserve the artifacts and 
landscapes that help to tell the story of this great conflict 
of the Civil War. Accordingly, the conference agreement 
acknowledges the need for a new visitors facility and supports 
the proposed public-private partnership as a unique approach to 
the interpretive needs of our National Parks.

                  national recreation and preservation

      The conference agreement provides $53,899,000 for 
National recreation and preservation instead of $49,449,000 as 
proposed by the House and $51,451,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The agreement provides $533,000 for Recreation 
programs, the same as the House and Senate. The agreement 
provides $10,090,000 for Natural programs as proposed by the 
House instead of $10,555,000 as proposed by the Senate. This 
includes a $500,000 general program increase and a $285,000 
increase for hydropower relicensing. While the conference 
agreement has not earmarked the River and Trails Conservation 
Assistance program, consideration should be given to the 
following projects: Mt. Independence NHL trail work, the Back 
to the River initiative, NE, and the Harlan County coal 
heritage project, KY. This is a technical assistance program, 
and therefore it is not meant to provide for annual operating 
expenses or technical assistance beyond two years.
      The conference agreement provides $19,614,000 for 
Cultural programs instead of $19,364,000 as proposed by the 
House and $19,914,000 as proposed by the Senate. The change to 
the House level is an increase of $250,000 for a Revolutionary 
War/War of 1812 Study. The conference agreement does not 
provide the increase of $300,000 as proposed by the Senate for 
a pilot demonstration project to provide technical preservation 
and development assistance to non-Federal National Historic 
Landmarks. However, in providing funds for this core program, 
it is expected that the National Park Service will provide 
technical assistance to non-Federal National Historic 
Landmarks. This is the core mission of the National Historic 
Landmarks program: to identify and help protect significant 
historic properties possessing exceptional value such as the 
Weston State Hospital in West Virginia.
      The conference agreement provides $1,699,000 for 
International park affairs as proposed by the House and Senate, 
$373,000 for environmental and compliance review as proposed by 
the House and Senate and $1,819,000 for Grant administration as 
proposed by the House and Senate.
      The conference agreement provides $6,886,000 for the 
heritage partnership program as proposed by the House instead 
of $5,886,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference 
agreement provides the following disbursements of funds: 
$1,000,000 each for the Ohio and Erie Canal National Heritage 
Corridor, the Essex National Heritage Area and the Rivers of 
Steel National Heritage Area, $800,000 each for the Hudson 
Valley National Heritage Area and the South Carolina National 
Heritage Corridor and the balance of $1,400,000 for the other 
four areas. The conference agreement provides $886,000 for 
technical assistance, of which not more than $150,000 may be 
provided for the Service's overhead expenses and the balance of 
which should be made available to the heritage areas for 
technical assistance agreed to by both the Alliance of National 
Heritage Areas and the National Park Service.
      The conference agreement provides $10,885,000 for 
Statutory or Contractual Aid instead of $4,685,000 as proposed 
by the House and $9,172,000 as proposed by the Senate. Funds 
are to be distributed as follows:

      The conference agreement provides $600,000 for a new 
Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Water Trails network and grants 
assistance program pursuant to Public Law 105-312. Of this 
amount, up to $200,000 is provided for completing a Chesapeake 
Bay Watershed-wide framework for implementing this law. It is 
expected that this framework and the criteria and procedures 
for the proposed assistance program will be completed by the 
Service and approved by the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations prior to providing any specific grants and 
technical assistance to states, communities or other groups. 
The remaining $400,000 will be available for competitive grants 
to meet the goals of the framework. A report is to be provided 
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by April 
1, 2000, on the framework goals and grants criteria and an 
annual end-of-year report, that details how the grants and 
technical assistance were allocated, the specific results of 
those individual grants and technical assistance and 
specifically how those projects relate to the framework and 
goals of the program.
      The conference agreement provides on a one-time only 
basis, $866,000 for the operation of the Oklahoma City 
Memorial, OK. It is noted that there was an unexpected delay in 
the construction of the memorial museum, which is the planned 
revenue source for the memorial.
      The conference agreement provides $2,000,000 for the 
Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery program instead of 
$4,000,000 as provided by the House and $1,500,000 as provided 
by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes language in the bill 
providing authority for the retention of fees for historic 
preservation tax certifications. Similar language was proposed 
by both the House and Senate.

                       Historic Preservation Fund

      The conference agreement provides $75,212,000 for the 
Historic preservation fund instead of $46,712,000 as proposed 
by the House and $42,412,000 as proposed by the Senate. Changes 
to the House level include decreases of $500,000 for the State 
Historic Preservation Offices and $1,000,000 for Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities. The amounts provided for each 
program are increases above the fiscal year 1999 levels.
      The conference agreement also includes $30,000,000 for 
the second and last year of the Millennium Program. These 
grants are subject to a fifty percent cost share and no single 
project may receive more than one grant from this program. The 
funds are to be distributed as follows:

                              Construction

      The conference agreement provides $225,493,000 for 
construction instead of $169,856,000 as proposed by the House 
and $223,153,000 as proposed by the Senate. The funds are to be 
distributed as follows:

      Bill Language.--The conference agreement does not include 
bill language as proposed by the House permitting Ellis Island 
to retain 100 percent of franchise fees subject to a 
requirement that these revenues be matched with non-Federal 
funds in fiscal year 2001.
      The conference agreement earmarks $885,000 for 
realignment of the Denali National Park and Preserve entrance 
road instead of $1,100,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides authority for the use 
of $3,000,000 for the FDR Memorial instead of $3,500,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The Service is directed to modify the 
scope of the project to accomplish the same goal of providing 
an appropriate space for the privately funded new sculpture. 
The National Park Service should work closely with the National 
Organization on Disability on the plans for installing a statue 
at the FDR Memorial in Washington, D.C.
      There are no earmarked funds for planning and development 
of interpretive sites at Saint Croix Island NHS as proposed in 
the Senate bill. Funds for this purpose should be derived from 
available planning funds.
      The conference agreement provides $500,000, subject to 
authorization, for studies on the preservation of certain Civil 
War battlefields along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail instead of 
$1,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides $3,000,000 for the 
Wheeling National Heritage Area construction instead of 
$5,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Language is included that provides one-year authorization 
of funding for the Lincoln Library and the Southwest 
Pennsylvania Heritage Area.
      Language in Title I, General Provisions provides the 
National Park Service with authority to obligate certain fees 
for transportation services at Zion National Park in advance of 
the receipt of such fees.
      The conference agreement provides $4,300,000 for the 
Brown v. Board of Education NHS in Kansas. These funds are to 
complete the rehabilitation of the building and for exhibit 
planning. The amount provided is based on a revised estimate of 
obligations in fiscal year 2000.
      Funds are provided for rehabilitation of sewer systems at 
Glacier National Park. The National Park Service has determined 
that the existing system cannot be upgraded sufficiently to 
meet state standards, and that therefore a replacement system 
likely will be required. Due to the additional time required to 
redesign the project, construction funds for this project 
cannot be obligated in fiscal year 2000.
      The conference agreement provides $2,300,000 for Glacier 
Bay National Park and Preserve in Alaska. It is intended that 
$1,400,000 be expended on the clean-up of contaminated soils at 
the site of the proposed visitor center. Another $400,000 is 
provided for the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of 
understanding with the park concessionaire to design a visitor 
center that will be co-managed and co-operated by the Service 
and the concessionaire. Design costs are to be shared equally 
between the Service and the concessionaire except that the 
concessionaire may use in-kind services, cash, or a combination 
of both, as its share. The facility is expected to be at least 
6,500 square feet and reserve an appropriate amount of space 
for non-exclusive use by the Hoonah Indian Association. In 
1998, Congress approved the Glacier Bay National Park Boundary 
Adjustment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-317), the purpose of which was 
to establish a process that could lead to the construction of a 
hydroelectric facility to provide power to Gustavus, Alaska. 
The hydroelectric project should be built and connected to the 
Park to protect the environment and to be more consistent with 
the purposes of the Park than the Park's use of diesel 
generators for power. Accordingly, $500,000 is expected to be 
made available as a grant to Gustavus Electric Company to pay 
for studies required by the Act.
      The conference agreement provides a total of $3,650,000 
for Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. These funds 
are intended for the following projects: $2,015,000 for site 
work, $885,000 for road realignment, $175,000 for the South 
Denali/CIRI plan, $125,000 for wildlife inventories and 
$450,000 for planning for Phase I. The conference agreement 
directs funding of $175,000 for the further development of 
plans to site National Park Service visitor services in 
facilities on Native lands near Talkeetna, Alaska.
      The conference agreement does not earmark planning funds 
specifically for Kenai Fjords National Park. To the extent 
funds previously appropriated for this project are not 
sufficient to continue planning through fiscal year 2000, the 
Service should seek to provide any necessary funds from 
available planning funds.
      The conference agreement provides $500,000 for the G.W. 
Memorial Parkway in Virginia. Of this total, $400,000 is 
available for a temporary alternative route at the Humpback 
Bridge, and $100,000 is to conduct and complete a study to 
extend the Mt. Vernon multi-use trail north to I-495 in 
Virginia.
      The conference agreement includes $1,000,000 for the 
National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati 
subject to a non-Federal match and the enactment of 
authorization.
      While the conference agreement has provided $3,000,000 in 
funds for a new Lincoln Library in Springfield, Illinois, 
$3,000,000 for Southwest Pennsylvania Heritage and $3,000,000 
for construction at the Wheeling National Heritage Area in West 
Virginia in fiscal year 2000, any future funding for these 
projects will be contingent on enacted authorization.
      The conference agreement provides a total of $500,000 for 
the research library administrative annex at Wilson's Creek 
National Battlefield Visitor Center in Missouri. This completes 
the federal share of this project.
      The conference agreement provides an appropriation of 
$675,000 for the New River Gorge National River, West Virginia, 
for various construction projects. The agreement notes that 
$500,000 in unobligated prior year funds are available to the 
New River Gorge for construction and that these funds are 
intended to be added to the $675,000 in new appropriations (for 
a total of $1,175,000) to carry out the highest priority 
construction needs of the New River Gorge National River for 
fiscal year 2000 as identified in Senate Report 106-99.
      The conference agreement has not provided funds for 
unscheduled housing because the unobligated balance in this 
account exceeds $22,000,000. The Committees have not agreed to 
release these funds until the Park Service agrees on a 
consistent new housing policy and standard construction designs 
that will be used for all trailer replacement units. The 
Service was supposed to present a complete package to the 
Committees on Appropriations in September 1999. As of November 
5, 1999, no such proposal had been forwarded. The Service is 
strongly encouraged to submit the information to the Committees 
on Appropriations for approval so that these funds can be 
released.
      The conference agreement provides $12,000,000 for the 
Olympic National Park Elwha dam removal project. Within the 
funds provided, the National Park Service is directed to use up 
to $5,500,000 to plan and design water supply mitigation 
measures for the City of Port Angeles. The National Park 
Service shall report final recommendations to the House and 
Senate Appropriations Committees no later than September 30, 
2000. The Park Service shall also reimburse the City for 
current and future sunk costs reasonably incurred in studying 
and preparing water supply mitigation options associated with 
removing the Elwha dams up to $500,000. The Park Service is 
urged to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the City 
of Port Angeles and other regional stakeholders setting forth 
the federal government's specific obligation with regard to the 
design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the 
domestic and industrial water mitigation measures as required 
by the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act of 
1992. The MOU should also define the specific roles of relevant 
federal agencies, the City of Port Angeles, and/or other 
regional stakeholders in the development and operation of the 
necessary water mitigation measures. The City of Port Angeles 
is encouraged to pursue an appropriate share of the costs 
related to upgrading its water system from the Environmental 
Protection Agency. An additional $10,000,000 is included for 
this project in Title VI.
      The National Park Service is urged to acquire title to 
the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams by February 29, 2000, subject 
to agreement between the owners and the National Park Service 
on the details of the transfer. Pending completion of planning, 
design, and engineering work for removal of the dams, the 
Secretary may cease power production if he determines that such 
production is not cost effective.
      The Service is directed to prepare special resource 
studies on the following areas: Anderson Cottage, Washington, 
District of Columbia;Bioluminescent Bay, Puerto Rico; Civil 
Rights Sites, multi-state; Crossroads of the American Revolution, 
Central New Jersey; Fort Hunter Liggett, California; Fort King, 
Florida; Gaviota Coast Seashore, California; Kate Mullany House, New 
York; Loess Hills, Iowa; Low Country Gullah Culture, multi-state; Nan 
Madol, State of Ponape, Federated States of Micronesia; Walden Pond and 
Woods, Massachusetts; World War II Sites, Commonwealth of the Northern 
Marianas; and World War II Sites, Republic of Palau. Bill language is 
included in Section 326 authorizing these studies.

                    land and water conservation fund

                              (rescission)

      The conference agreement rescinds the contract authority 
provided for fiscal year 2000 by 16 U.S.C. 460l-10a as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate.

                 Land Acquisition and State Assistance

      The conference agreement provides $120,700,000 for land 
acquisition including stateside grants instead of $132,000,000 
as proposed by the House and $107,725,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Funds should be distributed as follows:

      The conference agreement provides $2,000,000 to purchase 
an easement on Thompson Island as part of the Boston Harbor 
Islands National Recreation Area in Massachusetts. The release 
of these funds is contingent upon a non-federal match to 
acquire the balance of the easement on the property.
      The conference agreement provides $5,000,000 to the 
National Park Service (NPS) and $5,000,000 to the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM) for land acquisition within the 
California desert. This funding is based on the understanding 
that the Wildlands Conservancy will acquire 8,000 additional 
acres, in consultation with the NPS and BLM, from willing 
sellers and small private inholdings within Joshua Tree 
National Park and the Mojave National Preserve during the next 
year. An additional $5,000,000 is provided in Title VI for this 
land acquisition.
      No additional funds will be provided for Catellus land 
acquisition in future years unless and until the Department of 
the Interior and Department of Defense completely resolve 
remaining issues relating to desert tortoise mitigation and 
land acquisition and expansion at the National Training Center 
for the Army at Fort Irwin in California.
      Furthermore, the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations will consider an additional $15,000,000 for 
California desert land acquisition up to a total of 
$30,000,000. Future funding decisions will be based upon 
resolution by the two departments of the issues concerning 
desert tortoise mitigation and land acquisition and expansion 
at the National Training Center for the Army at Fort Irwin.
      The conference agreement provides $2,000,000 for land 
purchases at the Fredericksburg-Spotsylvania National Military 
Park in Virginia. Nearly $2,000,000 in previously appropriated 
funds have not been obligated. The Park is strongly urged to 
obligate fully the funds provided in fiscal years 1999 and 
2000. Future funding will not be provided until these funds are 
expended.
      The conference agreement provides an additional 
$1,600,000 for the Gettysburg National Military Park in 
Pennsylvania. This amount together with the $4,500,000 in 
unobligated balances from prior fiscal years will complete the 
purchase of the Brown Ranch and provide for the acquisition of 
the Tower, which was appraised at $3,000,000.
      The conference agreement provides the following: Lands 
shall not be acquired for more than the provided appraised 
value (as addressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91-646) 
except for condemnations and declarations of taking and tracts 
with an appraised value of $50,000 or less, unless such 
acquisitions are submitted to the Committees on Appropriations 
for approval in compliance with established procedures.
      The funds included for Paoli and Brandywine Battlefields 
are contingent upon authorization and a fifty percent non-
Federal match.
      The conference agreement provides the full $31,900,000 to 
complete the land acquisition needs of the Everglades National 
Park, Biscayne National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve. 
The agreement provides $10,000,000 for grants to Florida which 
are subject to a fifty percent match of newly appropriated non-
Federal funds. An additional $35,000,000 for these grants are 
provided in Title VI. The House bill language has been modified 
to make release of the grant funds to Florida subject to the 
submission of:
            (1) detailed legislative language to the House and 
        Senate Committees on Appropriations, agreed to by the 
        Secretaries of the Interior and Army and the Governor 
        of Florida, that provides assurances for the guaranteed 
        supply of water to the natural areas in Southern 
        Florida including all National Parks, Preserves, 
        Wildlife Refuges and other natural areas; and
            (2) a complete prioritized list of non-Federal land 
        acquisitions. All State grant funds are contingent on 
        new matching non-Federal funds and are subject to an 
        agreement that the lands to be acquired will be managed 
        in perpetuity for the restoration of the Everglades.
      The conference agreement also provides the additional 
$1,000,000 requested in the budget for acquisition management 
costs in Southern Florida but this amount is incorporated in 
the total acquisition management account. There was no need to 
provide a separate line for this purpose.
      The conference agreement provides $20,000,000 for Grants 
to States; an additional $20,000,000 is provided for this 
purpose in Title VI.
      Bill language allows the State of Wisconsin to receive 
grants for the purchase of lands for the Ice Age National 
Scenic Trail and North Country National Scenic Trail.

                    United States Geological Survey

                 surveys, investigations, and research

      The conference agreement provides $823,833,000 for 
surveys, investigations, and research instead of $820,444,000 
as proposed by the House and $813,093,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Increases above the House include $250,000 for the 
Hawaiian volcano program, $2,000,000 for minerals at risk, 
$500,000 for the Great Lakes mapping coalition project, 
$998,000 for watershed modeling, $100,000 for the endocrine 
disrupter study in the Las Vegas Wash, $500,000 for a 
monitoring well in Hawaii, $200,000 for a hydrologic study of 
Noyes Slough, $140,000 for the Southern Maryland ground water 
study, $180,000 for a Yukon River salmon study, $250,000 (for a 
total of $500,000) for repairs to the Leetown science center, 
and $500,000 for the Great Lakes boat restoration.
      Decreases below the House include $729,000 for 
technological efficiencies, $500,000 for the real time hazards 
program in the water resources division, $500,000 for amphibian 
research, and $500,000 for the cooperative research units.
      The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have 
agreed to approve in part the Survey's proposed budget 
restructuring by establishing new ``science support'' and 
``facilities'' budget line items. This action will improve the 
Survey's business practices and its relationship with its 
customers, and represents truth in budgeting. However, the 
Survey's proposal to establish a new ``integrated science'' 
budget activity is not agreed to. The House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations see the need for and importance of 
an integrated approach to science, but believe that 
establishing such a policy is primarily a management issue and 
not a function of the structure of the budget. The Director is 
encouraged to employ the appropriate management, operational, 
fiscal, and programmatic means at the Director's disposal in 
order to achieve the goal of establishing an integrated science 
approach where appropriate.
      Because of the severe budget constraints imposed on the 
appropriations process, no additional funds for new programs 
that were proposed in this year's budget were provided for. 
Therefore, no funds were provided for the community information 
partnership initiative or for the disaster information network.
      The Survey should give priority consideration to the 
installation of water gages on the Alabama, Coosa, Tallapoosa, 
Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers.
      The conference agreement restores $3,500,000 for coastal 
and marine geology programs. The conference agreement provides 
that a total of $1,250,000 is designated for continuation of 
the joint Survey-Sea Grant Consortium South Carolina/Georgia 
Coastal Erosion Study as outlined in the Phase II Study Plan, 
of which $250,000 is provided for the South Carolina coastal 
erosion monitoring program. Further, the Survey should continue 
its other high priority coastal and marine research programs, 
such as major studies of the Louisiana barrier islands, 
wetlands, hypoxia, and Lake Ponchartrain with the remaining 
available funds.
      The conference agreement provides $1,600,000 for the 
purchase of seismographic equipment as proposed by the House. 
It is expected that these funds will be allocated as indicated 
in the budget estimate.

                      Minerals Management Service

                Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management

      The conference agreement provides $110,682,000 for 
royalty and offshore minerals management as proposed by the 
Senate instead of $110,082,000 as proposed by the House.
      The $600,000 increase above the House is for the Center 
for Marine Resources and the Environmental Technology program.
      Within the funds provided $1,400,000 is earmarked for the 
Offshore Technology Resource Center at Texas A&M University for 
high-priority offshore research associated with deepwater 
development.

                           Oil Spill Research

      The conference agreement provides $6,118,000 for oil 
spill research as proposed by both the House and the Senate.

          Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement

                       Regulation and Technology

      The conference agreement provides $95,891,000 for 
regulation and technology as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$95,693,000 as proposed by the House. Funding for the 
activities should follow the Senate recommendation.

                    Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund

      The conference agreement provides $196,208,000 for the 
abandoned mine reclamation fund instead of $196,458,000 as 
proposed by the House and $185,658,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The agreement provides $181,019,000 for the 
environmental restoration activity, an increase of $10,879,000 
above the fiscal year 1999 funding level. Funding for the other 
activities follows the House recommendation. The House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations have agreed on the House 
proposal to designate $300,000 for the western Pennsylvania 
water quality demonstration project. The conference agreement 
authorizes up to $8,000,000 for the Appalachian clean streams 
initiative as proposed by the House. The agreement includes the 
Senate proposed language allowing all funds from Title IV of 
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act to be used as 
non-Federal cost shares.

                        Bureau of Indian Affairs

                      Operation of Indian Programs

      The conference agreement provides $1,670,444,000 for the 
operation of Indian programs instead of $1,631,050,000 as 
proposed by the House and $1,633,296,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Increases above the House include $5,000,000 for the 
Indian Self Determination Fund, $5,000,000 for other contract 
support costs, $320,000 for new tribes, $1,000,000 for student 
transportation, $3,000,000 for facilities operations, 
$2,000,000 for facilities maintenance, $3,000,000 for tribally 
controlled community colleges, $1,000,000 for fisheries 
enhancement, $500,000 for tribal resource management, 
$5,000,000 for implementation of the National Academy of Public 
Administration Report recommendations,$3,000,000 for 
environmental management, $20,000,000 for law enforcement, $250,000 for 
the Crownpoint Institute of Technology, and $600,000 for post secondary 
schools.
      Decreases below the House include $100,000 for Alaska 
legal services, $108,000 for general program activities, 
$3,573,000 for probate backlog, and $1,495,000 for land records 
improvement. From within available funds, the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs is directed to provide $108,000 to the United Sioux 
Tribes of South Dakota Development Corporation.
      Over the past several years, the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations and the Department of the Interior 
have been concerned with improving the management of the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs which has consistently been criticized for 
organizational shortcomings. During this period, a number of 
reforms have been put in place which were designed to improve 
the Bureau's effectiveness and accountability. To the Bureau's 
credit it has made substantial progress in addressing its 
management problems. However, to truly address these issues one 
needs an analysis of the structure of the Bureau, how its 
management has changed over time due to increased tribal 
contracting and compacting, and the lack of concurrent shifts 
in the Bureau's management structure to these changing 
circumstances. To this end, the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations working with the Department of the Interior 
commissioned a study of the Bureau by the National Academy of 
Public Administration (NAPA). The NAPA study was tasked with 
providing recommendations for improving the quality, 
efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of the Bureau's operations.
      The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have 
received copies of the NAPA report titled, ``A Study of 
Management and Administration: the Bureau of Indian Affairs''. 
The report provides some excellent recommendations to improve 
the administrative activities of the Bureau and managerial 
control over the Bureau. The most startling finding of the NAPA 
study was that some of the basic administrative functions that 
are necessary for effective management, and that exist in other 
organizations, are absent in the Bureau. This finding led NAPA 
to conclude that Bureau personnel are hard working dedicated 
employees who are not provided with the tools to effectively do 
their jobs. For example, NAPA concluded that, ``there is no 
existing capability to provide budget, human resources, policy, 
and other types of assistance to the Assistant Secretary--
Indian Affairs and the Bureau.'' Even prior to the NAPA report, 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations were aware 
that the Office of the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs did 
not have the capability to develop and analyze policy 
recommendations. Therefore, $250,000 has been provided under 
central office general administration as part of the fiscal 
year 2000 budget for the establishment of an office of policy 
analysis and planning in support of NAPA-related program reform 
efforts.
      Consequently, the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations have provided $5,000,000 to allow the Bureau to 
proceed with implementation of the NAPA report. In addition, 
the Bureau should incorporate the NAPA recommendations as part 
of the Bureau's fiscal year 2001 budget. It is recognized that 
implementation of the NAPA recommendations may require a 
reprogramming of funds. The Committees on Appropriations will 
look favorably on such requests and will try to expedite their 
approval. Lastly, the conference agreement directs the Bureau 
and the Department to keep the Committees on Appropriations 
fully informed as to the progress being made in implementing 
the NAPA recommendations.
      The conference agreement provides $592,000 for the Gila 
River Farms project with the understanding that the funding 
completes this multi-year agriculture project.
      Within the funds provided for the Indian Arts and Crafts 
Board $290,000 is earmarked for enforcement and compliance 
activities.
      In recognition of the many pressing needs in public 
safety and justice and in order to allow the tribes and the 
Bureau to determine the priorities among those needs, the 
conference agreement has not earmarked funds for animal welfare 
and control efforts within the funds provided for law 
enforcement. However, there is concern about the growing 
problems related to animal welfare and control on reservations 
and encourage the Bureau and the tribes to work with the Indian 
Health Service to determine if funding to address these 
problems should be included in future budget requests.

                              Construction

      The conference agreement provides $169,884,000 for 
construction instead of $146,884,000 as proposed by the Senate 
and $126,023,000 as proposed by the House.
      Changes to the House number include an increase of 
$45,374,000 for replacement school construction and decreases 
of $500,000 for employee housing and $1,013,000 from the safety 
of dams program. The funding increase provided for replacement 
school construction completes the next three schools on the 
priority list.
      The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations remain 
troubled over the growing number of requests to use unobligated 
prior year school operations funds for replacement or repair of 
Bureau funded schools. The Congress has increased school 
operations funding every year for the past five years based on 
analysis by the Department, the Bureau, and the tribes showing 
that school operation funds remain well below the per student 
national average. Based on this analysis the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations are not convinced that any school 
should have carryover operations funds at the end of the school 
year. Nevertheless, bill language has been included to allow 
the Tate Topa Tribal School, the Black Mesa Community School, 
and the Alamo Navajo School to use prior year operations funds 
for repair and replacement purposes. However, to ensure that 
the additional flexibility provided by this language does not 
create an incentive for schools to divert scarce operations 
dollars, any future requests require approval by the Secretary 
of the Interior. In addition, if this authority is used, the 
Secretary is directed to certify in writing to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations that this request will not 
negatively impact the school's academic standards.

 Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements and Miscellaneous Payments to 
                                Indians

      The conference agreement provides $27,256,000 for Indian 
land and water claim settlements and miscellaneous payments to 
Indians instead of $25,901,000 as proposed by the House and 
$27,131,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Increases above the House level include $1,000,000 for 
Aleutian Pribilof church repairs, $230,000 for the Truckee 
River, and $125,000 for the Walker River Paiute Tribe.

                 Indian Guaranteed Loan Program Account

      The conference agreement provides $5,008,000 for the 
Indian guaranteed loan program as proposed by the House instead 
of $5,004,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                       Administrative Provisions

      The conference agreement includes bill language under the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs Administrative Provisions as proposed 
by the Senate that allows the use of prior year school 
operations funds to be used for replacement or repair of Bureau 
schools if approved by the Secretary.
      The conference agreement modifies Senate proposed bill 
language included under the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
Administrative Provisions which clarifies that Bureau funded 
schools may share their campus with other schools that do not 
receive Bureau funding and have expanded grades, provided that 
any additional costs be provided by non-Federal sources.
      The conference agreement modifies Senate proposed bill 
language under Title I General Provisions to direct that the 
allocation of funds to post secondary schools during fiscal 
year 2000 be determined by the post secondary funding formula 
adopted by the Office of Indian Education.
      The Senate proposed bill language under General 
Provisions, Department of the Interior has been modified to 
allow the Secretary to redistribute Tribal Priority Allocation 
funds to address unmet needs, dual enrollment, overlapping 
service areas, or inaccurate distribution methodologies.

                          Departmental Offices

                            insular affairs

                       assistance to territories

      The conference agreement provides $70,171,000 for 
assistance to territories instead of $62,320,000 as proposed by 
the House and $67,325,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement follows the funding levels proposed by the 
Senate for the activities, except for a decrease of $154,000 
from the level proposed by the Senate for the Office of Insular 
Affairs and an increase of $3,000,000 to the territorial 
assistance activity for Compact-Impact aid to Guam as 
authorized by the Compact of Free Association Act (P.L. 99-
239). The conference agreement includes funding, as suggested 
by the Senate, for the Compact renegotiation process. The 
conference agreement also includes the language proposed by the 
Senate deferring part of the Covenant mandatory payment to the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The deferred 
funds are allocated to the Virgin Islands for federal mandates 
as directed by the Senate report. The Secretary should ensure 
that representatives of Hawaii are consulted during the 
upcoming compact renegotiation process so the impact to Hawaii 
of migrating citizens from the freely associated states is 
appropriately considered.

                      compact of free association

      The conference agreement provides $20,545,000 for the 
Compact of Free Association as proposed by both the House and 
the Senate.

                        Departmental Management

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement provides $62,864,000 for 
Departmental Management as proposed by the House instead of 
$62,203,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement 
provides for the following distribution of funds:

Departmental direction..................................     $11,665,000
Management and coordination.............................      22,780,000
Hearings and appeals....................................       8,047,000

                        Office of the Solicitor

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement provides $40,196,000 for the 
Office of the Solicitor instead of $36,784,000 as proposed by 
the House and the Senate. None of the funds may be used to hire 
new staff other than filling authorized vacancies and 
replacement of departing staff. The conference agreement 
provides for the following distribution of funds:

Legal services..........................................     $33,630,000
General administration..................................       6,566,000

                      Office of Inspector General

                         salaries and expenses

      The conference agreement provides $26,086,000 for the 
Office of Inspector General as proposed by the House instead of 
$26,614,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement 
provides for the following distribution of funds:

Audit...................................................     $15,266,000
Investigations..........................................       4,940,000
Administration..........................................       5,880,000

             Office of Special Trustee for American Indians

                         federal trust programs

      The conference agreement provides $90,025,000 for Federal 
trust programs as proposed by the House instead of $73,836,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      Prior to the Department deploying the Trust Asset and 
Accounting Management System (TAAMS) in any Bureau of Indian 
Affairs Area Office, with the exception of locations in the 
Billings area, the Secretary should advise the Committees on 
Appropriations that, based on the Secretary's review and 
analysis, such systems meet TAAMS contract requirements and 
user requirements.
      The conference agreement modifies House proposed bill 
language under Title I General Provisions to allow the 
Department to hire individuals other than administrative law 
judges (ALJ) to hear Indian probate cases, and to allow the 
Department to secure the services of ALJs from other Federal 
agencies as a means of reducing the Indian probate backlog.

                    Indian Land Consolidation Pilot

      The conference agreement provides $5,000,000 for the 
Indian land consolidation pilot as proposed by the House and 
Senate.
      The conference agreement includes a technical correction 
to the bill language to allow funds to be transferred to the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs for the administration of the 
consolidation pilot.

           Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration

                Natural Resource Damage Assessment Fund

      The conference agreement provides $5,400,000 for the 
natural resource damage assessment fund as proposed by the 
House instead of $4,621,000 as proposed by the Senate.

             GENERAL PROVISIONS, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

      The conference agreement includes sections 101 through 
112 and sections 114 and 115 from the Senate bill which 
continue provisions carried in past years.
      Section 113 contains a technical correction to the Senate 
language dealing with contract support costs paid by the 
Department of the Interior on Indian self-determination 
contracts and self-governance compacts as proposed by the 
House.
      Section 116 changes the name of the Steel Industry 
American Heritage Area to the ``Rivers of Steel National 
Heritage Area'' as proposed by the House. The Senate had no 
similar provision.
      Section 117 retains the text of section 116 as proposed 
by the Senate and provides for the protection of lands of the 
Huron Cemetery for religious and cultural uses and as a burial 
ground. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 118 retains the text of section 114 as proposed 
by the House and section 118 as proposed by the Senate which 
permits the retention of rebates from credit card services for 
deposit to the Departmental Working Capital Fund.
      Section 119 retains the text of section 115 as proposed 
by the House and section 119 as proposed by the Senate which 
permits the transfer of funds between the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians 
for the Trust Management Improvement Project High Level 
Implementation Plan.
      Section 120 makes permanent the exemption from certain 
taxes and special assessments for properties at Fort Baker, 
Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Senate had provided 
the exemption for one year.
      Section 121 retains the text of section 117 as proposed 
by the House and section 121 as proposed by the Senate which 
permits the retention of proceeds from agreements and leases at 
Fort Baker, Golden Gate National Recreation Area for 
preservation, restoration, operation, maintenance, 
interpretation and related activities.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed in section 118 of the House bill requiring the renewal 
of grazing permits in the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation 
Area. Senate section 124 contained a similar provision and it 
is not included in the agreement either.
       The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are 
deeply concerned with the National Park Service's change in 
policy regarding historical grazing in the Lake Roosevelt 
National Recreation Area. The NRA was established on Federal 
lands acquired or withdrawn for the Grand Coulee Dam project. 
In 1946 and again in 1990, the Secretary of the Interior 
designated the NPS as the manager of the Federal lands within 
the NRA.
      The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
recognize the cultural, custom and historic uses of the Lake 
Roosevelt National Recreation Area and expect the National Park 
Service to provide documentation to the Committees no later 
than July 1,2000, on the history of grazing and all other uses 
that have existed since 1935 under the terms and provisions of the 
Columbia Basin Act and since 1946 under the terms and provisions of the 
Tri-Party Agreement. The report shall include the following: parties 
affected, acreage affected, description of uses, impacts of such custom 
and culture on the local economy, an analysis of the circumstances 
surrounding the National Park Service assumption of management of the 
area and suggestions for appropriate legislative language.
      Section 122 makes a technical correction to the Omnibus 
Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-
333, 110 Stat. 4110) relating to a map reference to the Page 
Landing addition to the Colonial National Historical Park.
      Section 123 modifies language proposed by the House in 
section 119 and by the Senate in section 117. The modification 
renews grazing permits based on the same terms and conditions 
as the expiring permits or until the Department completes 
processing the existing grazing permit backlog. The Department 
is directed to develop and implement a schedule to address and 
alleviate this backlog as soon as possible. To this end the 
conference agreement has provided an additional $2,500,000 to 
expedite the grazing permit and lease renewal process. The 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations expect these 
renewals to be completed in a timely manner so there will no 
longer be a need to continue to address this problem.
      Section 124 modifies House section 120 and allows the 
Department to hire individuals other than administrative law 
judges and to secure the services of administrative law judges 
from other Federal agencies to address the Indian probate 
backlog. The Senate had no similar provision.
      Section 125 retains the text of section 121 as proposed 
by the House allowing American Samoa to receive a loan which 
will be repaid from its proceeds from a settlement agreement 
with tobacco manufacturers. The Senate had no similar 
provision. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
remain very concerned about the fiscal situation in American 
Samoa. The conference agreement includes the Senate proposal 
that the Secretary should not release certain funds withheld in 
fiscal year 1999 until the Secretary certifies that American 
Samoa implements activities regarding repayment for health care 
in Hawaii. It is expected that the substantial loan will be 
used effectively by American Samoa to provide a long-lasting 
fiscal remedy and economic development. The government is 
strongly encouraged to use some of these new funds for health 
care repayments which remain outstanding. The Secretary is 
directed to craft the final loan agreement so that the 
principal of $18,600,000, and interest calculated at the 
Congressional Budget Office's estimate of 5.4 percent, be fully 
repaid through the assignment of the tobacco lawsuit settlement 
funds over the next 26 years. At such time as these costs have 
been fully repaid the Secretary should act promptly to restore 
the tobacco settlement payments directly to American Samoa. The 
Secretary and the American Samoa government are also encouraged 
to work cooperatively to identify and bring economic 
development to the Territory. In addition, the Secretary is 
encouraged to consult with other Federal departments and 
agencies in this effort and make use of the recently 
established President's Interagency Group on Insular Areas to 
help achieve this goal.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the Senate in section 122 prohibiting the use of 
funds for the removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams.
      Section 126 modifies language as proposed by the Senate 
on a feasibility study for designating Midway Atoll as a 
National Memorial. The modification directs the Secretary, 
acting through the Fish and Wildlife Service (and its operating 
partner, Midway Phoenix Corporation) in coordination with the 
National Park Service, to pursue designation of Midway Atoll as 
a National Memorial to the Battle of Midway. It requires no 
study before establishment of the designation. The House had no 
similar provision. The Fish and Wildlife Service has an 
aggressive program underway at Midway relating to historic site 
protection, restoration and interpretation, and the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations fully support that effort 
by the Service and its operating partner.
      Section 127 modifies section 125 as proposed by the 
Senate and provides the Secretary one year to redistribute 
Tribal Priority Allocation funds to address unmet needs, dual 
enrollment, overlapping service areas or inaccurate 
distribution methodologies. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 128 retains the text of section 126 as proposed 
by the Senate prohibiting the use of funds to transfer land 
into trust status for the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe in Clark 
County, Washington, until the tribe and county reach agreement 
on development issues. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 129 modifies section 127 as proposed by the 
Senate and limits the use of funds to implement Secretarial 
Order 3206 regarding the administration of the Endangered 
Species Act on Indian tribal lands. The modification permits 
implementation of the order except for two provisions. The 
first provision, which may not be implemented, would give 
preferential treatment to Indian activities at the expense of 
non-Indian activities in determining conservation restrictions 
to species listed under the Endangered Species Act. The second 
would give preferential treatment to tribal lands at the 
expense of other privately owned lands in designating critical 
habitat under the Endangered Species Act. The House had no 
similar provision.
      Section 130 retains the text of section 128 as proposed 
by the Senate providing authority for the Bureau of Land 
Management to provide land acquisition grants to two local 
governments in Alaska. The House had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include section 129 as 
proposed by the Senate dealing with alternatives for the 
modification of Weber Dam. The projects listed in the section, 
however, have been funded and incorporated in the appropriate 
accounts. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 131 retains the text of section 130 as proposed 
by the Senate redirecting $1,000,000 from fiscal year 1999 
appropriated funds for acquisition of the Howard Farm near 
Metzger Marsh, Ohio. The House had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed in section 131 of the Senate bill to place a 
moratorium on the issuance of final procedures for class III 
Indian gaming. This action is based on assurances from the 
Secretary that he will not implement final procedures until the 
Federal courts have ruled on this issue.
      Section 132 modifies the text of section 132 as proposed 
by the Senate conveying certain lands to Nye County, Nevada. 
The House had no similar provision. The modification requires 
the county to pay an appropriate amount for the land.
      Section 133 modifies the text of section 133 as proposed 
by the Senate conveying certain lands to the City of Mesquite, 
Nevada. The House had no similar provision. The modification 
requires the completion of environmental review prior to land 
conveyance.
      Section 134 clarifies that section 134 as proposed by the 
Senate expresses the Sense of the Senate regarding exhibits 
commemorating the quadricentennial of European settlement at 
St. Croix Island IHS.
      Section 135 retains the text of section 135 as proposed 
by the Senate prohibiting the Department of the Interior from 
studying or implementing any plan to drain Lake Powell or 
reduce water levelsbelow levels required for the operation of 
Glen Canyon Dam. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 136 modifies section 136 as proposed by the 
Senate dealing with the prohibition of inspection fees on 
certain exported hides and skins. The modification specifies 
that the prohibition on fees does not apply to any person who 
ships more than 2,500 hides, skins or parts during the course 
of one year. The House had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the Senate in section 138 prohibiting the 
implementation of sound thresholds at Grand Canyon National 
Park until 90 days after the National Park Service has provided 
a report detailing the scientific basis for such thresholds. 
The House had no similar provision.
      Section 137 directs the Bureau of Indian Affairs to begin 
implementing the National Academy of Public Administration 
recommendations for improving the administration of the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs. In addition, this language directs that 
certain administrative functions be transferred from central 
office west to central office east. To facilitate this transfer 
and reduce any disruption, the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations have provided $5,000,000 and language on 
employee compensation to alleviate the impact of reductions in 
force.
      Section 138 modifies language as proposed by the Senate 
regarding funds appropriated in fiscal year 1998 for land 
acquisition in Haines Borough, Alaska.
      Section 139 modifies section 142 as proposed by the 
Senate so that funds appropriated for Bureau of Indian Affairs 
Post Secondary Schools for fiscal year 2000 shall be allocated 
by the Post Secondary Funding Formula adopted by the Office of 
Indian Education Programs. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 140 clarifies section 143 as proposed by the 
Senate that land and other reimbursement the Secretary may 
receive in the conveyance of the Twin Cities Research Center 
must be used for the benefit of the National Wildlife Refuge 
System in Minnesota and for activities authorized by Public Law 
104-134. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 141 modifies section 144 as proposed by the 
Senate regarding oil valuation regulations. This language 
places a moratorium on the issuance of the Minerals Management 
Service oil valuation regulations until March 15, 2000.
      Section 142 extends through 2003 the authority of the

                       TITLE II--RELATED AGENCIES

                       DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

                             Forest Service

                     Forest and Rangeland Research

      The conference agreement provides $202,700,000 for forest 
and rangeland research instead of $204,373,000 as proposed by 
the House or $187,444,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
agreement includes to the Senate proposal to direct $250,000 to 
study hydrological and biological impacts of lead and zinc 
mining on the Mark Twain National Forest, MO. The bill language 
concerning prospecting permits and land withdrawals on this 
national forest has been moved to Title III. The agreement 
includes a funding decrease of $2,574,000 from lower priority 
research but it does not include the Senate proposal to reduce 
non-forest health and productivity research specifically; nor 
are funds included for uncontrollable fixed cost support as 
proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement includes the House proposed 
funding level for the forest inventory and analysis program. 
This program should focus on cost share opportunities with 
state partners and give first priority to those states that 
have demonstrated a commitment to achieving the 20 percent 
annual plot measurement objective through cash or in-kind 
contributions.
      The conference agreement includes the funding for the 
activities at Mount St. Helens proposed by the House. The 
Pacific Northwest (PNW) research station should collaborate 
with the National Monument staff and non-Federal scientists to 
assemble, summarize and archive long-term data sets on 20 years 
of biological responses at Mount St. Helens. The PNW should 
convene scientists with past or future involvement with 
ecological studies at Mount St. Helens to synthesize current 
knowledge and promote future studies.
      The conference agreement provides no funding in the 
research account for the University of Washington landscape 
ecology study; rather, funds for this activity have been 
provided in the State and Private Forestry appropriation to 
maintain this effort at the fiscal year 1999 level.
      The conference agreement includes the Senate proposal for 
a funding increase at the Sitka, AK, forest center and includes 
a $300,000 increase above the fiscal year 1999 level for the 
Purdue University hardwood center. Funding for the Sitka 
facility should be included in the fiscal year 2001 budget 
justification.
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
proposal for the University of Montana research nor the Senate 
proposed expansion of the CROP program, but it does maintain 
the CROP program at the fiscal year 1999 level at the Colville 
National Forest, WA.
      The conference agreement moves $1,000,000 from the 
national forest system account for the PNW station to fund the 
demonstration of ecosystem management options (DEMO) program; 
if additional funds are needed, they should be taken from the 
national allocation to research. The agreement concurs with the 
Senate colloquy that projects at West Virginia, Vermont, and 
the Forest Products lab should be funded at the fiscal year 
1999 level as should the Coweeta and Bent Creek projects as 
proposed by the House. The agreement also provides that funding 
for the forest science laboratory in Juneau, AK, should be 
maintained at the fiscal year 1999 level.
      The conference agreement directs that up to $500,000 from 
the national allocation should be used, in a cost-share effort, 
to revise and update the Forest Service publication, ``Carbon 
Changes in U.S. Forests''. The updated publication should 
include all documentation of assumptions and methodologies used 
in estimating and projecting carbon sequestration using the 
forest carbon accounting model (FORCARB). A final draft of the 
updated publication should be presented to an accredited 
forestry school for scientific peer review by June 30, 2000, 
and an updated publication should be completed by September 30, 
2000, and submitted to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations.
      The conference agreement revises instructions regarding 
services provided by Forest Service scientists in support of 
NationalForest System (NFS) projects. Scientists should be 
available to support NFS project implementation as an important aspect 
of their professional public service and technology transfer 
responsibilities. The Forest Service is also encouraged to increase 
efforts at extramural research and pursue additional cost-sharing for 
the full scope of forest and rangeland research.

                       State and Private Forestry

      The conference agreement provides $202,534,000 for State 
and private forestry instead of $181,464,000 as proposed by the 
House and $190,793,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides $38,825,000 for Federal 
lands forest health management and $21,850,000 for cooperative 
lands forest health management. The agreement includes the 
House proposal on Asian long-horned beetle work in urban areas 
and the Senate proposal for the Vermont forest cooperative. The 
agreement fully funds the gypsy moth slow-the-spread program. 
The agreement redirects the Senate proposal for Kenai Peninsula 
Borough, AK, assistance to the state fire assistance activity. 
The conference agreement directs the Forest Service to improve 
the control or eradication of the pine beetles in the Rocky 
Mountain region of the United States; to conduct a study of the 
causes and effects of, and solutions for, the infestation of 
pine beetles in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States; 
and to submit to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations a report on the results of the study within six 
months of enactment of this Act.
      The conference agreement includes $24,760,000 for state 
fire assistance, including a special allocation of $250,000 for 
the Senate-proposed project for wildfire training and equipment 
in Kentucky and $2,000,000 for hazardous tree removal resulting 
from spruce bark beetle infestations in the Kenai Peninsula 
Borough, AK. The agreement includes the Senate direction 
concerning a direct lump sum payment to the Kenai Peninsula 
Borough and other direction concerning this funding. The 
conference agreement includes $3,250,000 for volunteer fire 
assistance, an increase of $1,250,000 above the fiscal year 
1999 funding level.
      The conference agreement includes $29,430,000 for forest 
stewardship as proposed by the House. This funding includes the 
House-proposed funding for the New York City watershed and the 
NE Pennsylvania community forestry program and the Senate 
proposed funding for the Chesapeake Bay program. The conference 
agreement includes $25,000,000 for the forest legacy program of 
which $1,500,000 is directed for the Jefferson and Randolph, 
NH, project as proposed by the Senate, $2,000,000 is included 
for the Nicatous Lake, Phase 2 project in Maine and $1,500,000 
is for the Panguitch Lake, UT, project. The Forest Service and 
the States should develop forest legacy selection criteria that 
emphasize projects which enhance federal lands, federal 
investments, or past federal assistance efforts. The conference 
agreement includes $31,300,000 for the urban and community 
forestry program which includes the House-proposed increase for 
the NE Pennsylvania forestry program and $500,000 for the 
Senate-proposed Salt Lake City Olympic tree program. The Forest 
Service is encouraged to work with and help support the Chicago 
green streets program for urban forestry. The agreement does 
not include the Senate direction concerning headquarters 
staffing for the urban and community forestry program, but 
greater cost savings are encouraged at headquarters and 
regional office levels. In addition, the Forest Service is 
directed to commission an independent study or panel to assess 
the feasibility and potential for enhanced efficiency by block-
granting all or portions of the cooperative forestry program. 
This evaluation should be done in consultation with the state 
foresters, the Society of American Foresters, and other 
interested professional or citizens groups.
      The conference agreement includes the following funding 
for the economic action program and the Pacific Northwest 
assistance program:

        Pacific Northwest Assistance program total......       8,000,000

      The conference agreement directs that within the funds 
provided for the rural development through forestry program 
$3,000,000 is directed for the Northeast-Midwest area. The 
agreement includes $500,000 for the Northern Forest Heritage 
Park, NH, within the available funds for the economic recovery 
program but the agreement stipulates that this will be the 
final Forest Service commitment for this effort and that this 
funding shall come from the allocation otherwise available to 
the Northeastern area.
      The conference agreement provides an increase of $100,000 
in addition to the $100,000 for the Hawaii forests and 
communities initiative within the economic action program as 
requested by the Administration. The agreement provides an 
increase of $975,000 for the Princeton, WV, hardwood center in 
addition to $1,520,000 included in the forest products 
conservation and recycling activity within the economic action 
program as requested by the administration. This brings the 
Princeton hardwood center funding to the FY 1999 level. The 
agreement also provides an increase of $500,000 for the Four 
Corners sustainable forestry initiative which is in addition to 
$500,000 that the agreement includes within the rural 
development through forestry activity as requested by the 
administration; this latter $500,000 should come from the 
region's allocation. The agreement concurs with the Senate 
direction on lump sum payments with respect to the Forks, WA, 
Training Center.
      The conference agreement revises instructions proposed by 
the House concerning the American Heritage Rivers initiative; 
the Forest Service may allocate up to $300,000 for this effort. 
This funding should be used entirely for field activities, and 
no funds should be transferred to or used to fund personnel, 
training or other administrative activities at the Council on 
Environmental Quality or national interdepartmental 
coordination or training efforts. Bill language is also 
included in Title III concerning this matter. The agreement 
does not object to the Forest Service continuing to provide 
headquarters and regional administrative or technical support 
for this effort as they would for any program, but no staff at 
regional, headquarters or departmental levels should be 
substantially dedicated to this initiative. The Forest Service 
is encouraged to develop cost-share efforts for this initiative 
to the maximum extent feasible.

                         National Forest System

      The conference agreement provides $1,269,504,000 for the 
national forest system instead of $1,254,434,000 as proposed by 
the House and $1,239,051,000 as proposed by the Senate. Funds 
should be distributed as follows:

Land management planning................................     $40,000,000
Inventory and monitoring................................      88,350,000
Recreation management...................................     155,500,000
Wilderness management...................................      30,151,000

                    ____________________________________________________
      Total, NFS........................................   1,269,504,000

      The conference agreement includes the following 
congressional priorities: recreation management includes a 
$500,000 increase for the Monongahela National Forest, WV, as 
proposed by the Senate; rangeland vegetation management 
includes $300,000 for noxious weed control on the Okanogan NF, 
WA, as proposed by the Senateand $400,000 for Region 5 grazing 
monitoring as proposed by the House; timber sales management includes 
$2,000,000 for the aspen program in Colorado as proposed by the Senate; 
forestland vegetation management includes $240,000 for pinelands work 
on the Mark Twain NF, MO, and $500,000 for spruce budworm work on the 
Gifford Pinchot NF, WA, proposed by the Senate and $300,000 for the 
CROP project on the Colville NF, WA, and $300,000 for Cradle of 
Forestry, NC, environmental education as proposed by the House. The 
agreement provides no funds for the newly proposed forest ecosystem 
restoration and improvement activity but $2,000,000 is included in the 
forestland vegetation management activity for work of this nature as 
well as $1,000,000 for the Blue Ridge project on the Apache-Sitgreaves 
NF that the Senate had proposed funding within the forest ecosystem 
restoration and improvement activity. The Forest Service should 
consider enhancing the ecosystem restoration program, including the use 
of partnerships, in Region 3. The conference agreement also includes 
$1,000,000 for the Wayne NF, OH, acid mine drainage work as proposed by 
the House; $750,000 for Lake Tahoe basin watershed improvements 
proposed by the Senate; and $750,000 for the Weyerhaeuser-Huckleberry 
land exchange supplemental environmental impact statement in Washington 
state as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement modifies bill language proposed 
by the House to require the display of unobligated balances by 
extended budget line items in the fiscal year 2001 budget 
justification.
      The conference agreement provides funding in the timber 
sales management activity sufficient to maintain the same total 
timber sale volume as was proposed for fiscal year 1999; the 
total sale volume for fiscal year 2000 should be no less than 
the volume in fiscal year 1999. The report proposed by the 
Senate concerning timber growth, inventory and mortality should 
be submitted to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations within 180 days of enactment. The drug law 
enforcement effort in Kentucky funding should be maintained at 
the 1999 level. The Forest Service should cooperate with the 
City of Fredonia, AZ, on standards for facilities for the North 
Kaibab ranger station and consider entering into an agreement 
with the city to occupy the facilities upon completion.
      The conference agreement revises instructions proposed by 
the House concerning a detailed report on USDA and Forest 
Service fiscal, budget and related business activities. The 
Forest Service and the Department of Agriculture should present 
a clear exposition in their budget justifications explaining 
their respective responsibilities and funding concerning 
fiscal, budget and related business activities. The agreement 
also requests that the Forest Service provide a report to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days 
of enactment describing the public affairs and communications 
programs and outlining objectives, performance measures and 
expected costs for this effort. The agreement concurs with 
House recommended language concerning the Knutson-Vandenburg 
reforestation fund, salvage sale and brush disposal funds 
except that these funds may be used for national commitments 
within the Forest Service if the project relates to the fund's 
administration, management or authorized activity.
      The conference agreement concurs with the House language 
that directs that no funds be used for the natural resource 
agenda or conservation education national commitment categories 
until a detailed, agency-wide spending plan, including funding 
sources and expected results, is approved by the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations. The agreement directs that 
no funds be used for the construction of a national museum or 
visitor center in the Sidney R. Yates building without the 
review and approval of the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations. The agreement does not request the GSA report 
requested by the Senate concerning alternative office space for 
the Washington Office at this time.
      Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area--The 
agreement notes that the Energy and Water Development 
Appropriations Act, 2000, does not include funding for 
operation of the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation 
Area, KY and TN. Therefore, the management of this area will be 
transferred from the Tennessee Valley Authority to the U.S. 
Forest Service as directed by the Land Between the Lakes 
Protection Act of 1998 Title V of Sec. 101(e) of Public Law 
105-277). The Land Between the Lakes (LBL) shall be managed as 
part of the national forest system for recreation in a manner 
consistent with the multiple use mandate of the Forest Service 
and the original 1972 LBL mission statement. The conference 
agreement also directs an orderly transfer of management from 
the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Forest Service. The 
agreement directs that the previously published guidelines for 
the transfer be followed; these are delineated on pages 1246 
and 1247 of House Report 105-825 accompanying P.L. 105-277, the 
Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations 
Act for fiscal year 1999. The agreement includes a total of 
$7,000,000 for the operation of LBL; this includes $5,400,000 
in the national forest system appropriation, $1,300,000 in the 
reconstruction and maintenance appropriation and $300,000 in 
the wildland fire management appropriation account.
      The Forest Service wilderness management policy should 
consider the need for mitigating the adverse effect of human 
impact on vegetation, soil, water and wildlife. The agreement 
suggests that the policy should consider solitude as one among 
a number of qualities valuable to a wilderness experience but 
recognize that the 1964 Wilderness Act does not require 
solitude on every trail. The Forest Service should not impose a 
wilderness-wide blanket of determining use by social encounters 
(solitude).
      The conference agreement recognizes the structural 
problems of the Long Park Dam in Daggett County, Utah. 
Recognizing the unique circumstances of the dam, its proximity 
to the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area, and its 
significant contribution to the local economy of Daggett 
County, Utah, the agreement encourages the Secretary of 
Agriculture to make repair of the dam a priority within the 
Department of Agriculture's Natural Resource Conservation 
Service appropriation. The State of Utah is participating in 
the project on a 50/50 cost share basis. Should budgetary 
adjustments be necessary to provide for the federal share, the 
Secretary should do so in consultation with the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations.

                        Wildland Fire Management

      The conference agreement provides $651,354,000 for 
wildland fire management instead of $561,354,000 as proposed by 
the House and $650,980,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement includes funding for fire operations and 
preparedness (including Land Between the Lakes NRA) as proposed 
by the House and contingent emergency funding as proposed by 
the Senate. The agreement concurs with the Senate direction 
concerning acquisition of a high band radio system for the 
Monongahela NF, WV. The agreement calls for about $70,000,000 
to be reserved for hazardous fuel operations of which $500,000 
is designated for hazardous tree removal on the Chugach 
National Forest, AK, and $1,500,000 is for implementing the 
Quincy Library group project as proposed by the Senate. The 
agreement does not specify any set amount of funding for 
particularly severe forest health areas as proposed by the 
House, but the Forest Service should follow other House and 
Senate instructions concerning this program, including a report 
within120 days and full integration of this program with other 
vegetation, habitat management and watershed improvement programs. The 
agreement includes bill language proposed by the House which requires 
the transfer of not less than 50 percent of the unobligated balances 
remaining at the end of fiscal year 1999 to pay back funds previously 
advanced from the Knutson-Vandenburg reforestation fund during severe 
emergencies. This fund is still owed $392,871,000 which was advanced 
for emergency wildfire fighting during previous years. The 
administration is again encouraged to make efforts to repay this 
important environmental restoration and protection fund.

                     Reconstruction and Maintenance

      The conference agreement provides $398,927,000 for 
reconstruction and maintenance instead of $396,602,000 as 
proposed by the House and $362,095,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement provides for the following 
distribution of funds:

               Facilities Reconstruction and Construction

                                                                  Amount

      Total reconstruction and maintenance..............     398,927,000

      The conference agreement has included bill language as 
proposed by the Senate that requires the Forest Service to 
provide an opportunity for public comment on each road 
decommissioning project. The conference agreement has provided 
sufficient road reconstruction and construction funding to 
allow the timber sales program to offer the same level of 
harvest as in fiscal year 1999. The agreement notes that funds 
will not be used for the direct construction of new timber 
access roads; rather, the timber purchasers will provide for 
the actual construction, although the Forest Service will 
continue to provide all needed engineering support and project 
guidance. The agreement does not include the Senate 
recommendation that road reconstruction decreases should come 
from the Region 10 funding. The agreement includes $100,000 for 
Noe's Dock boat ramp and $325,000 for the Rockcastle project on 
the Daniel Boone NF, KY, and directs that the $300,000 in the 
budget request originally designated for the Region 9 office 
move shall be used for the heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning systems at the Forest Products Lab, WI. The 
agreement emphasizes that the funding authorization for the 
Auburn University forestry school construction project requires 
the University to provide the Forest Service with rent-free use 
of space for the life of the building for collaborative 
research.

                            Land Acquisition

      The conference agreement provides $79,575,000 in new land 
acquisition funds and a reprogramming of $40,000,000 in prior 
year funds instead of a total of $1,000,000 as proposed by the 
House and $36,370,000 as proposed by the Senate. Funds should 
be distributed as follows:

        State and project                                         Amount

      Total.............................................     $79,575,000

      The conference agreement provides $1,000,000 for the 
Osceola National Forest, FL, to acquire black bear habitat. The 
agreement makes these funds contingent on an equal match from 
non-Federal sources. The project need is in excess of 
$100,000,000. The State of Florida should partner with the 
Federal government on this and other projects which are under 
serious development threat. The conference agreement notes that 
the State's annual land acquisition budget exceeds that of the 
Federal program; the agreement provides Stateside land and 
water grants within the National Park Service appropriation for 
the first time in five years.
      The conference agreement provides $3,000,000 for the 
Pacific Northwest Streams initiative. Of this amount, 
$2,000,000 is available for the Bowe Ranch, WA, and $1,000,000 
for the Bonanza Queen Mine, WA.
      Senate Report 105-56, which accompanied the Fiscal Year 
1999 Interior and Related Agencies Act, included a limitation 
on the purchase price for the acquisition of certain lands in 
the Columbia River Gorge NSA (CRGNSA), and also required a 
donation of a 40-acre tract adjacent to the CRGNSA. Both of 
these directives are hereby rescinded. The Forest Service shall 
notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations before 
finalizing the acquisition of these properties if the combined 
value of the acquisition of the Cannard Tract and the adjacent 
40-acre parcel totals more than $625,000. The agreement 
includes $40,000,000 in previously appropriated funds for 
acquisition of the Baca Ranch subject to a specific 
authorization. An additional $61,000,000 for the Baca Ranch 
acquisition is included in Title VI.

         Acquisition of Lands for National Forests Special Acts

      The conference agreement provides $1,069,000 for the 
acquisition of lands for national forests special acts as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

            Acquisition of Lands to Complete Land Exchanges

      The conference agreement provides an indefinite 
appropriation estimated to be $210,000 for the acquisition of 
lands to complete land exchanges as proposed by both the House 
and the Senate.

                         Range Betterment Fund

      The conference agreement provides an indefinite 
appropriation estimated to be $3,300,000 for the range 
betterment fund as proposed by both the House and the Senate.

    Gifts, Donations and Bequests for Forest and Rangeland Research

      The conference agreement provides $92,000 for gifts, 
donations and bequests for forest and rangeland research as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

               Administrative Provisions, Forest Service

      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the House concerning Committee approval of 
organizational restructuring. However, the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations are concerned that the Forest 
Service is not doing all that is practicable to see that the 
maximum amount of funding gets to the field where there is so 
much need for management action and public service. In 
addition, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are 
concerned that the Forest Service has established new staff 
units within the Washington Office with very little 
Congressional consultation. While the agreement concurs that 
additional resources may be necessary to improve agency 
accountability, such increases should be strictly limited in 
order to assure maximum availability of funds for program 
accomplishment. The agreement directs the Forest Service to 
consult the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior 
to establishing new units in the Washington Office where such 
units report to Associate Deputy Chiefs or above and for major 
reorganizations in the field where there is a significant 
deviation from the current organizational structure. Such 
deviation would be significant if the reorganizations involve a 
net increase in administrative support needs or where groups of 
employees are geographically relocated.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the House allowing the Secretary to use any 
available funds during wildland fire emergencies; the 
conference agreement continues the previous procedures as 
proposed by the Senate. The agreement includes House language 
which allows the release of non-wildland fire management funds 
for wildland emergencies only when all previously appropriated 
emergency contingent wildland fire funds have been released by 
the President and apportioned. The House and Senate Committees 
on Appropriations remain concerned that this Administration has 
been overly anxious to spend the KV reforestation fund on 
wildland fire emergencies and not sufficiently interested in 
paying the KV fund back. This fund provides for vital 
environmental restoration and protection activities including 
tree planting, watershed restoration, and wildlife and fish 
habitat enhancement.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the House preventing the transfer of Forest Service 
funds to the USDA working capital fund without advance approval 
from the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Clear 
statements should be included in future budget justifications 
concerning these and other departmental charges; the Forest 
Service should not be charged for Department of Agriculture 
administrative activities which should be funded by the 
Agriculture appropriations bill. In addition to the display 
contained in the agency budget justification, the agency should 
inform the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
immediately if the estimated total amount of funds to be 
transferred during the fiscal year differs from the agency 
estimate by more than 10 percent. The conference agreement 
further instruct the Secretary to provide the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations with a plan no later than March 
31, 2000, for reduction of total charges against the agency 
beginning in fiscal year 2000.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate concerning clearcutting on the Shawnee National 
Forest, IL; this language was carried in previous bills. The 
conference agreement includes the Senate proposed funding level 
for the National Forest Foundation and includes the House 
proposed language concerning the payment to the National Fish 
and Wildlife Foundation. The agreement includes bill language 
proposed by the Senate concerning the definition of overhead 
and indirect expenses and limiting indirect expenses to 20 
percent for certain trust funds and cooperative work funds. The 
House language is included which allows up to $500,000 to be 
transferred to the Office of the General Counsel for certain 
travel and related expenses; the Senate had included similar 
language. The agreement modifies language proposed by the 
Senate allowing any funds available to the Forest Service to be 
used for law enforcement during emergencies; the modified 
language allows any funds to be used up to a maximum of 
$500,000 per year. This authority should only be used during 
real emergencies and every effort should be made to pay back 
the borrowed funds promptly during subsequent years. The 
agreement concurs with the House direction regarding the 
International Forestry program and it includes the Senate 
provision authorizing use of Forest Service funds to pay a 
certain employee for part of the cost of his house and 
possessions which were destroyed by arson because this arson 
appears to be retaliation for him performing his official job 
duties.
      The agreement includes bill language directing that 
$5,000,000 be allocated to the Alaska Region from fiscal year 
1999 unobligated balances (excluding unobligated balances from 
the Alaska region) in addition to the $20,600,000 appropriated 
to sell timber in the normal base program for fiscal year 2000. 
The funds provided from unobligated balances, plus $5,100,000 
from the base program, shall be used to prepare and make 
available timber sales to establish a three year timber supply 
for operators on the Tongass National Forest. Sales are to be 
prepared which have a high probability of being sold in order 
to facilitate a reliable Federal timber supply and transition 
to value added processing for the forest products industry in 
Southeast Alaska.
      The conference agreement also includes bill language 
which appropriates $22,000,000 to the Southeast Alaska economic 
disaster fund to be distributed over three years to the 
Ketchikan Gateway Borough, the City of Petersburg, the City and 
Borough of Sitka and the Metlakatla Indian Community. These 
funds are to be provided as direct lump sum payments and are to 
be used to employ unemployed timber workers and for related 
community redevelopment projects.
      The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have 
received the report from the National Academy of Public 
Administration (NAPA) on the Forest Service financial systems 
and budget structures. The House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations are currently reviewing this important study and 
have assurances from the Secretary that he and the Forest 
Service will provide, by October 31, 1999, a report outlining 
specific steps, with deadlines, that the Forest Service will 
take to evaluate and implement NAPA recommendations as 
appropriate. The Academy's findings that the Forest Service has 
shown a substantial lack of leadership concerning managerial 
accountability are of great concern. The Forest Service and the 
Secretary should continue consultation with the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations concerning changes required 
to respond to this NAPA study. The Forest Service budget 
formulation and allocation processes do not provide sufficient 
linkage between on-the-ground needs and funding priority work. 
The Service must also address the consequences of inadequate 
performance. Development and implementation of sound 
performance measures will be needed before major budget 
restructuring is likely to be accepted by the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations. Another concern involves about 
the Forest Service granting approval to expand greatly the 
chief financial officer's staffing at headquarters: the Forest 
Service should pay close attention to NAPA recommendations 
concerning this matter and organizational structure.

                          Department of Energy

                         Clean Coal Technology

                               (Deferral)

      The conference agreement provides for the deferral of 
$156,000,000 in previously appropriated funds for the clean 
coal technology program as proposed by the Senate instead of a 
deferral of $256,000,000 as proposed by the House. Up to 
$14,400,000 may be used for program direction.

                 Fossil Energy Research and Development

                     (including transfer of funds)

      The conference agreement provides $419,025,000 for fossil 
energy research and development instead of $280,292,000 as 
proposed by the House and $390,975,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. Of the amount provided, $24,000,000 is derived by 
transfer from the biomass energy development account.
      Changes to the House position in advanced clean fuels 
research include increases of $300,000 for coal preparation/
carbon extraction from coal and $250,000 for indirect 
liquefaction and a decrease of $1,475,000 for direct 
liquefaction. For the advanced clean efficient power system 
program there is a decrease of $1,000,000 for low emissions 
boiler systems and an increase of $1,500,000 for Vision 21.
      For natural gas programs there are increases to the House 
position in exploration and production of $375,000 for arctic 
research and $1,000,000 for methane hydrates; increases in 
advanced turbine systems of $800,000 for mid-size turbines, 
$2,500,000 for ramgen technology (coalbed methane), and 
$41,008,000 for the utility turbines program that the House had 
proposed to transfer to the Energy Conservation account; and 
increases in emerging process technology of $1,000,000 for gas-
to-liquids/ITM Syngas and $2,000,000 for coal mine methane.
      Changes to the House position in the oil technology 
program include increases of $375,000 for arctic research and 
$250,000 for reservoir characterization/northern mid-continent 
atlas in exploration and production; an increase of $750,000 
for risk based data management systems and a decrease of 
$2,000,000 for preferred petroleum upstream management in 
recovery field demonstrations; and an increase of $3,500,000 
for diesel biodesulfurization in Alaska.
      Other changes to the House position include increases of 
$5,000,000 for the black liquor gasification program, $600,000 
for cooperative research and development, $2,400,000 for 
federal energy technology center program direction, $600,000 
for general plant projects, and $79,000,000 which eliminates a 
general reduction to fossil energy programs.
      The conference agreement provides for the following:
      1. The black liquor gasification program should include 
the active involvement of the appropriate officials within the 
industries of the future program in energy conservation.
      2. The funds provided for laser drilling may be used for 
other innovative technologies in addition to laser drilling.
      3. Within the methane hydrate program, the Department is 
encouraged to consider the expertise of the Gulf of Mexico 
Hydrate Research Consortium in safety-related research.
      4. Consideration should be given to a proposal to enhance 
the quality of low-grade sub-bituminous coal from the Powder 
River Basin by permanently removing moisture from the coal. 
This proposal also would provide economic development benefits 
for the Crow Nation. The Department is urged to evaluate this 
proposal and to consider providing technical assistance or 
other funding support to the extent the project represents a 
significant advance in coal dewatering technology, is 
consistent with the goals and objectives of the fossil energy 
program, and involves an appropriate degree of cost sharing.
      5. The Department's PM 2.5 monitoring and research 
efforts should focus on developing data that respond to the 
fine particulate research needs identified in the 
Congressionally-mandated ``National Research Council Priorities 
for Airborne Particulate Matter.'' To the extent feasible, the 
Department should coordinate with industry, State and 
university research efforts to clarify the uncertainties in the 
current understanding of fine particulate matter concentration, 
chemical composition and the relationship between personal 
exposure and ambient air quality. Research results should help 
Federal and State environmental regulators design plans that 
comply with the PM 2.5 ambient air standard and protect the 
public health.

                      Alternative Fuels Production

                     (Including Transfer of Funds)

      The conference agreement provides, as proposed by both 
the House and the Senate, for the deposit of investment income 
earned as of October 1, 1999, on principal amounts in a trust 
fund established as part of the sale of the Great Plains 
Gasification Plant in Beulah, ND, and immediate transfer of the 
funds to the General Fund of the Treasury. The amount available 
as of October 1, 1999, is estimated to be $1,000,000.

                 Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves

      The conference agreement provides no new funding for the 
Naval petroleum and oil shale reserves as proposed by both the 
House and the Senate. Unobligated funds from previous fiscal 
years should be sufficient to continue necessary operations in 
fiscal year 2000.

                      Elk Hills School Lands Fund

      The conference agreement provides $36,000,000 for the 
second payment from the Elk Hills school lands fund as proposed 
by the House instead of no funding as proposed by the Senate. 
This payment will be delayed until October 1, 2000, and the 
payment should be made on that date or as soon thereafter as 
possible.

                          Energy Conservation

                     (Including Transfer of Funds)

      The conference agreement includes $745,242,000 for energy 
conservation instead of $731,822,000 as proposed by the House 
and $684,817,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of the amount 
provided, $25,000,000 is derived by transfer from the biomass 
energy development account.
      Changes to the House position in building research and 
standards include increases of $2,201,000 for building America 
and $500,000 for technology roadmaps and a decrease of $300,000 
for industrialized housing in residential buildings; an 
increase of $1,700,000 for commercial buildings research and 
development; and increases of $470,000 for lighting research 
and development, $3,250,000 for space conditioning and 
refrigeration, $1,800,000 for cogeneration/fuel cells and 
$1,797,000 for lighting and appliance standards in equipment, 
materials and tools. For the building technology and assistance 
program there is an increase of $2,000,000 for the 
weatherization assistance program and an increase of $500,000 
for State energy program grants. For management and planning 
there is a decrease of $300,000 in support for State and local 
grants. There are also increases of $1,000,000 for Rebuild 
America, $2,000,000 for cooperative programs with States and 
$3,900,000 for the energy efficiency science initiative.
      Changes to the House position in industry programs 
include increases of $1,000,000 for the petroleum refining 
vision for biodesulfurization of gasoline, $2,000,000 for 
reciprocating engines $2,000,000 for a cogeneration field test 
and $2,000,000 for characterization of oxidation behavior and a 
decrease of $3,000,000 for industrial turbines in distributed 
generation; an increase of $300,000 for technical assistance/
integrated delivery; an increase of $500,000 for precision 
forging; a decrease of $41,008,000 for utility turbines that 
the House had proposed to transfer from the fossil energy 
account; and decreases of $550,000 for NICE \3\, $100,000 for 
inventions and innovations, $200,000 for industrial assessment 
centers, $400,000 for motors and compressed air, and $250,000 
for steam challenge. There are also increases of $2,000,000 for 
cooperative programs with the States and $3,900,000 for the 
energy efficiency science initiative.
      Changes to the House position for transportation 
programs/vehicle technology include an increase of $3,000,000 
for advanced power electronics and a decrease of $1,900,000 in 
hybrid systems; increases of $400,000 for fuel cell systems, 
$1,600,000 for stock components, and $2,620,000 for fuel 
processing and storage in fuel cell research and development; 
decreases of $500,000 each for light truck engines and for 
heavy truck engines in the advanced combustion engine program; 
and increases of $800,000 each for CARAT and GATE in 
cooperative research. For fuels utilization there are increases 
of $1,600,000 for advanced petroleum fuels for heavy trucks and 
$1,000,000 for alternative fuels for automobiles/light trucks. 
For technology deployment there is a decrease of $10,000 for 
advanced vehicle competitions. There are also increases of 
$1,000,000 for high power energy storage, $2,000,000 for heavy 
vehicle propulsion systems, $3,000,000 for combustion and 
aftertreatment, $1,000,000 for heavy vehicle systems, 
$1,500,000 for advanced petroleum fuels for automobiles and 
light trucks, $1,000,000 for automotive lightweight materials, 
$2,000,000 for cooperative programs with the States, and 
$3,900,000 for the energy efficiency science initiative. In 
policy and management there is an increase of $1,000,000 for a 
National Academy of Sciences review of fossil fuel and 
conservation research efforts as described below and decreases 
of $100,000 for the headquarters working capital fund, $300,000 
for international market development programs, and $200,000 for 
information and communications.
      Bill Language.--Bill language proposed by the House that 
requires a 25 percent State cost share for the weatherization 
assistance program has been modified. The modification delays 
the cost-sharing requirement until fiscal year 2001 and 
thereafter to allow sufficient time for the States to prepare 
for this new requirement. The cost share must be non-Federal 
for each State or other qualified participant but is not 
strictly limited to funds appropriated by each State or other 
qualified participant.
      The conference agreement provides for the following:
      1. While language in the bill earmarking funds for grants 
to municipal governments as proposed by the Senate has not been 
included, the Department is urged to continue working closely 
with municipal governments and with the States to address 
municipal and community energy challenges. The Department 
should support worthy project proposals that address these 
issues within the amount provided for the buildings, industry 
and transportation programs.
      2. The direction in the House report with respect to 
continuing fiscal year 1999 programs does not preclude the 
program eliminations and consolidations proposed in the budget 
request unless expressly identified to the contrary.
      3. In addition to the development project identified in 
the Senate report, the amount provided for fuel cells for 
buildings includes $750,000 to continue the partnership 
established with Materials and Electrochemical Research 
Corporation to work on polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel 
cells in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
      4. Within the funds provided for the Industries of the 
Future petroleum program, the Department is encouraged to 
continue support for research on the biocatalytic 
desulfurization of gasoline.
      5. The reciprocating engine program should include the 
active involvement of the appropriate officials within the 
fossil energy program.
      6. The increase for characterization of oxidation 
behavior is for rig testing in the turbine program. The Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory should be involved in this effort.
      7. The Department has placed a high priority on 
combustion and aftertreatment in the transportation program an 
increase is provided in that program area. The House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations are willing to consider a 
reprogramming request for additional funds if acceptable 
offsets are identified.
      8. The Department should support hybrid-electric buses by 
funding integration and refinement of advance hybrid-electric 
drive trains by bus makers and propulsion teams that have 
demonstrated the successful application of hybrid-electric 
drive trains in actual transit programs.
      9. The Department should use the expertise of the 
Consortium for Advanced Transportation Technologies and its 
streamlined competitive, cost-shared procurement process across 
the various transportation programs.
      10. Continued industry support for the hybrid lighting 
partnership is encouraging and the Department should continue 
the program in fiscal year 2000.
      11. Reports that cost accounting standards and cost 
principles in the Federal Acquisition Regulations may be 
hindering contracting with certain commercial entities are of 
concern and the Department should submit a report by December 
15, 1999 detailing problems in this area and making 
recommendations for addressing these problems in the future.
      12. The $1,000,000 provided for a National Academy of 
Sciences study is for a retrospective examination of the costs 
and benefits of Federal research and development technologies 
in the areas of fossil energy and energy efficiency. The study 
should identify improvements that have occurred because of 
Federal funding for: (1) fossil energy production with regard 
to performance aspects such as efficiency of conversion into 
electricity, lower emissions to the environment and cost 
reduction; and (2) energy efficiency technologies with regard 
to more efficient use of energy, reductions in emissions and 
cost impacts in the industrial, transportation, commercial and 
residential sectors. If the full amount provided is not needed 
for this study, the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations should be notified of the available balance. 
None of these funds may be used to fund overhead costs or other 
energy conservation programs. The Department has an arrangement 
with the National Academy of Sciences that will streamline the 
procurement process and the Department should expedite the 
necessary paperwork to get this study underway within 30 days 
of enactment of this Act.
      13. A total of $6,000,000 is provided for crosscutting 
cooperative programs with the States. No funds should be 
assessed for this activity from other activities funded by this 
Act.
      14. A total of $11,700,000 is provided for peer-reviewed, 
cost-shared, competitively awarded grants in support of an 
energy efficiency science initiative as approved by the Science 
Committee in the House of Representatives.

                          Economic Regulation

      The conference agreement provides $2,000,000 for economic 
regulation as proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                      Strategic Petroleum Reserve

      The conference agreement provides $159,000,000 for the 
strategic petroleum reserve as proposed by the Senate instead 
of $146,000,000 as proposed by the House. Bill language is 
included dealing with borrowing authority in the event of an 
SPR drawdown under this account as proposed by the Senate 
rather than addressing this provision under Administrative 
Provisions, Department of Energy as proposed by the House.

                   Energy Information Administration

      The conference agreement provides $72,644,000 for the 
energy information administration as proposed by the House 
instead of $70,500,000 as proposed by the Senate.

            Administrative Provisions, Department of Energy

      Bill language is included directing the Secretary of 
Energy, in cooperation with the Administrator of the General 
Services Administration, to transfer the site of the former 
National Institute of Petroleum Energy Research to the city of 
Bartlesville, Oklahoma. The House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations understand that the Department agrees that this 
is an appropriate way to dispose of this property that is no 
longer needed by the Department because of the privatization of 
NIPER.

                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

                         Indian Health Service

                         Indian Health Services

      The conference agreement provides $2,078,967,000 for 
Indian health services instead of $2,085,407,000 as proposed by 
the House and $2,138,001,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Changes to the House position in hospital and clinic 
programs include increases of $2,440,000 for the operation of 
Alaska facilities and $200,000 for epidemiology centers and 
decreases of $1,000,000 for the health care improvement fund 
and $110,000 for Shoalwater Bay infant mortality prevention.
      There are also increases of $1,500,000 for dental 
services and $1,030,000 for public health nursing and a 
decrease of $500,000 for mental health services. For contract 
support costs, there is a decrease of $10,000,000.
      Bill Language.--Language is included permitting the use 
of Indian Health Care Improvement Fund monies for activities 
typically funded under the Indian Health Facilities account. 
The Service should notify the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations on the distribution and use of these funds. A 
total of $10,000,000 has been provided. Indian Health Care 
Improvement Fund monies should be distributed to increase the 
level of need funded for the most underfunded tribes. Language 
also is included permitting the use of up to $10,000,000 in 
contract support cost funding for new and expanded contracts 
and compacts.
      The conference agreement provides for the following:
      1. The $4,000,000 provided for the Alaska telemedicine 
project is for the Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network.
      2. The increase provided for epidemiology centers 
includes a $100,000 increase for the Portland, OR center. The 
state-of-the-art work done by this center is impressive and the 
Service should use the expertise at the Portland center to 
assist the other epidemiology centers.
      3. At least $1,000,000 of the program increase for dental 
health should be used to develop four clinical and preventive 
dental support centers.
      4. Within the program increase for public health nursing, 
the Service should hire a nurse for the Havasupai, AZ clinic.
      5. The lack of a resolution to the contract support costs 
distribution disparity in IHS continues to be a great concern. 
The Service is strongly encouraged to continue its work with 
the tribes to resolve the discrepancies that exist currently 
and ensure that these costs can be funded fairly. Any 
resolution to the issue should not be made at the expense of 
funding for medical services and facilities for non-contracting 
and non-compacting tribes.
      6. With respect to the House language on distribution of 
funds, fixed cost increases that are provided should be 
distributed equitably across all Service-operated and tribally-
operated programs. Other program increases should not 
automatically be distributed on a pro-rata basis. For example, 
a $1,000,000 program increase distributed across all health 
programs would give each program an insignificant amount of 
additional funding. In such a case, the Service should select a 
very limited number of projects so that demonstrable results 
can be achieved. The Service should develop objective criteria 
for evaluating project proposals prior to the distribution of 
program-specific increases that are unrelated to fixed costs.
      7. Fetal alcohol syndrome and its impact on Indian 
families and Indian communities continues to be a great concern 
and there is a need for more collaborative efforts to address 
this important health problem. The University of Washington's 
fetal alcohol syndrome research program should consider a 
partnership with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board to 
provide more direct services to the American Indian and Alaska 
Native communities through training and consultation and 
collaborative analysis of the data surrounding fetal alcohol 
syndrome and fetal alcohol effect.
      8. The Service is encouraged to ensure that adequate 
funding is provided to support IHS and tribal epidemiological 
activities related to the surveillance and monitoring of AIDS/
HIV and other communicable and infectious diseases.
      9. On October 27, 1999, the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned a judgment by the 
Department of the Interior Board of Contract Appeals with 
respect to contract support costs (Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of 
the Interior v. Oglala Sioux Tribal Public Safety Department). 
The court decision clearly states that the law unequivocally 
makes contracts providing such costs subject to the 
availability of appropriations and that any agency can only 
spend as much money as has been appropriated for contract 
support costs. Any shortfall does not create an unfunded 
liability for the Federal government.

                        Indian Health Facilities

      The conference agreement provides $318,580,000 for Indian 
health facilities instead of $312,478,000 as proposed by the 
House and $189,252,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Changes to the House position include increases of 
$1,500,000 for sanitation construction, $2,942,000 for the 
Parker, AZ clinic construction and $1,000,000 for Fort 
Defiance, AZ hospital construction and a decrease of $1,745,000 
for the Pawnee, OK clinic design. There is also an increase of 
$2,405,000 for facilities and environmental health support.
      Bill Language.--Several provisions are included to ensure 
that the facilities program is able to take advantage of 
certain purchase opportunities from other agencies and that 
construction projects can be successfully completed.
      Language is included to assist the Hopi Tribe with the 
debt associated with the construction of staff quarters that is 
being financed with tribal funds.
      Language is included permitting the use of up to $500,000 
to purchase equipment from the Department of Defense and 
permitting the use of up to $500,000 to purchase ambulances, 
including medical equipment, from the General Services 
Administration.
      Language is included permitting the use of up to $500,000 
for demolition of Federal facilities.
      Language is included permitting the purchase of up to 5 
acres to expand the parking facilities at the IHS hospital in 
Tahlequah, OK.
      The conference agreement provides for the following:
      1. The funds provided for Fort Defiance, AZ, hospital 
construction do not include staff quarters construction which 
is subject to the guidance provided in item number five below.
      2. The funds for staff quarters at Zuni are for uniform 
building code approved modular housing.
      3. The program increase provided for facilities and 
environmental health support is not specifically earmarked for 
individual programs; however, a portion of the total increase 
should be dedicated to injury prevention efforts. The Service 
should notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
on how the Service proposes to distribute these funds.
      4. Within the funds provided for maintenance and 
improvement, $1,000,000 is to be used for environmental 
remediation at Talihina, OK.
      5. The Service needs to develop a standardized 
methodology for construction of staff quarters. That 
methodology should assume the use of uniform building code 
approved modular housing unless there is a compelling reason 
why such housing is not appropriate. The methodology should be 
applied fairly to all quarters projects on the priority list 
and should encourage tribal funding and alternative financing. 
The Service should address the new methodology in their 2001 
budget request.
      6. The Service may use up to $5,000,000 in sanitation 
funding for projects to clean up and replace open dumps on 
Indian lands pursuant to the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act 
of 1994.
      7. The Service should work closely with the tribes and 
the Administration to make needed revisions to the facilities 
construction priority system. Given the extreme need for new 
and replacement hospitals and clinics, there should be a base 
funding amount, which serves as a minimum annual amount in the 
budget request. Issues which need to be examined in revising 
the current system include, but are not limited to, projects 
funded primarily by the tribes, anomalies such as extremely 
remote locations like Havasupai, recognition of projects that 
involve no or minimal increases in operational costs such as 
the Portland area pilot project, and alternative financing and 
modular construction options. The Service in re-examining the 
current system for construction of health facilities, should 
develop a more flexible and responsive program can be developed 
that will more readily accommodate the wide variances in tribal 
needs and capabilities.

to the institute instead of the $4,250,000 proposed by the 
Senate and zero funding as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement provides $2,125,000 to the 
institute with the understanding that these funds are subject 
to a one-to-one match from non-Federal sources. In addition, 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations note that 
this is the last year that Federal funding will be provided for 
institute operations.

                        Smithsonian Institution

                         Salaries and Expenses

      The conference agreement provides $372,901,000 for 
salaries and expenses instead of $371,501,000 as proposed by 
the House and $367,062,000 as proposed by the Senate. Included 
in this amount is $18,329,000 to fund fully the estimated cost 
increases associated with pay and benefits, utilities, 
communications and postage, rental space, and implementation of 
the Panama Canal Treaty at the Tropical Research Institute. A 
revised estimate of utilities costs by the Smithsonian has 
resulted in a decrease of $1,100,000 from the original budget 
submission and is reflected in the foregoing total. In 
agreement with the House, an additional amount of $5,000,000 is 
provided to the National Museum of the American Indian to meet 
anticipated expenses that will be incurred in moving staff and 
collections from New York City to the Cultural Resources Center 
in Suitland, Maryland. An additional amount of $2,500,000 is 
provided to the National Museum of Natural History's Arctic

the House and agreed to by the Senate. Within this total, 
$6,000,000 is provided specifically for repairs and 
improvements at the National Zoological Park. The conference 
agreement includes the proposal put forward by the Smithsonian 
to consolidate their previous budget structure, whereby 
separate accounts for Zoo Construction and Improvements, Repair 
and Restoration of Buildings, as well as the Alterations and 
Modifications portion of the Construction account, have been 
merged into one broad account designated as Repair, 
Rehabilitation and Alteration of Facilities. In agreeing to the 
proposal, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
want to underscore the Institution's responsibility for 
ensuring that future budget estimates contain sufficiently 
detailed information for the various activities covered by this 
new account. In addition, the Smithsonian Institution is 
directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations with a 
report to be submitted annually by December 1, which details 
expenditures, obligations and remaining balances for this 
account from the previous fiscal year.

and administration as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$96,800,000 as proposed by the House. The National Endowment 
for the Humanities has for several years supported important 
efforts to preserve disintegrating books, periodicals and other 
published materials. While the Endowment acknowledges that 
other elements of our culture and heritage--such as films and 
sound recordings--are also at risk, its efforts in these areas 
have been considerably less. The House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations are concerned that much of the musical heritage 
of the nation--as represented by early sound recordings--is 
irrevocably lost with each passing year. Consequently, the 
National Endowment for the Humanities is strongly encouraged to 
strengthen and expand its support of efforts to preserve the 
rich and important heritage of early sound recordings. Within 
this effort, the NEH is encouraged to place emphasis on such 
traditional music forms as folk, jazz and the blues. The 
Endowment is directed to provide a report to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations by March 30, 2000, 
detailing the state by state distribution of the various grants 
and other NEH funding.

                            Matching Grants

      The conference agreement provides $6,312,000 as proposed 
by both the House and the Senate. The conference agreement 
includes the Senate proposal to provide one-year authority for 
appointed members of the Commission to be compensated in a 
manner similar to other Federal boards and commissions.

                United States Holocaust Memorial Council

                       Holocaust Memorial Council

      The conference agreement provides $33,286,000 for the 
Holocaust Memorial Council as proposed by both the House and 
the Senate.
      The United States Holocaust Memorial Council was 
established in 1980 to support the planning and construction of 
a permanent, living memorial museum to the victims of the 
Holocaust. Having opened in 1993, the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum has achieved remarkable success. Following 
these first six years of operation, the House Appropriations 
Committee requested the National Academy of Public 
Administration (NAPA) to conduct a review of the Council and 
the Museum. NAPA has completed its report and included a number 
of recommendations to improve the operation and management of 
the two entities that will set them on a strong course to 
ensure future success. The House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations strongly support the NAPA findings and 
recommendations and urge the entities to include those reforms 
that require statutory changes in a reauthorization bill to the 
Congress by the opening of the second session of the 106th 
Congress. Further, the organizations should implement fully the 
administrative changes recommended in the report by February 
15, 2000 and to report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations on the completion of their implementation by 
March 1, 2000.

                             Presidio Trust

                          Presidio Trust Fund

      The conference agreement provides $44,400,000 for the 
Presidio Trust as proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                     TITLE III--GENERAL PROVISIONS

      The conference agreement includes sections 301 through 
306, sections 308 through 315, sections 317 through 319 and 
section 325 from the Senate bill, which continue provisions 
carried in past years. Section 314 adds a reference to Alaska 
for the Jobs-in-the-Woods program as proposed by the Senate.
      Section 307 makes permanent the provision on compliance 
with the Buy American Act, which was included in the House bill 
as section 306. The Senate had extended the provision for one 
year.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the House in section 315 and by the Senate in 
section 316 prohibiting the use of funds for biosphere reserves 
as part of the Man and Biosphere Program.
      Section 316 exempts the Presidio Trust from certain taxes 
and assessments. While the Presidio Trust, and all property 
under its administrative jurisdiction, is exempt by law from 
all taxes of any kind, the conference agreement provides 
clarification that any interests created under leases or any 
other agreement associated with Presidio properties are exempt 
from taxes of any kind, including but not limited to possessory 
interest taxes.
      Section 320 continues the provision contained in the bill 
in previous years regarding outreach efforts to rural and 
underserved communities by the NEA, as amended by the House to 
include urban minorities.
      Section 321 modifies a provision concerning Forest 
Service land management planning which was proposed by the 
House and the Senate and which was included in previous 
Appropriations acts. The modification now allows national 
forests to begin planning if their existing plans reach the 
fifteen year mandated date to revise before or during calendar 
year 2001.
      Section 322 continues the limitation on funding for 
completion and issuance of the five-year program under the 
Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act as 
proposed by the Senate. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 323 prohibits the use of funds to support 
government-wide administrative functions unless they are in the 
budget justification and approved by the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations as proposed by the House. The 
Senate had no similar provision.
      Section 324 modifies a provision proposed by the House 
prohibiting the use of funds for certain programs. The 
modification retains the limitation on the use of funds for 
General Services Administration Telecommunications Centers and 
for the President's Council on Sustainable Development and 
deletes the limitation dealing with the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration. The Senate 
had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the Senate in section 324 that would continue the 
moratorium on new or expanded Indian self-determination and 
self-governance contracts and compacts with the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service. The House had no 
similar provision.
      Section 326 authorizes certain special resource studies. 
This issue is addressed in more detail under the construction 
account in the National Park Service.
      Section 327 retains the text of section 324 as proposed 
by the House and section 325 as proposed by the Senate which 
permits the Forest Service to use the roads and trails fund for 
backlog maintenance and priority forest health treatments.
      Section 328 modifies language proposed by the House in 
section 325 dealing with the establishment of a National 
Wildlife Refuge in the Kankakee watershed in northwestern 
Indiana and northeastern Illinois. The modification stipulates 
that refuge establishment must be consistent with the U. S. 
Army Corps of Engineers' efforts to control flooding and 
siltation in that area. Written certification of consistency 
and compatibility must be submitted to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations prior to refuge establishment. The 
Committees note that any land acquisition for such a refuge may 
only occur after funds have been requested in subsequent budget 
submissions and approved by the Committees.
      Section 329 modifies language proposed by the House in 
Section 326 concerning the American Heritage Rivers initiative. 
The modified language specifically prevents funds from being 
transferred to, or used to fund personnel, training or other 
administrative activities at, the Council on Environmental 
Quality (CEQ) for purposes related to this program, but the 
language no longer prevents headquarters or departmental 
activities for these purposes. The Council on Environmental 
Quality, as part of the Executive Office of the President, is 
funded through a different appropriations bill to cover all of 
its program needs, including those associated with the American 
Heritage Rivers initiative. The Committees note that the 
appropriations act funding the CEQ provides that no funds other 
than those specifically appropriated to the CEQ maybe used for 
or by the CEQ. Thus, no detailees from agencies funded by this Act may 
be used for or by the CEQ. The House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations do not object to the agencies covered by this bill from 
participating in this initiative if it is a normal part of their 
programs. In fact, the technical assistance programs funded in this 
bill are intended to help respond to local initiatives and needs. The 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations encourage maximum cost-
sharing and expect the agencies to emphasize field-level 
accomplishments rather than headquarters or regional office 
bureaucratic efforts.
      The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are 
very concerned about reports that individuals employed by the 
Federal government who work on the American Heritage Rivers 
initiative have engaged in inappropriate lobbying activities 
with Congressional offices and Federal career employees 
concerning this legislative issue. Such activities should cease 
immediately and disciplinary actions should be taken. Such 
inappropriate behavior by Federal employees should not be 
tolerated, and staff should not be allowed to interfere with 
Congressional efforts to improve management and accountability.
      Section 330 modifies language proposed by the House in 
section 327 restricting the use of answering machines during 
core business hours except in case of emergency. The 
modification requires that there be an option that permits the 
caller to reach immediately another individual. The American 
taxpayer deserves to receive personal attention from public 
servants. The Senate had no similar provision.
      Section 331 modifies a provision proposed by the House 
concerning Forest Service administration of rights-of-way and 
land uses. The Senate had no similar provision. The 
modification retains most of the language proposed by the 
House, with technical modifications, but the provision now 
makes this a five-year pilot program and requires annual 
reports to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
summarizing activities and funds involved during the previous 
year. The Forest Service is directed to follow the instructions 
proposed by the House regarding this provision. The House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations and the authorizing 
committees of jurisdiction will review this pilot program and 
determine subsequently if it warrants permanent authority.
      Section 332 modifies a provision included in the fiscal 
year 1999 act regarding the Institute of Hardwood Technology 
Transfer and Applied Research to make the related authorities 
permanent as proposed by the Senate in section 326. The House 
had no similar provision.
      Section 333 modifies language proposed by the Senate in 
section 327 to continue a program by which Alaska's surplus 
western red cedar is made available preferentially to U.S. 
domestic mills outside Alaska, prior to export abroad. The 
House had no similar provision. The provision has been modified 
to conform to the standard transaction evidence timber 
appraisal system used elsewhere in the national forest system 
and recently implemented in Region 10.
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate-
proposed section 328 concerning Forest Service and Bureau of 
Land Management inventorying, monitoring and surveying 
requirements. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 334 includes language clarifying the Presidio 
Trust's borrowing authority by requiring that obligations 
issued to the Secretary of the Treasury be subject to terms and 
conditions prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury 
including a review of the creditworthiness of the properties 
designed as the source of repayment of the obligations.
      Section 335 modifies language regarding reports on the 
feasibility and cost of implementing the Interior Columbia 
Basin Ecosystem Management Project as proposed by the House in 
section 329. The Senate proposed similar language in section 
330. The provision has been modified so that a report 
describing the estimated production of goods and services 
produced in the study area for the first five years during the 
course of the decision may be reported for each Resource 
Advisory Council or Provincial Advisory Council rather than for 
each individual unit of Federal land as required in the House 
and Senate passed versions.
      The conference agreement does not include section 330 as 
proposed by the House which would have provided authority for 
breastfeeding in the National Park Service, the Smithsonian, 
the John F. Kennedy Center, the Holocaust Memorial Museum and 
the National Gallery of Art. A separate appropriations bill 
funding general government programs includes a similar 
provision, but one that is broader in its application. The 
Senate bill had no similar provision.
      Section 336 prohibits the use of funds to propose or 
issue rules, regulations, decrees or orders for implementing 
the Kyoto Protocol prior to Senate ratification as proposed by 
the House in section 331. The Senate had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include House proposed 
bill language included under section 333 prohibiting the use of 
funds to directly construct timber access roads in the National 
Forest System. The Senate had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include either the 
across the board cut proposed by the House in section 333 or 
the across the board cut proposed by the Senate in section 348.
      Section 337 modifies language proposed by the House in 
section 334 and the Senate in section 335 regarding patent 
applications. The modification exempts from the Solicitor's 
opinion of November 7, 1997 mining operations with approved 
plans of operation, patents that were grandfathered as part of 
the 1995 mining patent moratorium, and plans of operation 
submitted prior to the Solicitor's opinion of November 7, 1997. 
It is inequitable to apply the Solicitor's millsite opinion to 
those plans of operation retroactively, since the Department of 
the Interior and the Forest Service have been approving and 
modifying plans of operation routinely for years without 
raising an issue with operators about the ratio of millsites to 
claims. The Departments of the Interior and Agriculture may not 
implement the millsite opinion for existing plans of operation. 
Further, the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture may 
not reopen decisions already made and relied upon by the 
stakeholders when these existing plans were approved.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the House in section 335 prohibiting certain uses 
of leghold traps and neck snares within the National Wildlife 
Refuge system.
      The conference agreement does not include language as 
proposed by the House in section 336 that would prohibit 
implementation of certain portions of the Gettysburg NMP 
general management plan.
      Section 338 modifies a Senate provision in section 330 
concerning consistency among federal land managing agencies for 
the exemption to the Service Contract Act for concession 
contracts. The modified language deals only with the Forest 
Service and applies only in fiscal year 2000. The House had no 
similar provision.
      Section 339 modifies section 331 as proposed by the 
Senate regarding the establishment of a five-year pilot program 
for the Forest Service to collect fair market value for forest 
botanical products. The House had no similar provision. The 
provision is modified to clarify the definition of forest 
botanical products, to ensure that theharvest of such products 
will be sustainable, to exempt some personal use harvest from fee 
collection at the discretion of the agency, and to return a portion of 
the funds collected to the national forest unit at which they are 
generated. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations want to 
encourage the development of appropriate small-scale industries but 
also ensure that the Forest Service carefully manages this program so 
that plants and fungi are not over-collected. This provision has been 
modified so that the funds which exceed the level collected in fiscal 
year 1999 can be used right away rather than delaying expenditure of 
the funds until fiscal year 2001 as proposed by the Administration and 
the Senate. Fees will be returned to the forest unit where they are 
generated and will be used to provide for program administration, 
inventory, monitoring, sustainable harvest level and impact of harvest 
determination and restoration activities. The Forest Service is 
encouraged to develop harvest guidelines that cover species ranges so 
sharing of fees among units may be required to properly deal with wide-
ranging species.
      Section 340 includes the Senate-proposed section 333 
extending the authorization for the Forest Service to provide 
funds to Auburn University, AL, for construction of a non-
federal building. The House bill had no similar provision.
      Section 341 modifies the Senate-proposed section 334 
dealing with Forest Service stewardship end-results 
contracting. The modification deletes the Senate proposal to 
provide the Northern region with nine additional projects. The 
modified provision includes technical changes to the language 
which authorized the pilot program. These changes make it clear 
that the Forest Service can enter into a contract or agreement 
with either a public or private entity; that an agreement as 
opposed to a contract can be the primary vehicle for 
implementing a pilot project; and there is a national limit on 
projects, as opposed to contracts. This will allow, if 
necessary, use of more than one contract to implement a 
project. The House bill had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate proposed 
bill language included under section 335 that provides that 
residents living within the boundaries of the White Mountain 
National Forest are exempt from certain user fees. The House 
bill had no similar provision.
      Section 342 modifies the Senate-proposed section 336 
dealing with special use fees paid for recreation residences on 
Forest Service managed lands. This provision supersedes section 
343 of P.L. 105-83 and limits fee increases during fiscal year 
2000 to $2,000 per permit. The House had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the Senate in section 337 concerning acquisition of 
lands within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. The 
House had no similar provision.
      Section 343 redesignates the Blackstone River Valley 
National Heritage Corridor as the John H. Chafee Blackstone 
River Valley National Heritage Corridor.
      Section 344 provides that the Forest Service may not use 
the Recreation Fee Demonstration program to supplant existing 
recreation contracts on the national forests as proposed by the 
Senate in section 338. The House bill had no similar provision.
      Section 345 amends the National Forest-Dependent Rural 
Communities Economic Diversification Act, as proposed by the 
Senate in section 339, to make Forest Service grasslands 
eligible for economic recovery funding. The House bill had no 
similar provision.
      Section 346 modifies language proposed by the Senate in 
section 340 regarding the I-90 Land Exchange Act of 1998 to 
reflect a recently negotiated settlement of a federal district 
court case involving Plum Creek and five environmental groups. 
The settlement reconfigures the exchange in a way not reflected 
in the original amendment in the Senate Interior Appropriations 
bill. The settlement significantly reduces the scope of the 
exchange. Several parcels in the Gifford Pinchot National 
Forest were dropped from the exchange, along with several Plum 
Creek parcels destined for public ownership. As a result, the 
new language reflects the settlement agreement. The House had 
no similar provision.
      Section 347 modifies language proposed by the Senate in 
section 341 adjusting the boundary of the Snoqualmie National 
Forest. Eight Plum Creek parcels will be placed in escrow for 
three years to be eligible for Forest Service ownership through 
either appropriations, additional land conveyances or private 
donation. If the parcels are not acquired after three years, 
the titles revert back to Plum Creek. The original section in 
the Senate Interior Appropriations bill placed five Plum Creek 
parcels in escrow. However, the value of the lands in escrow 
remains the same. The House had no similar provision.
      Section 348 amends the Food Security Act to protect the 
confidentiality of Forest Inventory and Analysis data on 
private lands as proposed by the Senate in section 342. The 
House bill had no similar provision.
      Section 349 provides, as proposed by the Senate in 
section 343, that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise 
made available by this Act may be used to implement or enforce 
any provision in Presidential Executive Order 13123 regarding 
the Federal Energy Management Program which circumvents or 
contradicts any statutes relevant to Federal energy use and the 
measurement thereof. The Department is expected to adhere to 
existing law governing energy conservation and efficiency in 
implementing the Federal Energy Management Program. The House 
had no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate proposed 
bill language included under section 344 directing the Forest 
Service to use funds to improve the control or eradication of 
pine beetles in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. 
The conference agreement provides direction on this matter 
under the Forest Service heading.
      The conference agreement does not include Senate proposed 
bill language included under section 346 prohibiting the use of 
funds for certain activities on the Shawnee National Forest, 
IL.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the Senate in section 345 prohibiting funds for the 
physical relocation of grizzly bears into the Selway-Bitterroot 
Wilderness of Idaho and Montana. The House had no similar 
provision. This action is based on written assurances, by 
letter of November 8, 1999, from the Fish and Wildlife Service 
that the Service will not reintroduce or relocate grizzly bears 
during fiscal year 2000.
      Section 350 provides for the investment of Exxon Valdez 
oil spill funds in high yield investments and in marine 
research.
      Section 351 directs that up to $1,000,000 of Bureau of 
Land Management funds be used to fund high priority projects to 
be conducted by the Youth Conservation Corps as proposed by the 
Senate in section 347. The House bill had no similar provision.
      Section 352 makes a permanent appropriation for the North 
Pacific Research Board. To date, these funds have been subject 
to appropriation.
      Section 353 prohibits the withdrawal of certain lands on 
the Mark Twain NF, MO, from mining activities and prohibits the 
issuance of new prospecting permits. The House had no similar 
provision.
      Section 354 makes a minor technical modification to a 
previously established pilot program. This modification 
authorizes the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service 
to establish transfer appropriation accounts in order to 
facilitate efficient inter-agency fund transfers. The House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations support the pilot effort of 
the two agencies to accomplish mutually beneficial management 
of respective lands. The agencies are expected to provide a 
combined report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations on the use of these accounts by June 30, 2000.
      Section 355 provides for an extension of the public 
comment period for the White River National Forest, CO, forest 
plan revision for ninety days past the February 9, 2000, 
deadline currently in place.
      Section 356 provides direction to the National Capital 
Planning Commission concerning a certain easement and other 
matters regarding the National Harbor project, MD.
      Section 357 allows the Bureau of Land Management to 
promulgate new hardrock mining regulations so long as these 
regulations are not inconsistent with the recommendations 
contained in the National Research Council (NRC) report on 
hardrock mining and with BLM's statutory authority. To the 
extent necessary to accomplish this, the BLM is permitted to 
finalize the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on Surface 
Management Regulations for Locatable Mineral Operations. If the 
Department of the Interior wishes to implement any regulatory 
changes that go beyond the recommendations contained in the NRC 
report and existing statutes, it should provide a detailed 
report on such recommendations and the rationale for such 
changes in the fiscal year 2001 budget submission. In addition, 
the Department should submit any legislative proposals that 
might be required to implement changes that go beyond the NRC 
recommendations and existing statutes.

     TITLE IV--MISSISSIPPI NATIONAL FOREST IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999

      The conference agreement includes the Mississippi 
National Forest Improvement Act of 1999. This new bill language 
provides for the sale of surplus Forest Service research 
property and other surplus administrative sites in Mississippi; 
facilitates a cooperative agreement between the Forest Service 
and the University of Mississippi; and facilitates a land 
exchange on the Homochitto National Forest for the Franklin 
County Dam.

     TITLE V--UNITED MINE WORKERS OF AMERICA COMBINED BENEFIT FUND

      Title V provides an emergency transfer of interest earned 
by the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to the United Mine 
Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund. The Abandoned Mine 
Reclamation Fund was established by the Surface Mining Control 
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1231). The Abandoned 
Mine Land Reclamation Act of 1990 provides for the investment 
of the unappropriated balances of the fund and the crediting of 
earned interest to the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. The 
Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (26 U.S.C. 
9701-9722) was included as part of the Energy Policy Act of 
1992 and provides for an annual transfer of part of the 
interest earned by the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to the 
United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund.
      The transfer of funds provided by this title is in 
response to rising health care costs and recent court decisions 
which have combined to seriously erode the solvency of the 
United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund. 
Consequently, the Trustees of the Fund have determined that 
without the relief provided by this section, cuts in health 
care benefits to the more than 66,000 retired miners and their 
dependents throughout the nation are imminent.
      The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
recognize that the emergency transfer provided by this title is 
not the long-term answer to the financial problems associated 
with the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund. 
It is expected that the legislation necessary to remedy the 
financial problems of the United Mine Workers of America 
Combined Benefit Fund will be taken up by the legislative 
committees of jurisdiction and will be enacted into law in a 
timely manner. The committees of jurisdiction are urged to work 
with miners and the contributing companies in ensuring the 
long-term solvency of the fund. The best long-term solution to 
the financial problems associated with the fund must include a 
review of and action on appropriate adjustments to private 
sector contributions to the fund, including contributions 
currently being made by the so-called ``reach back'' companies. 
At the same time, the long-term solution for the fund should 
cover all eligible retired miners and their dependents, 
including the unassigned beneficiaries, as provided for in 
current law.
      The more than 66,000 elderly retired miners and their 
dependents should not again be brought to the precipice, not 
knowing whether the Federal Government will continue to meet 
fully its commitment to provide their health care benefits, as 
provided in the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act of 
1992.

         TITLE VI--PRIORITY LAND ACQUISITION AND LAND EXCHANGES

      The conference agreement provides $197,500,000 for high 
priority land acquisition and other purposes. This amount is in 
addition to the $266,288,000 provided in previous titles of 
this Act, for a total of $463,788,000. The agreement provides 
the following additional funds for specific projects: 
$61,000,000 for the Baca Ranch in New Mexico, subject to the 
same terms and conditions contained under the heading ``Forest 
Service, Land Acquisition'', $20,000,000 for the State 
Assistance program, $5,000,000 for the Catellus property in 
southern California with the expectation that certain 
conditions involving the National Training Center for the Army 
at Fort Irwin will be resolved in the future, $2,000,000 for 
the Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex, $19,500,000 
for the purchase of mining rights in Utah, $10,000,000 for 
Elwha River ecosystem restoration, $5,000,000 for backlog 
maintenance in the National Park Service, $5,000,000 for the 
Forest Legacy program in the Forest Service, and $35,000,000 
for State grants for land acquisition in the State of Florida 
subject to conditions on guaranteed water supply contained 
under the heading ``National Park Service, Land Acquisition and 
State Assistance''.
      With respect to the remainder of the funds totaling 
$35,000,000, the conference agreement provides $20,000,000 to 
the Department of the Interior and $15,000,000 to the 
Department of Agriculture, Forest Service for land 
acquisitions. These funds and the Forest Legacy funding in this 
title are made available with the understanding that the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations will notify the 
Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior in writing on the 
individual projects to be funded with these additional monies.

                   CONFERENCE TOTAL--WITH COMPARISONS

      The total new budget (obligational) authority for the 
fiscal year 2000 recommended by the Committee of Conference, 
with comparisons to the fiscal year 1999 amount, the 2000 
budget estimates, and the House and Senate bills for 2000 
follow:

      The conference agreement would enact the provisions of 
H.R. 3424 as introduced on November 17, 1999. The text of that 
bill follows:

 A BILL Making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year 
           ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the 
following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the 
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Departments of 
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Educaiton, and related 
agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for 
other purposes, namely:

                      TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

including the purchase and hire of passenger motor vehicles, 
the construction, alteration, and repair of buildings and other 
facilities, and the purchase of real property for training 
centers as authorized by the Workforce Investment Act; the 
Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act; the Women in 
Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations Act; the National 
Skill Standards Act of 1994; and the School-to-Work 
Opportunities Act; $3,002,618,000 plus reimbursements, of which 
$1,650,153,000 is available for obligation for the period July 
1, 2000 through June 30, 2001; of which $1,250,965,000 is 
available for obligation for the period April 1, 2000 through 
June 30, 2001; of which $35,500,000 is available for the period 
July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2003 including $34,000,000 for 
necessary expenses of construction, rehabilitation, and 
acquisition of Job Corps centers, and $1,500,000 under 
authority of section 171(d) of the Workforce Investment Act for 
use by the Organizing Committee for the 2001 Special Olympics 
World Winter Games in Alaska to promote employment 
opportunities for individuals with disabilities and other 
staffing needs; and of which $55,000,000 shall be available 
from July 1, 2000 through September 30, 2001, for carrying out 
activities of the School-to-Work Opportunities Act: Provided, 
That $58,800,000 shall be for carrying out section 166 of the 
Workforce Investment Act, including $5,000,000 for carrying out 
section 166(j)(1) of the Workforce Investment Act, including

                described in section 8003(a)(1) in average 
                daily attendance, and at least 6,000 children 
                described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of 
                section 8003(a)(1) in average daily attendance.
            (2) From the remaining $2,000,000 and any amounts 
        available after making payments under paragraph (1), 
        the Secretary shall then make supplemental payments to 
        local educational agencies that are not described in 
        paragraph (1) of this subsection, but that meet the 
        requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4) of section 
        8003(f ) of ESEA for fiscal year 2000.
            (3) After making payments to all eligible local 
        educational agencies described in paragraph (2) of 
        subsection (a), the Secretary shall use any remaining 
        funds from paragraph (2) for making payments to the 
        eligible local educational agencies described in 
        paragraph (1) of subsection (a) if the amount available 
        under paragraph (1) is insufficient to fully fund all 
        eligible local educational agencies.
            (4) After making payments to all eligible local 
        educational agencies as described in paragraphs 1 
        through 3, the Secretary shall use any remaining funds 
        to increase basic support payments under section 
        8003(b) for fiscal year 2000 for all eligible 
        applicants.
    (b) In calculating the amounts of supplemental payments for 
agencies described in subparagraphs (1)(A) and (B) and 
paragraph (2) of subsection (a), the Secretary shall use the 
formula contained in section 8003(b)(1)(C) of ESEA, except 
that--
            (1) eligible local educational agencies may count 
        all children described in section 8003(a)(1) in 
        computing the amount of those payments;
            (2) maximum payments for any of those agencies that 
        use local contribution rates identified in section 
        8003(b)(1)(C) (i) or (ii) shall be computed by using 
        four-fifths instead of one-half of those rates;
            (3) the learning opportunity threshold percentage 
        of all such agencies under section 8003(b)(2)(B) shall 
        be deemed to be 100;
            (4) for an eligible local educational agency with 
        35 percent or more of its children in average daily 
        attendance described in either subparagraph (D) or (E) 
        of section 8003(a)(1) in fiscal year 1997, the weighted 
        student unit figure from its regular basic support 
        payment shall be recomputed by using a factor of 0.55 
        for such children;
            (5) for an eligible local educational agency with 
        fewer than 100 children in average daily attendance in 
        fiscal year 1997, the weighted student unit figure from 
        its regular basic support payment shall be recomputed 
        by multiplying the total number of children described 
        in section 8003(a)(1) by a factor of 1.75; and
            (6) for an eligible local educational agency whose 
        total number of children in average daily attendance in 
        fiscal year 1997 was at least 100, but fewer than 750, 
        the weighted student unit figure from its regular basic 
        support payment shall be recomputed by multiplying the 
        total number of children described in section 
        8003(a)(1) by a factor of 1.25.
    (c) For a local educational agency described in subsection 
(a)(1)(C) above, the Secretary shall use the formula contained 
in section 8003(b)(1)(C) of ESEA, except that the weighted 
student unit total from its regular basic support payment shall 
be recomputed by using a factor of 1.35 for children described 
in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 8003(a)(1) and its 
learning opportunity threshold percentage shall be deemed to be 
100.
    (d) For each eligible local educational agency, the 
calculated supplemental section 8003(f ) payment shall be 
reduced by subtracting the agency's fiscal year 2000 section 
8003(b) basic support payment.
    (e) If the sums described in subsections (a)(1) and (2) 
above are insufficient to pay in full the calculated 
supplemental payments for the local educational agencies 
identified in those subsections, the Secretary shall ratably 
reduce the supplemental section 8003(f ) payment to each local 
educational agency.

    Sec. 310. (a) From the amount appropriated for title VI of

accordance with this section, the Secretary of Education--(1) 
shall make available a total of $6,000,000 to the Secretary of 
the Interior (on behalf of the Bureau of Indian Affairs) and 
the outlying areas for activities under this section; and (2) 
shall allocate the remainder by providing each State the same 
percentage of that remainder as it received of the funds 
allocated to States under section 307(a)(2) of the Department 
of Education Appropriations Act, 1999.
    (b)(1) Each State that receives funds under this section 
shall distribute 100 percent of such funds to local educational 
agencies, of which--(A) 80 percent of such amount shall be 
allocated to such local educational agencies in proportion to 
the number of children, aged 5 to 17, who reside in the school 
district served by such local educational agency from families 
with incomes below the poverty line (as defined by the Office 
of Management and Budget and revised annually in accordance 
with section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act 
(42 U.S.C. 9902(2))) applicable to a family of the size 
involved for the most recent fiscal year for which satisfactory 
data are available compared to the number of such individuals 
who reside in the school districts served by all the local 
educational agencies in the State for that fiscal year; and (B) 
20 percent of such amount shall be allocated to such local 
educational agencies in accordance with the relative 
enrollments of children, aged 5 to 17, in public and private 
nonprofit elementary and secondary schools within the 
boundaries of such agencies.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the award to a local 
educational agency under this section is less than the starting 
salary for a new fully qualified teacher in that agency who is 
certified within the State (which may include certification 
through State or local alternative routes), has a baccalaureate 
degree, and demonstrates the general knowledge, teaching 
skills, and subject matter knowledge required to teach in his 
or her content areas, that agency may use funds under this 
section to (A) help pay the salary of a full- or part-time 
teacher hired to reduce class size, which may be in combination 
with other Federal, State, or local funds; or (B) pay for 
activities described in subsection (c)(2)(A)(iii) which may be 
related to teaching in smaller classes.
    (c)(1) The basic purpose and intent of this section is to 
reduce class size with fully qualified teachers. Each local 
educational agency that receives funds under this section shall 
use such funds to carry out effective approaches to reducing 
class size with fully qualified teachers who are certified 
within the State, including teachers certified through State or 
local alternative routes, and who demonstrate competency in the 
areas in which they teach, to improve educational achievement 
for both regular and special needs children, with particular 
consideration given to reducing class size in the early 
elementary grades for which some research has shown class size 
reduction is most effective.
    (2)(A) Each such local educational agency may use funds 
under this section for
            (i) recruiting (including through the use of 
        signing bonuses, and other financial incentives), 
        hiring, and training fully qualified regular and 
        special education teachers (which may include hiring 
        special education teachers to team-teach with regular 
        teachers in classrooms that contain both children with 
        disabilities and non-disabled children) and teachers of 
        special-needs children, who are certified within the 
        State, including teachers certified through State or 
        local alternative routes, have a baccalaureate degree 
        and demonstrate the general knowledge, teaching skills, 
        and subject matter knowledge required to teach in their 
        content areas;
            (ii) testing new teachers for academic content 
        knowledge, and to meet State certification requirements 
        that are consistent with title II of the Higher 
        Education Act of 1965; and
            (iii) providing professional development (which may 
        include such activities as promoting retention and 
        mentoring) to teachers, including special education 
        teachers and teachers of special-needs children, in 
        order to meet the goal of ensuring that all 
        instructional staff have the subject matter knowledge, 
        teaching knowledge, and teaching skills necessary to 
        teach effectively in the content area or areas in which 
        they provide instruction, consistent with title II of 
        the Higher Education Act of 1965.
    (B)(i) Except as provided under clause (ii) a local 
educational agency may use not more than a total of 25 percent 
of the award received under this section for activities 
described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A).
    (ii) A local educational agency in an Ed-Flex Partnership 
State under Public Law 106-25, the Education Flexibility 
Partnership Act, and in which 10 percent or more of teachers in 
elementary schools as defined by section 14101(14) of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 have not met 
applicable State and local certification requirements 
(including certification through State or local alternative 
routes), or if such requirements have been waived, may apply to 
the State educational agency for a waiver that would permit it 
to use more than 25 percent of the funds it receives under this 
section for activities described in subparagraph (A)(iii) for 
the purpose of helping teachers who have not met the 
certification requirements become certified.
    (iii) If the State educational agency approves the local 
educational agency's application for a waiver under clause 
(ii), the local educational agency may use the funds subject to 
the waiver for activities described in subparagraph (A)(iii) 
that are needed to ensure that at least 90 percent of the 
teachers in elementary schools are certified within the State.
    (C) A local educational agency that has already reduced 
class size in the early grades to 18 or less children (or has 
already reduced class size to a State or local class size 
reduction goal that was in effect on the day before the 
enactment of the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 
2000, if that State or local educational agency goal is 20 or 
fewer children) may use funds received under this section--
            (i) to make further class size reductions in grades 
        kindergarten through 3;
            (ii) to reduce class size in other grades; or
            (iii) to carry out activities to improve teacher 
        quality, including professional development.
            (D) If a local educational agency has already 
        reduced class size in the early grades to 18 or fewer 
        children and intends to use funds provided under this 
        section to carry out professional development 
        activities, including activities to improve teacher 
        quality, then the State shall make the award under 
        subsection (b) to the local educational agency.
    (3) Each such agency shall use funds under this section 
only to supplement, and not to supplant, State and local funds 
that, in the absence of such funds, would otherwise be spent 
for activities under this section.
    (4) No funds made available under this section may be used 
to increase the salaries or provide benefits, other than 
participation in professional development and enrichment 
programs, to teachers who are not hired under this section. 
Funds under this section may be used to pay the salary of 
teachers hired under section 307 of the Department of Education 
Appropriations Act, 1999.
    (d)(1) Each State receiving funds under this section shall 
report on activities in the State under this section, 
consistent with section 6202(a)(2) of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act of 1965.
    (2) Each State and local educational agency receiving funds 
under this section shall publicly report to parents on its 
progress in reducing class size, increasing the percentage of 
classes in core academic areas taught by fully qualified 
teachers who are certified within the State and demonstrate 
competency in the content areas in which they teach, and on the 
impact that hiring additional highly qualified teachers and 
reducing class size, has had, if any, on increasing student 
academic achievement.
    (3) Each school receiving funds under this section shall 
provide to parents upon request, the professional 
qualifications of their child's teacher.
    (e) If a local educational agency uses funds made available 
under this section for professional development activities, the 
agency shall ensure for the equitable participation of private 
nonprofit elementary and secondary schools in such activities. 
Section 6402 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 shall not apply to other activities under this section.
    (f) Administrative Expenses.--A local educational agency 
that receives funds under this section may use not more than 3 
percent of such funds for local administrative costs.
    (g) Request for Funds.--Each local educational agency that 
desires to receive funds under this section shall include in 
the application required under section 6303 of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 a description of the 
agency's program to reduce class size by hiring additional 
highly qualified teachers.
    (h) No funds under this section may be used to pay the 
salary of any teacher hired with funds under section 307 of the 
Department of Education Appropriations Act, 1999, unless, by 
the start of the 2000-2001 school year, the teacher is 
certified within the State (which may include certification 
through State or local alternative routes) and demonstrates 
competency in the subject areas in which he or she teaches.

 TITLE VI--EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTIONS FOR NEWBORNS 
                     AND INFANTS WITH HEARING LOSS

    Sec. 601. (a) Definitions.--For the purposes of this 
section only, the following terms in this section are defined 
as follows:
            (1) Hearing screening.--Newborn and infant hearing 
        screening consists of objective physiologic procedures 
        to detect possible hearing loss and to identify 
        newborns and infants who, after rescreening, require 
        further audiologic and medical evaluations.
            (2) Audiologic evaluation.--Audiologic evaluation 
        consists of procedures to assess the status of the 
        auditory system; to establish the site of the auditory 
        disorder; the type and degree of hearing loss, and the 
        potential effects of hearing loss on communication; and 
        to identify appropriate treatment and referral options. 
        Referral options should include linkage to State IDEA 
        part C coordinating agencies or other appropriate 
        agencies, medical evaluation, hearing aid/sensory aid 
        assessment, audiologic rehabilitation treatment, 
        national and local consumer, self-help, parent, and 
        education organizations, and other family-centered 
        services.
            (3) Medical evaluation.--Medical evaluation by a 
        physician consists of key components including history, 
        examination, and medical decision making focused on 
        symptomatic and related body systems for the purpose of 
        diagnosing the etiology of hearing loss and related 
        physical conditions, and for identifying appropriate 
        treatment and referral options.
            (4) Medical intervention.--Medical intervention is 
        the process by which a physician provides medical 
        diagnosis and direction for medical and/or surgical 
        treatment options of hearing loss and/or related 
        medical disorder associated with hearing loss.
            (5) Audiologic rehabilitation.--Audiologic 
        rehabilitation (intervention) consists of procedures, 
        techniques, and technologies to facilitate the 
        receptive and expressive communication abilities of a 
        child with hearing loss.
            (6) Early intervention.--Early intervention (e.g., 
        nonmedical) means providing appropriate services for 
        the child with hearing loss and ensuring that families 
        of the child are provided comprehensive, consumer-
        oriented information about the full range of family 
        support, training, information services, communication 
        options and are given the opportunity to consider the 
        full range of educational and program placements and 
        options for their child.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to clarify 
the authority within the Public Health Service Act to authorize 
statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and 
intervention programs and systems, technical assistance, a 
national applied research program, and interagency and private 
sector collaboration for policy development, in order to assist 
the States in making progress toward the following goals:
            (1) All babies born in hospitals in the United 
        States and its territories should have a hearing 
        screening before leaving the birthing facility. 
Babiesborn in other countries and residing in the United States via 
immigration or adoption should have a hearing screening as early as 
possible.
            (2) All babies who are not born in hospitals in the 
        United States and its territories should have a hearing 
        screening within the first 3 months of life.
            (3) Appropriate audiologic and medical evaluations 
        should be conducted by 3 months for all newborns and 
        infants suspected of having hearing loss to allow 
        appropriate referral and provisions for audiologic 
        rehabilitation, medical and early intervention before 
        the age of 6 months.
            (4) All newborn and infant hearing screening 
        programs and systems should include a component for 
        audiologic rehabilitation, medical and early 
        intervention options that ensures linkage to any new 
        and existing statewide systems of intervention and 
        rehabilitative services for newborns and infants with 
        hearing loss.
            (5) Public policy in regard to newborn and infant 
        hearing screening and intervention should be based on 
        applied research and the recognition that newborns, 
        infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf or hard-
        of-hearing have unique language, learning, and 
        communication needs, and should be the result of 
        consultation with pertinent public and private sectors.
    (c) Statewide Newborn and Infant Hearing Screening, 
Evaluation and Intervention Programs and Systems.--Under the 
existing authority of the Public Health Service Act, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section

        agencies and organizations and other programs mandated 
        by part C of the Individuals with Disabilities 
        Education Act, which offer programs specifically 
        designed to meet the unique language and communication 
        needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, 
        toddlers, and children.
            (2) To collect data on statewide newborn and infant

reports that specifically allocate funds, each has been 
reviewed and those which are jointly concurred in have been 
included in this joint statement.
      The provisions of the House Report (105-205) are endorsed 
that direct ``. . . the Departments of Labor, Health and Human 
Services, and Education and the Social Security Administration 
and the Railroad Retirement Board to submit operating plans 
with respect to discretionary appropriations to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations. These plans, which are to 
be submitted within 30 days of the final passage of the bill, 
must be signed by the respective Departmental Secretaries, the 
Social Security Commissioner and the Chairman of the Railroad 
Retirement Board.''
      The Departments and agencies covered by this directive 
are expected to meet with the House and Senate Committees as 
soon as possible after enactment of the bill to develop a 
methodology to assure adequate and timely information on the 
allocation of funds within accounts within this conference 
report while minimizing the need for unnecessary and 
duplicative submissions.
      The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and 
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, FY 2000, 
put in place by this bill, incorporates the following 
agreements of the managers:

                      TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

                 Employment and Training Administration

                    Training and Employment Services

      The conference agreement appropriates $5,465,618,000, 
instead of $4,572,058,000 as proposed by the House and 
$5,472,560,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of the amount 
appropriated, $2,463,000,000 becomes available on October 1, 
2000, instead of $2,607,300,000 as proposed by the House and 
$2,720,315,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The agreement includes language authorizing the use of 
funds under the dislocated workers program for projects that 
provide assistance to new entrants in the workforce and 
incumbent workers as proposed by the Senate. It also includes 
language proposed by the Senate modified to waive a 10 percent 
limitation in the Workforce Investment Act with respect to the 
use of discretionary funds to carry out demonstration and pilot 
projects, multiservice projects and multistate projects with 
regard to dislocated workers and to waive certain other 
provisions in that Act. The House bill had no similar 
provisions.
      The Department is expected to make every effort to be 
flexible in the use of worker training funds for reactivated 
shipyards, such as those referenced in the Senate Report. The 
conference agreement encourages the Department to use national 
emergency grantsunder the dislocated workers program to 
supplement available resources for (1) worker training needs at 
reactivated shipyards that have experienced large-scale worker 
dislocation, (2) continuing training to utilize the workplace as site 
for learning, (3) supporting training for American workers at state-of-
the-art foreign shipyards, and (4) continuing upgrading of workers 
skills to increase employability and job retention.
      The agreement includes a citation to the Women in 
Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations Act as proposed 
by the House. The Senate bill did not cite this Act.
      The conference agreement includes $5,000,000 under Job 
Corps for the purpose of constructing or rehabilitating 
facilities on some Job Corps campuses to co-locate Head Start 
programs to serve Job Corps students and their children as 
proposed in the House Report.
      The Labor Department is encouraged to continue and 
provide technical assistance to the Role Models America Academy 
Demonstration Program.
      The Ways to Work family loan program is an innovative 
micro-loan program which provides small loans to low-income 
families who are attempting to make the transition from public 
assistance to the workforce or retain employment. This program 
allows families who often lack access to loans from mainstream 
sources because of their weak credit histories to receive the 
necessary financial resources to meet emergency expenses. The 
Department is urged to consider making available up to $1 
million for this program to demonstrate its effectiveness in 
assisting low-income parents in obtaining and retaining jobs.

majority of the welfare-to-work program staff shall be term 
appointments lasting no more than one year. The Senate bill 
contained no such language.
      The Department is expected to conduct an analysis of the 
case backlog in the alien labor certification program and 
report its findings to the Appropriations Committees by 
February 1, 2000. Further, it is expected that the Department

as proposed by the Senate.

with industry or the courts' impartial consideration of the 
merits of this issue, the Department is urged to clarify this 
letter with regard to retroactivity and to existing collective 
bargaining agreements or private litigation.

                    black lung disability trust fund

proposed by the Senate. The agreement includes a definite 
annual appropriation for black lung benefit payments and

proposed by the House instead of an indefinite permanent 
appropriation as proposed by the Senate.
      There is concern about the structural deficit in the

directed to provide its recommended solution for the problem of 
the increasing indebtedness of the Trust Fund to the Congress

include language proposed by the Senate that would have 
earmarked one-half of the increase over the FY 1999

enforcement and all other purposes. The House bill had no 
similar provision. The detailed table at the end of this joint 
statement reflects the activity distribution agreed upon.
      The Department is urged to consider allowing the use of 
all FDA-approved devices which reduce the risk of needlestick 
injury, whether or not such safety feature is integrated into 
the needle or other sharp medical object, if the non-integrated 
device is at least as safe and effective as other FDA-approved 
devices.
      Without any intent to delay pending regulations, the 
conference agreement includes $450,000 elsewhere in this bill 
for a National Academy of Sciences study of the proposed 
standard on tuberculosis.
      Concerns have been expressed about recommendations of the 
Metalworking Fluids Standards Advisory Committee, established 
by the Department, with respect to metalworking fluids exposure 
levels. The Department is expected to carefully consider peer-
reviewed scientific research and examine the technical 
feasibility and economic consequences of its recommendations. 
An economic analysis to the three-digit SIC code and a risk 
assessment should be completed on the impact of reduced 
exposure levels.

                 Mine Safety and Health Administration

                         salaries and expenses

$2,500,000 over the budget request for physical improvements at 
the National Mine Safety and Health Academy.
      The agreement does not include language proposed by the 
House that would have prohibited the use of funds to carry out 
the miner training provisions of the Mine Safety and Health Act 
with respect to certain industries, including sand and gravel 
and surface stone, until June 1, 2000. The Senate bill did not 
include a similar provision.
      The agreement also does not include language proposed by 
the Senate that would have allowed MSHA to retain and spend up 
to $1,000,000 in fees collected for the approval and 
certification of mine equipment and materials. The House bill 
did not include a similar provision.
      Concerns have been expressed about the possible 
ramifications of a rulemaking on the use of conveyor belts in 
underground coal mines, including concerns about the validity 
of the testing on which the rule is based. MSHA is urged to 
carefully examine the record and to conduct additional research 
that may be required to address any significant concerns that 
have been raised.
      MSHA is urged to examine the ongoing NCI/NIOSH study of 
Lung Cancer and Diesel Exhaust among Non-Metal Miners in 
connection with the promulgation of a proposed rule on diesel 
exhaust.

instead of $191,131,000 as proposed by the House and 
$247,311,000 as proposed by the Senate. The agreement includes 
language proposed by the Senate that authorizes the expenditure 
of funds for the management or operation of Departmental 
bilateral and multilateral foreign technical assistance. The 
House bill included no such language. The agreement does not 
include language proposed by the Senate that would have 
authorized the use of up to $10,000 of DOL salaries and 
expenses funds in this Act for receiving and hosting officials 
of foreign states and official foreign delegations. The House 
bill included no such language. Instead, the agreement 
authorizes the Secretary to use up to $20,000 from funds 
available for salaries and expenses for official reception and 
representation expenses in a general provision in title V of 
the bill (Sec. 504), instead of $15,000 as proposed in both the 
House and Senate bills.
      International child labor activities are funded at the 
level requested in the President's budget.
      The agreement does not include statutory language 
proposed by the Senate requiring a report to Congress 
containing options to promote a legal domestic workforce in the 
agricultural sector, provide for improved compensation and

Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language

identifying $238,932,000 for family planning instead of

      There is concern that there has been a steady erosion of 
title X funds being made available by the Department for 
authorized section 1001 clinical services. The Department is 
directed to allocate at least 90 percent of the funds 
appropriated for title X specifically for clinical services. 
The conference agreement concurs with the language contained in

and allocation of title X funds to regional offices.
      The conference agreement does not include a provision to 
allow funds to be used to operate the Council on Graduate 
Medical Education as proposed by the Senate. The House bill

to determine the most effective methods of providing insurance 
coverage for the uninsured. States are to submit reports to the 
Secretary that identify the characteristics of the uninsured 
within the state and approaches for providing them with health 
coverage through an expanded state, Federal and private 
partnership. The goal is to ensure that everyone in that state 
has affordable health insurance benefits similar in care to 
state employee coverage, Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, 
Medicaid or other similar quality benchmark plans.
    In awarding these grants, preference should be given to 
applicant states that present diverse characteristics and 
represent a variety of geographic areas. In addition, 
preference should be given to those states with lower uninsured 
rates unless the applicant state shows a potential for a 
significant decrease in its uninsured population. States are 
encouraged to work with the many existing Federal and State 
data collection activities as well as efforts in the private, 
nonprofit sector that are ongoing. HRSA, and other HHS 
agencies, should work collaboratively with the States on these 
grants and provide technical assistance, and access to 
appropriate data and analytic support.

level through the community planning process as a means of 
targeting specific interventions to specific individuals and 
communities is supported. CDC is urged, in consultation with

Senate.

       National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine

      The conference agreement provides $68,753,000 for the 
National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine 
instead of $68,000,000 as proposed by the House and $56,214,000 
as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement does not 
include bill language proposed by the Senate to make these 
funds available for obligation through September 30, 2001. The 
House bill contained no similar provision.
      It is believed that Federal policy in a number of areas 
is failing to keep up with the increased use of complementary 
and alternative therapies. Funding was provided in fiscal year 
1999 to support the establishment and operation of a White 
House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine 
Policy to study and make recommendations to the Congress on 
appropriate policies regarding consumer information, training, 
insurance coverage, licensing, and other pressing issues in 
this area. It is believed that the Commission is not intended 
to review the work of or set the priorities for the Center. 
Rather, the Center is expected simply to provide administrative 
support to the Commission.
      The conference agreement concurs with the House and 
Senate report language regarding the training of physicians in 
integrative medicine, but urges the Center to also support the 
training of nurses in integrative medicine through appropriate 
mechanisms. The Center is also urged to study strategies for 
integrating complementary and alternative medicine into all 
nursing curricula.

                         Office of the Director

                     (Including Transfer of Funds)

      The conference agreement provides $283,509,000 for the 
Office of the Director instead of $270,383,000 as proposed by 
the Houseand $299,504,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement includes a designation in bill language of 
$44,953,000 for the operations of the Office of AIDS Research as 
proposed by the House. The Senate bill contained no similar provision.
      It is expected that the Minority Access to Research 
Careers, Minority Biomedical Research Support, Research Centers 
in Minority Institutions, and the Office of Research on 
Minority Health programs will continue to be supported at a 
level commensurate with their importance.
      Investigations into the causes, prevention, treatment, 
and cure for diabetes are important. The Diabetes Research 
Working Group report outlines many scientific opportunities and 
NIH is encouraged to pursue research on all types of diabetes 
with equal vigor.
      NIH is expected to consult closely with the research 
community, clinicians, patient advocates, and the Congress 
regarding Parkinson's research and fulfillment of the goals of 
the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research Act. NIH is requested 
to develop a report to Congress by March 1, 2000 outlining a 
research agenda for Parkinson's focused research for the next 
five years, along with professional judgment funding 
projections. The NIH Director should be prepared to discuss 
Parkinson's focused research planning and implementation for 
fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001.
      Continued advances in biomedical imaging and engineering, 
including the development of new techniques and technologies 
for both clinical applications and medical research and the 
transfer of new technologies from research projects to the 
public health sector are important. The disciplines of 
biomedical imaging and engineering have broad applications to a 
range of disease processes and organ systems and research in 
these fields does not fit into the current disease and organ 
system organizational structure of the NIH. The present 
organization of the NIH does not accommodate basic scientific 
research in these fields and encourages unproductive diffusion 
of imaging and engineering research. Several efforts have been 
made in the past to fit imaging into the NIH structure, but 
these have proved to be inadequate.
      For these reasons, NIH is urged to establish an Office of 
Bioimaging/Bioengineering and to review the feasibility of 
establishing an Institute of Biomedical Imaging and 
Engineering. This Office should coordinate imaging and 
bioengineering research activities, both across the NIH and 
with other Federal agencies. The NIH shall report to the 
Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate on the 
progress achieved by this Office no later than June 30, 2000.
      Security at Federal facilities is a growing concern and 
with the number of visitors to the NIH campus, including both 
domestic and foreign dignitaries, and the type of research that 
occurs on campus, adequate security at NIH is critical. The 
Director is requested to contract with an independent group to 
study the overall security situation at the Bethesda campus. 
This study should include, but not be limited to, 
recommendations regarding the appropriate manpower, training, 
and equipment needed to provide adequate security for NIH 
employees and all visitors to the campus as well as any 
recommended changes to the current security policy.
      Infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are 
biologically based neurodevelopmental diseases that cause 
severe impairments in language and communication and generally 
manifest in young children sometime during the first two years 
of life. Best estimates indicate that 1 in 500 children born 
today will be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and 
that 400,000 Americans have autism or an autism spectrum 
disorder. NIH is strongly encouraged to dedicate more resources 
and to expand and intensify these efforts through the NIH 
Autism Coordinating Committee. More knowledge is needed 
concerning the underlying causes of autism and autism spectrum 
disorders, how to treat and prevent these disorders; the 
epidemiology and risk factors for the disorders; the 
development of methods for early medical diagnosis; 
dissemination to medical personnel, particularly pediatricians, 
to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of this disease; 
and the costs incurred in educating and caring for individuals 
with autism and autism spectrum disorders. NIH is also 
encouraged to explore mechanisms, including innovative 
collaborative approaches in autism, supported by the Institutes 
to conduct basic and clinical researchinto the cause, 
diagnosis, early detection, prevention, control, and treatment of 
autism, including research in the fields of developmental neurobiology, 
genetics, and psychopharmacology.
      NIDDK and NIAID are to be commended for jointly 
supporting research on foodborne illness. The Institutes are 
encouraged to enhance research on the reaction of the gut to 
foodborne pathogens, including research on the pathogenesis of 
the disease, the reasons for antibiotic resistance, the 
reaction of the gut to infections, the development of animal 
models to test therapies, and the invention of vaccines or 
substances that bind with the toxins to prevent the illness.
      The conference agreement concurs with language contained 
in the House report regarding International Collaborations.
      Ashkenazi Jewish women who carry the BRCA 1 gene have an 
abnormally high incidence of breast and ovarian cancer. NIH is 
urged to support, especially through NCI and NHGRI, coordinated 
U.S./Israeli research activities through all available 
mechanisms, as appropriate, including the establishment of a 
computerized data and specimen sharing system, subject 
recruitment and retention programs, and collaborative pilot 
research projects.
      The Office of Research on Minority Health is encouraged 
to expand and strengthen science-based HIV prevention research 
for African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian 
Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders and 
consideration should be given to the U.S. Virgin Islands and 
Puerto Rico. The Office is also encouraged to expand existing 
culturally competent behavioral research, conducted by minority 
principal investigators, that seeks to break the link between 
HIV infection and high risk behaviors, and that seek to 
decrease the rate of mortality in targeted minority 
populations.

                        Buildings and Facilities

proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement does not 
provide $148,816,000 to become available on October 1, 2000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
provisions.
Center for Mental Health Services
      The conference agreement provides $356,000,000 for the

become available on October 1, 2000, as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides $83,000,000 for 
children's mental health as proposed by the House instead of 
$78,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Mental health services for children and adolescents could 
be strengthened by a comprehensive system that measures the 
quality and effectiveness of these services. The Center's 
Committee on Child and Adolescent Outcomes has supported the 
collaboration between Vanderbilt University and Australia in 
developing such an evaluation system in the United States. The 
Department is urged to continue this collaboration.
      The National Mental Health Self-Help Clearinghouse, the 
Consumer Organization and Networking Technical Assistance 
Center, and the National Empowerment Center provide information 
and resources to individuals suffering from mental illnesses 
and their families. Continued funding of these Centers will 
allow services to be provided uninterrupted.

Senate. The conference agreement has doubled funding for mental 
health services for school-age children, as part of an effort 
to reduce school violence. It is intended that $80,000,000 be 
used for the support and delivery of school-based and school-
related mental health services for school-age youth. It is 
intended that the Department will continue to collaborate its 
efforts with the Department of Education to develop a 
coordinated approach.

residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum 
women.
      The conference agreement includes $40,325,000 for 
activities that strengthen substance abuse treatment capacity 
in communities of color disproportionately impacted by the HIV/
AIDS epidemic, based on rates of new HIV infection and 
mortality from AIDS. These funds are designed to provide 
targeted service expansion and capacity building to minority, 
community-based substance abuse treatment programs with a 
history of providing services to communities of color severely 
impacted by substance abuse and HIV/AIDS. These funds are to be 
allocated based on program priorities identified in the 
previous fiscal year. Funds are also included to enhance state 
and county efforts to plan and develop integrated substance 
abuse and HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention services to

      Recent reports by NIH and the Institute of Medicine 
recommend expansion of effective treatment approaches for 
adolescent drug abusers. CSAT is to be commended for its work 
in developing and testing manuals for program interventions 
through the Cannabis Youth Treatment initiative. CSAT is 
encouraged to expand this initiative by examining the immediate 
and long-term outcomes across the developmental period when 
adolescents are at risk for peak drug use, and by taking steps 
to replicate and improve such treatment approaches.
      The Norton Sound Health Corporation project for substance 
abuse treatment services should be given full and fair 
consideration for funding.

      The conference agreement designates $88,576,000 to be 
available to the Agency under the Public Health Service one 
percent evaluation set-aside instead of $70,647,000 as proposed 
by the House and $191,751,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      In addition, $5,000,000 previously identified by the 
Senate report for bioterrorism activities is included in the 
Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for the same 
purpose.

                  Health Care Financing Administration

                           program management

      The conference agreement provides $1,994,548,000 for 
program management instead of $1,752,050,000 as proposed by the 
House and $1,991,321,000 as proposed by the Senate. The House 
bill assumed that the Administration's user fee proposal would 
be enacted prior to conference. An additional appropriation of 
$630,000,000 has been provided for this activity in the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
      The conference agreement provides $95,000,000 for 
Medicare+Choice as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$15,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement does not include language 
proposed by the Senate that would have allowed Medicaid and 
CHIP funding to be interchangeable. The House bill contained no 
similar provision.
      The conference agreement repeats language included in 
last year's bill related to administrative fees collected 
relative to Medicare overpayment recovery activities.
      The conference agreement does not include bill language 
proposed by the Senate to allow appropriated funds to be used 
to increase Medicare provider audits. The House bill contained 
no similar provision.
Research, Demonstration, and Evaluation
      The conference agreement provides $62,900,000 for 
research, demonstration, and evaluation instead of $50,000,000 
as proposed by the House and $65,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement includes the following amounts 
for the following projects and activities:
      --$100,000 for Littleton Regional Hospital in New 
Hampshire to assist in the development of rural emergency 
medical services;
      --$250,000 for the University of Missouri-Kansas City to 
test behavioral interventions of nursing home residents with 
moderate to severe dementia;
      --$2,000,000 for a nursing home transition initiative;
      --$2,000,000 for a demonstration of residential and 
outpatient treatment facilities at the AIDS Healthcare 
Foundation in Los Angeles;
      --$3,000,000 for the University of Pennsylvania Medical 
Center, the University of Louisville Sciences Center, and St. 
Vincent's Hospital in Montana to conduct a demonstration to

Medicaid/TennCare eligibility.
      HCFA is urged to conduct a demonstration project to test 
the potential savings to the Federal government and to the 
Medicare program by comparing different products used for 
diabetic wound-care treatment. Such a demonstration should 
compare the aggregate costs of wound care treatment using 
different wound-care gel products as well as different gel 
application regimens.
      HCFA is urged to conduct a demonstration project 
addressing the extraordinary adverse health status of native 
Hawaiians at the Waimanalo health center exploring the use of 
preventive and indigenous health care expertise.
      HCFA is urged to conduct a demonstration project in 
Hawaii and Alaska to address the extraordinary adverse health 
status andlimited access to health services of the indigenous 
people in Hawaii and Alaska natives and others residing in southwest 
Alaska.
      There is strong concern over HCFA's failure to articulate 
clear guidelines and set expeditious timetables for 
consideration of new technologies, procedures and products for 
Medicare coverage. Two particularly troubling examples are 
HCFA's lengthy delays and failure to articulate clear standards 
regarding Medicare coverage of positron emission tomography 
(PET) and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). The effect of 
these delays in instituting Medicare coverage is to deny the 
benefits of these technologies and products to Medicare 
patients. There is also concern that HCFA appears to be 
requiring new technologies to repeat clinical trials and 
testing already successfully completed by the new products in 
the process of gaining FDA approval or in NIH clinical trials 
and which serve as signals to private insurers to cover new 
technologies. The recent creation of a 120-person advisory 
committee to review new technologies is also of some concern 
and it is noted that the Appropriations Committees will be 
observing the new advisory committee to review its costs and to 
see whether its use further delays Medicare coverage of new 
products. Because of the possible duplication of efforts among 
HHS agencies and related unnecessary costs to the Medicare 
program and the Department, it is expected that the Secretary 
will take a leadership role in resolving this matter 
expeditiously.
      The Secretary is strongly urged to appoint a three-person 
Medicare-Technology Consumer Advisory Committee. The Committee 
should be appointed from among knowledgeable patient advocates 
and members of the medical community with expert knowledge of 
new technologies and cost-benefit analysis. The new Committee 
should study the current HCFA process for determining new 
coverages and should report at least every six months to the 
Secretary, the Appropriations Committees, and the general 
public on its findings and recommendations. The Secretary is 
expected to report prior to fiscal year 2001 appropriations 
hearings about its recommendations on streamlining HCFA's 
approval process for Medicare coverage of new technologies.
      If the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human 
Services, under existing demonstration authority, chooses to 
implement a program to improve health care access for uninsured 
workers, the Secretary should encourage applications from 
private, not-for-profit multi-state health systems in urban and 
rural areas. Such multi-state systems should be given special 
consideration if they are willing to provide private matching 
funds to create model public-private partnerships which enhance 
integrated systems of health care for the working poor.
Medicare contractors
      The conference agreement provides $1,244,000,000 for 
Medicare contractors as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$1,176,950,000 as proposed by the House. The amount provided 
reflects HCFA's proposal to change its approach for processing 
managed care encounter data, which will result in estimated 
savings of $30,000,000.
State survey and certification
      The conference agreement provides $204,674,000 for State 
survey and certification instead of $106,000,000 as proposed by 
the House and $204,347,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Federal administration
      The conference agreement provides $485,000,000 for 
Federal administration instead of $421,126,000 as proposed by 
the House and $480,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement concurs with House report 
language regarding its concern that the current performance 
evaluation and recertification process for Organ Procurement 
Organizations (OPO) may hinder the goal of increased organ 
donations.HCFA is urged to work with and support the industry 
in its effort to develop alternative performance measures. HCFA is also 
urged to use existing authority to extend the OPO certification period 
until such time as an alternative process has been adopted.
      Hospices in Wichita, Kansas will be adversely affected in 
their Medicare reimbursement in fiscal year 2000 because of an 
error in a faulty hospital cost report in 1995, over which they 
had no control, and because of a faulty tabulation by HCFA or 
its fiscal intermediary. HCFA is expected to correct the error 
in the publication of the hospice wage index for the Wichita, 
Kansas MSA by using the July 30, 1999 hospital wage index, 
published in the Federal Register, for the current fiscal year, 
rather than delaying until the following fiscal year, and by 
publishing a revised notice to reflect this correction.
      In 1998, HCFA was urged to commit appropriate resources 
to ensure the provision of ongoing training, technical 
assistance, and quality assurance support to regional and State 
personnel who are responsible for implementation and review of 
Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR) 
and waiver programs. Seeing no progress to date on this issue, 
and recognizing the growing concerns about abuse and neglect 
and the use of restraints in such settings, HCFA is strongly 
urged to ensure that staff be devoted solely to ensuring 
quality in ICFs/MR and home and community-based waivers. It is 
hoped that HCFA would also allow for the speedy revision of the 
ICF/MR regulations to reflect widely recognized advancements in 
the field and to encourage more flexibility, consumer 
involvement and direction, and community integration in meeting 
individual's needs. The Department is requested to report 
within 120 days on how these staffing requirements will be 
accommodated.

                Administration for Children and Families

  payments to states for child support enforcement and family support 
                                programs

      The conference agreement provides no extended 
availability of funds proposed by the Senate. The House bill 
proposed no extended availability.

                   low income home energy assistance

      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the House designating that the $1,100,000,000 appropriated for 
LIHEAP for FY 2000 in the FY 1999 appropriations act is an 
emergency under the Budget Act and requiring that such funds be 
allocated in accordance with the statutory formula. The Senate 
bill contained no such language. The agreement also includes 
the House legal citation to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.

                     refugee and entrant assistance

      The conference agreement appropriates $426,505,000, 
instead of $423,500,000 as proposed by the House and 
$430,500,000 as proposed by the Senate. The agreement provides 
for an annual 
appropriation as proposed by the House instead of three-year 
availability of funds proposed by the Senate. In the case of 
the Torture Victims Relief Act funds, the agreement provides 
for an annual appropriationas proposed by the House instead of 
the funds remaining available until expended proposed by the Senate.
      In addition, the conference agreement includes language 
not contained in either bill that designates all funding in 
this account as an emergency requirement under the Budget Act.
      The conference agreement includes $20,000,000 from 
carryover funds that are to be used under social services to 
increase educational support to schools with a significant 
proportion of refugee children and for the development of 
alternative cash assistance programs that involve case 
management approaches to improve resettlement outcomes. Such 
support should include intensive English language training and 
cultural assimilation programs.
      The agreement also includes $26,000,000 for increased 
support to communities with large concentrations of refugees 
whose cultural differences make assimilation especially 
difficult justifying a more intense level and longer duration 
of Federal assistance.

                 Child Care and Development Block Grant

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,182,672,000 as 
an advance appropriation for fiscal year 2001, instead of 
$2,000,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The agreement further 
provides that $19,120,000 shall be for child care resource and 
referral and school-aged child care activities as proposed by 
the Senate. The House bill had no appropriation for this 
account.
      The conference agreement includes language to require the 
States to use $172,672,000 above the amount required by the 
basic law for activities that improve the quality of child care 
for fiscal year 2001. The basic law requires that not more than 
four percent of the approporation be used for such activites. 
Neither the House nor the Senate bill included such language.
      The conference agreement includes $500,000 for a toll-
free child care services program hotline to be operated by 
Child Care Aware.
      States are encouraged to create or enhance systems of 
care that support and educate families expecting a baby or with 
young children, and help them understand that day-to-day 
interaction with children helps them develop cognitively, 
socially, physically and emotionally. Many states have already 
created state and local collaboratives that coordinate early 
childhood development, and these efforts are to be commended.
      In the case of states that have yet to initiate such 
coordination, they are encouraged to look at best practices 
from across the country. The National Governors Association has 
developed goals, model indicators, and measures of performance 
to help states focus on improving the conditions of young 
children and their families. The State of Ohio has a successful 
initiative known as Family and Children First that could serve 
as a model. All states are encouraged to continue to develop 
and expand healthy early childhood systems of care.

                      Social Services Block Grant

      The conference agreement includes $1,775,000,000, instead 
of $1,909,000,000 as proposed by the House and $1,050,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate. The agreement does not include the 
provision in the House or Senate bills that limits the ability 
of States to transfer TANF funds to the Social Services Block 
Grant to 4.25 percent or 5 percent, respectively.
      The conference agreement does not include section 216 of 
the Senate bill which increased the appropriation to 
$2,380,000,000 but specified that $1,330,000,000 of that amount 
would not become available for obligation until fiscal year 
2001 and that the amount available for allocation to States in 
fiscal year 2001 would be $3,030,000,000. The House had no 
similar provision.

                Children and Families Services Programs

                        (including rescissions)

      The conference agreement appropriates $6,835,133,000, 
instead of $6,240,216,000 as proposed by the House and 
$6,789,635,000 as proposed by the Senate. In addition, the 
agreement rescinds $21,000,000 from permanent appropriations as 
proposed by the House.
      The agreement includes an advance appropriation of 
$1,400,000,000 for Head Start for fiscal year 2001 as proposed 
by the House instead of $1,900,000,000 proposed by the Senate. 
The agreement also includes $1,700,000,000 designated as an 
emergency.
      An amount of $10,000,000 is included under social 
services and income maintenance research for establishing 
Individual Development Accounts. The House proposed to fund 
this as a separate line item.
      The Hull House Association's Neighbor to Neighbor (NTN) 
program in Chicago and Florida provides specialized placement 
and family services for sibling groups, keeping such children 
together, placed within their community, and stabilized in one 
foster home. Outcomes for this program have been noteworthy, 
including high rates of family reunification, placement 
stability and foster parent retention. The conference agreement 
includes $500,000 to support the Association's project to 
provide training, technical assistance and implementation 
assistance to establishment of NTN programs within public and 
private foster care agencies in other states and localities.
      The conference agreement includes language not contained 
in either House or Senate bills that requires the Department to 
establish certain procedures regarding the disposition of 
intangible property in the community economic development 
program under the Community Services Block Grant Act.
      There is awareness of efforts by the state information 
technology consortium to identify best practices with regard to 
implementing Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, including 
best practices developed by states, the federal government, and 
the private sector. The next phase of this effort will enable 
states to discern which best practices are appropriate for 
their particular needs, then work with the consortium to 
implement those practices. Continuation of this effort at the 
current level of support is urged.
      It is important that the Congress determine the economic 
status of former recipients of Temporary Assistance to Needy 
Families, and the conference agreement provides funds to 
support such research and evaluation.
      Head Start grantees may use their basic grant funds, 
quality funds, and expansion funds for minor renovations and 
rehabilitation of existing Head Start facilities. The Secretary 
is urged to give special attention to Native American 
communities with particular needs, including the Alaskan 
communities of Chevak, Napakiak, Haines, Marshall, Noorvik, 
Selawik, Pilot Station, Hooper Bay, and Dillingham.

                        Office of the Secretary

                    general departmental management

      The conference agreement appropriates $232,902,000, 
instead of $227,787,000 as proposed by the House and 
$189,420,000 as proposed by the Senate. To the extent that any 
staffing reductions are required to implement the conference 
agreementthe Secretary should make the reductions in such 
overhead areas as the immediate office of the Secretary, public 
affairs, Congressional affairs, and intergovernmental affairs.
      The agreement includes $1,500,000 for the United States-
Mexico Border Health Commission. The conference agreement 
concurs with the Senate Report language concerning the human 
services transportation technical assistance program. It also 
concurs with the Senate Report language concerning the amount 
available for a public education campaign on osteoporosis in 
the Office on Women's Health.
    The conference agreement includes $9,700,000 within the 
Office of Minority Health to fund activities that are designed 
to address the trend of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in communities of 
color based on rates of new infections and mortality from AIDS. 
These funds are to be allocated based on program priorities 
identified in the previous fiscal year, which include support 
for the Minority Community Coalition Demonstrations Grants 
program, including the Bilingual/Bicultural Demonstrations 
Grants Program targeted to fund HIV/AIDS prevention activities 
by minority organizations. Funds are also provided to target 
national, regional and local minority organizations with a 
history of service and development to communities of color to 
provide technical assistance and to expand the National 
Minority Organization/Cooperative Agreement Program. Funds have 
been provided to expand and strengthen contracts with HBCUs and 
HSIs to provide funding to minority behavioral scientists to 
enhance the implementation of research-based prevention 
activities for disease prevention, health promotion and HIV/
AIDS in conjunction with community organizations targeting 
minority populations.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the House that earmarks $450,000 for a contract with the 
National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of OSHA's 
proposed rule relating to occupational exposure to 
tuberculosis. The study should address the following questions:
      1. Are health care workers at a greater risk of 
infection, disease, and mortality due to tuberculosis than the 
general community within which they reside? If so, what is the 
excess risk due to occupational exposure?
      2. Can the occupationally acquired risk be quantified for 
different work environments, different job classifications, 
etc., as a result of implementation of the 1994 Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for the 
prevention of tuberculosis transmission at the worksite or the 
implementation of specific parts of the CDC guidelines?
      3. What effect will the implementation of OSHA's proposed 
tuberculosis standard have in minimizing or eliminating the 
risk of infection, disease, and mortality due to tuberculosis?
      The agreement includes language as proposed by the Senate 
setting aside $10,569,000 under the adolescent family life 
program for activities specified under Sec. 2003(b)(2) of the 
Public Health Service Act, of which $9,131,000 shall be for 
prevention grants under Sec. 510(b)(2) of the Social Security 
Act, without application of the limitation of Sec. 2010(c) of 
the Public Health Service Act. The House bill had no similar 
provision.
      With respect to the advance appropriation of $20,000,000 
for title XX of the Public Health Service Act, it is intended 
that these funds be used for grants to organizations that 
clearly and consistently focus on abstinence for preventing 
STD's and unwanted pregnancy. [Abstinence shall have the same 
meaning as in Public Law 104-193, title IX, section 912.] 
Grants to these organizations should focus on training persons 
as abstinence instructors and on providing actual presentations 
to youth at vulnerable ages (grades7 through 12). The 
Department shall hold competition for these grants during the regular 
grant cycle in fiscal year 2000 and issue these grants at the beginning 
of fiscal year 2001.
      The conference agreement concurs with the language in the 
House Report relating to an Institute of Medicine study on 
ethnic bias in medicine.
      Sufficient funds are available to continue the inner city 
childhood asthma project at the Children's Hospital of 
Philadelphia.
      It is understood that the screening of blood and blood 
products could be improved through the use of nucleic acid 
testing (NAT) to better detect known infectious diseases such 
as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) and Hepatitis C virus 
(HCV). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the 
National Institutes of Health has contracted with private 
companies to develop fully automated NAT tests for HIV-1 and 
HCV. In view of NIH's financial commitment to NAT and the 
approval of NAT in other countries, the Public Health Service 
Blood Safety Committee, chaired by the Surgeon General/
Assistant Secretary for Health, is urged to encourage the 
adoption of these screening tools for individual donor testing 
of blood and plasma.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate modified to earmark $500,000 to be utilized by the 
Surgeon General to prepare and disseminate the findings of the 
Surgeon General's report on youth violence and to coordinate 
with other agencies activities to prevent youth violence. The 
House bill had no similar provision.

available to the Inspector General in FY 2000 under the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to 
no more than $100,000,000, the same amount as in FY 1999. The

the study of the outcomes of welfare reform. It is recommended 
that this effort include the collection and use of state-
specific surveys and state and federal administrative data. The 
study should focus on improving the capabilities and 
comparability of data collection efforts and developing and 
reporting reliable State-by-State measures of family hardship 
and well-being and of the utilization of other support 
programs. The study should measure outcomes for a broad 
population of low-income families, welfare recipients, former 
recipients, potential recipients, and other special populations 
affected by state TANF policies, including diversion practices. 
The conference agreement includes sufficient funds to continue 
supporting efforts at Iowa State University to develop state-
level data on low-income families that can be integrated with 
national data collection efforts. A report is to be submitted 
to the Appropriations Committees within nine months.

            Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund

      The conference agreement provides $583,600,000 for the 
Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund instead of 
$391,833,000 as proposed by the House and $475,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement also includes 
a provision that these funds shall be made available only upon 
submission of a budget request designating the entire amount as 
an emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 as proposed by the House. 
The Senate bill did not propose this account as an emergency.

                           General Provisions

                       NIH and SAMHSA Salary Cap

      The conference agreement includes a provision limiting 
the use of the National Institutes of Health and the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration funds to pay 
the salary of an individual, through a grant or other 
extramural mechanism, at a rate not to exceed Level II of the 
Executive Schedule instead of Level III as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill contained no similar provision.

                           Transfer Authority

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the House to prohibit any appropriation from increasing by more 
than three percent as a result of use of the Secretary's one 
percent transfer authority. The Senate bill contained a similar 
provision except it exempted the Public Health and Social 
Services Emergency Fund.

                      Organ Allocation Final Rule

    The conference agreement includes a provision delaying the 
effective date of the Department's final rule entitled, ``Organ 
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN),'' promulgated 
by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on April 2, 1998 
(63 FR 16295 et. seq.) (relating to part 121 of Title 42, Code 
of Federal Regulations), together with amendments to such rule 
promulgated on October 20, 1999 (64 FR 56649 et seq.). The 
amended final rule shall not become effective before the 
expiration of the 42 day period beginning on the date of 
enactment of this Act.
    It is intended that the Secretary will continue discussions 
with the OPTN and other representatives of the transplant 
community for 21 days after enactment of this Act concerning 
the provisions of the amended final rule. It is also intended 
that the Secretary shall spend an additional 21 days 
considering the issues raised in those discussions before the 
amended final rule becomes effective. It is intended that this 
shall be the final delay of the rule.

             Substance Abuse Block Grant Formula Allocation

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the House to provide each State with the same funding level in 
fiscal year 2000 as it received in fiscal year 1999. The Senate 
bill contained a similar provision except it was based on an 
increased appropriation amount.

              Extension of Certain Adjudication Provisions

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate to extend the refugee status for persecuted 
religious groups. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.

           Medicare Competitive Pricing Demonstration Project

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate to prohibit funding to implement or administer the 
Medicare Prepaid Competitive Pricing Demonstration Project in 
Arizona or in Kansas City, Missouri or in the Kansas City, 
Kansas area. The House bill contained no similar provision.

                          Delayed Obligations

      The conference agreement includes a provision to delay 
the obligation of $3,000,000,000 of NIH funds; $450,000,000 of 
HRSA funds; $500,000,000 of CDC funds; $200,000,000 of SAMHSA 
funds; $425,000,000 of Social Services Block Grant funds; and 
$400,000,000 of Children and Families Services funds until 
September 29, 2000. The Senate bill contained a provision to 
delay the obligation of $3,000,000,000 of NIH funds until 
September 29, 2000. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.

      Sense of the Senate Regarding Diabetes Awareness and Funding

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice a 
sense of the Senate provision regarding diabetes awareness and 
support for increased diabetes research funding. The House bill 
contained no similar provision.

   Study of the Geographic Adjustment Factors in the Medicare Program

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate to require the Secretary of HHS to conduct a study 
on appropriateness of the geographic adjustment factors used to 
determine the amount of payment for physicians' services under 
the Medicare program in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and 
Texas and the effect thesefactors have on recruitment and 
retention of physicians in small rural States. The House bill contained 
no similar provision.

                  Dental Sealant Demonstration Program

      The conference agreement deletes a provision proposed by 
the Senate to establish a multi-State dental sealant 
demonstration program. The House bill contained no similar 
provision. The agreement includes sufficient funds within the 
Maternal and Child Health block grant to initiate such a 
program.

                  Withholding of Substance Abuse Funds

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the Senate to allow a State to avoid a penalty under section 
1926 of the Public Health Service Act (commonly known as the 
Synar Amendment) if the State agrees to commit new State 
funding to help ensure compliance with State laws prohibiting 
youth purchase of tobacco products. It is noted that the 
provision applies only for fiscal year 2000 and States are 
expected to continue to try to meet the established Synar 
Amendment targets for enforcement of their youth tobacco laws. 
It is also noted that there is increasing sentiment that the 
Synar Amendment needs to be reexamined and all concerned 
parties are encouraged to work toward a compromise solution 
next year with the appropriate authorizing committees. The 
provision allows the Secretary to exercise discretion in 
enforcing the timing of the new State expenditures in order to 
provide flexibility to States that do not immediately have 
available funds for this purpose. It is expected that within 30 
days of accepting an agreement to increase funding for 
enforcement, the State will provide a report to the Secretary 
of all State resources spent in fiscal year 1999 on enforcement 
of the State law by program activity and by May 15, 2000, a 
report on FY 2000 obligations regarding enforcement unless 
otherwise negotiated by the Secretary. The Secretary shall 
deliver the findings of these reports to Congress. The language 
provides the Secretary authority to permit a State to commit an 
amount smaller than its formula amount as described in 
subsection (b) in order to recognize that an individual state 
may have been granted ``delayed applicability'' status under 
the Synar Amendment by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration.

                   Medicare Injectable Drug Coverage

      The conference agreement includes a provision not 
proposed by either House or Senate related to Medicare 
injectable drug coverage. There is concern that an August 13, 
1997 memorandum and subsequent interpretations will 
inappropriately restrict beneficiary access to injectable drugs 
that are and have been covered by the Medicare program. It is 
noted that for many years, Medicare policy (as stated in 
Section 2049.2 of the Medicare Carriers Manual) has allowed 
coverage of a drug or biological administered incident to a 
physician's service where the product is one that is not 
usually self-administered by the patient. It is intended that 
HCFA continue to cover such products under Social Security Act 
section 1861(s)(2) and communicate this policy through a 
program memorandum to all HCFA regional offices. HCFA is 
directed to obtain public input on this matter by holding at 
least two regional ``town hall meetings'' to give interested 
organizations and individuals an opportunity to share their 
thoughts and concerns on the issue of reimbursement for 
injectable drugs.

                       National Cancer Institute

      The conference agreement includes a provision to allow 
the Cancer Therapy and Research Center in San Antonio, Texas to 
continue to use prior year construction grant funding without 
fiscal year limitation.

                            Childhood Asthma

      The conference agreement deletes a provision proposed by 
the Senate to provide an earmark of $8,706,000 for the asthma 
prevention program on October 1, 2000. The House bill contained 
no similar provision. The conference agreement includes 
$11,294,053 for asthma prevention as part of the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention.

                Study of Vaccines for Biological Agents

      The conference agreement transfers $20,000,000 from the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) for a collaborative effort to 
study the safety and efficacy of vaccines used against 
biological agents. The study would address: (1) the risk 
factors for adverse events, including differences in rates of 
adverse events between men and women; (2) determining 
immunological correlates of protection and documenting vaccine 
efficacy; and (3) optimizing the vaccination schedule and 
administration to assure efficacy while minimizing the number 
of doses required and the occurrence of adverse events. It is 
intended that NIH, CDC, and the Department of Defense will 
fully cooperate in this effort.

                           Title II Citation

      The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by 
the House to cite title II as the ``Department of Health and 
Human Services Appropriations Act, 2000''. The Senate bill 
contained no similar provision.

                   TITLE III--DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

                            Education Reform

      The conference agreement includes $1,768,370,000 for

agreement does not include advance funding of $344,625,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The House had no similar provision.
Goals 2000
      For Goals 2000, the conference agreement provides 
$491,000,000. The Senate provided $494,000,000. The House 
proposed no funding for this program. This amount includes 
$458,000,000 for state grants, instead of $461,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The House proposed no funding for this 
program.For parental assistance, the conference agreement 
includes $33,000,000, the same level as in the Senate bill. The House

                    Education for the Disadvantaged

      The conference agreement includes $8,700,986,000 for 
Education for the Disadvantaged instead of the $8,750,986,000 
proposed by the Senate and $8,417,897,000 as proposed by the 
House. The agreement includes advance funding for this account 
of $6,204,763,000, the same as both the House and the Senate.
      For Grants to Local Education Agencies (LEAs) the 
agreement provides $7,941,397,000, compared with $8,052,397,000 
provided in the Senate bill and $7,732,397,000 provided in the 
House bill. Of the funds made available for basic grants, 
$5,046,366,000 becomes available on October 1, 2000 for the 
academic year 2000-2001.
      The agreement includes $6,783,000,000 for basic state 
grants and $1,158,397,000 for concentration grants. Of this 
total, $1,158,397,000 for fiscal year 2000 was advance funded 
in the fiscal year 1999 Departments of Labor, Health and Human 
Services and Education and Related Agencies Act (P.L. 105-277). 
The conference agreement funding of $1,158,397,000 for 
concentration grants is advanced for fiscal year 2001.
      The conference agreement includes $134,000,000 within the 
Title I program to help schools in school improvement status to 
improve student achievement. The conference agreement also 
provides that school districts must give students attending 
schools identified in school improvement status the option to 
transfer to another public school within the local educational 
agency that has not been identified for school improvement. If 
the local educational agency does not have the capacity to 
provide this option to all students who seek it, the local 
educational agency must permit as many students as possible to 
transfer to another public school that is not in school 
improvement status.
      The conference agreement includes $12,000,000 for capital 
expenses for private school children, instead of $15,000,000 
proposed by the Senate. The House contained no funding for this 
program.
      The conference agreement provides $150,000,000 for the 
Even Start program as proposed by the House. The Senate 
provided $145,000,000 for this program.
      The conference agreement provides $42,000,000 for 
Neglected and Delinquent Youth as proposed by the Senate. The 
House provided $40,311,000 for this program.
      The conference agreement provides $8,900,000 for 
evaluation of title I programs as proposed by the Senate. The 
House provided $7,500,000 for this activity.
      The conference agreement includes the provision contained 
in the Senate bill regarding a 100% hold harmless for States 
and LEAs for both basic and concentration grants. The 
conference agreement also adopts language included in the 
Senate bill providing that the Department shall make 100% hold 
harmless awards to LEAs who were eligible for concentration 
grants in 1998 but are not eligible to receive grants in fiscal 
year 2000, ratably reduced if necessary.
      The House nevertheless opposes the hold harmless 
provision because it unfairly penalizes underprivileged and 
immigrant children in growing states, including Arizona, 
Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, 
Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Texas, Virginia and the District of Columbia. These 
states represent over half of the U.S. population of 
underprivileged schoolchildren.
      The House also notes that the 100% hold harmless 
provision is opposed by the House authorizing committee of 
jurisdiction and the Administration. The House will continue to 
oppose the inclusion of such a provision in the future.
      The conference agreement also adopts language included in 
the Senate bill providing that the Secretary of Education shall 
not take into account the 100% hold harmless provision in 
determining State allocations under any other program.
      The conference agreement includes $170,000,000 for the 
Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration Program under Title 
I-Education for the Disadvantaged; both the House and Senate 
funded this program at $120,000,000. Together with $50,000,000 
provided under the Fund for the Improvement of Education, the 
conference agreement includes a total of $220,000,000 for 
Comprehensive School Reform grants to school districts for 
continuation and new awards.
      The conference agreement directs the Department to follow 
the directives in the conference report accompanying the fiscal 
year 1998 bill (House Report 105-390) and in the conference 
report accompanying the fiscal year 1999 bill (House Report 
105-825).
      The conference agreement includes $15,000,000 for the 
High School Equivalency Program instead of $9,000,000 as 
proposed by both the House and the Senate and includes 
$7,000,000 for the College Assistance Migrant Program instead 
of $4,000,000 as proposed by both the House and the Senate.

                               IMPACT AID

      The conference agreement provides $910,500,000 for the 
Impact Aid programs. The House proposed $907,200,000. The 
Senate proposed $892,000,000. For basic grants the conference 
agreement includes $737,200,000, for payments for children with 
disabilitiesthe agreement includes $50,000,000, and for 
payments for heavily impacted districts the agreement includes 
$76,000,000. The agreement also includes $5,000,000 for facilities 
maintenance, $10,300,000 for construction, and $32,000,000 for payments 
for federal property. The conference agreement provides within the 
account for construction, $500,000 for the Ft. Sam Houston ISD, 
$800,000 for the Hays Lodgepole School District in MT and $2,000,000 
for the North Chicago Community Unit School District.
      The conference agreement also includes the following 
language provisions: eligibility for the Central Union, Island, 
and Hueneme School Districts in California and the Hill City, 
Wall, and Hot Springs School Districts in South Dakota; timely 
filing of applications by the Brookeland School District in 
Texas, the Fallbrook High School District in California and 
Hydaburg School District in Alaska; forgiveness of overpayment 
for the Hatboro-Horsham and Delaware Valley School Districts in 
Pennsylvania; and computing payments for Travis School District 
in California. Neither the House nor Senate bills contained 
similar provisions.
      The conference agreement notes the Administration's 
proposal to significantly expand the Military Family Housing 
Privatization Initiative, which has since been scaled back. In 
some privatization projects, the property itself is privatized, 
causing serious implications for the affected school districts' 
ability to receive funding under the Impact Aid program. Thus, 
the conference agreement strongly urges the Administration to 
clarify that military family housing privatization proposals 
will have no effect on Impact Aid payments to local school 
districts, even if land is privatized.

                      School Improvement Programs

      The conference agreement provides $3,026,884,000 for 
School Improvement Programs, instead of $3,115,188,000 as 
proposed by the House and $2,961,634,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The agreement provides $1,511,884,000 in fiscal year 
2000 and $1,515,000,000 in fiscal year 2001 funding for this 
account.
Eisenhower professional development
      For the Eisenhower professional development activities, 
the agreement provides $335,000,000, the same level as in the 
Senate bill. The House provided no funding for this activity.
Innovative education program strategies
      For innovative education program strategies, title VI of 
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the 
conference agreement provides $380,000,000. The House provided 
$385,000,000 and the Senate bill included $375,000,000.
Class size
      The conference agreement includes $1,300,000,000 to 
continue the initiative to reduce class size that was begun in 
fiscal year 1999. The House bill provides $1,800,000,000 for 
the Teacher Empowerment Act, subject to authorization. The 
Senate bill provided $1,200,000,000 for teacher assistance 
activities, subject to authorization. The agreement provides 
$400,000,000 in fiscal year 2000 and $900,000,000 in fiscal 
year 2001 funding for this account.
      The conference agreement provides that the allocation of 
funds under section 310 to the states shall be based on the 
proportional share that each state received from the fiscal 
year 1999 appropriation for class size reduction. States will 
continue to allocate their grant funds among local educational 
agencies based on a formula that reflects both their relative 
numbers of children in low-income families and their school 
enrollments.
      Local educational agencies would use funds for 
recruiting, hiring and training fully qualified regular and 
special education teachers who are certified within the states, 
have a baccalaureate degree and demonstrate subject matter 
knowledge in their content areas. Twenty five percent of these 
funds may be used by local educational agencies to test new 
teachers for academic content knowledge, to meet state 
certification requirements, or to provide professional 
development for existing teachers to meet the goal of ensuring 
that all instructional staff are fully qualified. All teachers 
hired using fiscal year 1999 funds for this program must also 
be fully qualified within one year. A local educational agency 
that has already reduced class size in the early grades may use 
its funds to make further reductions in grades kindergarten 
through 3 or other grades, or carry out activities to improve 
teacher quality. A local educational agency in which 10 percent 
or more of its elementary teachers are uncertified may apply to 
the state for a waiver under the Education Flexibility 
Partnership Act to use funds under this program for the purpose 
of helping those teachers become certified. A local educational 
agency that receives an award under this section which is less 
than the starting salary for a new teacher may use these funds 
to help pay the salary of a teacher or pay for professional 
development activities to ensure that all the instructional 
staff are fully qualified.
      To improve accountability, the conference agreement 
provides that each state and local educational agency receiving 
funds publicly report to parents on the progress in reducing 
class size, increasing the percentage of classes in core 
academic areas taught by fully qualified teachers, and the 
impact that such activities has had on increasing student 
academic achievement. Parents, upon request, will also have the 
right to know the professional qualifications of their 
children's teachers.
      The conference agreement urges the Secretary of Education 
to inform local educational agencies of the new flexibility 
provisions of this section, particularly the increase in the 
amount that can be spent on new teacher testing and 
professional development activities, the ability to spend these 
funds on professional development for existing teachers if the 
LEA receives an award that is less than the starting salary for 
a new fully qualified teacher, and the additional flexibility 
provided to LEAs in states participating in the ``Ed-Flex'' 
Program.

the Senate. The agreement provides $115,000,000 in fiscal year 
2000 and $330,000,000 in fiscal year 2001 funding for this 
account.

$476,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

safe and drug free schools national programs to continue the

alcohol and drug abuse prevention and education at the college 
level.
      The conference agreement includes $50,000,000 under 
national programs for the Safe and Drug Free Schools 
coordinator initiative, instead of $35,000,000 as proposed by 
the House and $60,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $750,000 for a study of 
school violence authorized under section 4 of P.L. 106-71 (the 
Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act). The 
conference agreement requests the National Academy of Sciences 
to consult with the authorizing and appropriations committees 
in developing the scope and specifications for this study.
Reading is Fundamental
      For the Reading is Fundamental program, the conference 
agreement provides $20,000,000 instead of $21,500,000 as 
proposed by the Senate and $18,000,000 as proposed by the 
House.
Arts in Education
      For Arts in Education, the conference agreement provides 
$11,500,000, instead of $10,500,000 as proposed by the House 
and $12,500,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Magnet Schools Assistance Program
      For the Magnet Schools Assistance Program, the conference 
agreement provides $110,000,000 instead of $104,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $112,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
Education of Native Hawaiians
      The conference agreement includes $23,000,000 for the 
Education of Native Hawaiians, the same level as in the Senate.

described in the Report of the Senate Committee (Senate Report 
No. 106-166).

Advanced placement fees
      For advanced placement fees, the conference agreement 
provides $15,000,000 as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$4,000,000 as proposed by the House. The conference agreement 
notes that less than half of our Nation's high schools offer 
some form of Advanced Placement (AP) course instruction for 
junior and senior high school students. The lack of access to 
this instruction is particularly acute in rural parts of the 
country. Internet-based AP course instruction is a dynamic and 
cost-effective way to deliver AP instruction to students living 
in rural areas and other areas where conventional instructor-
led training for AP courses is not available. Accordingly, the 
conference agreement encourages the Secretary to use some of 
the Advanced Placement Incentive Program funds to award grants 
to States or LEAs seeking to establish Internet-based AP pilot 
programs in rural parts of the country or other under-served 
districts where students would otherwise not have access to AP 
instruction.

proposed by the Senate. The agreement provides $65,000,000 in

for this account.

in fiscal year 2001 funding for this account.

proposed by the House and $9,548,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement sets the maximum Pell Grant at

current law Pell Grants. The conference agreement does not 
provide advance funding for this account. The House advance

Within the amount provided, the conference report specifies 
funding for the following activities:

University of South Florida for a distance learning program...$3,000,000

    distance learning program.................................   190,000
Alliance for Technology, Learning and Society (ATLAS) at the 
    University of Colorado for technology-enhanced learning... 2,000,000
Interactive Learning Environments at the University of Idaho 
    for a distance learning program........................... 1,250,000
Illinois Community College Board to develop a systemwide, on-
    line virtual degree program for the community college 
    system.................................................... 2,500,000

    The conference agreement includes $98,000,000 for Teacher 
Quality Enhancement Grants instead of $75,000,000 as proposed 
by the House and $80,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement reflects concern about long-standing 
problems with teacher education programs in America, including 
inadequate time to learn subject matter in depth; fragmented 
coursework that is disconnected from practice teaching; 
uninspired teaching methods; and superficial curriculum. 
Without considerable attention to raising the quality of 
teacher preparation programs, an increasing number of under-
qualified teachers will be teaching our children. The 
Department of Education estimates that 2 million more teachers 
will be needed over the next 10 years as student enrollments 
reach their highest levels ever, and teacher retirements and 
attrition create large numbers of vacancies.
    The conference agreement notes that while some exemplary 
approaches to teacher education exist, too few institutions 
have restructured their programs to assure that teachers are 
well qualified in the subjects they teach and well trained in 
research-based instructional practices needed to help all 
children learn. Therefore, the conference agreement urges the 
Secretary to apply rigorous criteria in funding new Teacher 
Quality Enhancement Partnership Grants in fiscal year 2000 and 
to submit a letter to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations outlining the criteria that the Secretary will 
use to evaluate applications and to ensure that institutions of 
higher education receiving funding under this program achieve 
measurable performance outcomes that will enhance teacher 
quality. Such outcomes might include, but not be limited to, 
improved performance (measured through test scores, portfolios, 
state certification or other means) of students in teacher 
training programs; increases in the amount and rigor of 
coursework in content areas; increased and extended clinical 
placements; increased entry of graduates into teaching; and 
raising academic standards for entry into and graduation from 
teacher preparation programs.
      The conference agreement also includes $1,750,000 for the 
Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program as 
proposed by the Senate. The House did not fund this activity.
      The conference agreement includes $1,000,000 for 
community scholarship mobilization, instead of $2,000,000 as

Senate did not provide separate line item funding for this

             EDUCATION RESEARCH, STATISTICS AND IMPROVEMENT

      The conference agreement includes $596,892,000 for 
Education Research, Statistics and Improvement instead of the 
$390,867,000 as proposed by the House and $368,867,000 as 
proposed in the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides $103,567,000 for 
research instead of $83,567,000 proposed by the House and 
$82,567,000 proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement 
includes a total of $20,000,000 for current and expanded 
comprehensive school reform research and development and 
includes $1,000,000 for the development of a five-year plan for 
an expanded research program of large-scale, systematic 
experimentation and demonstration focused on strategic 
education issues in accordance with the guidelines outlined in 
the Report of the House Committee (House Report 106-370).

research and development priorities to guide the work funded 
and that funds be obligated and distributed in accordance with 
the fiscal year 1999 allocations by December 1, 1999.
      The conference agreement provides $68,000,000 for

proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides $50,000,000 for 
continuation grants for schools in their third year of 
implementing comprehensive school reform. The conference 
agreement also includes $15,000,000 to continue existing and 
award new contracts to providers of comprehensive school reform 
models. In making new awards, the Department should give 
priority to proposals to serve schools located in rural or 
isolated areas.
      The conference agreement provides funds for the 
continuation of Project Jump Start and provides funds for the 
continuation and expansion of the Youth Safety Corps. The 
conference agreement also includes $400,000 for the National 
Student and Parent Mock Elections.
      Within the amount provided, $20,000,000 is to be used for 
the Elementary School Counseling Demonstration Program to 
establish or expand counseling programs in elementary schools.
    The conference agreement includes $45,000,000 for a Small 
Schools initiative under section 10105 of Part A of title X of 
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The conference 
agreement recognizes that one approach that holds great 
potential for preventing school violence is creating smaller 
high schools. The tragic shootings at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colorado have reinforced what many education 
practitioners already know--the impersonal nature of large high 
schools leaves too many young people feeling apathetic, 
isolated and alienated from their peers, schools and 
communities.
    Yet, approximately 70% of American high school students 
attend schools enrolling 1,000 or more students despite the 
strong body of research documenting the benefits of smaller 
higher schools. These benefits include less crime and violence, 
fewer disciplinary problems, less alcohol and tobacco use, 
better student attendance, fewer dropouts, more satisfied 
students, greater student participation in school activities, 
and greater student academic achievement. The conference 
agreement acknowledges that the significant benefits of smaller 
schools justify a federal investment to encourage school 
districts to undertake research-based strategies to create 
smaller learning communities within large high schools, as 
recommended in Breaking Ranks, a 1996 study commissioned by the 
nation's secondary school principals. Such strategies include 
establishing small learning clusters, ``houses'', career 
academies, magnet schools or other approaches to creating 
schools within schools; block scheduling; personal adult 
advocates, teacher-advisory systems and other mentoring 
strategies; reduced teaching loads; and other innovations 
designed to create a more personalized high school experience 
for students and improve student achievement.
    Within the amount for the Small Schools initiative, not 
less than $42,750,000 is for competitive grants to local 
educational agencies to plan, develop and implement smaller 
learning communities where students receive individual 
attention and support--with a goal of not more than 600 
students in each learning community. The conference agreement 
directs that each grantee shall use funds only for activities 
related to high school redesign and that up to $2,250,000 may 
be used by the Secretary for evaluation, technical assistance, 
and school networking activities. The conference agreement 
affirms that the management of this initiative would benefit 
from a team effort within the Department and directs that the 
program shall be jointly managed by the Office of Elementary 
and Secondary Education and the Office of Vocational and Adult 
Education. Finally, the Department shall provide a letter by 
March 31, 2000 to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations outlining its plan for implementing this 
initiative.

             Technical Correction to Fiscal Year 1999 Bill

      The conference agreement deletes a provision contained in 
the House bill which made a technical correction to P.L. 105-
277 (the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations Act, 1999). The Senate bill had no similar 
provision.

               Direct Student Loan Administrative Account

      The conference agreement deletes a provision contained in 
the House bill which froze the administrative account for the 
Direct Student Loan program at fiscal year 1999 levels. The 
Senate bill had no similar provision.

                        Voluntary National Tests

      The conference agreement does not include a provision 
contained in the Senate bill regarding voluntary national 
tests. This language is not necessary since P.L. 105-277 (the 
Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations 
Act, 1999) adopted a permanent change to the law that 
specifically prohibited any pilot testing, field testing, 
administration or distribution of individualized national tests 
that are not specifically and explicitly provided for in 
authorizing legislation enacted into law. At the present time, 
there is no specific and explicit authority in Federal law for 
individualized national tests.

                                Funding

      The conference agreement deletes a provision contained in 
the Senate bill which redistributed funding for certain 
education programs. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.

         Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program

      The conference agreement deletes a provision contained in 
the Senate bill that provided advance funding for the LEAP 
program. The House bill contained no similar provision.

        missing, exploited, and runaway children protection act

      The conference agreement includes an amendment to P.L. 
106-71, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection 
Act.

 limitation on punitive damages awarded against institutions of higher 
                               education

      The conference agreement includes an amendment to P.L. 
106-37 which limits the punitive damages that may be awarded 
against an institution of higher education that is sued in an 
action for a ``Y2K'' failure in the institution's computer-
based student financial aid system.

                        impact and hold harmless

      The agreement includes a provision which provides that 
when calculating impact aid basic support payments, the 
Secretary of Education shall not use a local contribution rate 
that is less than the rate that was used in fiscal year 1998.

                 voter registration of college students

      The conference agreement includes an amendment to the 
Higher Education Act of 1965 relating to voter registration of 
college students.

                       TITLE IV--RELATED AGENCIES

                      Armed Forces Retirement Home

      The conference agreement provides $68,295,000 for the 
Armed Forces Retirement Home as proposed by the House. The 
Senate bill contained no appropriation for the Home.

             Corporation for National and Community Service

        DOMESTIC VOLUNTEER SERVICE PROGRAMS, OPERATING EXPENSES

      The conference agreement provides $295,645,000 for the 
Domestic Volunteer Service programs instead of $293,261,000 as 
proposed by the Senate and $274,959,000 as proposed by the 
House.
Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)
      The conference agreement provides $81,000,000 for VISTA 
as proposed by the Senate instead of $73,000,000 proposed by 
the House.
National Senior Volunteer Corps
      The conference agreement provides $96,354,000 for the 
Foster Grandparent Program (FGP), $39,369,000 for the Senior 
Companion Program (SCP), and $46,293,000 for the Retired Senior 
Volunteer Program (RSVP). The House proposed $93,256,000 for 
Foster Grandparents, $36,573,000 for Senior Companions and 
$43,001,000 for Retired Senior Volunteers. The Senate proposed 
$95,000,000 for FGP, $39,031,000 for SCP and $46,001,000 for 
RSVP.
      One-third of the increases provided for the FGP, SCP, and 
RSVP programs shall be used to fund Programs of National 
Significance expansion grants to allow existing FGP, RSVP and 
SCP programs to expand the number of volunteers serving in 
areas of critical need as identified by Congress in the 
Domestic Volunteer Service Act.
      Sufficient funding has been included to provide a 2 
percent increase for administrative costs realized by all 
current grantees in the FGP and SCP programs, and a 4 percent 
increase for administrative costs realized by all current 
grantees in the RSVP program. Funds remaining above these 
amounts should be used to begin new FGP, RSVP and SCP programs 
in geographic areas currently unserved. The conference 
agreement expects these projects to be awarded via a nationwide 
competition among potential community-based sponsors.
      The Corporation for National and Community Service shall 
comply with the directive that use of funding increases in the 
Foster Grandparent Program, Retired and Senior Volunteer 
Program and VISTA not be restricted to America Reads 
activities. The agreement further directs that the Corporation 
shall not stipulate a minimum or maximum amount for PNS grant 
augmentations.
      The conference agreement also provides $1,500,000 for 
senior demonstration activities, instead of $3,100,000 proposed 
by the Senate. The House did not propose funding for this 
activity. Sufficient funds are provided for the third and final 
year of the Seniors for Schools demonstration. Of the total, 
$350,000 is provided to conduct an evaluation of existing 
demonstration activities and to bring to closure the Seniors 
for Schools demonstration project.
      Funds are also provided to continue other existing senior 
demonstration activities, except that no funds are provided for 
the payment of non-taxable, non-income stipends to individuals 
not meeting income requirements established by Congress. No new 
demonstration projects may be begun with these funds. None of 
the increases provided for FGP, SCP, or RSVP in fiscal year 
2000 maybe used for demonstration activities. The agreement 
further expects that all future demonstration activities will be funded 
through allocations made through Part E of the Domestic Volunteer 
Service Act.
      Funds appropriated for Fiscal Year 2000 may not be used 
to implement or support service collaboration agreements or any 
other changes in the administration and/or governance of 
national service programs prior to passage of a bill by the 
authorizing committees of jurisdiction specifying such changes.
Program administration
      The conference agreement includes $31,129,000 for program 
administration of DVSA programs at the Corporation, instead of 
$29,129,000 that was provided in both House and Senate bills. 
The additional $2,000,000 is provided to assist the Corporation 
in correcting its financial management weaknesses and obtaining 
a clean opinion on its financial statements. Funding should be 
used to fully implement the new core financial management 
system and to make other technology enhancements that will 
improve customer service and field communications.

                  Corporation for Public Broadcasting

      The conference agreement provides $350,000,000 in advance 
funding for fiscal year 2002 for the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting as proposed by the Senate instead of $340,000,000 
as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the House providing an additional $10,000,000 for 
digitalization, if specifically authorized by subsequent 
legislation by September 30, 2000. The Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) has mandated that all public television be 
converted from analog to digital transmission by May 2003. 
Because television and radio broadcast infrastructures are 
closely linked, the conversion of television to digital will 
create immediate costs not only for television, but also for 
public radio stations. Public broadcasting stations with 
limited resources, in particular small rural stations, will be 
faced with extreme hardship because of the significant cost of 
converting to digital, therefore, the conference agreement 
encourages funds provided to be targeted to those stations with 
the most financial need.
      The conference agreement commends the Corporation for 
adoption of the Listener Access 2000 initiative and other 
related efforts that recognize the need to enhance service in 
rural and underserved areas. These steps will expand the number 
of stations defined as serving rural areas, create a new 
incentive grant tailored to areas with limited financial 
resources, while maintaining the public-private nature of 
public broadcasting.
      While this approach is a meaningful initial investment, 
the conference agreement urges the Corporation to continue to 
explore additional ways to ensure that its goal of universal 
service throughout the country is achieved. The conference 
agreement recognizes that stations serving rural and 
underserved audiences typically have limited local potential 
for fundraising because of sparse populations serviced, limited 
number of local businesses, and low-income levels.
      The conference agreement strongly urges the Corporation 
to consider expanding its Rural Listener Access Incentive Fund, 
which will support further enhancements to and reliability of 
service in rural and underserved areas. Furthermore, the 
conference agreement supports additional actions that will 
assist stations in serving rural and underserved areas.

               Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service

      The conference agreement provides $36,834,000 for the 
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service as proposed by the 
Senate instead of $34,620,000 as proposed by the House. The 
conference agreement also includes bill language proposed by 
the Senate stating that FMCS may charge for training 
activities, services, and assistance, including those provided 
to foreign governments and international organizations.

            Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission

      The conference agreement provides $6,159,000 for the 
Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission as proposed by 
the Senate instead of $6,060,000 as proposed by the House.

                Institute of Museum and Library Services

      The conference agreement provides $166,885,000 for the 
Institute of Museum and Library Services. The Senate proposed 
$154,500,000. The House proposed $149,500,000. The conference 
agreement does not accept the President's request for 
$5,000,000 under National Leadership Grants for Libraries for 
the National Digital Library initiative. The increase in 
funding for this account should be used for new awards under 
the regular grant competition. Within the amount provided, the 
conference report specifies funding for the following 
activities:

active consideration its proposed rulemaking proceedings in 
this area.

                        National Mediation Board

      The conference agreement provides $9,600,000 for the 
National Mediation Board as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$8,400,000 as proposed by the House. The conference agreement 
also includes bill language that unobligated balances at the 
end of fiscal year 2000 not needed for emergencies shall remain

      The conference agreement includes a general provision as 
proposed by the House that prohibits the use of funds in this 
Act to carry out any program of distributing sterile needles or 
syringes for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug. The

not have become effective until one day after the date of 
enactment of this Act.

                   Unobligated Salaries and Expenses

      The conference agreement includes a general provision 
proposed by the House that would allow salaries and expenses 
funds in the bill that are unobligated at the end of the fiscal 
year to remain available for three additional months, provided

obligated. The Senate bill had no similar provision.

                   Railroad Retirement Board Buyouts

      The conference agreement includes a provision amending 
existing law as proposed by the Senate to allow the Railroad

2466, the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations Act, shall include 
language prohibiting the use of funds for the Brooklyn Museum 
of Art unless the Museum immediately cancels the exhibit 
``Sensation'' which contains obscene and pornographic pictures 
and other offensive material.

                      Hospital Outpatient Services

13951(t)).

                  Former Recipients of TANF Assistance

and investigation into the scientific validity of polygraphy as 
a screening tool for Federal and Federal contractor personnel. 
However, the Secretary of HHS is urged to conduct such a study 
and report her findings to Congress.

                        Prostate Cancer Research

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice a 
sense of the Senate provision stating that finding treatment 
breakthroughs and a cure for prostate cancer should be made a 
national health priority, that significant increases in 
prostate cancer research funding should be made available to 
NIH and DoD, and that these agencies should prioritize research 
that is directed toward innovative clinical and translational 
projects.

                      Border Health Commission Act

      The conference agreement includes a Senate provision 
amending the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission Act 
to require the President to appoint the United States members 
of the Commission and attempt to conclude an agreement with

later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this 
provision. The House bill contained no similar provision.

             Access to Obstetric and Gynecological Services

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice a 
sense of the Senate provision stating that Congress should 
enact legislation that requires health plans to provide women 
with direct access to a participating obstetrician/gynecologist 
without first having to obtain a referral from a primary care 
provider or the health plan.

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice a 
sense of the Senate provision stating that the Federal 
government should support state and local educational agencies 
engaged in comprehensive reform of their public education 
systems.

                  Federal Employees' Compensation Act

      The conference agreement includes a Senate provision with 
respect to a compensation claim arising from injuries sustained 
as a result of an employee's exposure to a nitrogen or sulfur 
mustard agent at the Department of the Army's Edgewood Arsenal 
before March 20, 1944. The House had no similar provision.

                        Workforce Investment Act

      The conference agreement includes a Senate provision 
amending the Workforce Investment Act with respect to Alaska 
Natives. The House had no similar provision.

                          Needlestick Injuries

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice a 
sense of the Senate provision stating that the Senate should 
pass legislation to eliminate or minimize the risk of 
needlestick injury to health care workers.

                                TITLE VI

         Newborn and Infant Hearing Screening and Intervention

      The conference agreement includes a separate title as 
proposed by the House which authorizes grants to States on a 
voluntary basis for a three-year period to aid in setting up 
newborn infant hearing screening programs. This language 
authorizes funding for the Health Resources and Services 
Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
and the National Institutes of Health for the implementation of 
these programs and provides that State programs shall work with 
participants to ensure that all children are given options for 
care to include, but not be limited to medical, audiologic, 
rehabilitative, education, and community service programs. The 
Senate bill contained no similar language.

                               TITLE VII

      The conference agreement amends Section 307 of Title 
III--Denali Commission of Division C--Other Matters of P.L. 
105-277 by adding a new subsection that authorizes the 
Secretary of HHS to make grants to the Denali Commission to 
plan, construct, and equip multi-county demonstration health, 
nutrition, and child care projects in accordance with the Work 
Plan referred to under section 304. The House and Senate bills 
contained no similar provision.

                               TITLE VIII

                        Welfare-to-Work Changes

      The conference agreement incorporates amendments to the 
Welfare-to-Work authorizing legislation (section 403(a)(5) of 
the Social Security Act). These amendments were included in a 
bill considered and passed by the House (H.R. 3073). Effective 
date provisions have been added.
      These amendments streamline eligibility determinations 
for welfare recipients and others with characteristics 
associated with welfare dependence, extend eligibility to 
youths aging out of foster care and to custodial parents below 
the poverty level, and enhance opportunities for noncustodial 
parents entering into personal responsibility agreements with 
commitments to provide child support. Vocational educational or 
job training for up to 6 months will be an allowable activity 
in Welfare-to-Work programs. Reporting requirements are 
simplified. The conference agreement reduces the existing law's 
authority to award $100 million in bonuses to Welfare-to-Work 
programs for successful performance to $50 million.

                            Other Provisions

      The conference agreement deletes without prejudice a 
House provision to require any elementary or secondary school 
or public library that has received any Federal funds for the 
acquisition or operation of any computer that is accessible to 
minors and that has access to the Internet to install software 
on such computer designed to prevent minors from obtaining 
access to any obscene information using that computer and to 
ensure that such software is operational whenever that computer 
is used by minors. Exceptions are granted to permit a minor to 
have access to information thatis not obscene or otherwise 
unprotected by the Constitution under the direct supervision of an 
adult designated by the school or library. The Senate bill contained no 
similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include House language 
amending the National Labor Relations Act to require the NLRB 
to adjust its jurisdictional threshold amounts for the 
inflation that has occurred since the adoption of the current 
thresholds on August 1, 1959. The Senate bill contained no 
similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include House language 
amending the Internal Revenue Code to require that Earned 
Income Tax Credit payments be paid on a monthly basis rather 
than in a lump sum annual payment. The Senate bill contained no 
similar language.
      The conference agreement does not include House language 
amending the Higher Education Act to require the Secretary of 
Education to charge an origination fee on direct student loans 
of four percent. The Senate bill included no similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include House language 
amending the National Housing Act to eliminate the premium 
rebate on FHA home mortgages. The Senate bill included no 
similar provision.
      The conference agreement does not include an 
appropriation of $508,000,000 proposed by the House for the 
Department of Agriculture to provide assistance to producers 
for crop and livestock losses incurred as a result of the 
hurricanes, and the flooding associated with the hurricanes, 
that struck the eastern United States in August and September, 
1999. The Senate bill included no similar appropriation.

        is at least 250 percent of the annual fiscal revenues 
        of the country, and has minimum ratios of exports to 
        Gross Domestic Product of 30 percent, and of fiscal 
        revenues to Gross Domestic Product of 15 percent.
    (e) Priority.--In carrying out subsection (a), the 
President should seek to leverage scarce foreign assistance and 
give priority to heavily indebted poor countries with 
demonstrated need and the capacity to use such relief 
effectively.
    (f) Exceptions.--A country shall not be eligible for 
cancellation of debt under this section if the government of 
the country--
            (1) has an excessive level of military 
        expenditures;
            (2) has repeatedly provided support for acts of 
        international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary 
        of State under section 6(j)(1) of the Export 
        Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)) 
        or section 620A(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
        1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371(a));
            (3) is failing to cooperate on international 
        narcotics control matters; or
            (4) (including its military or other security 
        forces), engages in a consistent pattern of gross 
        violations of internationally recognized human rights.
    (g) Additional Requirement.--A country which is otherwise 
eligible to receive cancellation of debt under this section may 
receive such cancellation only if the country has committed, in 
connection with a social and economic reform program--
            (1) to enable, facilitate, or encourage the 
        implementation of policy changes and institutional 
        reforms under economic reform programs, in a manner 
        that ensures that such policy changes and institutional 
        reforms are designed and adopted through transparent 
        and participatory processes;
            (2) to adopt an integrated development strategy of 
        the type described in section 1624(a) of the 
        International Financial Institutions Act, to support 
        poverty reduction through economic growth, that 
        includes monitorable poverty reduction goals;
            (3) to take steps so that the financial benefits of 
        debt relief are applied to programs to combat poverty 
        (in particular through concrete measures to improve 
        economic infrastructure, basic services in education, 
        nutrition, and health, particularly treatment and 
        prevention of the leading causes of mortality) and to 
        redress environmental degradation;
            (4) to take steps to strengthen and expand the 
        private sector, encourage increased trade and 
        investment, support the development of free markets, 
        and promote broad-scale economic growth;
            (5) to implement transparent policy making and 
        budget procedures, good governance, and effective 
        anticorruption measures;
            (6) to broaden public participation and popular 
        understanding of the principles and goals of poverty 
        reduction, particularly through economic growth, and 
        good governance; and
            (7) to promote the participation of citizens and 
        nongovernmental organizations in the economic policy 
        choices of the government.
    (h) Certain Prohibitions Inapplicable.--Except as the 
President may otherwise determine for reasons of national 
security, a cancellation of debt under this section shall not 
be considered to be assistance for purposes of any provision of 
law limiting assistance to a country. The authority to provide 
for cancellation of debt under this section may be exercised 
notwithstanding section 620(r) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, or any similar provision of law.
    (i) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the cost (as 
defined in section 502(5) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 
1990) of the cancellation of any debt under this section, there 
are authorized to be appropriated to the President such sums as 
may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2000 through 
2004, which shall remain available until expended.
    (j) Annual Reports to the Congress.--Not later than 
December 31 of each year, the President shall prepare and 
transmit to the Committees on Banking and Financial Services, 
Appropriations, and International Relations of the House of 
Representatives, and the Committees on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs, Foreign Relations, and Appropriations of the 
Senate a report, which shall be made available to the public, 
concerning the cancellation of debt under subsection (a), and a 
detailed description of debt relief provided by the United 
States as a member of the Paris Club of Official Creditors for 
the prior fiscal year.

in order to help reduce poverty and improve the lives of 
residents of poor countries and, in particular, to allow those 
poor countries with unsustainable debt burdens to receive 
deeper, broader, and faster debt relief, without allowing gold 
to reach the open market or otherwise adversely affecting the 
market price of gold, the Secretary of the Treasury is 
authorized to instruct the United States Executive Director of 
the Fund to vote--

Agreements Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall certify to 
the Congress that neither the profits nor the earnings on the 
investment of profits from the gold sales made pursuant to the

                    GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS CHAPTER

      Sec. 101. The conference agreement directs the Secretary 
of Agriculture to provide up to $20,000,000 in assistance under 
the noninsured crop assistance program, without any requirement 
for an area loss, to producers located in a county with respect 
to which a natural disaster was declared by the Secretary or a 
major disaster or emergency was declared by the President under 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance 
Act.
      Sec. 102. The conference agreement includes language 
making a technical correction to section 814 of Public Law 106-
78 regarding crop insurance premium discounts.
      Sec. 103. The conference agreement includes language 
permitting the Secretary of Agriculture to obligate not to 
exceed $4,700,000 of previously appropriated funds for 
mandatory livestock private reporting.
      Sec. 104. The conference agreement includes language 
which permits the Secretary of Agriculture to provide 
assistance to producers or first-handlers for the 1999 crop of 
cottonseed, and which provides special competitive provisions 
for extra long staple cotton.
      The Farm Service Agency of the Department of Agriculture 
has indicated that funds made available by previous 
appropriations Acts for market loss assistance may exceed the 
amounts necessary to carry out the requirements of those Acts. 
If the Secretary determines that this is the case, the 
conference agreement directs that such funds shall be applied 
first to fund activities related to mandatory livestock price 
reporting, second to fund assistance to producers or first-
handlers for the 1999 crop of cottonseed, and third to fund 
activities related to special competitive provisions for extra 
long staple cotton. Within 30 days of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary shall report to the Appropriations Committees of 
the House and the Senate on the status of funds previously 
appropriated for market loss assistance in Public Laws 105-277 
and 106-78, and the plan and timetable for obligation of any 
excess funds. Further, the Secretary shall report periodically 
(but no less frequently than quarterly) on the status of such 
funds and plans until all funds previously appropriated for 
market loss assistance are exhausted.
      Sec. 105. The conference agreement requires that the 
entire amount necessary to carry out this chapter shall be 
available only to the extent that an official budget request 
for the entire amount, that includes designation of the entire 
amount of the request as an emergency requirement, is 
transmitted by the President to the Congress and that the 
entire amount is designated by the Congress as an emergency 
requirement.

                               CHAPTER 2

                  Federal Emergency Management Agency

                            disaster relief

      The President has proposed that of the funding made 
available in Public Law 106-74, up to $429,149,000 would be 
available for property acquisition and relocation assistance 
for residential homeowner victims of Hurricane Floyd. Since 
current regulations and policies do not adequately address this 
type of assistance, the President's proposal would be to 
provide this funding to the affected states through the section 
404 program of the Stafford Act.
      There is no doubt that Hurricane Floyd caused significant 
damage and loss of property. The Congress is committed to 
providing appropriate assistance to affected property owners. 
However, the conferees are concerned that FEMA does not have a 
structured program for buyouts and relocation of structures, 
including eligibility criteria, oversight procedures, 
procedures for affected states to prioritize projects, 
requirements for the submission of state and local buyout 
plans, procedures for cost-benefit analysis, and the process 
for measuring program results.
      The appropriate Congressional committees of jurisdiction 
should hold hearings early in the next session of Congress to 
explore fully the extent of the problem which exists because of 
damage caused by Hurricane Floyd and surrounding events, and 
the benefits and problems associated with buyouts and 
relocations. The authorizing committees should then recommend 
solutions to those problems, keeping in mind the need to 
control disaster relief costs while addressing the most 
compelling needs. Such hearings could then serve as the basis 
for FEMA to undertake a rulemaking which includes a significant 
comment period and would result in a policy which could be 
applied in a uniform manner to ensure that all individuals 
suffering losses are treated in a consistent and equitable 
manner.
      In the interim, the conferees have agreed to provide 
authority to spend up to $215,000,000 for buyout of homeowners 
(or the relocation of structures) for residences that have been 
made uninhabitable by flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd, and 
surrounding events, which are located in the 100-year flood 
plain. FEMA is required to promulgate interim regulations not 
later than December 31, 1999, pertaining to the buyout program. 
The conferees are aware that the authority provided does not 
give FEMA the same flexibility afforded under the section 404 
program and FEMA is directed to report to the Committees on 
Appropriations of the House and Senate on any significant 
problems which arise as a result of this decreased flexibility.
      The conferees continue to have serious concerns about the 
dissemination of accurate and useful information to water well 
owners about testing for contamination and implementing 
decontamination procedures for household drinking water in 
flood areas. The conferees encourage FEMA to continue to work 
with expert organizations, like the National Ground Water 
Association, in developing information about proper 
decontamination practices and procedures.

                 TITLE II--OTHER APPROPRIATIONS MATTERS

                 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE--OTHER ITEMS

      The conference agreement expects the Agricultural 
Marketing Service [AMS] to continue to assess the existing 
inventories of cranberries and to determine whether or not 
there is a surplus and continued low price in fiscal year 2000. 
If there is a surplus inventory of cranberries and continued 
low price, the Department is expected to purchase surplus 
cranberries under the authorities of section 32 for donation to 
schools, institutions, and other domestic feeding programs or 
for humanitarian food aid.
      The conference agreement encourages the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service to assist in the construction of the Snake 
River project in Warren, Minnesota.
      The conference agreement directs the General Accounting 
Office (GAO), in close consultation with the Department of 
Agriculture, to transmit to the Committees on Appropriations, 
Agriculture and Judiciary by June 30, 2000 a report on current 
practices and policies in the states concerning bonds to secure 
payment of employee wage obligations of ``farm labor 
contractors.'' The report shall include (a) a summary of state 
law requirements for such bonding of farm labor contractors; 
(b) an analysis of the role of farm labor contractors in the 
allocation and provision of farm labor for work performed by 
seasonal and migrant agricultural workers and the effect that 
state law bonding requirements have had on the availability of 
farm labor contracting services and farm labor; (c) an economic 
assessment of the availability, reliability and costs of such 
bonds for farm labor contractors; and (d) an assessment of the 
effect of such bond requirements on total farm labor 
compensation costs and benefits.

citrus canker.
      Sec. 205. The conference agreement includes language 
which provides for continuation of crop insurance revenue 
insurance pilots, and which provides for expansion of other 
crop insurance pilots. The Department is directed to report to 
the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate fifteen 
days prior to the implementation of any expansion of crop 
insurance pilot projects. This report will be expected to 
display the scope, impact, and justification for the expansion.
      Sec. 206. The conference agreement includes language 
which revises crop insurance sales closing dates.
      Sec. 207. The conference agreement includes language 
which allows funding to be provided for certain flood-related 
losses in the State of Oregon.
      Sec. 208. The conference agreement includes language 
which provides $5,000,000 and allows funding to be provided to 
repair storm-related damage to the Tillamook Railroad.
      Sec. 209. The conference agreement includes language 
which provides that the Congressional Hunger Center may invest 
funds for hunger fellowships and expend income from such funds, 
and that previously appropriated funds may be paid directly to 
the Congressional Hunger Center.
      Sec. 210. The conference agreement permits the Secretary 
of Agriculture to reprogram funds to provide up to $100,000 for 
the cost of guaranteed loans authorized by section 306 of the 
Rural Electrification Act of 1936.
      Sec. 211. The conference agreement includes language 
which repeals section 755(b) of Public Law 106-78, which is not

           fiscal year 2000 appropriations act clarification

      The conferees agree that it was the intention of Congress 
that the requirements of section 8149 of Public Law 106-79 in 
no way supercede the requirements of section 8154 of that Act.
      Sec. 218. Army Readiness Enhancements. The conference 
agreement includes a general provision providing $100,000,000 
to the Department of the Army, to address existing readiness 
shortfalls. The provision permits these funds to be used to 
initiate testing and validation of the new Army Vision concept. 
The conferees direct that none of the funds provided in this 
section may be obligated until 30 days after the Chief of Staff 
of the Army reports to the congressional defense committees the 
specific plan to utilize these funds, and, if funds are 
designated for the Army Vision concept, the relationship

      Sec. 240. On September 21, 1999, the Administration 
forwarded to Congress a package of budget amendments, including 
a request for additional funding for the United States Secret 
Service. However, Congress had already approved the Treasury 
and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000.
      To address this issue, a provision is included which 
provides an additional $10,000,000 to the United States Secret 
Service for salaries and expenses, and which in addition 
directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer $21,000,000 
to the United States Secret Service for new full-time-
equivalents (FTE). The conferees are aware that these funds are 
necessary to meet the additional workload requirements 
associated with the Secret Service's protective and 
investigative operations. The conferees regret that the 
Administration did not propose additional resources during the 
regular fiscal year 2000 appropriations process given that 
early separations and average overtime for agents are at 
unacceptably high rates.
      The conferees direct the Administration to submit, as 
part of its annual budget submission, a summary of workload 
trends for field agents including, but not limited to, average 
overtime and early separations. The conferees further directed 
the United States Secret Service, Assistant Director, Office of 
Investigations, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees 
on Appropriations on workforce retention and workload balance 
including, but not limited to, investigative and protective 
workloads, recruitment, and staffing by field office.

                        pathogen sensor systems

      The conferees commend the efforts of the Secret Service 
to improve its ability to detect biological agents. The 
conferees encourage the Secret Service to monitor the 
development of biological detector technology through 
coordination with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
(DARPA) for pathogen sensor systems. The conferees direct the 
Secret Service to report on the possible benefits of this 
technology to the Committees on Appropriations within 120 days 
of enactment of this Act.
      Sec. 241. The conference agreement includes a provision 
to extend the authority for agencies to submit Accountability 
Reports under the Government Management Reform Act of 1994.
      Sec. 242. The conference agreement amends Public Law 106-
74 to include seven additional economic development initiative 
projects.

respect to aggregate payments to hospitals, and that the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to 
determine such amount without regard to such section.

included in the enactment of BBA.

Outside Hospitals and Physicians' Offices.--
            (1) Study.--The Secretary of Health and Human

                health concerns for the patient;
                    (C) determine whether covering the delivery 
                of these drugs and biologicals in a patient's 
                home can reduce overall spending under the 
                medicare program; and
                    (D) determine whether changing the site of 
                setting for these services would affect 
                beneficiary access to care.
            (2) Report.--The Secretary shall submit a report on 
        such study to the Committees on Ways and Means and 
        Commerce of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Finance of the Senate within 18 months 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act. The 
        Secretary shall include in the report recommendations 
        regarding the appropriate manner and settings under 
        which the medicare program should pay for these drugs 
        and biologicals delivered outside of a hospital or 
        physician's office.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
shall establish by regulation (after notice and opportunity for 
public comment) a process (including data collection standards) 
under which the Secretary will accept for use and will use, to 
the maximum extent practicable and consistent with sound data 
practices, data collected or developed by entities and 
organizations (other than the Department of Health and Human 
Services) to supplement the data normally collected by that 
Department in determining the practice expense component under 
section 1848(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395w-4(c)(2)(C)(ii)) for purposes of determining relative

established under subsection (a) for the use of external data 
in making adjustments in relative value units and the extent to 
which the Secretary has used such external data in making such 
adjustments for each such year, particularly in cases in which 
the data otherwise used are inadequate because such data are

        report made on March 1, 1999, regarding the impact of 
        the Secretary's, fiscal intermediaries', and carriers' 
        use of such authority; and
            (2) the Secretary has published a notice of final 
        rulemaking in the Federal Register that relates to such 
        authority and that responds to such report and to

        interim final regulation relating to such authority 
        that was published in the Federal Register on January 
        7, 1998.

            (1) the Health Care Financing Administration has 
        been slow to incorporate or provide incentives for 
        providers to use new screening diagnostic health care 
        technologies in the area of cervical cancer;
            (2) some new technologies have been developed which 
        optimize the effectiveness of pap smear screening; and
            (3) the Health Care Financing Administration should 
        institute an appropriate increase in the payment rate 
        for new cervical cancer screening technologies that 
        have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
        and that are significantly more effective than a 
        conventional pap smear.

        with respect to a demonstration project--
                    ``(A) in its first year, a rate established 
                for the project by the Secretary, using the 
                most current available data, in a manner that 
                ensures that aggregate payments under the 
                project will not exceed the aggregate payment 
                that would have been made for ambulance 
                services under part B of title XVIII of the 
                Social Security Act in the local area of 
                government's jurisdiction; and

Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(i)), prior to incorporating data 
from the 1999 Medicare cost survey or a subsequent cost survey, 
such system shall be implemented in a manner so that--
            (1) in the first year of its implementation, only a 
        proportion (specified by the Secretary and not to 
        exceed \1/3\) of the payment for such services shall be 
        made in accordance with such system and the remainder 
        shall be made in accordance with current regulations;

                defined in subparagraph (C)) in a year during 
                the 5-year period beginning with 2000. The

                        this subsection shall be construed as

                        coverage provided for a cohort for a 
                        year from extending coverage to drugs

        actuarial methods, the Secretary shall compute the 
        number of additional months for the cohort for a year

        subsection, as computed based upon the best available 
        data at the time additional months are specified under 
        this subsection, do not exceed $150,000,000. Subject to

Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(a)(5)) shall apply with 
respect to the coverage of additional benefits for 
immunosuppressive drugs under the amendments made by this 
section for drugs furnished in 2000 in the same manner as if 
such amendments constituted a national coverage determination 
described in the matter in such section before subparagraph 
(A).
    (d) Report on Immunosuppressive Drug Benefit.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than March 1, 2003, the 
        Secretary of Health and Human Services shall submit to 
        Congress a report on the operation of this section and 
        the amendments made by this section. The report shall 
        include--
                    (A) an analysis of the impact of this 
                section; and

                appropriate cost-effective method for providing 
                coverage of immunosuppressive drugs under the 
                medicare program on a permanent basis.
            (2) Considerations.--In making recommendations 
        under paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall identify 
        potential modifications to the immunosuppressive drug 
        benefit that would best promote the objectives of--
                    (A) improving health outcomes (by 
                decreasing transplant rejection rates that are 
                attributable to failure to comply with 
                immunosuppressive drug regimens);
                    (B) achieving cost savings to the medicare 
                program (by decreasing the need for secondary 
                transplants and other care relating to post-
                transplant complications); and
                    (C) meeting the needs of those medicare 
                beneficiaries who, because of income or other 
                factors, would be less likely to maintain an 
                immunosuppressive drug regimen in the absence 
                of such modifications.

SEC. 410. GAO STUDY ON GEOGRAPHIC RECLASSIFICATION.

    (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United 
States shall conduct a study of the current laws and 
regulations for geographic reclassification of hospitals to 
determine whether such reclassification is appropriate for 
purposes of applying wage indices under the medicare program 
and whether such reclassification results in more accurate 
payments for all hospitals. Such study shall examine data on 
the number of hospitals that are reclassified and their 
reclassified status in determining payments under the medicare 
program. The study shall evaluate--
            (1) the magnitude of the effect of geographic 
        reclassification on rural hospitals that are not 
        reclassified;
            (2) whether the current thresholds used in 
        geographic reclassification reclassify hospitals to the 
        appropriate labor markets;
            (3) the effect of eliminating geographic 
        reclassification through use of the occupational mix 
        data;
            (4) the group reclassification policy;
            (5) changes in the number of reclassifications and 
        the compositions of the groups;
            (6) the effect of State-specific budget neutrality 
        compared to national budget neutrality; and
            (7) whether there are sufficient controls over the 
        intermediary evaluation of the wage data reported by 
        hospitals.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United

                adjustment factor applied to a Medicare+Choice 
                plan to explain variations in plans' average 
                per capita medicare costs, as reported by 
                Medicare+Choice plans in the plans' adjusted 
                community rate filings.
                    (B) The year-to-year stability of the risk 
                factors applied to each Medicare+Choice plan 
                and the potential for substantial changes in 
                payment for small Medicare+Choice plans.
                    (C) For medicare beneficiaries newly 
                enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans in a given 
                year, the correspondence between the average 
                risk factor calculated from medicare fee-for-
                service data for those individuals from the 
                period prior to their enrollment in a 
                Medicare+Choice plan and the average risk 
                factor calculated for such individuals during 
                their initial year of enrollment in a 
                Medicare+Choice plan.
                    (D) For medicare beneficiaries disenrolling 
                from or switching among Medicare+Choice plans 
                in a given year, the correspondence between the 
                average risk factor calculated from data 
                pertaining to the period prior to their 
                disenrollment from a Medicare+Choice plan and 
                the average risk factor calculated from data 
                pertaining to the period after disenrollment.
                    (E) An evaluation of the exclusion of 
                ``discretionary'' hospitalizations from 
                consideration in the risk adjustment 
                methodology.
                    (F) Suggestions for changes or improvements 
                in the risk adjustment methodology.

    (c) Study and Report Regarding Reporting of Encounter 
Data.--
            (1) Study.--The Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services shall conduct a study on how to reduce the 
        costs and burdens on Medicare+Choice organizations of 
        their complying with reporting requirements for 
        encounter data imposed by the Secretary in establishing 
        and implementing a risk adjustment methodology used in 
        making payments to such organizations under section 
        1853 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23). 
        The Secretary shall consult with representatives of 
        Medicare+Choice organizations in conducting the study. 
        The study shall address the following issues:
                    (A) Limiting the number and types of sites 
                of services (that are in addition to inpatient 
                sites) for which encounter data must be 
                reported.
                    (B) Establishing alternative risk 
                adjustment methods that would require 
                submission of less data.
                    (C) The potential for Medicare+Choice 
                organizations to misreport, overreport, or 
                underreport prevalence of diagnoses in 
                outpatient sites of care, the potential for 
                increases in payments to Medicare+Choice 
                organizations from changes in Medicare+Choice 
                plan coding practices (commonly known as 
                ``coding creep'') and proposed methods for 
                detecting and adjusting for such variations in 
                diagnosis coding as part of the risk adjustment 
                methodology using encounter data from multiple 
                sites of care.
                    (D) The impact of such requirements on the 
                willingness of insurers to offer 
                Medicare+Choice MSA plans and options for 
                modifying encounter data reporting requirements 
                to accommodate such plans.
                    (E) Differences in the ability of 
                Medicare+Choice organizations to report 
                encounter data, and the potential for adverse 
                competitive impacts on group and staff model 
                health maintenance organizations or other 
                integrated providers of care based on data 
                reporting capabilities.
            (2) Report.--Not later than January 1, 2001, the 
        Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on the 
        study conducted under this subsection, together with 
        any recommendations for legislation that the Secretary 
        determines to be appropriate as a result of such study.

                 TITLE I--PROVISIONS RELATING TO PART A

Subtitle A--Adjustments to PPS Payments for Skilled Nursing Facilities 
                                 (SNFs)

 Sec. 101. Temporary Increase in Payment for Certain High Cost Patients

Current law
      The SNF prospective payment system (PPS) includes 44 
hierarchical resource utilization groups (RUGs). The RUGs are 
utilized to formulate the per diem payments to SNFs on behalf 
of Medicare patients. The RUG payments represent the average 
cost for patients in each RUG category. During a phase-in 
starting in 1998, the per diem payment is based partially on 
the facility's specific costs and partially on a federal per 
diem rate.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Increases temporarily the federal per diem payment by 10% 
for 12 RUGs in the ``Extensive Services,'' ``Special Care,'' 
and ``Clinically Complex'' categories. Increased payments would 
be made from April 1, 2000 through September 30, 2000.
S. 1788, as reported
      Increases temporarily the federal per diem payment by 25% 
for ``Extensive Services'' and ``Special Care'' categories and 
adds specified dollar amounts to per diem rates for five RUGs 
for rehabilitation therapies. Increased payments would be made 
from April 1, 2000 through September 30, 2001.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with 
amendments. For SNF services furnished on or after April 1, 
2000, and before the later of October 1, 2000, or 
implementation by the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
(hereafter referred to as ``Secretary'') of a refined RUG 
system, per diem payments are increased by 20% for 15 RUGs 
falling under categories for Extensive Services, Special Care, 
Clinically Complex, High Rehabilitation, and Medium 
Rehabilitation. It is the intent of the parties to the 
agreement that the implementation begin on April 1, 2000, and 
that on this date, each payment shall increase by the required 
amount so that the facilities will receive payment authorized 
on April 1, 2000. In FY 2001 and 2002 the federal per diem 
payment to a facility is increased by 4% in each year, 
calculated exclusive of the 20% RUG rate increase.

   Sec. 102. Authorizing Facilities to Elect Immediate Transition to 
                              Federal Rate

Current law
      Payments to SNFs under the federal per diem RUG system 
are phased in over a period of time. Starting in 1998, a SNF 
receives per diem rates that are a blend of 75% of the 
facility-specific rate and 25% of the federal per diem rate. 
The proportions shift annually by 25 percentage points until 
the federal rate equals the full payment.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Permits SNFs to choose to receive payments based wholly 
on the federal per diem rate if that would be more advantageous 
to the facility; effective for elections made more than 60 days 
after enactment.
S. 1788, as reported
      Permits SNFs to choose to receive payments based wholly 
on the federal per diem rate if that would be more advantageous 
to the facility; effective upon enactment.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
modification. SNFs may elect immediate transition to the 
federal rate on or after December 15, 1999 for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2000. There is no 
election for cost reporting periods beginning before January 1, 
2000. SNFs may elect immediate transition up to 30 days after 
the start of their cost reporting period.

Sec. 103. Part A Pass-Through Payments for Certain Ambulance Services, 
                   Prostheses, and Chemotherapy Drugs

Current law
      SNF PPS payments are inclusive of ancillary services and 
drugs (except for renal dialysis services) needed by patients 
in specified RUGs.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Excludes certain items, starting April 1, 2000, from RUG 
payments. Provides separate payment for ambulance services for 
beneficiaries needing renal dialysis in a facility outside of 
the SNF, specific chemotherapy items and services, radioisotope 
services, and customized prosthetic devices delivered to the 
beneficiary during an inpatient SNF stay. Beginning with FY 
2001, requires Secretary to reduce base RUG rates to account 
for exclusion of these items to ensure budget neutrality.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement include this provision in recognition that 
skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) from time to time experience 
high-cost, low probability events that could have devastating 
financial impacts because their costs far exceed the payment 
they receive under the prospective payment system (PPS). This 
provision is an attempt to exclude from the PPS certain 
services and costly items that are provided infrequently in 
SNFs. For example, in the case of chemotherapy drugs, Health 
Care Financing Administration (HCFA) physicians excluded 
specific chemotherapy drugs from the PPS because these drugs 
are not typically administered in a SNF, or are exceptionally 
expensive, or are given as infusions, thus requiring special 
staff expertise to administer. Some chemotherapy drugs, which 
are relatively inexpensive and are administered routinely in 
SNFs, were excluded from this provision.
      While this provision exempts ambulance services for end-
stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, the parties to the 
agreement note that, in many cases, regularly scheduled trips 
may be made in vehicles that are less costly than an Advanced 
or Basic Life Support ambulance, and the parties to the 
agreement urge that SNFs use these cost-saving services 
appropriately.
      The parties to the agreement recognize that excluding 
services or items from the PPS by specifying codes in 
legislation may not be the most appropriate way to protect SNFs 
from extraordinary events. Additionally, some items may have 
been inadvertently excluded from the list. New, extremely 
costly items may come into use or codes may change over time. 
Therefore, the parties to the agreement expect the Secretary to 
use her authority to review periodically and modify, as needed, 
the list of excluded services and items to reflect changes in 
codes and developments in medical technology. The parties to 
the agreement also request the General Accounting Office (GAO) 
to review the codes of the excluded items and make 
recommendations on whether the criteria for their exclusion are 
appropriate by July 1, 2000.
      Section 1888(e)(5)(A) of the Social Security Act directed 
the Secretary to establish a SNF market basket index (MBI) that 
``reflects the changes over time in the prices of an 
appropriate mix'' of goods and services. The parties to the 
agreement believe that the Secretary should ensure that the 
current SNF MBI, as developed by the Secretary and based on 
Fiscal Year 1992 costs, fulfills this mandate. The parties to 
the agreement recognize that the Secretary revised and rebased 
the 1992 costs when developing the MBI; however, the Secretary 
should ensure that these types of modifications adequately 
reflect the costs of the efficient delivery of medically 
necessary new medications developed since 1992. Innovative 
medical research techniques, combined with significant 
technological advances, have led to the development of numerous 
new medications over the past seven years. The Secretary should 
ensure that these types of changes are represented in the 
current SNF MBI.
      Accordingly, Congress expects the Secretary to: (1) 
evaluate the appropriateness of the SNF MBI with respect to 
medications used in the SNF population based on data from the 
first fiscal year after full implementation of the SNF PPS when 
they become available; (2) consider modification of the current 
SNF MBI as appropriate; and (3) ensure that the MBI continues 
to be responsive to new medications used by the SNF population.

Sec. 104. Provision for Part B Add-ons for Facilities Participating in 
  the Nursing Home Case Mix and Quality (NHCMQ) Demonstration Project

Current law
      SNFs that had participated in the NHCMQ demonstration 
that preceded completion and implementation of the RUG/PPS do 
not have the cost of Part B services to their Medicare patients 
accounted for under the facility-specific component of the PPS 
during the transition period as do other SNFs.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Includes the cost of Part B services in the computation 
of the facility-specific component of the per diem payment 
during the transition to the federal per diem PPS for SNFs that 
had participated in the NHCMQ demonstration, including updates 
of the SNF market basket increase minus 1 percentage point, 
except for an increase in FY 2001 of the SNF market basket plus 
0.8 percentage points. The provision becomes effective 
retroactively to implementation of the Balanced Budget Act of 
1997 (BBA 97).
S. 1788, as reported
      Similar to the House provision, with updates of the 
market basket increase minus 1 percentage point for cost 
reporting periods after 1997 and with allowances for exceptions 
payments.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with a 
modification to keep the FY 2001 update at market basket minus 
1 percentage point.

  Sec. 105. Special Consideration for Facilities Serving Specialized 
                          Patient Populations

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Provides temporarily for special per diem payments to be 
based 50% on the facility-specific rate and 50% on the federal 
rate for hospital-based SNFs: (1) that were certified for 
Medicare before July 1, 1992; (2) in 1998 served patients who 
were immuno-compromised secondary to an infectious disease; and 
(3) for which such patients accounted for more than 60% of the 
facility's total patient days in 1998. The special rates apply 
for the first cost reporting period starting after enactment 
and end on September 30, 2001. Requires the Secretary to assess 
and report within 1 year of enactment on the resource use of 
such patients and recommend whether permanent adjustments 
should be made to the RUGs in which they are classified.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress 
within 1 year of enactment on alternative payment methods for 
SNFs specializing in caring for extremely high cost, 
chronically ill populations.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

  Sec. 106. MedPAC Study on Special Payment for Facilities Located in 
                           Hawaii and Alaska

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 
(MedPAC) to study and report within 18 months of enactment on 
the need for additional payments for SNFs in Alaska and Hawaii.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

Sec. 107. Study and Report Regarding State Licensure and Certification 
       Standards and Respiratory Therapy Competency Examinations

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires the Secretary to report within 1 year of 
enactment on variations in state licensure and certification 
standards for workers providing respiratory therapy in SNFs and 
to make recommendations regarding Medicare requirements for 
licensing or certification.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with 
modification.

                       Subtitle B--PPS Hospitals

  Sec. 111. Modification in Transition for Indirect Medical Education 
                      (IME) Percentage Adjustment

Current law
      Medicare pays teaching hospitals for its share of the 
direct costs of providing graduate medical education, and the 
indirect costs associated with approved graduate medical 
education programs. Prior to BBA 97, Medicare's indirect 
medical education (IME) payments increased 7.7% for each 10% 
increase in a hospital's ratio of interns and residents to 
beds. BBA 97 reduced the IME adjustment to 6.5% in FY 1999; to 
6.0% in FY 2000 and to 5.5% in FY 2001 and subsequent years.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Freezes the IME adjustment at 6.0% for FY 2001 and then 
reduces the adjustment to 5.5% in FY 2002 and subsequent years.
S. 1788, as reported
      Freezes the IME adjustment at 6.5% through FY 2003 and 
then reduces the adjustment to 5.5% in FY 2004 and subsequent 
years.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with 
modifications. The IME adjustment would be frozen at 6.5% 
through FY 2000. The adjustment would be reduced to 6.25% in FY 
2001 and then to 5.5% in FY 2002 and subsequent years.
      The parties to the agreement include in this provision a 
special adjustment to achieve the 6.5 percent IME payment for 
the first six months of FY 2000. Because the PPS rates for FY 
2000 were set prior to enactment and claims have already been 
paid at the IME percentage adjustment of 6.0 percent as 
mandated in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, reverting to the 
6.5 percent IME percentage adjustment provided in this 
legislation would require re-processing of beneficiary claims. 
Due to necessary Year 2000 computer adjustments, the Secretary 
is unable to make payment changes until April 1, 2000, thus 
requiring a special adjustment to accommodate the changes made 
under this section. To prevent reprocessing of over 5 million 
beneficiary claims and reissuing an FY 2000 PPS payment rule, 
the payment difference between a 6.0 and a 6.5 IME percentage 
adjustment will be accomplished through an aggregate adjustment 
to teaching hospital payments.

Sec. 112. Decrease in Reductions for Disproportionate Share Hospitals; 
                      Data Collection Requirements

Current law
      Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that 
serve a disproportionate share of low-income Medicare and 
Medicaid patients. BBA 97 reduced the disproportionate share 
hospital (DSH) payment formula by 1% in FY 1998; 2% in FY 1999; 
3% in FY 2000; 4% in FY 2001; 5% in FY 2002 and 0% in FY 2003 
and in each subsequent year.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Freezes the reduction in the DSH payment formula to 3% in 
FY 2001. Changes the reduction to 4% in FY 2002.
      Requires the Secretary to collect hospital cost data on 
uncompensated inpatient and outpatient care, including non-
Medicare bad debt and charity care as well as Medicaid and 
indigent care charges. Requires the submission of the data in 
cost reports for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
the enactment date.
S. 1788, as reported
      Freezes the reduction in the DSH payment formula to 3% in 
FY 2001.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
modification by requiring the Secretary to have hospitals 
submit the data requested in cost reports for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001.
      This provision eases the financial burden of hospitals 
caring for a disproportionate share of low-income individuals. 
In addition, the Secretary is required to collect additional 
data necessary to develop a DSH payment methodology that takes 
into account the cost of serving uninsured and underinsured 
patients, as recommended by MedPAC. Presently, the DSH formula 
is based only on the costs associated with Medicaid patients 
and Medicare patients eligible for Supplementary Security 
Income (SSI). MedPAC has recommended that the formula be 
amended to include inpatient and outpatient costs associated 
with services provided to low-incomepatients, defined broadly 
to include all care to the poor.
      In order to develop such a revised formula, it is 
necessary first to collect additional data. MedPAC recommends 
that data be collected on patients enrolled in state and local 
indigent care programs, as well as uncompensated care 
associated with uninsured or underinsured patients. State and 
local indigent care programs would include non-federally 
financed programs with specific eligibility criteria for 
specified health care services. Financial data on state and 
local appropriations that offset uncompensated care expenses 
should also be collected. Uncompensated care costs and charges 
are those identified more typically as bad debt and charity 
care. While the parties to the agreement recognize that there 
may be problems in defining and appropriately measuring such 
costs and charges in a way that avoids duplication, such 
problems can best be overcome by developing standard 
definitions at the national level. The parties to the agreement 
expect the Secretary to report on the financial interactions 
and potential for shifts between Federal and State governments.

                    Subtitle C--PPS-Exempt Hospitals

  Sec. 121. Wage Adjustment of Percentile Cap for PPS-Exempt Hospitals

Current law
      BBA 97 established a national cap on the Tax Equity and 
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) limits for PPS-exempt 
hospitals at 75% of the target amount for that class of 
hospital.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Adjusts the labor-related portion of the 75% cap to 
reflect differences between the wage-related costs in the area 
of the hospital and the national average of such costs within 
the same class of hospitals beginning for cost reporting 
periods on or after October 1, 1999.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

    Sec. 122. Enhanced Payments for Long-Term Care and Psychiatric 
 Hospitals Until Development of Prospective Payment Systems (PPS) for 
                            those Hospitals

Current law
      BBA 97 established the amount of bonus and relief 
payments for eligible PPS-exempt providers.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Increases the amount of continuous bonus payments to the 
eligible long-term care and psychiatric providers from 1% to 
1.5% for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 
1, 2000 and before September 30, 2001 and 2% for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001 and before 
September 30, 2002.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

Sec. 123. Per Discharge Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Long-Term 
                             Care Hospitals

Current law
      BBA 97 requires the Secretary to develop a legislative 
proposal for a PPS for long-term care hospitals that includes 
an adequate patient classification system by October 1, 1999.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate 
Congressional committees by October 1, 2001 on a discharge-
based PPS with an adequate patient classification system for 
long-term care hospitals which would be implemented in a 
budget-neutral fashion for cost reporting periods beginning on 
or after October 1, 2002. The Secretary may require such long-
term care hospitals to submit information to develop the 
payment system.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. In developing 
and evaluating the new PPS system, the parties to the agreement 
encourage the Secretary to measure the quality of outcomes.

  Sec. 124. Per Diem Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Psychiatric 
                               Hospitals

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate 
Congressional committees by October 1, 2001 on a per diem-based 
PPS with an adequate patient classification system for 
psychiatric hospitals and distinct-part units which would be 
implemented in a budget-neutral fashion for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002. The Secretary 
may require such psychiatric hospitals and units to submit 
information to develop the system.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires the Secretary to report to Congress within 2 
years of enactment on a PPS for psychiatric hospitals and 
units. The study should take into account the unique 
circumstances of psychiatric hospitals in rural areas.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement are aware that changes to payments for 
psychiatric units and hospitals contained in this bill could 
affect the provision of mental health services in rural areas. 
Accordingly, the parties to the agreement request that MedPAC 
evaluate the impact of these changes and make recommendations 
if further modifications are needed to maintain the 
availability of rural hospitals to provide critical behavioral 
health services.

Sec. 125. Refinement of Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Inpatient 
                        Rehabilitation Hospitals

Current law
      BBA 97 requires the Secretary to establish a case-mix 
adjusted prospective payment system (PPS) for rehabilitation 
hospitals and distinct-part units, effective beginning in FY 
2001. PPS rates are to be phased-in between October 1, 2000 and 
before October 1, 2002 with an increasing percentage of the 
hospitals' payment based on the PPS amount. For FY 2001 and FY 
2002, the Secretary is required to establish prospective 
payment amounts so that total payments for rehabilitation 
hospitals equal 98% of the amount that would have been paid if 
the PPS had not been enacted. The inpatient rehabilitation 
hospital/distinct-part unit PPS will be fully implemented by 
October 1, 2002.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Changes the phase-in requirements to permit 
rehabilitation facilities to elect to have their payment based 
entirely on the PPS amount in FY 2001 and FY 2002. Changes the 
budget neutrality requirement for FY 2001 and FY 2002 to 
account for the facilities that have elected to be fully 
reimbursed on the PPS amount during the transition period. 
Requires the Secretary, after obtaining substantially complete 
FY 2001 data, to analyze the extent to which changes in case-
mix (or changes in the severity of illnesses) are attributable 
to changes in medical record coding and patient classification 
and do not reflect real changes in case-mix. Based on the 
analysis of the case-mix change attributable to coding and 
classification change, the Secretary shall adjust FY 2004 PPS 
rates by 150% of the estimate of the PPS percentage adjustment 
that would have achieved budget neutrality in FY 2001 if it had 
applied to setting the rates for that fiscal year. If this FY 
2004 adjustment resulted in a percentage decrease in the rates, 
the Secretary shall increase the FY 2005 PPS rates by a 
percentage equal to \1/3\ of such percentage decrease. If this 
FY 2004 adjustment resulted in a percentage increase in the 
rates, the Secretary shall decrease the FY 2005 PPS rates by a 
percentage equal to 1/3 of such percentage increase.
      Requires the Secretary to base PPS on discharges. 
Requires the Secretary to establish classes of patient 
discharges of rehabilitation facilities by functional-related 
groups, based on impairment, age, comorbidities, and functional 
capability of the patient and such other factors as the 
Secretary deems appropriate to improve the explanatory power of 
Functional Independence Measure-Function Related Groups 
(FIMFRGs). Clarifies that the Secretary may adjust payments to 
account for the early transfer of a patient from a 
rehabilitation facility to another site of care. Requires the 
Secretary to submit a study to Congress not later than 3 years 
after the implementation of the PPS of its impact on 
utilization and access.
S. 1788, as reported
      Bases the PPS on discharges classified according to 
functional-related groups based on impairment, age, 
comorbidities, and functional capability of the patient as well 
as other factors deemed appropriate to improve the explanatory 
power of FIMFRGs. Requires the Secretary to submit a study to 
Congress, not later than 2 years after implementation of PPS, 
of its impact on service utilization, beneficiary access, non-
therapy ancillary services and other factors that the Secretary 
determines to be appropriate. The study should include 
legislative recommendations on payment adjustments as 
appropriate.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
amendments.

                        Subtitle D--Hospice Care

        Sec. 131. Temporary Increase in Payment for Hospice Care

Current law
      Hospice payments are based on one of four prospectively 
determined daily rates which correspond to levels of care. 
Before BBA 97, the rates were updated annually by the hospital 
market basket; BBA 97 reduced the updates to market basket 
minus 1 percentage point for FY 1999 through FY 2002 and 
required the Secretary to collect hospice cost data.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Changes the hospice update to market basket minus 0.5 
percentage point through FY 2002.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with an 
amendment. For each of fiscal years 2001 and 2002, hospice 
payment rates (otherwise in effect for those years) are 
increased by 0.5 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively. The 
Secretary is prohibited from including these additional 
payments in the updates of payment rates after FY 2002.

 Sec. 132. Study and Report to Congress Regarding Modification of the 
                     Payment Rates for Hospice Care

Current law
      The Secretary is required to collect data from hospices 
on the costs of care provided for each fiscal year beginning 
with FY 1999.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires the GAO to conduct a study on the feasibility 
and advisability of updating the hospice rates and certain 
capped payment amounts, including an evaluation of whether the 
cost factors used to determine the rates should be modified, 
eliminated, or supplemented with additional cost factors. The 
report and recommendation are to be submitted to Congress 
within 1 year of enactment.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

                      Subtitle E--Other Provisions

  Sec. 141. MedPAC Study on Medicare Payment for Non-Physician Health 
              Professional Clinical Training in Hospitals

Current law
      BBA 97 required that, not later than 2 years after 
enactment, MedPAC submit to Congress a study of Medicare's 
graduate medical education payment policy and reimbursement 
methodologies including whether and to what extent payments are 
being made (or should be made) for training in nursing and 
other allied health professions.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires MedPAC, within 18 months of enactment, to submit 
to Congress a study of Medicare payment policy with respect to 
professional clinical training of different types of non-
physician health care professionals (such as nurses, nurse 
practitioners, allied health professionals, physician 
assistants, and psychologists).
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement recognize that MedPAC has considered non-
physician clinical training in its report to the Congress on 
long-term policies for graduate medical education. However, the 
parties to the agreement require additional explicit 
information on Medicare's role in financing clinical training 
for non-physician health professionals. A continuation of the 
existing effort, combined with quantitative analysis, will 
provide the Congress with all aspects of Medicare's support for 
health professional training, including possible methodologies 
for making payments and the entities that should receive them.
      The parties to the agreement are pleased that the 
Secretary, consistent with language included in the Conference 
Report (Report 105-217) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, is 
considering a proposal to initiate graduate medical education 
payments to institutions involved in the training of clinical 
psychologists. The parties to the agreement urge the Secretary 
to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to accomplish this 
modification before June 1, 2000.

                  Subtitle F--Transitional Provisions

           Sec. 151. Exception to CMI Qualifier for One Year

Current law
      The Secretary is authorized to allow for exceptions and 
adjustments to the amount paid under PPS for hospitals that act 
as regional or national referral centers for patients 
transferred from other hospitals. Generally, a referral center 
is located in a rural area, has at least 275 ormore beds, can 
show that at least 50% of its Medicare patients are referred from other 
hospitals, and that at least 60% of its Medicare patients live more 
than 25 miles from the hospital or that 60% of all the services that 
the hospital furnishes to Medicare beneficiaries are furnished to those 
that live more than 25 miles from the hospital.
      Alternatively, a hospital may meet certain other 
specified criteria including (1) a case-mix index above the 
national average or above the median case-mix value for urban 
hospitals located in that region; (2) a number of discharges 
greater than 5,000 or, if less, above the median number of 
discharges for urban hospitals in the region; (3) more than 50% 
of the hospital's active medical staff are specialists; (4) at 
least 60% of all its discharges are for patients who live more 
than 25 miles from the hospital; or (5) at least 40% of all 
patients treated at the hospital are referred from other 
hospitals or by physicians not on the hospital's staff. These 
referral centers receive preferential treatment in the Medicare 
inpatient PPS for the disproportionate share hospital payment 
adjustment and when considered for geographic reclassification.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Deems that Northwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center 
meets the case-mix index criterion for classification as a 
referral center for FY 2000.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

 Sec. 152. Reclassification of Certain Counties and Areas for Purposes 
              of Reimbursement Under the Medicare Program

Current law
      Medicare's inpatient hospital PPS payments vary by urban/
rural classification and the geographic area where a hospital 
is located or to which a hospital is assigned.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Deems that: Iredell County, NC is to be considered part 
of the Charlotte-Gastonia Rock Hill NC-SC Metropolitan 
Statistical Area (MSA); and Orange County, NY is to be 
considered part of the large urban area of New York, NY for 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1999.
Agreement
      The agreement contains the Senate provision with 
modifications. For purposes of Medicare reimbursement, Lake 
County, Indiana and Lee County, Illinois are deemed to be 
considered part of the Chicago, Illinois MSA; Hamilton-
Middletown, Ohio is deemed to be considered part of the 
Cincinnati, Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana MSA; Brazoria County, Texas 
is deemed to be considered part of the Houston, Texas MSA; and 
Chittenden County, Vermont is deemed to be considered part of 
the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence-Lowell-Brockton, Massachusetts-
New Hampshire MSA. These counties would be reclassified for the 
purposes of the Medicare inpatient PPS in FY 2000 and FY 2001.

                    Sec. 153. Wage Index Correction

Current law
      Medicare's inpatient hospital PPS payments are adjusted 
to reflect the wage level in the geographic area where a 
hospital is located or to which a hospital is assigned. 
Hospitals can only submit and correct wage data during 
specified times. All payment changes that result from changes 
to the wage data are implemented in a budget-neutral fashion.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires the Secretary to recalculate and apply the 
Hattiesburg, MS MSA wage index for FY 2000 using FY 1996 wage 
and hour data for Wesley Medical Center. The Secretary is 
instructed to adjust PPS to take into account the corrected 
wage index.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with 
modifications. The wage index recalculation would not affect 
the wage indices for any other areas.

Sec. 154. Calculation and Application of Wage Index Floor for a Certain 
                                  Area

Current law
      Medicare's inpatient hospital PPS payments are adjusted 
to reflect the wage level in the geographic area where a 
hospital is located or to which a hospital is assigned. 
Hospitals can only submit and correct wage data during 
specified times. All payment changes that result from changes 
to the wage data are implemented in a budget-neutral fashion.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement would require the Secretary to calculate 
and apply the wage index for the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton MSA 
for FY 2000 as if Lehigh Valley Hospital were classified in 
such area. Such recalculation would not affect the wage index 
for any other area. For FY 2001, Lehigh Valley Hospital would 
be treated as being classified to the Allentown-Bethlehem-
Easton MSA.

     Sec. 155. Special Rule for Certain Skilled Nursing Facilities

Current law
      The SNF prospective payment system pays SNFs a per diem 
amount for all covered services provided to Medicare 
beneficiaries. During a transition period lasting through the 
three cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 
1998, a portion of the per diem payment to a SNF will be based 
on a facility-specific rate, and the remaining portion on a 
federal rate. By the end of the transition, 100% of the per 
diem payment will be based on the federal rate. Federal and 
facility-specific payments are based on updated 1995 cost 
reports.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes provisions to require the 
Secretary to establish for each cost reporting period beginning 
in FY 2000 and in FY 2001, special per diem payments for SNFs: 
(1) that began participation in the Medicare program before 
January 1, 1995; (2) for which at least 80 percent of total 
inpatient days of the facility in the cost reporting beginning 
in 1998 were comprised of persons entitled to Medicare; and (3) 
that are located in Baldwin or Mobile County, Alabama. The 
payment amount would be equal to 100 percent of the facility-
specific rate, which would be based on allowable costs for the 
cost reporting period beginning in FY 1998.

                TITLE II--PROVISIONS RELATING TO PART B

  Sec. 201. Outlier Adjustment; Transitional Pass-through for Certain 
                  Medical Devices, Drugs, Biologicals

Current law
      Under the hospital outpatient PPS, payments will be 
uniform for all patients undergoing a certain procedure in 
certain hospitals. Currently, beneficiaries pay 20% of charges 
for outpatient services. Under the outpatient PPS, beneficiary 
copayments will be limited to frozen dollar amounts based on 
20% of the national median of charges for services in 1996, 
updated to the year of implementation of the PPS.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      For certain high cost (or ``outlier'') patients, permits 
the Secretary to determine and provide additional payments to 
hospitals for each covered service for which the hospital's 
costs exceed a fixed multiple of the PPS amount, including any 
``transitional pass-through'' payments and including other 
adjustments. The pool of funds for such outlier payments may 
not exceed 2.5% of total program costs in years before 2004 and 
3.0% thereafter, but must be budget-neutral.
      Allows for 2 to 3 years of payments to be made in 
addition to PPS payments (``transitional pass through'' 
payments) for innovative medical devices, drugs, and 
biologicals, including orphan drugs, cancer therapy drugs and 
biologicals, and certain ``new'' medical devices, drugs, and 
biologicals. The pool of funds for such items would be 2.5% for 
years up to 2004 and 2% thereafter, but must be budget-neutral.
      For the outpatient PPS, defines covered outpatient 
services to include implantable medical devices; gives the 
Secretary the option of basing the system's relative payment 
weights on the mean or the median of hospital costs.
      Limits cost range of services and items (except for 
orphan drugs) comprising a cost group on which a prospective 
payment is based. Provides that beneficiary copayments will not 
reflect Medicare payments to hospitals for outlier costs or 
transitional pass through payments for certain drugs, 
biologicals, and devices.
S. 1788, as reported
      Similar to House provision with additional transitional 
pass-through payments forradiopharmaceuticals.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
amendments: the agreement includes a transitional pass-through 
of costs of radiopharmaceuticals. In addition, the agreement 
allows the Secretary to apply outlier payments for covered 
outpatient services furnished before January 1, 2002, for 
individual outpatient encounters, using an appropriate cost-to-
charge ratio for the hospital rather than for the specific 
departments within the hospital.
      It is the intent of the conferees that the phase-down in 
beneficiary coinsurance for hospital outpatient services 
enacted by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 not be delayed 
further by any changes to the hospital outpatient prospective 
payment system included in this bill. The BBA 97 provision was 
intended to fix an anomaly in the law that resulted in Medicare 
beneficiaries paying more than 20 percent in coinsurance for 
hospital outpatient services. There has already been a one-year 
delay in the implementation of the BBA 97 provision. The 
conferees fully expect that the beneficiary coinsurance phase-
down will commence, as scheduled, on July 1, 2000, and that 
beneficiary coinsurance for outpatient department (OPD) 
services will be frozen until it equals 20 percent of the 
Medicare OPD fee schedule amount, which should be determined 
without regard to any outlier adjustments, adjustments that 
limit payment declines, or transitional add-on payments.
      The parties to the agreement believe that HCFA's plans 
for implementing the outpatient prospective payment system 
(PPS), as described in HCFA's September 7, 1998 proposed 
regulation, raise many concerns. The proposal: (1) fails to 
provide adjustments for high cost care; (2) does not adequately 
provide a transition to include medical devices, drugs and 
biologicals in the system, and; (3) will not be updated 
annually to keep pace with changes in technology and medical 
practice. The Committee is making several structural changes to 
improve the design of the outpatient PPS and to assure that 
patients are not denied access to needed care.
      In the proposed regulation, HCFA classified many 
different services with varying costs into a single payment 
group. In one example, brachytherapy has been placed in a group 
with other procedures that are much less costly. This could 
provide disincentives to use this technology. The Committee 
believes that while some level of variation is unavoidable, 
there should not be wide variation that could potentially 
restrict access to the most costly services. To address this 
problem, this agreement would place an upper limit on the 
variation of costs among services included in the same group. 
The most costly item or service in a group could not have a 
mean or median cost that was more than twice the mean or median 
cost of the least costly item or service in the group. To 
provide additional flexibility, the parties to the agreement 
give the Secretary the option to base the relative payment 
weights on either the mean or median cost of the items and 
services in a group. Further, in classifying drugs and 
biologicals into payment categories, the parties to the 
agreement expect that consideration will be given to products 
that are therapeutically equivalent.
      The parties to the agreement recognize that there may be 
unusual cases, such as low volume items and services, and the 
Secretary is given discretion to exempt these exceptional cases 
from the limitation. The parties expect that the Secretary 
would not use this exception to include orphan drugs in a group 
that contains very different resources.
      In the proposed regulation, HCFA stated its intention not 
to update the payment groups and rates annually. This is 
different from the agency's process of annually updating the 
inpatient prospective payment system. Given the rapid pace of 
technological change as well as changes in medical practice, 
the parties to the agreement require the Secretary to review 
the outpatient payment groups and amounts annually and to 
update them as necessary.
      BBA 97 gave the Secretary the discretion to make 
additional payments (called outlier payments) to hospitals for 
particularly costly cases. The parties to the agreement require 
the Secretary to make outlier payments in a budget neutral 
manner and in a similar way as is currently done in the 
inpatient PPS. The outlier pool would be established at any 
level up to 2.5 percent of total payments for the first three 
years under the new system. After the third year, the pool 
could be set at any level up to 3 percent of total payments.
      While the statutory provisions for the inpatient PPS 
require an outlier pool equal to a level between 5 and 6 
percent of total inpatient PPS payments, the Committee believes 
that the lower levels of 2.5 and 3.0 percent are more 
appropriate for the outpatient PPS because the outpatient PPS 
will make separate payments for most individual services 
performed during an outpatient encounter. The allowed upper 
limit on the size of the pool is increased after the third year 
because the need for outlier payments may increase after the 
temporary add-on payments for drugs and biologicals, described 
below, are replaced with a transitional provision that applies 
only to new products.
      The parties to the agreement are concerned that HCFA's 
proposed payment system does not adequately address issues 
pertaining to the treatment of drugs, biologicals and new 
technology. The parties believe that these oversights could 
lead to restricted beneficiary access to drugs, biologicals and 
new technology. The provisions would establish transitional 
payments to cover the added costs of certain services involving 
the use of medical devices, drugs and biologicals. Hospitals 
using these drugs, biologicals and devices would be eligible 
for additional payments.
      The duration of the transitional payment would be for a 
period of at least two years but not more than three years. For 
drugs, biologicals, and brachytherapy used in cancer therapy 
and orphan drugs, the period would begin with the 
implementation date of the outpatient PPS. This also would be 
the period applicable to medical devices first paid as an 
outpatient hospital service after 1996 but before 
implementation of the outpatient PPS (as well as for any other 
item or service eligible for the additional payments at the 
inception of the outpatient PPS because of insufficient data or 
use of the Secretary's discretion). For products first paid as 
an outpatient service after implementation of the outpatient 
PPS, the transitional payment would begin with the first date 
on which payment is made for the device, drug or biological as 
an outpatient hospital service and continue for at least two, 
but not more than three, years.
      The parties to the agreement expect the Secretary to 
develop a process to address new devices, drugs and biologicals 
introduced after the outpatient fee schedule for a particular 
year has been set. This process should include assigning an 
appropriate code (or codes) to the product and establishing the 
amount of the add-on payment. New codes and add-on payment 
amounts should be made effective quarterly.
      The amount of the additional payment to hospitals, before 
applying the limitation described below, should equal the 
amount specified for the new technology less the average cost 
included in the outpatient payment schedule for the existing 
technology. Specifically, for drugs and biologicals, the amount 
of the additional payment is the amount by which 95 percent of 
the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) exceeds the portion of the 
applicable outpatient fee schedule amount that the Secretary 
determines is associated with the drug or biological. 
Similarly, for new medical devices, the add-on payment is the 
amount by which the hospital's charges for the device, adjusted 
to cost, exceed the outpatient fee schedule amount associated 
with the device.
      The total amount of additional pass-through payments in a 
year should not exceed a prescribed percentage of total 
projected payments under the outpatient prospective payment 
system. The applicable percentages are: (1) 2.5 percent for the 
first three years after implementation of the new outpatient 
payment system; and (2) up to 2.0 percent in subsequent years. 
In setting the hospital outpatient department (OPD) rates and 
add-on amounts for a particular year, the Secretary will 
estimate the total amount of additional payments that would be 
made based on the add-on amounts specified above and the 
expected utilization for each service. If the estimated total 
amount exceeds the percentage limitation, the Secretary will 
apply a pro rata reduction to the add-on payment amounts so 
that projected total payments are within the limitation.
      The parties to the agreement believe that the current 
DMEPOS fee schedule is not appropriate for certain implantable 
items, since their use in the hospital setting involves the 
provision of services by the hospital. It is the parties' 
intent that payment for implantable medical items (for example, 
pacemakers, defibrillators, cardiac sensors, venous grafts, 
drug pumps, stents, neurostimulators, and orthopedic implants), 
as well as for items that come into contact with internal human 
tissue during invasive medical procedures (but are not 
permanently implanted), will be made through the outpatient PPS 
system--regardless of how these products might be classified on 
current HCFA fee schedules.
      The parties to the agreement understand that the 
Secretary is committed to creating separate payment categories 
for blood, blood products, and plasma-based and recombinant 
therapies. The parties to the agreement continue to be 
concerned that the inadequate payment for these products and 
therapies could represent a barrier to patient access. 
Accordingly, the parties to the agreement expect the Secretary 
to carefully analyze potential patient access issues and create 
sufficient payment categories to adequately differentiate these 
products.
      The agreement also requires the Secretary to conduct a 
study of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) services in 
settings other than hospital outpatient departments and 
physicians' offices to be completed within 1 year of enactment. 
In addition, the agreement requires the Secretary to make 
recommendations on the appropriate manner and settings under 
which Medicare should pay for these services in such settings.
      The parties to the agreement encourage the Secretary to 
examine Medicare policies regarding outpatient rehabilitation 
services (including cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation 
services) in hospital outpatient departments and other 
ambulatory settings in light of advances in medical technology.

 Sec. 202. Establishing a Transitional Corridor for Application of OPD 
                                  PPS

Current law
      The hospital outpatient PPS is to be implemented in full 
and simultaneously for all services and hospitals (estimated 
for July 2000).
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Provides payments in addition to PPS payments to a 
hospital during the first 3 years of the PPS if its PPS 
payments are less than the payments that would have been made 
prior to the PPS. During the first year, a hospital would 
receive an additional amount equal to 80% of the first 10% of 
the difference between its payments under the prior system and 
under the PPS, 70% of the next 10% of reduced payments, and 60% 
of the next 10%. If PPS payments are less than 70% of prior 
levels, the additional sum is 21% of the pre-BBA amount. During 
the second year, the payments as a proportion of reduced 
payments would change to 70% of the first 10% and 60% of the 
second 10%. If PPS payments are less than 80% of prior amounts 
the additional sum is 13% of the pre-BBA amount. In the third 
year, the payment would be 60% of the first 10% of reduced 
payments, and if the PPS payments are less than 90% of the 
prior amounts, the additional payment is 6% of the pre-BBA 
amount. These additional payments would be made through 2003.
      Until January 1, 2004, for rural hospitals with fewer 
than 100 beds, provides special payments to bring payments to 
hospital outpatient departments up to their pre-PPS amounts if 
their PPS payments are less than under the prior system. Waives 
budget neutrality for these payments; applies BBA 97 
beneficiary copayment rules. Requires the Secretary to report 
by July 1, 2002, on whether the outpatient PPS should apply to 
Medicare dependent small rural hospitals; sole community 
hospitals; rural health clinics; rural referral centers; rural 
hospitals with 100 or fewer beds; other rural hospitals as 
determined by the Secretary.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires the Secretary to increase payments under the 
hospital outpatient PPS in amounts such that the ratio of 
Medicare payments (after correction for the formula-driven 
overpayment) plus beneficiary copayments to hospital costs 
would be no less than 90%, 85%, and 80% of the ratio of the 
hospital's 1996 payments-to-costs in the first, second, and 
third years of the new system, respectively. Authorizes the 
Secretary to make interim payments to hospitals during these3 
years and to make subsequent retroactive adjustments. The budget 
neutrality requirement of the PPS is waived. For each year beginning in 
2000, the Secretary is authorized to increase permanently PPS payments 
to Medicare dependent small rural hospitals, sole community hospitals, 
and cancer hospitals to amounts such that the ratio of Medicare 
payments plus beneficiary copayments to a hospital's costs would be not 
less than that ratio in 1996. Beneficiary copayment reductions in BBA 
97 would be protected for care in these facilities. The BBA 97 budget 
neutrality requirements would be waived for these payments.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House and Senate provisions 
with amendments. The agreement includes the House corridor 
amounts and a temporary hold harmless provision for small rural 
hospitals with modifications. It also includes the Senate's 
permanent hold harmless provision for cancer hospitals under 
the PPS. For services furnished before January 1, 2004, by 
rural hospitals with not more than 100 beds, Medicare payments 
will equal 100% of the hospitals' pre-BBA outpatient payment 
amounts if their PPS amount is less than the pre-BBA amount. On 
a permanent basis, Medicare payments to cancer hospitals will 
equal 100% of their pre-BBA amount if their PPS amount is less 
than their pre-BBA amount. Pre-BBA amount is defined as the 
amount equal to the product of the reasonable cost of the 
hospital for such services for the portions of the hospital's 
cost reporting period (or periods) occurring in the year and 
the base OPD payment-to-cost ratio for the hospital, excluding 
formula-driven overpayments.

Sec. 203. Study and Report to Congress Regarding the Special Treatment 
 of Rural and Cancer Hospitals in Prospective Payment System (PPS) for 
                Hospital Outpatient Department Services

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretary to submit a report and 
recommendations to Congress by July 1, 2002 on whether a 
hospital outpatient prospective payment system (PPS) should 
continue to apply to Medicare Dependent Hospitals, Sole 
Community Hospitals, rural health clinics, rural referral 
centers, and other rural hospitals.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires MedPAC to prepare a report to the Secretary of 
HHS and the Congress within 2 years of enactment regarding the 
feasibility and advisability of including cancer hospitals and 
rural hospitals in the outpatient PPS. After submission of the 
report, the Secretary shall submit comments on the report 
within 60 days.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with 
modifications.

Sec 204. Limitation on Outpatient Hospital Copayment for a Procedure to 
                     the Hospital Deductible Amount

Current law
      When the hospital outpatient PPS is implemented, BBA 97 
freezes beneficiary copayments at the dollar amount that is 
equal to 20% of national median changes for a procedure in 1996 
updated to 1999 (or the year of implementation of the PPS).
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Caps beneficiary copayments under the PPS for care and 
services in hospital outpatient departments to the dollar 
amount of the deductible for an inpatient hospital stay under 
Part A. Provides Medicare payments to make up the difference 
between the frozen copayment amount and the new limit. 
Effective retroactively to enactment of the BBA 97.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

                     Subtitle B--Physician Services

Sec. 211. Modification of Update Adjustment Factor Provisions to Reduce 
           Update Oscillations and Require Estimate Revisions

Current law
      Payments to physicians are made on the basis of a fee 
schedule which assigns a relative value unit to each service. 
The conversion factor is a dollar figure that converts the 
geographically adjusted relative value into a dollar payment 
amount. This amount is updated each year. Beginning in 1999, 
the update percentage equals the Medicare Economic Index (MEI), 
subject to an adjustment to match actual spending to target 
spending for physicians services under the sustainable growth 
rate (SGR) system.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Makes technical changes to limit oscillations in the 
annual update to the conversion factor beginning in 2001 by: 
(a) requiring that future update adjustment factors be 
calculated usingdata measured on a calendar year basis; (b) 
modifying the formula for determining the update by adding a new 
component to the formula to measure past year variances from allowed 
spending growth; and (c) mitigating the year-to-year impact of these 
measures on the update by the addition of dampening multipliers. 
Provides for a budget-neutral transition to the revised system. 
Provides that the SGR is to be calculated on a calendar basis. Requires 
that an estimate of the conversion factor and SGR be made available to 
MedPAC and the public by March 1 of each year, MedPAC comments in its 
annual report, and final publication November 1. Requires the Secretary 
to use the best available data to revise prior SGR estimates for up to 
2 years after the estimate is first published. Provides that provision 
would not apply to or affect any update for any year before 2001.
S. 1788, as reported
      Nearly identical provision. In addition, requires the 
Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Agency for 
Health Care Policy and Research, to conduct a study on the 
utilization of physicians services under the fee-for-service 
program.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with Senate 
amendment to include the AHCPR study. With regard to physician 
supervision of anesthesia services under Medicare's Conditions 
of Participation, if the Secretary determines that there is 
insufficient current scientific data comparing mortality and 
adverse outcome rates in the provision of anesthesia services 
to Medicare patients, the Secretary should conduct a 
comparative outcome study and report back to the parties to the 
agreement. If the Secretary believes that she has sufficient 
mortality and quality information regarding the provision of 
anesthesia services by nurse anesthetists and 
anesthesiologists, then she could make the appropriate 
regulatory changes to ensure access to quality care for 
Medicare beneficiaries.

   Sec. 212. Use of Data Collected by Organizations and Entities in 
              Determining Practice Expense Relative Values

Current law
      The Social Security Act Amendments of 1994 (P.L. 103-432) 
required the Secretary to develop a methodology for a resource-
based system for calculating practice expenses which would be 
implemented in calendar year 1998. BBA 97 delayed 
implementation of a resource-based practice expense methodology 
for a year, until 1999. BBA 97 also reduced certain practice 
expense relative value units in 1998. The new resource-based 
system is being phased-in beginning in calendar year 1999; 1998 
is used as the base year for the calculation. Beginning in 
2002, the values will be totally resource-based.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretary to establish by regulation a 
process (including data collection standards) under which the 
Secretary would accept for use and would use, to the maximum 
extent practicable and consistent with sound data practices, 
data collected by organizations and entities other than HHS. 
Requires a report to the Secretary on the process and the 
extent to which such data has been used.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement direct the Secretary to give fair 
consideration to data submitted by external entities. The 
parties to the agreement are particularly concerned about the 
instances when HCFA may not have adequate data for rate 
setting.

Sec. 213. GAO Study on Resources Required to Provide Safe and Effective 
                       Outpatient Cancer Therapy

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires a study and report to Congress on resources 
required to provide safe and effective outpatient cancer 
therapy and the appropriate payment rates for such services.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement direct the Comptroller General to determine 
the adequacy of practice expenses associated with the 
utilization of outpatient cancer clinical resources, examine 
the current level of work values in the practice expense 
formula, and assess various standards to assure the provision 
of safe outpatient cancer therapy services. The parties to the 
agreement also direct the Comptroller General to submit to 
Congress a report on this study. As part of the study, the 
Comptroller General is directed to make recommendations 
regarding adjustments to practice expense values in effect 
under Part B of the Medicare program and the impact on program 
costs. In addition, the parties to the agreement encourage the 
Comptroller General to examine the variation in Medicare 
payments for these services in hospital and non-hospital 
settings.

                       Subtitle C--Other Services

     Sec. 221. Revision of Provisions Relating to Therapy Services

Current law
      BBA 97 set annual payment limits for all outpatient 
therapy services provided by non-hospital providers. There are 
two per beneficiary limits. The first is a $1,500 per 
beneficiary annual cap for all outpatient physical therapy 
services and speech language pathology services. The second is 
a $1,500 per beneficiary annual cap for all outpatient 
occupational therapy services. The Secretary is required to 
report to Congress by Jan. 1, 2001 on recommendations for 
establishing a revised payment policy based on diagnostic 
groups.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Creates separate $1,500 caps for physical therapy and 
speech-language pathology services which would be applied to 
services furnished on a per beneficiary, per facility (or 
provider) basis beginning in 2000. The cap on occupational 
therapy services would also be applied on a per beneficiary, 
per facility (or provider) basis. Directs the Secretary to 
establish a process so that a facility or provider may apply 
for an increase in the limitation for a beneficiary for 
services furnished in 2000 or 2001; limits additional payments 
to $40 million in FY2000, $60 million in FY2001, and $20 
million in FY2002.
      In addition, H.R. 3075 specifies that an optometrist may 
meet the physician supervision requirement for outpatient 
physical therapy services. Current law limits outpatient 
occupational therapy services to services furnished to 
individuals who are under the care of a medical doctor, doctor 
of osteopathy, or podiatrist. Persons suffering from low vision 
(visual impairments not correctable using conventional eyewear) 
may be under the care of either a medical doctor, doctor of 
osteopathy, or optometrist. The provision would clarify that 
rehabilitation services for these individuals may be covered 
when the patient is under the care of, and the treatment plan 
has been ordered by, either a medical doctor, doctor of 
osteopathy, or optometrist.
S. 1788, as reported
      Provides that the cap would not apply in 2000 and 2001. 
Modifies current report to Congress to include recommendation 
for assuring appropriate utilization and incorporation of 
functional status in recommended payment modifications. 
Requires Secretary to study utilization patterns in 2000 
compared to those in 1998 and 1999.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with a 
modification requiring the Secretary to conduct focused medical 
reviews of therapy services during 2000 and 2001, with emphasis 
on claims for services provided to residents of SNFs.
      The agreement also includes the House provision regarding 
optometrists and the supervision of outpatient physical therapy 
services. The parties to the agreement note that the extent to 
which these rehabilitation services are covered is a coverage 
decision made by carriers and the Health Care Financing 
Administration. Based on an agreement between organizations 
representing ophthalmology and optometry on appropriate low 
vision rehabilitation services, the parties to the agreement 
expect that referral for low vision rehabilitation services by 
optometrists would be limited to three codes--97530, 97535, and 
97537.

           Sec. 222. Update in Renal Dialysis Composite Rate

Current law
      Dialysis facilities providing care to beneficiaries with 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receive a fixed prospective 
payment amount for each dialysis treatment. The base composite 
rate is $126 for hospital-based providers and $122 for free-
standing facilities.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Updates the composite rate by 1.2% for dialysis services 
furnished during CY2000 and an additional 1.2% for services 
furnished in CY2001. Requires a MedPAC study on the use of home 
dialysis services by Medicare beneficiaries.
S. 1788, as reported
      Updates the rate for services furnished after October 1, 
2000 by 2.0%.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

 Sec. 223. Implementation of the Inherent Reasonableness (IR) Authority

Current law
      The Secretary has the authority to modify payment rates 
for Part B services (other than physicians services) if such 
rates (as determined by prevailing payment methodologies) are 
``grossly excessive or grossly deficient'' and therefore 
inherently unreasonable. The Secretary is required, by 
regulation, to describe the factors to be used in making 
inherent reasonableness determinations. Interim final 
regulations describing such factors were issued January 7, 
1998.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Prohibits the Secretary from exercising inherent 
reasonableness authority until after the Secretary has issued 
final rule-making. Specifies that final rule-making must be 
preceded by new proposed rule-making and a minimum 60-day 
public comment period.
S. 1788, as reported
      Prohibits the Secretary from using inherent 
reasonableness authority until 90 days after the GAO issues a 
report regarding this issue.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House and Senate provisions 
with modifications to prohibit the Secretary from using 
inherent reasonableness authority until after (1) the GAO 
releases a report regarding the Secretary's recent use of the 
authority; and (2) the Secretary has published a notice of 
final rulemaking in the Federal Register that responds to the 
GAO report and to comments received in response to the 
Secretary's interim final regulation published January 7, 1998. 
In promulgating the final regulation, the Secretary is required 
to (1) reevaluate the appropriateness of the criteria included 
in the interim regulation for identifying payments which are 
excessive or deficient; and (2) take appropriate steps to 
ensure the use of valid and reliable data when exercising the 
authority. The parties to the agreement believe that the 
inherent reasonableness authority provided by section 1842(b) 
should be administered judiciously and applied only after 
public concerns and suggestions about proposed administrative 
criteria have been openly addressed. Also, the rules should 
include an explanation of the Secretary's costing methodology 
which should be based on statistically reliable and relevant 
data.

            Sec. 224. Increase Reimbursement for Pap Smears

Current law
      Medicare pays for Pap smears under the clinical 
laboratory fee schedule.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Sets the minimum payment for the test component of a Pap 
smear at $14.60. Expresses Sense of Congress that HCFA should 
institute appropriate increases for new cervical cancer 
screening technologies approved by the FDA.
S. 1788, as reported
      Similar payment provision, but does not include the 
language relating to the sense of Congress.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

    Sec. 225. Refinement of Ambulance Services Demonstration Project

Current law
      BBA 97 authorized a demonstration project under which a 
unit of local government could enter into a contract with the 
Secretary to furnish ambulance services for individuals living 
in the local government unit. Capitated payments in the first 
year are to equal 95% of the amount which would otherwise be 
payable. Requires on a capitated basis the Secretary to publish 
a request for proposals for the project by July 1, 2000. 
Specifies that the capitation rate is to be based on the most 
current data and that the aggregate payments do not exceed what 
would otherwise be paid.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretary to publish a request for proposals 
for the project by July 1, 2000. Specifies that the capitation 
rate is to be based on the most current data and that the 
aggregate payments do not exceed what would otherwise be paid.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

    Sec. 226. Phase-in of PPS for Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC)

Current law
      Medicare payments for services in ASCs have been based on 
a fee schedule (a form of PPS) since such services were first 
covered by Medicare in 1982. On June 12, 1998, HCFA published 
proposed rules rebasing, regrouping, and revising ASC rates 
which are to be implemented with the hospital outpatient PPS. 
These new rates are based on 1994 survey data.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      For ASC rates based on pre-1999 survey data, requires the 
new rates to be phased in over a period of at least three 
years. In the first year, new payment rates cannot exceed \1/3\ 
of the payment totals made to an ASC; in the second year, new 
payment rates cannot exceed \2/3\ of the payment totals made to 
an ASC.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement note that the dataupon which HCFA's proposed 
payment system is based was collected in 1994 and that there have been 
substantial changes in costs and technologies associated with these 
procedures since that time. In addition, the parties to the agreement 
note that HCFA is now completing a new cost survey intended to yield 
more reliable information and encourages the Secretary to obtain 
adequate cost data for rate setting. Should HCFA move forward with its 
new payment policy, this provision will ensure that the Agency has the 
flexibility necessary to implement the new ASC system over a period of 
three years or longer.

  Sec. 227. Extension of Medicare Benefits for Immunosuppressive Drugs

Current law
      Medicare pays for drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy 
during the first 36 months following a Medicare covered organ 
transplant.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretary to provide for an extension of the 
36-month time period. Prohibits any extension after September 
30, 2004. Permits the Secretary to limit (or provide priority 
in) eligibility to those persons who because of income or other 
factors would be less likely to continue the regimen in the 
absence of the extension. Limits total expenditures under the 
extension to $40 million in FY2000 and $200 million overall. 
Requires a report on the operation of the extension.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
amendments. The extension would apply to beneficiaries whose 
benefits under current law expire during the 5-year period 
beginning January 1, 2000 and ending December 31, 2004. 
Beneficiaries who current law benefits are set to expire in 
2000 would be provided an additional eight months of coverage. 
Those whose benefits are set to expire in calendar year 2001 
would receive a minimum of eight months of additional coverage. 
Beginning in 2001, the Secretary would be required to compute 
and specify in May what period of such additional months (which 
may be portions of months) qualifying beneficiaries would 
receive in the following year. In May 2001, the Secretary could 
also extend the period of coverage provided in statute for 
2001, if her actuarial estimates supported such an extension. 
The Secretary is required to compute additional months of 
coverage in such a manner as to limit total expenditures for 
the extension to $150 million over the 5-year period. The 
Secretary would be required to adjust the number of additional 
months of coverage specified for each year beginning in 2001 
and ending 2004 to the extent necessary to take into account 
differences between actual and estimated expenditures and to 
assure compliance with the limitation on spending for the 
extension. The Secretary's computations for any given year is 
to be based on the best data available to her at the time of 
computation in the preceeding May. The additional months of 
coverage established for a given year would apply to an 
individual who exhausts their 36-month period of coverage 
during that year. The Secretary's report on the extension would 
be due March 1, 2003.

  Sec. 228. Temporary Increase in Payment Amount for Durable Medical 
                       Equipment (DME) and Oxygen

Current law
      The DME fee schedules are updated annually by the CPI-U; 
BBA 97 eliminated the updates for 1998 through 2002.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Provides an update to the DME payments in 2001 and 2002 
by the CPI minus 2 percentage points, for the 12-month period 
ending with June of the previous year.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision, with a 
modification to provide temporary adjustments to the DME fee 
schedule payments equaling 0.3 percent in FY 2001 and 0.6 
percent in FY 2002. The Secretary is prohibited from including 
the additional payments for FY 2001 and 2002 in updates for 
future years.

                     Sec. 229. Studies and Reports

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the following studies: (1) MedPAC study on cost-
effectiveness of covering services of a post-surgical recovery 
center (that provides an intermediate level of recovery care 
following surgery); (2) AHCPR study comparing differences in 
the quality of ultrasound and other imaging services provided 
by credentialed individuals versus those provided by non-
credentialed individuals; (3) MedPAC comprehensive study of the 
regulatory burdens placed on all classes of providers under 
fee-for-service Medicare and the associated costs; and (4) GAO 
monitoring of Department of Justice application of guidelines 
on use of False Claims Act in civil health care matters.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement are concerned that federal regulations 
governing health care providers participating in the Medicare 
program are overly complex and administratively burdensome. 
Therefore, the parties direct MedPAC to conduct a comprehensive 
study to review the regulatory burdens placed on all classes of 
health care providers under Parts A and B of the Medicare 
program. The purpose of the study is to determine the costs 
these burdens impose on the nation's health care system and the 
impact on patients and providers, and their ability to deliver 
cost-effective quality care to Medicare beneficiaries.
      The parties to the agreement note that the Congress has 
expressed concern regarding the application of the False Claims 
Act (FCA) to Medicare billing errors that are the result of a 
complex regulatory system. The Department of Justice issued 
written guidance (``Guidance'') to the United States Attorneys 
on the appropriate use of the FCA in health care 
investigations. In 1998, the Congress directed the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) to monitor the implementation of and 
compliance with the ``Guidance'' and report to Congress. The 
provision directs the GAO to continue its monitoring of the 
issue.
      The parties to the agreement request that AHCPR focus its 
report on the role and the value of credentialing. In designing 
the study, the Administrator should consult with groups with 
expertise in ultrasound procedures, including the Society of 
Diagnostic Medical Sonographers, the Society of Vascular 
Technology, the American Society of Echocardiography and the 
American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers.

            TITLE III--PROVISIONS RELATING TO PARTS A AND B

                    Subtitle A--Home Health Services

 Sec. 301. Adjustment to Reflect Administrative Costs not Included in 
  the Interim Payment System; GAO Report on Costs of Compliance with 
                   OASIS Data Collection Requirements

Current law
      Home health agency workers are required to collect 
clinical and social data on new home health patients using the 
standard Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) data 
collection instrument.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Authorizes payments to home health agencies of $10 for 
each beneficiary served during a cost reporting period 
beginning in FY 2000. By April 1, 2000, the Secretary shall pay 
an estimated 50% of the aggregate annual amount. The payments 
are to be made from the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the 
Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund as 
determined appropriate by the Secretary. Requires the GAO to 
report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the cost of 
OASIS data collection and the effects on patient privacy. 
Requires the GAO to perform an audit of the costs of OASIS and 
report to Congress 180 days after the first cost and privacy 
report.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

Sec. 302. Delay in Application of 15 Percent Reduction in Payment Rates 
     for Home Health Services Until 1 year after Implementation of 
                    Prospective Payment System (PPS)

Current law
      PPS is to be designed to reduce Medicare payments to home 
health agencies by 15% from pre-PPS payments; if PPS is not 
implemented by October 1, 2000, payment limits per visit and 
per beneficiary are to be reduced by 15%.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Delays the 15% reduction in home health payments under 
the PPS until 12 months after implementation of the PPS. Total 
Medicare payments to home health agencies in the first year of 
the PPS shall be the same in total as would have been paid had 
the PPS not been in effect. The 15% reduction to begin 12 
months after the start of the PPS shall be applied to the level 
of total payments in FY 2001 with updates. Within 6 months of 
implementation of the PPS, the Secretary shall report to 
Congress on the need for the 15% or other reduction.
S. 1788, as reported
      Repeals the 15% reduction to the interim cost limits if 
PPS is not ready for implementation on October 1, 2000. Phases 
in the 15% reduction under the PPS by 5% over 3 years, starting 
in FY 2001.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement encourage the Secretary to consider what 
changes would be necessary to provide home health care agencies 
with the flexibility to adopt new market innovations and new 
technologies that can improve health outcomes while maintaining 
the goals of quality of care and cost containment. The parties 
to the agreement also encourage the Secretary to eliminate 
barriers to the use of branch offices, by allowing the use of 
technology for means of supervision and oversight by the parent 
agency. The adequate level of onsite supervision from the 
parent agency should be determined based on quality outcomes.

              Sec. 303. Increase in Per Beneficiary Limits

Current law
      Under the home health care interim payment system 
established in BBA 97, aggregate payments to home health 
agencies are computed using the least of reasonable costs, 
payments based on per visit limits (applied in the aggregate), 
or payments based on an average payment per beneficiary in FY 
1994, with certain updates, applied in the aggregate. No limit 
applies to individual beneficiaries.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Increases agency per beneficiary limits by 1% starting in 
October 1, 1999. The increase does not affect per visit limits 
and is not included in the payment base for establishing the 
PPS.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with an 
amendment to raise the increase in per beneficiary limits for 
cost reporting periods beginning during or after FY 2000 by 2% 
for home health agencies with per beneficiary limits below the 
national median per beneficiary limit for agencies with cost 
reporting periods starting during or before FY 1994. This 
increase will not be included in the base on which payments 
under the home health PPS are determined.

          Sec. 304. Clarification of Surety Bond Requirements

Current law
      Home health agencies must provide the Secretary on a 
continuing basis with a surety bond that is not less than 
$50,000. HCFA regulations require the bond to be not less than 
15% of the agency's Medicare payments in the previous year.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Establishes the lesser of $50,000 or 10% of the agency's 
Medicare payments in the previous year as the annual amount of 
an agency's surety bond requirement. Requires the bond to be in 
effect for 4 years, or longer if agency ownership changes; 
prior periods covered by a bond may be counted. Coordinates 
Medicare and Medicaid surety bonds.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement encourage the Secretary to provide home health 
agencies with the opportunity to repay overpayments (due to 
incorrect interim payment system estimates) over a three-year 
period without interest costs.

    Sec. 305. Refinement of Home Health Agency Consolidated Billing

Current law
      When the home health PPS is implemented, home health 
agencies will be responsible for billing Medicare and paying 
all other providers for services supplied on behalf of 
individual home health beneficiaries.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Excludes durable medical equipment, including oxygen and 
oxygen supplies, from the consolidated billing requirement.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

   Sec. 306. Technical Amendment Clarifying Applicable Market Basket 
             Increase for Prospective Payment System (PPS)

Current law
      When the home health PPS is in effect, the payments are 
to be updated in FY 2002 ``or'' 2003 by the market basket minus 
1.1 percentage points.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Clarifies that the PPS market basket increase minus 1.1 
percentage points applies to FY 2002 and FY 2003.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

Sec. 307. Study and Report to Congress Regarding the Exemption of Rural 
Agencies and Populations from Inclusion in the Home Health Prospective 
                          Payment System (PPS)

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires MedPAC to report to Congress within 2 years on 
the feasibility and advisability of exempting rural home health 
agencies or services to individuals residing in rural areas 
from the home health PPS.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

             Subtitle B--Direct Graduate Medical Education

  Sec. 311. Use of National Average Payment Methodology in Computing 
               Direct Graduate Medical Education Payments

Current law
      Medicare pays hospitals for its share of direct graduate 
medical education (DGME) costs in approved training programs 
using a hospital-specific historic cost per resident, updated 
for inflation and multiplied by a hospital's number of full-
time equivalent (FTE) residents.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Establishes a national average per resident payment 
amount, adjusted for differences in area wages, starting on or 
after October 1, 2000. Hospitals would receive the greater of 
the national average per resident amount or a blended amount of 
the hospital-specific amount and the national average amount 
for a transition period for cost reporting periods on or after 
October 1, 2000 and before October 1, 2004. For cost reports 
starting on or after October 1, 2004, teaching hospitals would 
receive Medicare's share of a wage-adjusted national average 
per resident amount. The national per resident amount would be 
calculated using each hospital's combined primary care and non-
primary care per resident amount, weighted by the number of 
full time equivalent residents in each hospital with an 
approved program, and standardized for differences in area 
wages. The amount would be calculated with data from cost 
reporting periods ending during FY 1997 updated by the CPI to 
the midpoint of the FY 2001 cost reporting period. Subsequent 
updates would be based on the CPI. During the transition 
period, a hospital with a wage index of less than 1.00 would 
not have its payment based on the national average adjusted by 
its area wage index.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
amendments. This provision establishes a direct graduate 
medical education payment methodology based on the national 
average per resident amount modified by the geographic 
adjustment factor (GAF) used to adjust physician payments, that 
is the weighted average of the three geographic practice cost 
indices (GPCIs) weighted by the national average percentage as 
published in the Federal Register on October 31, 1997. A 
national average per resident payment amount, based on FY 1997 
data, would be calculated from each hospital's combined primary 
care and non-primary care per resident amounts and would be 
standardized by the average of the three geographic index 
values (weighted by the national average weight for each of the 
work, practice expense, and malpractice components) as applied 
for 1999 in the fee schedule in which the hospital is located. 
The national average per resident amount, standardized for 
locality, would be calculated using each hospital's amount 
weighted by the number of FTE residents and would be updated to 
FY 2001 by the consumer price index for urban areas (CPI).
      Beginning during FY 2001, a lower bound would be 
calculated at 70% of the locality-adjusted, or standardized, 
national average per resident amount. An upper bound of 140% of 
the locality-adjusted national average per resident amount also 
would be calculated. Each hospital's FY 2001 per resident 
amount would then be compared to the upper and lower bounds 
adjusted by the GAF for the locality in which the hospital is 
situated. Hospitals with per resident amounts below 70% of the 
locality-adjusted threshold would have their per resident 
amounts increased to the 70% locality-adjusted threshold. 
Hospitals with per resident amounts that exceed 140% of their 
locality-adjusted upper bound would receive no update to their 
per resident amounts for two years (FY 2001 and FY 2002), and 
would receive updates of CPI minus two percentage points (but 
not below zero) for three years (FY 2003, FY 2004 and FY 2005). 
Hospitals with perresident amounts within the locality-adjusted 
boundaries of 70% and 140% would continue to be paid portions of their 
per resident amounts and would receive updates for inflation.
      The parties to the agreement concur that the GAF seems to 
be an appropriate measure for adjusting per resident payment 
amounts, and represents an initial attempt to adjust for 
differences among geographic areas in the costs related to 
physician training. The parties to the agreement request that 
MedPAC study the use of the GAF for this purpose and, if 
appropriate, make recommendations by March 2002 on the 
development of a more sophisticated or refined index to adjust 
payment amounts for physician training.

   Sec. 312. Initial Residency Period for Child Neurology Residency 
                           Training Programs

Current law
      Each full-time intern and resident is counted as a 1.0 
full time equivalent (FTE) resident during the initial 
residency period. After the initial residency period, a full-
time resident can be counted only as 0.5 FTE for Medicare's 
direct graduate medical education payment. Generally, the 
initial residency period is the minimum number of years in 
which a resident must train to be eligible for certification in 
a medical specialty as listed in the American Medical 
Association's (AMA) Graduate Medical Education Directory. With 
a combined primary care specialty program, such as internal 
medicine-pediatrics, the initial residency period is defined as 
the minimum number of years for the longer of the two programs, 
plus one additional year. However, with a combined program 
where one of the programs is not primary care, then the initial 
residency period is based on the minimum years to qualify for 
the longer of the composite programs.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Establishes a 3-year period where an individual in a 
child neurology residency program shall be treated as part of 
the initial residency period and shall not be counted against 
any limitation of the initial residency period.
      Requires MedPAC to include in its March 2001 report to 
Congress a recommendation on whether the initial residency 
period for other combined residency training programs should be 
extended.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
amendment. A resident enrolled in a child neurology residency 
training program would have a period of board eligibility and 
initial residency of the board eligibility for pediatrics plus 
2 years. This provision would be effective on or after July 1, 
2000 to residency programs that began before, on, or after the 
enactment of this division.
      MedPAC would be required to include in its March 2001 
report to Congress a recommendation on whether the initial 
residency period for other combined residency training programs 
should be extended.

                  Sec. 321. BBA Technical Corrections

H.R. 3075, as passed
      Includes various technical corrections to the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1997.
S. 1788, as reported
      Includes various technical corrections to the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1997.
Agreement
      The agreement includes amendments to Medicare law that 
are needed as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

                  TITLE IV--RURAL PROVIDER PROVISIONS

                      Subtitle A--Rural Hospitals

  Sec. 401. Permitting Reclassification of Certain Urban Hospitals as 
                            Rural Hospitals

Current law
      Medicare's inpatient hospital PPS payments vary by urban/
rural classification and the geographic area where a hospital 
is located or to which a hospital is reassigned. Several 
mechanisms within the Medicare program permit hospitals that 
meet certain criteria to apply to the Secretary to change their 
geographic designation.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Instructs the Secretary to treat certain urban hospitals 
as rural hospitals no later than 60 days after their 
application for such treatment if the hospitals: (1) are 
located in a rural census tract of a Metropolitan Statistical 
Area (as determined by the Goldsmith Modification published in 
the Federal Register on February 27, 1992); (2) are located in 
an area designated by State law or regulation as a rural area 
or designated by the State as rural providers; or (3) meet 
other criteriaas the Secretary specifies. Permits otherwise 
qualifying urban hospitals to be classified as sole community 
hospitals, regional referral centers, rural referral centers, or 
national referral centers. Extends this rural designation for use in 
outpatient PPS. Updates other federal criteria used to designate rural 
providers.
      Provides that a hospital in an urban area may apply to 
the Secretary to be treated as if the hospital were located in 
a rural area of the State in which the hospital is located. 
Hospitals qualifying under this section shall be eligible to 
qualify for all categories and designations available to rural 
hospitals, including sole community, Medicare dependent, 
critical access, and referral centers. Additionally, qualifying 
hospitals shall be eligible to apply to the Medicare Geographic 
Reclassification Review Board for geographic reclassification 
to another area. The Board shall regard such hospitals as rural 
and as entitled to the exceptions extended to referral centers 
and sole community hospitals, if such hospitals are so 
designated.
S. 1788, as reported
      Provides alternative federal criteria to designate 
providers as rural.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
clarification that the most recent Goldsmith Modification will 
be used.

 Sec. 402. Update of Standards Applied for Geographic Reclassification 
                         for Certain Hospitals

Current law
      Section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Social Security Act requires 
the Secretary to treat a hospital located in a rural county 
adjacent to one or more urban areas as being located in the 
urban Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) to which the greatest 
number of rural workers commute if the rural county's aggregate 
commuting rate (to all the contiguous MSAs) meets the standards 
for designating outlier counties to MSAs (and New England 
County Metropolitan Statistical Areas) that were published in 
the Federal Register on January 3, 1980.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Updates the standards which are used to classify 
hospitals located between two Metropolitan Statistical Areas 
(MSAs) from 1980 to 1990 census data and then to the most 
recently available decennial population data for FY 2003 and 
subsequent years. For FY 2000, the 1980 census data would be 
used. A transition is provided for discharges occurring during 
cost report periods during FY 2001 and 2002 for hospitals to 
choose between the standards published in 1980 and 1990. 
Beginning with cost reporting periods during FY 2003, standards 
would be based on the most recent decennial population data 
published by the Bureau of the Census as revised by the Office 
of Management and Budget. This provision is effective with 
discharges occurring during cost reporting periods beginning on 
or after October 1, 1999.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement believe that a transition period for hospitals 
that might be negatively affected by the change in the standard 
is appropriate.

  Sec. 403. Improvements in the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) Program

Current law
      BBA 97 established criteria for a small, rural, limited 
service hospital to be designated as a critical access hospital 
(CAH). These are geographically remote, rural nonprofit or 
public hospitals that are certified by the state as a necessary 
provider and have hospital stays of no more than 96 hours 
except under certain circumstances.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Applies the 96-hour length of stay limitation on an 
average annual basis. Permits for-profit hospitals and 
hospitals that have closed within the past 10 years to be CAHs. 
Permits States to designate a facility as a CAH if the 
facility: (1) was a hospital that ceased operations on or after 
10 years before enactment of this legislation; (2) is a State-
licensed health clinic or health center; (3) was a hospital 
that was downsized to a health clinic or health center; and (4) 
meets the criteria for designation as a CAH. Permits CAHs to 
elect either a cost-based hospital outpatient service payment 
plus a fee schedule payment for professional services or an 
all-inclusive rate. Eliminates coinsurance for clinical 
laboratory tests. Clarifies CAH's ability to participate in the 
swing bed program.
S. 1788, as reported
      Applies the 96-hour length of stay limitation on an 
average annual basis.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

Sec. 404. 5-Year Extension of Medicare Dependent Hospital (MDH) Program

Current law
      Medicare dependent hospitals (MDH) are small rural 
hospitals, not classified as sole community hospitals, that 
treat relatively high proportions of Medicare patients. BBA 97 
reinstated and extended the MDH program to FY 2001.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Extends the Medicare Dependent Hospital program through 
FY 2006.
S. 1788, as reported
      Authorizes Medicare Dependent Hospitals to receive the 
market basket update in FY 2000 and subsequent years.
      Extends the Medicare Dependent Hospital program through 
FY 2003.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

        Sec. 405. Rebasing for Certain Sole Community Hospitals

Current law
      Sole community hospitals are paid based on whichever of 
the following amounts yields the greatest Medicare 
reimbursement: (1) a hospital-specific amount based on its 
updated FY 1982 costs; (2) a hospital-specific amount based on 
its updated FY 1987 costs; or (3) the federal amount.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Permits sole community hospitals that are now paid the 
federal rate to transition over time to Medicare payment based 
on their FY 1996 costs.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

      Sec. 406. One-Year Sole Community Hospital Payment Increase

Current law
      Sole community hospitals are paid based on whichever of 
the following amounts yields the greatest Medicare 
reimbursement: (1) a hospital-specific amount based on its 
updated FY 1982 costs; (2) a hospital-specific amount based on 
its updated FY 1987 costs; or (3) the federal amount.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Provides for market basket update for sole community 
hospitals and Medicare Dependent Hospitals in FY 2000 and 
subsequent years.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with 
modifications. Sole community hospitals will receive a market 
basket update for one year only for discharges occurring in FY 
2001.

    Sec. 407. Increased Flexibility in Providing Graduate Physician 
                   Training in Rural and Other Areas

Current law
      BBA 97 limited the number of residents that a hospital 
may count for graduate medical education (GME) to the number of 
full-time equivalent residents recognized in the hospital's 
most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 
31, 1996.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Permits rural hospitals to increase their resident limits 
by 30% for direct graduate medical education payments for cost 
reporting periods starting on or after October 1, 1999 and 
indirect medical education payments for discharges occurring on 
or after October 1, 1999.
      Permits non-rural facilities that operate separately 
accredited rural training programs in underserved rural areas, 
or that operate accredited training programs with integrated 
rural tracks, to increase their resident limits for purposes of 
calculating direct graduate medical education payments 
effective for cost reporting periods starting on or after 
October 1, 1999 and for indirect medical education payments 
effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1999.
S. 1788, as reported
      Expands the number of residents reimbursed by Medicare to 
those appointed by the hospitals for periods ending on or 
before December 31, 1996; allows hospitals with only one 
residency program to increase their resident count by one per 
year, up to a maximum of three;allows hospitals to count 
residents associated with new training programs established on or after 
January 1, 1995 and before September 30, 1999; gives special 
consideration to facilities that are not located in a rural area but 
have established separately accredited rural training tracks.
      Provides an exception to the count of residents to 
include those who participated in GME at a Veterans Affairs 
(VA) facility and were subsequently transferred on or after 
January 1, 1997 and before July 31, 1998 to the hospital 
because the program would lose accreditation if residents were 
trained at the VA facility. If the Secretary determines that 
the hospital is owed retroactive payments, these payments shall 
be made within 60 days of enactment.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
amendment. It would allow hospitals to increase the number of 
primary care residents that it counts in the base year limit by 
up to 3 full-time equivalent residents if those individuals 
were on maternity, disability, or a similar approved leave of 
absence. The provision also permits non-rural facilities that 
operate separately accredited rural training programs in rural 
areas, or that operate accredited training programs with 
integrated rural tracks, to receive direct graduate medical 
education and indirect medical education payments for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2000 and for 
discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2000. In addition, 
the agreement includes the Senate provision regarding an 
exception to the count of residents to include those who 
participated in GME at a Veterans Affairs (VA) facility and 
were subsequently transferred.

Sec. 408. Elimination of Certain Restrictions with Respect to Hospital 
                           Swing Bed Program

Current law
      Medicare permits certain rural hospitals with fewer than 
50 beds to use their inpatient facilities, as necessary, to 
furnish long-term care services. Rural hospitals with less than 
100 beds can operate swing beds under certain circumstances.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Eliminates requirement that States review the need for 
swing beds through the Certificate of Need (CON) process. 
Constraints on length of stay are also eliminated.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

 Sec. 409. Grant Program for Rural Hospital Transition to Prospective 
                                Payment

Current law
      BBA 97 replaced and modified the existing Essential 
Access Community Hospital (EACH) program. The Secretary was 
authorized to award grants for certain limited purposes.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Permits rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds to apply 
for grants not to exceed $50,000 for meeting the costs of 
implementing data systems required to meet BBA 97 amendments. A 
hospital receiving a grant may use the funds for the purchase 
of computer software and hardware, for the education and 
training of hospital staff, and costs related to the 
implementation of PPS systems. Requires the Secretary to report 
to Congressional committees at least annually on the grant 
program including the number of grants, the nature of projects 
that are funded, the geographic distribution of the grant 
recipients, and other matters that are deemed appropriate. 
Requires the Secretary to submit a final report no later than 
180 days after the completion of all projects funded by such 
grants.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

           Sec. 410. GAO Study on Geographic Reclassification

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the GAO to submit a report to Congress no later 
than 18 months after enactment on the current laws and 
regulations for geographic reclassification of hospitals under 
Medicare. The purpose of the GAO study is to determine the need 
for geographic reclassification, whether reclassification is 
appropriate for the application of wage indices, and whether 
reclassification results in more accurate payments to all 
hospitals. The study shall evaluate: (1) the magnitude of the 
effect of geographic reclassification on rural hospitals that 
do not reclassify; (2) whether the current thresholds used in 
geographic reclassification assign hospitals to appropriate 
labor markets; (3) the effect of eliminating geographic 
reclassification through the use of data on occupational mix; 
(4) the group reclassification process; (5) changes in the 
number of reclassifications and the compositions of the groups; 
(6) the effect of State-specific budget neutrality compared to 
national budget neutrality; and (7) whether there are 
sufficient controls over the intermediary evaluation of wage 
data reported by hospitals.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Medicare 
Geographic Classification Review Board, to conduct a study to 
determine whether acute hospital PPS payment rates are an 
adequate proxy for the costs of inpatient hospital services and 
whether the standard for county-wide geographic 
reclassification needs to be updated or revised.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement note that in recent years the geographic 
reclassification process and the increasing number of special 
designations for groups of hospitals have resulted in a system 
that is administratively cumbersome. In addition, the system, 
which relies on exceptions and waivers, lacks consistency and 
undermines the ability of hospitals to implement long-term 
planning. Most hospitals are required to reapply annually for 
geographic reclassification with no certainty that they will 
receive the desired wage index or standardized amount.
      The parties to the agreement expect the GAO study to 
assess the background, rationale, and analytic justification 
for the current rural definitions and exceptions process. The 
parties to the agreement hope that this report will be an 
important tool in helping the Congress craft a more objective 
and equitable approach to Medicare payment for rural hospitals. 
This will only become more critical as the Congress considers 
extending geographic reclassification to other types of 
prospective payment systems. The parties to the agreement 
specifically ask the GAO to consider in its analysis whether 
the geographic reclassification process should be extended to 
other types of providers, particularly to skilled nursing 
facilities.

                   Subtitle B--Other Rural Provisions

               Sec. 411. MedPAC Study of Rural Providers

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires MedPAC to conduct a study of rural providers, 
evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of the categories of 
special Medicare payments (and payment methodologies) for rural 
hospitals, and their impact on beneficiary access and quality 
of health services. MedPAC shall submit its recommendations to 
Congress no later than 18 months after the date of enactment.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

Sec. 412. Expansion of Access to Paramedic Intercept Services in Rural 
                                 Areas

Current law
      BBA 97 authorized coverage of advanced life support (ALS) 
services provided by a paramedic intercept service provider in 
a rural area when medically necessary for the individual being 
transported and provided under contract with one or more 
qualified volunteer ambulance services. The volunteer ambulance 
service is certified, provides only basic life support 
services, and is prohibited by State law from billing for any 
services. The entity supplying the advanced life support 
services is Medicare-certified and bills all recipients who 
receive ALS services, regardless of whether the recipients are 
Medicare-eligible.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Expands the areas to be treated as rural areas to include 
those designated as rural areas by any State law or regulation 
or those located in a rural census tract of a Metropolitan 
Statistical Area (as determined under the Goldsmith 
Modification, published in the Federal Register on February 27, 
1992).
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
modification to clarify that the most recent Goldsmith 
Modification should be used. The parties to the agreement 
believe that a State-determined designation of a rural area or 
an area located in a rural census tract of a Metropolitan 
Statistical Area should be acceptable for purposes of expanding 
access to paramedic intercept services.

Sec. 413. Promoting Prompt Implementation of Informatics, Telemedicine, 
                  and Education Demonstration Project

Current law
      BBA 97 authorized Medicare payment for professional 
consultations via telecommunications systems to beneficiaries 
residing in rural areas designated as health professional 
shortage areas (HPSA). HPSAs encompass either a full county or 
part of a county.BBA 97 also authorized a telehealth 
demonstration project for beneficiaries with diabetes mellitus in 
medically underserved rural or inner-city areas.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretary to award without additional review 
the diabetes mellitus demonstration project no later than 3 
months after enactment to the best technical proposal as of the 
bill's enactment date. Clarifies that qualified medically 
underserved rural or urban inner-city areas are federally-
designated medically underserved areas or HPSAs at the time of 
enrollment in the project. Changes the project's data 
requirements. Limits beneficiary cost sharing.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

 TITLE V--PROVISIONS RELATING TO PART C (MEDICARE+CHOICE PROGRAM) AND 
                 OTHER MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PROVISIONS

      Subtitle A--Provisions To Accommodate and Protect Medicare 
                             Beneficiaries

         Sec. 501. Changes in Medicare+Choice Enrollment Rules

Current law
      Beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare+Choice (M+C) plan 
that terminates its contract with HCFA are guaranteed access to 
certain Medicare supplemental insurance policies (i.e. 
``Medigap'' policies) offered in their area of residence if 
they sign up within 63 days of their Medicare+Choice plan 
termination.
      In addition, beneficiaries, at their election, may enroll 
or disenroll from a M+C plan offered in their area any time 
during the year. Beginning in 2002, however, beneficiaries 
generally will be able to enroll in a M+C plan or change plans 
only during an annual, month-long, open enrollment period.
      If a M+C plan withdrawals from a M+C payment area 
(typically a county), enrollees who reside in that county may 
only elect to retain their enrollment in the plan (and travel 
to neighboring counties to obtain covered services) in certain 
circumstances.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Specifies that an individual who is enrolled in a M+C 
plan that announces its intention to withdrawal from the M+C 
program may elect to exercise their guaranteed issue rights 
with (respect to obtaining a Medicare supplemental insurance 
policy) within 63 days of being notified of the plan's 
intention to terminate.
      Permits continuous open enrollment in M+C plans after 
2002 for institutionalized beneficiaries. Permits a plan 
leaving a M+C payment area (typically a county) to offer 
enrollees in that county the option of continuing enrollment in 
the plan, so long as they agree to obtain all basic services 
through plan providers located in other counties.
S. 1788, as reported
      Similar provision regarding Medigap special election 
period.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with a 
modification clarifying that the continuous open enrollment 
provisions for the institutionalized only permit enrollment in 
a M+C plan or changing from one M+C plan to another.

    Sec. 502. Change in Effective Date of Elections and Changes of 
                   Elections of Medicare+Choice Plans

Current law
      Medicare+Choice plan enrollees may elect to disenroll 
from their M+C plan at any time, and either switch to another 
M+C plan offered in their area or elect to obtain benefits 
through the fee-for-service Medicare program. Beginning in 
2002, generally enrollees will be only be able to change 
coverage options once a year.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Specifies that any request to enroll in or disenroll from 
a M+C plan made after the 10th of the month will not be 
effective until the first day of the second calendar month 
thereafter.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

         Sec. 503. 2-Year Extension of Medicare Cost Contracts

Current law
      Prior to enactment of BBA 97, beneficiaries were able to 
enroll in organizations with cost contracts. BBA 97 specified 
that cost-based contracts could not be renewed after December 
31, 2002.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Extends the cost contract program through 2004.
S. 1788, as reported
      Similar provision. However, after December 31, 2003, no 
new persons could enroll in a plan.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

      Subtitle B--Provisions to Facilitate Implementation of the 
                        Medicare+Choice Program

  Sec. 511. Phase-In of New Risk Adjustment Methodology; Studies and 
                       Reports on Risk Adjustment

Current law
      Currently, M+C payments to plans are adjusted using only 
demographic factors, including age, gender, coverage by 
Medicaid, institutionalized status, and working status. The law 
requires implementation of a risk adjustment payment 
methodology based on health status, effective January 1, 2000.
      The Secretary has proposed use of the principal inpatient 
diagnostic cost groups (PIP-DCG) method of risk adjustment, 
which is based on diagnoses of beneficiaries with an inpatient 
hospitalization as well as demographic characteristics.
      The Secretary has proposed a phase-in of the new risk 
adjustment methodology by blending the current demographic 
method with the new PIP-DCG method. The proposed phase-in 
schedule would be:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Year                    Demographics         PIP-DCG
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2000..............................  90 percent.......  10 percent
2001..............................  70 percent.......  30 percent
2002..............................  45 percent.......  55 percent
2003..............................  20 percent.......  80 percent
------------------------------------------------------------------------

      A new comprehensive risk adjustment method based on 
inpatient and other settings would be used beginning in 2004.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      The phase-in schedule is modified as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Year                    Demographic       Health status
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2000..............................  90 percent.......  10 percent
2001..............................  90 percent.......  10 percent
2002..............................  80 percent.......  20 percent
2003..............................  70 percent.......  30 percent
------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Beginning in 2004, M+C rates would be adjusted by a risk 
adjuster based 100% on data from multiple settings.
S. 1788, as reported
      The Senate phase-in would be identical to the House 
provision from 2000 through 2003.
      In 2004, the risk adjuster would be 45% demographic/55% 
health status based, with 67% of health status rate based on 
data from inpatient settings and 33% based on data from 
inpatient and other settings. In 2005, it would be 20% 
demographic/80% health status based, with 33% of health status 
rate based on data from inpatient settings and 67% on data from 
inpatient and other settings. Beginning in 2006, 100% of the 
risk adjuster would be based health status data, and be 
completely determined using data from inpatient and other 
settings.
      Exempts frail elderly beneficiaries enrolled in EverCare 
demonstration projects for the frail elderly from the new risk 
adjustment system in 2000.
      Requires Secretary to: (a) conduct a study on the 
effects, costs, and feasibility of requiring fee-for-service 
providers and entities to comply with quality standards and 
related reporting requirements which are comparable to those 
required for M+C plans; and (b) study and report to Congress 
regarding data submissions used to establish risk adjustment 
methodology under M+C.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the identical House/Senate 
provisions for 2000-2002, only. The parties to the agreement 
note that in 1997, when Congress required the Secretary to 
develop a risk adjuster for Medicare+Choice plans, it was 
concerned that those plans that treated the most severely ill 
enrollees were not adequately paid. The Congress envisioned a 
risk adjuster thatwould be more clinically-based than the old 
method of adjusting payments. The Congress did not instruct HCFA to 
implement the provision in a manner that would reduce aggregate 
Medicare+Choice payments. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office 
did not estimate that the provision would reduce aggregate 
Medicare+Choice payments. Consequently, the parties to the agreement 
urge the Secretary to revise the regulations implementing the risk 
adjuster so as to provide for more accurate payments, without reducing 
overall Medicare+Choice payments.
      The parties to the agreement also note that as currently 
designed, the proposed Medicare+Choice risk adjuster fails to 
account for several unique aspects of Medicare's frail elderly 
population. The parties to the agreement note that the 
Secretary recently acknowledged her authority to address this 
problem by waiving application of the risk adjuster within the 
frail elderly demonstration project commonly known as EverCare. 
The parties to the agreement note that the Secretary will begin 
implementation of a multi-setting risk adjuster for all 
enrollees in 2004, and that such a risk adjuster should be 
designed to better predict the unique costs associated with 
caring for frail elderly beneficiaries. Consequently, the 
parties to the agreement encourage the Secretary to consider 
her ability to waive the application of the new risk adjuster 
to such beneficiaries until that time.
      The parties to the agreement also believe Medicare 
enrollees with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) could benefit by 
being offered the opportunity to enroll in Medicare+Choice 
plans. However, the parties to the agreement understand that 
the current risk adjuster may not adequately reflect the 
varying costs of these patients and requests further 
information from the Secretary so that it might address this 
issue in the future. The parties to the agreement also 
encourage the Secretary to develop proposed quality of care 
requirements for Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD in this 
report.
      The parties agreed to the Senate proposed study requiring 
the Secretary to: (a) conduct a study on the effects, costs, 
and feasibility of requiring fee-for-service providers and 
entities to comply with quality standards and related reporting 
requirements which are comparable to those required for M+C 
plans; and (b) study and report to Congress regarding data 
submission used to establish risk adjustment methodology under 
M+C.

   Sec. 512. Encouraging Offering of Medicare+Choice Plans in Areas 
                             Without Plans

Current law
      A M+C plan receives the M+C payment rate applicable to 
the payment area (typically a county) in which the enrollee 
resides, adjusted for risk. This rate is based on a formula 
which assigns to the county the highest of three different 
rates--a floor, a minimum update or a blended rate.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Would establish added bonus payments to encourage new M+C 
plans to enter counties that would otherwise not have a plan 
participating. The first plan to enter a previously unserved 
county would receive a 5% added payment during their first year 
and a 3% added payment during their second year.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. In some 
counties, beneficiaries have access to only one Medicare 
option: the fee-for-service Medicare program. The parties to 
the agreement expect that this temporary enhancement of 
payments will encourage new plans to enter areas without 
Medicare+Choice options.

      Sec. 513. Modification of 5-Year Re-Entry Rule for Contract 
                              Terminations

Current law
      The Secretary cannot enter into a M+C contract with a M+C 
organization, if within the preceding 5 years, that 
organization had a M+C contract which it did not renew. This 
prohibition may be waived under special circumstances.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Allows, under certain circumstances, a plan to re-enter a 
county if a legislative or regulatory change that would 
increase M+C payments in the area occurred within 6 months of 
the plan's notification to the Secretary of its intent to 
terminate its M+C contract. Permits re-entry only if, at the 
time it notified the Secretary, there is no more than one other 
M+C plan offered in the area.
S. 1788, as reported
      Reduces the exclusion period from 5 years to 2 years.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House and Senate provisions 
with modifications. The parties recognize that some plans left 
the Medicare+Choice program because of increased administrative 
requirements and payment growth that was lower than expected. 
Since this bill would make payment changes affecting 
Medicare+Choice plans, this provision would provide an 
opportunity for the plans to return to a county, and therefore, 
increase options for beneficiaries.
      The general exclusion period is reduced from 5 to 2 
years, with specific exceptions permitted where there is a 
change in payment policy. Further, nothing is to be construed 
as affecting the authority of the Secretary to provide 
additional exceptions, including those specified in Operational 
Policy Letter Number 103.

 Sec. 514. Continued Computation and Publication of Medicare Original 
        Fee-for-Service Expenditures on a County-Specific Basis

Current law
      The Secretary is required to announce each year the M+C 
payment rates for each payment area, as well as risk and other 
factors that are used in adjusting those payments. The 
Secretary is not currently required to publish adjusted annual 
per capita cost (AAPCC) data.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretary to continue to publish estimates 
of adjusted annual per capita cost data (AAPCCs) for each M+C 
payment area, which represent county-specific per capita fee-
for-service expenditure information.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires Secretary to provide county-level data on fee-
for-service spending.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with 
modifications to require the Secretary to publish for the 
original Medicare fee-for-service program under Parts A and B 
for each M+C payment area: 1) total expenditures per capita 
separately for Parts A and B; 2) expenditures as in ``1'' 
reduced by best estimates of expenditures (such as graduate 
medical education and disproportionate share hospital payments 
) not related to payment of claims; 3) average risk factors 
based on diagnoses reported for medicare inpatient services; 
and 4) average risk factors based on diagnoses reported for 
inpatient and other sites of service. The Secretary is required 
to provide information for 1998 and 1999 in the 2001 report.

  Sec. 515. Flexibility to Tailor Benefits Under Medicare+Choice Plans

Current law
      In general, M+C managed care plans offer benefits in 
addition to those provided under Medicare's benefit package, 
and may, subject to regulation, charge for these additional 
benefits. Under current law, the monthly basic and supplemental 
premiums and benefits cannot vary among individuals enrolled in 
the plan.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Permits a M+C plan to waive part or all of a premium if 
the M+C capitation rates the plan receives vary, so long as 
premiums do not vary within payment areas.
S. 1788, as reported
      Allows plans to vary premiums, benefits, and cost-sharing 
across individuals enrolled in the plan so long as these are 
uniform within a separate segment of a service area. A segment 
would comprise one or more counties within the plan's service 
area.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision. The parties 
to the agreement are also concerned about allegations that some 
Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare+Choice program 
are being denied certain Medicare-covered benefits. It was the 
clear intent of Congress in passing the Medicare+Choice program 
in BBA 97 that all beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare+Choice 
plans should be guaranteed access to all benefits covered by 
the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. Therefore, 
the parties to the agreement would like to clarify that, 
pursuant to this fundamental requirement of the Balanced Budget 
Act of 1997, all Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a 
Medicare+Choice plan under Part C are entitled to treatment by 
means of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a 
subluxation.

 Sec. 516. Delay in Deadline for Submission of Adjusted Community Rates

Current law
      BBA 97 required M+C plans to submit adjusted community 
rate (ACR) proposals by May 1 of the previous calendar year. 
The Secretary is required to make available, during the open 
enrollment period, comparative information on plans.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Changes the date for ACR submission from May 1st to July 
1st. Specifies that, the Secretary will provide information to 
the extent it is available.
S. 1788, as reported
      Similar provision. Also specifies that if a M+C 
organization intends to terminate a contract, it must provide 
notice to the Secretary 6 months in advance.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with an 
amendment which retains the current law provisions relating to 
the information the Secretary is required to make available 
during the open enrollment period, and which reduces the 
required period of advance notification from 6 months to 4 
months.
      Despite this change, the parties to the agreement note 
that HCFA will know by mid-August of each year what the final 
plan premiums and benefits will be for each Medicare+Choice 
planfor the following calendar year. To help employers who 
sponsor retiree health benefits coordinate their own annual enrollment 
procedures, the parties to the agreement urge the Secretary to make 
this information available to such employers as soon as possible.

       Sec. 517. Reduction in Adjustment in National Per Capita 
               Medicare+Choice Growth Percentage for 2002

Current law
      The M+C payment rate is based on a formula which gives 
the payment area (generally a county) the highest of three 
different rates--a floor, a minimum update, or a blended rate. 
The blended capitation rates are subject to a budget neutrality 
provision. Each year, the Secretary projects national per 
capita growth rates in expenditures in fee-for-service 
Medicare. These projected rates are reduced by 0.8 percentage 
points for 1998, and by 0.5 percentage points annually from 
1999 through 2002 to determine the national M+C growth 
percentage for that year. Growth rates are used to update the 
floor and blend payments in the M+C payment rate formula. 
Because the blend payments are subject to budget neutrality, 
they may not always be fully funded; thus annual increases in 
payment rates to these counties may be limited.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      The provision would increase the national per capita M+C 
growth rate by 0.2 percentage points in 2002, by replacing the 
adjustment of -0.5 percentage points with -0.3 percentage 
points. The adjustment would remain at 0 for a year after 2002.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision. The parties 
to the agreement expect that the increase in payments that will 
result from this provision will help to increase the number of 
counties paid a blended capitation payment rate.

 Sec. 518. Deeming of Medicare+Choice Organization to Meet Requirements

Current law
      A M+C organization is required to meet certain standards. 
It is deemed to meet standards relating to quality assurance 
and confidentiality of records if it is accredited by a private 
organization that applies standards that are no less strict 
than M+C standards.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretary, within 210 days of receiving an 
application from a private accrediting organization, to 
determine whether such organization's accreditation procedures 
meet the requirements. If it does, the Secretary would be 
required to deem a M+C organization accredited by such 
accrediting entity as meeting the requirements relating to 
quality assurance and confidentiality of records.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with 
amendments. The Secretary would be required to recognize 
accreditation with respect to M+C requirements relating to 
anti-discrimination, access to services, information on advance 
directives, and provider participation. In approving 
accrediting bodies for M+C program purposes, the Secretary 
would be required to use the same basic organizational criteria 
that are used to approve accrediting bodies who survey 
hospitals under the fee-for-service program. The agreement also 
clarifies that the accreditation bodies may choose to deem M+C 
plans' compliance with one or more of the specified 
requirements.
      This provision would clarify the deeming process so that 
it is consistent with deeming in the Medicare fee-for-service 
program. The provision puts in place incentives for M+C plans 
to seek higher standards achievable through accreditation and 
would reduce redundancy in the oversight process. This will 
help ensure that improvements in the quality of care are made 
available through M+C plans.
      Although accredited plans will be deemed to meet HCFA's 
standards, the parties to the agreement note that HCFA will 
continue to have broad authority to establish the actual 
standards that the accrediting bodies enforce. Moreover, HCFA 
continues to have broad authority to conduct independent 
oversight activities with respect to plans and to respond to 
any concerns beneficiaries may raise about a M+C plan. HCFA 
will also be able to approve or disapprove of the deeming 
process submitted by private accreditation bodies and maintain 
its authority to review periodically an approved accreditation 
body's standards and performance in the field. Nevertheless, 
the parties to the agreement emphasize that the intent of 
Congress in 1997 was clear that private accreditation 
procedures should be utilized in the Medicare+Choice program. 
The parties to the agreement's intent in this regard has not 
changed. Consequently, the parties to the agreement expect that 
the Secretary shall recognize and utilize qualified 
accreditation entities that have the ability to certify and 
enforce any of the requirements specified in the provision.

      Sec. 519. Timing of Medicare+Choice Health Information Fairs

Current law
      There is an annual coordinated period in November of each 
year during which beneficiariesmay sign up for or change their 
M+C plan. Beginning in 2002, this enrollment period generally will be 
the only time during the calendar year that such an election or change 
of election may be made. A nationally coordinated information and 
publicity campaign is held in November each year to provide 
beneficiaries with information about their plan options.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Permits HCFA to conduct the annual information campaign 
during the fall season.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision. The parties 
intend to give HCFA the flexibility to begin the annual 
information campaign earlier. For the purpose of this provision 
the parties intent for the Fall season to mean the months of 
September, October or November.

    Sec. 520. Quality Assurance Requirements for Preferred Provider 
                           Organization Plans

Current law
      M+C program requirements mandate that participating plans 
maintain ongoing quality assurance programs. Quality assurance 
program requirements are more extensive for coordinated care 
plans (which rely upon networks of providers with whom they 
contract to provide coordinated services) than they are from 
MSA and fee-for-service M+C plans. In implementing these 
quality assurance requirements, the Secretary has required that 
participating plans meet Quality Improvement System for Managed 
Care (QISMC) standards and guidelines.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Exempts M+C preferred provider organizations from the 
QISMC requirements unless the Secretary establishes similar 
requirements for Medicare fee-for-service providers.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with 
modifications. The provision would clarify that preferred 
provider organizations (PPOs) only be required to meet the 
quality assurance requirements currently applied to private 
fee-for-service and MSA plans. The provision further requires 
MedPAC to conduct a study on the appropriate quality assurance 
standards that should apply to each type of M+C plan (including 
each type of coordinated care plan) and to the original 
Medicare program. A report on this study is due within 2 years 
of enactment.
      The changes incorporated in this provision are in 
response to the lack of preferred provider organizations 
participating in the M+C program, especially in rural counties. 
The parties to the agreement have taken these steps to help 
ensure that PPOs can reasonably comply with the quality 
assurance requirements under Part C, and strongly encourage PPO 
plans to begin offering coverage in rural counties.

 Sec. 521. Clarification of Nonapplicability of Certain Provisions of 
          Discharge Planning Process to Medicare+Choice Plans

Current law
      BBA 97 modified hospital discharge planning process to 
assure that patients are not directed to a single post-acute 
facility.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Provides an exemption for M+C enrollees.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with a 
modification specifying that a M+C discharge planning 
evaluation is not required to include information on the 
availability of home health services provided by individuals or 
entities that do not have a contract with the M+C organization. 
Further, the plan may specify or limit the provider or 
providers of post-hospital home health services or other post-
hospital services.

Sec. 522. User Fee for Medicare+Choice Organizations Based on Number of 
                         Enrolled Beneficiaries

Current law
      Requires the Secretary to collect a user fee from each 
M+C organization for use in carrying out Medicare+Choice 
education and enrollment activities. The activities are 
directed at all Medicare beneficiaries, including the 84% still 
enrolled in the original medicare fee-for-service program under 
Parts A and B. The user fee is equal to the organization's pro 
rata share of the aggregate amount of fees authorized to be 
collected from M+C organizations. The Secretary is authorized 
to collect $100 million in user fees each year.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Specifies that the aggregate amount of fees collected 
from M+C organizations would be limited to a pro rata share of 
the total budget for the education and enrollment related 
activities. This pro rata share is to be based on the number of 
beneficiaries in M+C plans as compared to the total number of 
Medicare beneficiaries. Limits total amount available in a 
fiscal year to the Secretary to carry out functions to $100 
million. Authorizes the Secretary to draw upon the trust funds 
to finance that portion of authorized activities that are not 
financed by user fees imposed on M+C plans.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with 
modifications. The program is authorized for $100 million per 
year. A Medicare+Choice plan's share of the total is the same 
proportion as their share of the total Medicare population. For 
example, if a particular Medicare+Choice plans enrolled 2.5 
percent of the total Medicare population, that plan would be 
responsible for 2.5 percent of the costs associated with the 
information campaign, up to the $100,000,000 authorized.

Sec. 523. Clarification Regarding the Ability of a Religious Fraternal 
          Benefit Society to Operate any Medicare+Choice Plan

Current law
      Religious fraternal benefit societies may restrict 
enrollment in their M+C plans to their members. This allowable 
restriction applies only to coordinated care plans.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Extends the authority to all M+C plans.
S. 1788, as reported
      Extends the authority to all M+C plans except MSAs.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

   Sec. 524. Rules Regarding Physician Referrals for Medicare+Choice 
                                Program

Current law
      Currently it is unlawful for physicians who bill Medicare 
to refer patients to certain entities if the physician has an 
ownership interest in or a compensation arrangement with the 
entity to which the patient is referred. There is an exception 
for referrals to certain specified health plans that agree to 
provide care on a prepaid basis.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Specifies that the exception applies to M+C coordinated 
care plans.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

  Subtitle C--Demonstration Projects and Special Medicare Populations

 Sec. 531. Extension of Social Health Maintenance Organization (SHMO) 
                    Demonstration Project Authority

Current law
      Under waivers from the Secretary of HHS, SHMOs provide 
integrated health and long-term care services on a prepaid 
capitation basis. Medicare demonstration project waivers are to 
expire on December 31, 2000. The Secretary is required to 
submit to Congress by January 1, 1999, a report with a plan for 
integration and transition of SHMOs into an option under 
Medicare+Choice (this report is not yet completed) and a final 
report on the demonstration projects by March 31, 2001. Permits 
enrollment limits per site to be no fewer than 36,000.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Extends the Medicare demonstration project waivers until 
18 months after the Secretary submits an integration and 
transition plan report to Congress. Within 6 months after the 
Secretary's final report (due March 31, 2001), requires MedPAC 
to submit a report to Congress with recommendations regarding 
the demonstration project. Increases the aggregate limit on 
participants at all sites to not less than 324,000.
S. 1788, as reported
      Extends Medicare demonstration project waivers until 1 
year after the Secretary submits anintegration and transition 
plan report to Congress. Requires the Secretary to submit a final 
report on the demonstration projects to Congress 1 year after the 
integration and transition plan report.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

    Sec. 532. Extension of Medicare Community Nursing Organization 
                         Demonstration Project

Current law
      The community nursing organization demonstration project 
began on January 1, 1994 to test in four sites a system of 
capitated payments for specified community nursing services 
covered by Medicare. Experimental and control groups were 
followed for health care utilization and costs. The experiment 
ended at the end of 1997. BBA 97 extended the availability of 
services through 1999. A final report is in progress.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Extends the demonstration project for 2 years; requires 
the Secretary to submit a report to Congress on the results of 
the demonstration project no later than July 1, 2001.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with an 
amendment requiring the Secretary to provide for such 
reductions in payments under the project, in either year, which 
are necessary to ensure that federal expenditures under the 
project do not exceed those which would have been made in the 
absence of the project extension.

  Sec. 533. Medicare+Choice Competitive Bidding Demonstration Project

Current law
      BBA 97 requires the Secretary to establish a 
demonstration project under which payments to Medicare+Choice 
organizations are determined by a competitive pricing 
methodology, in accordance with the recommendations of the 
Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee (CPAC), the composition 
and responsibilities of which were also established under BBA 
97.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Delays implementation of the project until January 1, 
2002 or, if later, 6 months after CPAC submits reports on (a) 
incorporating original fee-for-service Medicare into the 
demonstration; (b) quality activities required by participating 
plans; (c) the viability of expanding the demonstration project 
to a rural site; and (d) the nature of the benefit structure 
required from plans that participate in the demonstration. The 
Secretary is also required, subject to recommendations by CPAC, 
to allow plans that make bids below the established government 
contribution rate, to offer beneficiaries rebates on their Part 
B premiums.
      This provision is designed to give both CPAC and Congress 
more time to resolve some of the initial concerns that have 
been raised about the demonstration project, as it is currently 
designed. By delaying the start date an additional year, and by 
tasking CPAC to report back on the identified areas of concern, 
the parties to the agreement believe appropriate modifications 
to the project can be implemented before its inauguration so as 
to improve its chances of success. Similarly, the additional 
time provided by the delay will afford the Secretary, CPAC and 
the area advisory committees additional time to work with the 
communities designated under the project to resolve outstanding 
issues of concern.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

sec. 534. extension of medicare municipal health services demonstration 
                            projects (mhsp)

Current law
      The MHSP is a multi-site demonstration to improve access 
to primary care services. BBA 97 extended the project through 
Dec. 2000 to provide a transition to mainstream Medicare.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Extends the project through December 31, 2001.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision, with an 
amendment to extend the project through December 31, 2002.

       Sec. 535. Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration Project

Current law
      BBA 97 provided for a coordinated care demonstration 
project in a cancer hospital. Funds would only be available as 
provided in any law making appropriations for the District of 
Columbia.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Specifies that the funding is to be made from Medicare 
trust funds in such amounts as are necessary to cover the costs 
of the project.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.
      The parties to the agreement are concerned that the 
Secretary has not acted upon a previously expressed 
Congressional mandate contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 
1997 with respect to best practices in the area of coordinated 
care. Specifically, the mandate contained in Subchapter D, 
Section 4016 of the law required the Secretary no later than 
two years after enactment to conduct nine demonstration 
projects, that among other things, would evaluate best 
practices in the management of chronic illness. The parties to 
the agreement are aware that a solicitation for such proposals 
in the areas of, but not limited to, congestive heart failure 
and diabetes mellitus contained in the Health Care Financing 
Administration Federal Register Notice of June 11, 1998, Vol. 
63, No. 112 has not yet been acted upon by the Department, 
despite clear Congressional interest to evaluate and understand 
the potential benefits of these programs for better delivery of 
care to Medicare beneficiaries.
      Therefore, the parties direct the Secretary to implement 
no later than 90 days after enactment of this law 
demonstrations enunciated in BBA 97, including a demonstration 
focused on the best practices available in chronic illness. 
Specifically, the parties also direct the Secretary no later 
than 90 days after enactment of this law to implement the case 
management demonstration focused on congestive heart failure 
and diabetes mellitus contained in the HCFA Federal Register 
solicitation of June 11, 1998.

        Sec. 536. Medigap Protections for PACE Program Enrollees

Current law
      The law guarantees issuance of specified Medigap policies 
to certain persons in terminating plans and, within their first 
twelve months of Medicare eligibility, to persons who enter 
directly into a M+C plan when becoming eligible for Medicare.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Extends protections to PACE enrollees in similar 
circumstances.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision with a 
modification to limit application of the provision to persons 
65 years of age and older. The agreement does not include an 
extension of the disenrollment window for involuntarily 
terminated enrollees.

  Subtitle D--Medicare+Choice Nursing and Allied Health Professional 
                           Education Payments

   Sec. 541. Medicare+Choice Nursing and Allied Health Professional 
                           Education Payments

Current law
      Medicare's calculation of managed care rates incorporates 
the additional payments made to teaching hospitals that operate 
residency training programs. BBA 97 reduced these rates by 
carving out the costs attributable to graduate medical 
education payments for physicians. The payment reduction is 
phased in over 5 years. Teaching hospitals will receive 
additional payments depending upon the number of Medicare 
managed care beneficiaries they serve.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Authorizes hospitals that operate approved nursing and 
allied health professional training programs to receive 
additional payments to reflect utilization of Medicare+Choice 
enrollees. The relationship of allied health direct graduate 
medical education (DGME) payments for Medicare+Choice enrollees 
to physician DGME payments for Medicare+Choice enrollees shall 
be in the same proportion as total allied health DGME payments 
to total DGME payments. The allied health payments to different 
hospitals are proportional to the direct costs of each hospital 
for such programs. In no case can this payment exceed $60 
million. Physician DGME payment for Medicare+Choice utilization 
will be adjusted by the amount of additional payments that will 
be made for allied health professions under this provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with technical 
modifications. Hospitals that operate approved nursing and 
allied health professional training programs and receive 
Medicare reasonable cost reimbursement for these programs would 
receive additional payments to reflect utilization of 
Medicare+Choice enrollees for portions of the cost reporting 
periods occurring in a year beginning in 2000. As specified by 
the Secretary, the payment amount would be calculated based on 
the proportion of physician direct graduate medical education 
(DGME) payments for Medicare+Choice enrollees to total 
physician DGME payments multiplied by the Secretary's estimate 
of total reasonable cost reimbursement for approved nursing and 
allied health professional training programs. In no case could 
this payment exceed $60 million. Hospitals would receive these 
allied health payments in proportion to amount of Medicare 
reasonable cost reimbursement for nursing and allied health 
programs received in the cost reporting period in the second 
preceding fiscal year to the total paid to all hospitals for 
such cost reporting period. Physician DGME payment for 
Medicare+Choice utilization would be reduced by the amount of 
additional payments that would be made for nursing and allied 
health professions under this provision.

Sec. 551. Report on Accounting for VA and DOD Expenditures for Medicare 
                             Beneficiaries

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires the Secretaries of HHS, DOD, and VA no later 
than a year from enactment to submit to Congress a report on 
the use of health services furnished by DOD and VA to Medicare 
beneficiaries including Medicare+Choice enrollees and Medicare 
fee-for-service beneficiaries.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision with an 
amendment. The amendment requires the study to be conducted no 
later than April 1, 2001.
      On a similar matter, the parties to the agreement are 
also concerned about the ability of Medicare beneficiaries who 
are also entitled to Veterans Administration health care 
services to obtain the full benefit of these separate 
entitlements. This issue is of particular concern in areas 
where VA health facilities are inadequate to fully meet the 
needs of these veteran beneficiaries. While beneficiaries in 
these areas are often able to readily obtain Medicare covered 
services from Medicare providers, the lack of Veterans Health 
Administration facilities often prevents them from obtaining 
more generous VA benefits for their health care needs. As a 
result, these beneficiaries often have to pay more in out-of-
pocket health spending than similarly entitled veterans who 
reside near VA facilities.
      To address this problem, the parties to the agreement 
encourage the Secretary to consult with the Secretary of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs and consider ways in which the 
two Secretaries could institute procedures that would allow for 
the greater coordination of benefits--and consequently greater 
access to needed care--for this special population.

  Sec. 552. Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) Studies and 
                                Reports

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires MedPAC to submit to Congress a report on 
specific legislative changes that would make MSA plans a viable 
option under the M+C program.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires MedPAC to conduct a study that evaluates the 
methodology used by the Secretary in developing risk adjustment 
factors for M+C capitation rates. Requires MedPAC to conduct a 
study on the development of a payment methodology under M+C for 
frail elderly beneficiaries enrolled in specialized programs.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House and Senate provisions.

               Sec. 553. GAO Studies, Audits, and Reports

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires the GAO to conduct a study of Medigap policies. 
Requires the GAO to conduct annual audits of the Secretary's 
expenditures for providing M+C information to beneficiaries.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

                           TITLE VI--MEDICAID

Sec. 601. Increase in DSH Allotment for Certain States and the District 
                              of Columbia

Current law
      The federal share of Medicaid disproportionate share 
payments is capped at amounts specified for each state.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Increases the ceiling on the federal share of DSH 
payments for the District of Columbia, from $23 million to $32 
million for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2002; for 
Minnesota, from $16 million to $33 million for each of fiscal 
years 1999 through 2002; for New Mexico, from $5 million to $9 
million for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2002; and for 
Wyoming, from 0 to $.1 million for each of fiscal years 1999 
through 2002.
S. 1788, as reported
      Same as House provision.
Agreement
      The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate bill.

  Sec. 602. Removal of Fiscal Year Limitation On Certain Transitional 
                    Administrative Costs Assistance

Current law
      The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 
Reconciliation Act of 1996 replaced the Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children (AFDC) program and established the Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. Under the old 
program, people who qualified for AFDC were automatically 
eligible for Medicaid. Welfare reform de-linked Medicaid and 
TANF eligibility. Concerned that state Medicaid programs would 
face large new administrative costs for conducting Medicaid 
eligibility determinations that would otherwise not have 
occurred, Congress established a fund of $500 million to assist 
with the transitional costs of the new eligibility activities. 
The funds are available at an increased federal match for 
states that can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary that such additional administrative costs were 
attributable to welfare reform. The increased matching funds 
are available for the period beginning with fiscal year 1997 
and ending with fiscal year 2000 and must relate to costs 
incurred during the first 12 quarters following the welfare 
reform effective date.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Extends the availability of the transitional increased 
federal matching funds beyond fiscal year 2000 and allows costs 
for which the increased matching funds are claimed to relate to 
costs incurred for the calender quarters beyond the first 12 
following the effective date of welfare reform.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

  Sec. 603. Two-Year Moratorium on Phase-Out of Payment for Federally-
Qualified Health Center Services and Rural Health Clinic Services Based 
                          On Reasonable Costs

Current law
      States pay FQHCs and RHCs a percentage of the facilities' 
reasonable costs for providing services. This percentage 
decreases for specified fiscal years--100% of costs for 
services furnished during FY1998 and FY1999; 95% for FY2000; 
90% for FY2001; 85% for FY2002; and 70% for FY2003. For 
services furnished on or after October 1, 2003, no required 
payment percentage will apply. Two special payment rules are 
applicable during FY1998-FY2002. In the case of a contract 
between an FQHC or RHC and a managed care organization (MCO), 
the MCO must pay the FQHC or RHC at least as much as it would 
pay any other provider for similar services. States are 
required to make supplemental payments to the FQHCs and RHCs, 
equal to the difference between the contracted amounts and the 
cost-based amounts.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Creates a new Medicaid prospective payment system for 
FQHCs and RHCs beginning with FY2000. For the base year 
(defined as FY2000 for existing entities and the initial year 
of FQHC or RHC qualification for new entities established after 
FY1999), per visit payments are equal to 100% of the reasonable 
costs during the previous year for existing entities and the 
base year for new entities, adjusted for any increase in the 
scope of services furnished. For each fiscal yearthereafter, 
per visit payments are equal to amounts for the preceding fiscal year 
increased by the percentage increase in the Medicare Economic Index 
applicable to primary care services for that fiscal year, and adjusted 
for any increase in the scope of services furnished during that fiscal 
year. In managed care contracts, States must make supplemental payments 
equal to the difference between contracted amounts and the cost-based 
amounts. Alternative payment methods are permitted only when payments 
are at least equal to amounts otherwise provided.
S. 1788, as reported
      Retains the phase-out of cost-based reimbursement under 
Medicaid for FQHCs and RHCs as delineated in current law, and 
adds a new grant program. Beginning in FY2001, transitional 
grants outside the Medicaid program may be awarded to 
qualifying states to pay for services allowable under Medicaid 
when provided by FQHC and RHC to individuals who are not 
eligible for Medicaid. These grants will be made only to states 
that are paying 100% of reasonable costs to FQHCs and RHCs 
under Medicaid with one exception--states that have elected to 
pay FQHCs and RHCs 95% of reasonable costs in FY2000 and which 
revert to paying 100% of reasonable costs for FY2001 through 
FY2003 may also qualify for this new grant. For each of fiscal 
years 2001 through 2003, grant amounts are based on the ratio 
of the number of low-income persons in a state to the total 
number of such persons in all states. Counts of low-income 
persons equal the average number of such persons estimated 
using the 3 most recent March supplements of the CPS before the 
beginning of the calendar year in which the fiscal year begins. 
Annual grant amounts for any state will be no less than 
$400,000, and the Secretary will make pro rata adjustments as 
needed to achieve this requirement. There are no matching fund 
requirements for states. Also, each state awarded a grant will 
have 3 years in which to spend the funds allotted for a given 
fiscal year. States must distribute funds among all FQHCs and 
RHCs using uniform criteria based on factors such as size of 
caseload and treatment costs. Up to 15% of grant amounts per 
fiscal year may be used by states for administrative costs 
associated with this program. Total annual appropriations are 
$25 million for each of fiscal years 2001 through 2003. The GAO 
will conduct an annual study (due on November 1 of each year 
for 2000 through 2003) to determine the impact of the phase-out 
of cost-based reimbursement for FQHCs and RHCs and will report 
related recommendations for legislation.
Agreement
      The agreement imposes a two-year moratorium on the phase-
down of the cost-based reimbursement system set forth in the 
Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This will freeze the phase-down at 
95 percent for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, and then the phase-
down will resume at 90 percent in 2003, 85 percent in 2004. 
Cost-based reimbursement will be repealed in 2005. The General 
Accounting Office (GAO) will conduct an analysis of the impact 
of reducing or modifying payments based on the reasonable cost 
standard for federally qualified health centers and rural 
health clinics and the populations they serve. The GAO shall 
report back to Congress within 12 months with their findings 
and recommendations. This study shall evaluate a sampling of 
different payment approaches.

 Sec. 604. Parity in Reimbursement for Certain Utilization and Quality 
Control Services; Elimination of Duplicative Requirements for External 
         Quality Review of Medicaid Managed Care Organizations

a. Parity in Reimbursement for Certain Utilization and Quality Control 
                                Services

Current law
      Current Medicaid law provides that States will receive 
75% federal financial participation (FFP) when contracting with 
a Peer Review Organization (PRO) for medical and utilization 
reviews and for quality reviews. In addition, states can 
receive 75% FFP when they contract with a PRO-like entity but 
only for external quality reviews of Medicaid managed care. For 
all other reviews and entities, the standard 50% FFP applies.
      A PRO is an entity that has a Medicare contract to 
perform medical and utilization reviews. A PRO-like entity is 
one that is certified by the Secretary as meeting the 
requirements of Section 1152 which defines standards for PROs 
under Medicare.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      States will receive 75% FFP when PRO-like entities 
conduct medical and utilization reviews for fee-for-service 
Medicaid, and quality reviews for Medicaid managed care.
S. 1788, as reported
      No provision.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the House provision.

b. Elimination of Duplicative Requirements for External Quality Review 
                 of Medicaid Managed Care Organizations

Current law
      Medicaid managed care organizations are required to 
obtain annual independent, external reviews using either a 
utilization and quality control peer review organization, a PRO 
defined under section 1152, or a private accreditation body. 
The results must be made available to the State and upon 
request to the Secretary, the Inspector General of HHS and the 
Comptroller General. This requirement is contained in three 
different sections of Medicaid law.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Deletes the external review requirements of Section 
1902(a)(30)(C) and related parts of Sections 1902(d), 
1903(a)(3)(C)(i) and 1903(m)(6)(B). Also requires the Secretary 
of HHS to certify to Congress that the external review 
requirement in Section 1932(c)(2) is fully implemented.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

Sec. 605. Inapplicability of Enhanced Match Under the State Children's 
           Health Insurance Program to Medicaid DSH Payments

Current law
      States have a great deal of flexibility in determining 
the formula used to calculate DSH payments to individual 
hospitals within minimum and maximum federal criteria. Those 
payments are matched by the federal government at the federal 
medical assistance percentage (FMAP), the same percentage that 
the federal government matches most other Medicaid payments for 
benefits. On the other hand, Medicaid payments for children who 
are eligible for benefits on the basis of being a targeted low-
income child under Title XXI are matched at an enhanced federal 
matching percentage which is considerably higher than the basic 
Medicaid FMAP.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Clarifies that Medicaid DSH payments are matched at the 
FMAP and not at the enhanced federal matching percentage 
authorized under Title XXI.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

Sec. 606. Optional Deferment of the Effective Date for Outpatient Drug 
                               Agreements

Current law
      Medicaid law requires that rebate agreements between the 
Secretary (or, if authorized by the Secretary, with the States) 
and drug manufacturers that were not in effect before March 1, 
1991 become effective the first day of the calendar quarter 
that begins more than 60 days after the date the agreement is 
entered into.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Allows rebate agreements entered into after the date of 
enactment of this act to become effective on the date on which 
the agreement is entered into, or at State option, any date 
before or after the date on which the agreement is entered 
into.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

        Sec. 607. Making Medicaid DSH Transition Rule Permanent

Current law
      Medicaid authorizes states to make special 
disproportionate share (DSH) payments to certain hospitals 
treating large numbers of low-income and Medicaid patients. 
States determine the formula used to calculate DSH payments to 
individual hospitals within minimum and maximum federal 
criteria. For the period July 1, 1997 through July 1, 1999, 
hospital-specific disproportionate share payments for the State 
of California may be as high as 175% of the cost of care 
provided to Medicaid recipients and individuals who have no 
health insurance or other third-party coverage for services 
during the year (net of non-disproportionate share Medicaid 
payments and other payments by uninsured individuals).
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Removes the July 1, 1999, end date for increased 
hospital-specific disproportionate share payments for the State 
of California, extending the transition period indefinitely.
S. 1788, as reported
      Same as House provision.
Agreement
      The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate bill.

                Sec. 608. Medicaid Technical Corrections

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Makes technical corrections to cross-references in Title 
XIX.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

      TITLE VII--STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (SCHIP)

  Sec. 701. Stabilizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program 
                           Allotment Formula

Current law
      States and the District of Columbia are allotted funds 
for SCHIP using a distribution formula based on the product of 
the ``number of children'' and a ``state cost factor.'' For 
FY1998 through FY2000, the number of children is equal to the 
3-year average of uninsured children in families with income 
below 200% FPL, using the three most recent March supplements 
of the Current Population Survey. For subsequent fiscal years, 
the number of children is a combination of low-income uninsured 
children and low-income children (75/25 percent split for 
FY2001 and a 50/50 percent split for FY2002 and thereafter). 
The state cost factor for a fiscal year equals the sum of .85 
multiplied by the ratio of the annual average wages per 
employee to the national average wages per employee and .15. 
The measure for the annual average wages per employee is based 
on the 3 most recent years for employees in the health services 
industry. SCHIP allotments are subject to a floor of $2 
million.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Accelerates the phase-in of the use of low-income 
children in calculating the ``number of children'' in the 
allotment distribution formula. Changes the data set to be used 
to estimate the number of children for a fiscal year from the 
three most recent March supplements of the CPS to the three 
most recent supplements available before the calendar year in 
which the fiscal year begins. Specifies new methods for 
determining floors and ceilings on allotments for the states 
and the District of Columbia for FY2000 and beyond. The floor 
remains $2 million, stated as a proportion of the total amount 
available for allotments for a fiscal year. For each fiscal 
year, the floor will not be less than 90% of a state's 
allotment proportion for the preceding year. The cumulative 
floor is set at 70% of the proportion for FY1999. The 
cumulative ceiling is capped at 145% of a state's allotment 
proportion for FY1999. If these methods create a deficit in a 
given year, there will be a ceiling on the maximum increase 
permitted in that year to ensure budget neutrality; if these 
methods create a surplus in a given year, there will be a pro-
rata increase for all states below the ceiling. These new 
methods do not apply to unspent allotments that are 
redistributed to states as specified in Section 2104(f) of 
Title XXI.
S. 1788, as reported
      Same as House provision.
Agreement
      The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate bill.

    Sec. 702. Increased Allotments for Territories Under the State 
                  Children's Health Insurance Program

Current law
      Of the total amount available for allotment for the SCHIP 
program, commonwealths and territories are allotted .25%, to be 
divided among them based on specified percentages. In addition, 
for fiscal year 1999, commonwealths and territories were 
allotted $32 million. This additional allotment amount was also 
divided among them based on the same specified percentages as 
the basic allotment.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      Requires additional allotments for the commonwealths and 
territories of $34.2 million for each of fiscal years 2000 and 
2001, $25.2 million for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2004, 
$32.4 million for each of fiscal years 2005 and 2006, and $40 
million for fiscal year 2007.
S. 1788, as reported
      Same as House provision.
Agreement
      The agreement follows the House bill and the Senate bill.

    Sec. 703. Improved Data Collection and Evaluations of the State 
                  Children's Health Insurance Program

 a. Funding for Reliable Annual State-by-State Estimates on the Number 
         of Children Who Do Not Have Health Insurance Coverage

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires that the Secretary of Commerce make appropriate 
adjustments to the annual CPS to produce statistically reliable 
annual State-level data on the number of low-income children 
without health insurance. Data should be stratified by family 
income, age, and race or ethnicity. Appropriate adjustments to 
the CPS may include expanding sample size and/or sampling units 
within States, and appropriate verification methods. Requires 
that $10 million be appropriated for FY-2000 and for each year 
thereafter. These changes to the CPS will improve critical data 
for evaluation purposes. They will also affect State-specific 
counts of number of low-income children and the number of such 
children who have no health insurance coverage that feed into 
the formula in existing law that determines annual State-
specific allotments from federal SCHIP appropriations.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

 b. Funding for Children's Health Care Access and Utilization State-by-
                               State Data

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires the Secretary of HHS, acting through the 
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), to collect data 
on children's health insurance through the State and Local Area 
Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS) for the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia. The data collected must provide reliable, 
annual State-by-State information on health care access and 
utilization by low-income children. Data must also allow for 
stratification by family income, age, and race or ethnicity. 
The Secretary must obtain input from appropriate sources, 
including States, in designing the survey and its content. 
Requires that $9 million be appropriated for FY-2000 and for 
each year thereafter. At State request, the Secretary may also 
collect additional SLAITS data to assist with individual State 
SCHIP evaluations, for which the States must reimburse NCHS for 
such services.
Agreement
      The Senate provision is not included.

  c. Federal Evaluation of State Children's Health Insurance Programs

Current law
      The Secretary is required to submit to Congress by 
December 31, 2001, a report based on the annual evaluations 
submitted by States, with conclusions and recommendations, as 
appropriate.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Adds a new federal evaluation to current law. The 
Secretary of HHS, directly or through contracts or interagency 
agreements, would be required to conduct an independent 
evaluation of 10 States with approved SCHIP plans. The selected 
States must represent diverse approaches to providing child 
health assistance, a mix of geographic areas (including rural 
and urban areas), and a significant portion of uninsured 
children. The federal evaluation will include, but not be 
limited to: (1) a survey of the target population, (2) an 
assessment of effective and ineffective outreach and enrollment 
practices for both SCHIP and Medicaid, (3) an analysis of 
Medicaid eligibility rules and procedures that are a barrier to 
enrollment in Medicaid, and how coordination between Medicaid 
and SCHIP has affected enrollment under both programs, (4) an 
assessment of the effects of cost-sharing policies on 
enrollment, utilization and retention, and (5) an analysis of 
disenrollment patterns and factors influencing this process. 
The Secretary must submit the results of the federal evaluation 
to Congress no later than December 31, 2001. Requires that $10 
million be appropriated for FY-2000. This appropriation shall 
remain available without fiscal year limitation.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

  d. Inspector General Audit and GAO Report on Enrollees Eligible for 
                                Medicaid

Current law
      No provision.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Requires that the Inspector General of HHS conduct an 
audit to determine how many Medicaid-eligible children are 
incorrectly enrolled in SCHIP among a sample of States that 
provide child health assistance through separate programs only 
(not via a Medicaid expansion). This audit will also assess 
progress in reducing the number of uninsured children relative 
to the goals stated in approved SCHIP plans. The first such 
audit will be conducted in FY2000, and will be repeated every 
third fiscal year thereafter. Requires the GAO to monitor these 
audits and report their results to Congress within six months 
of audit completion (i.e., by March 1 of the fiscal year 
following each audit).
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

  e. Coordination of Data Collection with Data Requirements Under the 
             Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant

Current law
      States are required to submit annual reports detailing 
their activities under the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) 
Services Block Grant. These reports must include, among other 
items, information (by racial and ethnic group) on: (1) the 
number of deliveries to pregnant women who were provided 
prenatal, delivery or postpartum care under the block grant or 
who were entitled to benefits with respect to such deliveries 
under Medicaid, and (2) the number of infants under one year of 
age who were provided services under the block grant or were 
entitled to benefits under Medicaid.
H.R. 3075, as passed
      No provision.
S. 1788, as reported
      Adds to the existing reporting requirement under the MCH 
Block Grant authority inclusion of information (by racial and 
ethnic group) on the number of deliveries to pregnant women 
entitled to benefits under SCHIP, and the number of infants 
under age one year entitled to SCHIP benefits.
Agreement
      The agreement includes the Senate provision.

days of the receipt of all necessary documents from the 
applicant and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 
the case of an immigrant visa application where the sponsor of

each category of visa application under subsection (a), a list 
of the embassies and consular posts which do not meet the 
policy standards under subsection (a), the amount of funds 
collected worldwide for processing of visa applications during 
the most recent fiscal year, the estimated costs of processing 
such visa applications (based on the Department of State's most

Representatives, and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on 
the feasibility of decreasing the amount of an individual's 
arrearages of child support that would require the Secretary of 
State to refuse to issue a passport to such individual, or 
otherwise act with respect to such an individual, as provided 
under section 452(k) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
652(k)).

        addition, an amount between $5,000 and $2,500.
            (2) A projection of the estimated benefits of 
        reducing the amount to $2,500 (or an amount between 
        $5,000 and $2,500), which shall include an estimate of 
        the additional numbers of individuals who would be 
        subject to denial, an estimate of the additional child 
        support arrearages that would be received through such 
        a reduction, and an estimate of the amount of child 
        support that would be paid earlier than under current 
        law (together with an estimate of how much earlier such 
        amounts would be paid).
            (3) Information regarding the number of individuals

        benefit projections described in paragraphs (1) and 
        (2).

of an emergency involving a threat to human life the Secretary 
of State shall notify the appropriate congressional committees

        TITLE VI--EMBASSY SECURITY AND COUNTERTERRORISM MEASURES

SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Secure Embassy 
Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999''.

SEC. 602. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On August 7, 1998, the United States embassies 
        in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were 
        destroyed by simultaneously exploding bombs. The 
        resulting explosions killed 220 persons and injured 
        more than 4,000 others. Twelve Americans and 40 Kenyan 
        and Tanzanian employees of the United States Foreign 
        Service were killed in the attack.
            (2) The United States personnel in both Dar es 
        Salaam and Nairobi showed leadership and personal 
        courage in their response to the attacks. Despite the 
        havoc wreaked upon the embassies, staff in both 
        embassies provided rapid response in locating and 
        rescuing victims, providing emergency assistance, and 
        quickly restoring embassy operations during a crisis.
            (3) The bombs are believed to have been set by 
        individuals associated with Osama bin Laden, leader of 
        a known transnational terrorist organization. In 
        February 1998, bin Laden issued a directive to his 
        followers that called for attacks against United States 
        interests anywhere in the world.
            (4) Threats continue to be made against United 
        States diplomatic facilities.
            (5) Accountability Review Boards were convened 
        following the bombings, as required by Public Law 99-
        399, chaired by Admiral William J. Crowe, United States 
        Navy (Ret.) (in this section referred to as the ``Crowe 
        panels'').
            (6) The conclusions of the Crowe panels were 
        strikingly similar to those stated by the Commission 
        chaired by Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, which issued an 
        extensive embassy security report in 1985.
            (7) The Crowe panels issued a report setting out 
        many problems with security at United States diplomatic 
        facilities, in particular the following:
                    (A) The United States Government has 
                devoted inadequate resources to security 
                against terrorist attacks.
                    (B) The United States Government places too 
                low a priority on security concerns.
            (8) The result has been a failure to take adequate 
        steps to prevent tragedies such as the bombings in 
        Kenya and Tanzania.
            (9) The Crowe panels found that there was an 
        institutional failure on the part of the Department of 
        State to recognize threats posed by transnational 
        terrorism and vehicular bombs.
            (10) Responsibility for ensuring adequate resources 
        for security programs is widely shared throughout the 
        United States Government, including Congress. Unless 
        the vulnerabilities identified by the Crowe panels are 
        addressed in a sustained and financially realistic 
        manner, the lives and safety of United States employees 
        in diplomatic facilities will continue to be at risk 
        from further terrorist attacks.
            (11) Although service in the Foreign Service or 
        other United States Government positions abroad can 
        never be completely without risk, the United States 
        Government must take all reasonable steps to minimize 
        security risks.

SEC. 603. UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC FACILITY DEFINED.

    In this title, the terms `United States diplomatic 
facility' and `diplomatic facility' mean any chancery, 
consulate, or other office notified to the host government as 
diplomatic or consular premises in accordance with the Vienna 
Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations, or otherwise 
subject to a publicly available bilateral agreement with the 
host government (contained in the records of the United States 
Department of State) that recognizes the official status of the 
United States Government personnel present at the facility.

        each diplomatic facility or each diplomatic or consular 
        post composed of such facilities that is a priority for 
        replacement or for any major security enhancement 
        because of its vulnerability to terrorist attack (by 
        reason of the terrorist threat and the current 
        condition of the facility). The report shall list such 
        facilities in groups of 20. The groups shall be ranked

                identification criteria that emphasize the 
                threat of transnational terrorism and include

                 Subtitle C--People's Republic of China

SEC. 871. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Congress concurs in the conclusions of the 
        Department of State, as set forth in the Country 
        Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1998, on human 
        rights in the People's Republic of China in 1998 as 
        follows:
                    (A) ``The People's Republic of China (PRC) 
                is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese 
                Communist Party (CCP) is the paramount source 
                of power. . . . Citizens lack both the freedom 
                peacefully to express opposition to the party-
                led political system and the right to change 
                their national leaders or form of 
                government.''.
                    (B) ``The Government continued to commit 
                widespread and well-documented human rights 
                abuses, in violation of internationally 
                accepted norms. These abuses stemmed from the 
                authorities' very limited tolerance of public 
                dissent aimed at the Government, fear of 
                unrest, and the limited scope or inadequate 
                implementation of laws protecting basic 
                freedoms.''.
                    (C) ``Abuses included instances of 
                extrajudicial killings, torture and 
                mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, 
                arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy 
                incommunicado detention, and denial of due 
                process.''.
                    (D) ``Prison conditions at most facilities 
                remained harsh. . . . The Government infringed 
                on citizens' privacy rights. The Government 
                continued restrictions on freedom of speech and 
                of the press, and tightened these toward the 
                end of the year. The Government severely 
                restricted freedom of assembly, and continued 
                to restrict freedom of association, religion, 
                and movement.''.
                    (E) ``Discrimination against women, 
                minorities, and the disabled; violence against 
                women, including coercive family planning 
                practices--which sometimes include forced 
                abortion and forced sterilization; 
                prostitution, trafficking in women and 
                children, and the abuse of children all are 
                problems.''.
                    (F) ``The Government continued to restrict 
                tightly worker rights, and forced labor remains 
                a problem.''.
                    (G) ``Serious human rights abuses persisted 
                in minority areas, including Tibet and 
                Xinjiang, where restrictions on religion and 
                other fundamental freedoms intensified.''.
                    (H) ``Unapproved religious groups, 
                including Protestant and Catholic groups, 
                continued to experience varying degrees of 
                official interference and repression.''.
                    (I) ``Although the Government denies that 
                it holds political or religious prisoners, and 
                argues that all those in prison are 
                legitimately serving sentences for crimes under 
                the law, an unknown number of persons, 
                estimated at several thousand, are detained in 
                violation of international human rights 
                instruments for peacefully expressing their 
                political, religious, or social views.''.
            (2) In addition to the State Department, credible 
        press reports and human rights organizations have 
        documented an intense crackdown on political activists 
        by the Government of the People's Republic of China, 
        involving the harassment, detainment, arrest, and 
        imprisonment of dozens of activists.
            (3) The People's Republic of China, as a member of 
        the United Nations, is expected to abide by the 
        provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human 
        Rights.
            (4) The People's Republic of China is a party to 
        numerous international human rights conventions, 
        including the Convention Against Torture and Other 
        Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 
        and is a signatory to the International Covenant on 
        Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on 
        Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.

    CHAPTER 2--MATTERS RELATING TO THE CONTROL OF BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS

SEC. 1121. SHORT TITLE.

    This chapter may be cited as the ``National Security and 
Corporate Fairness under the Biological Weapons Convention 
Act''.

SEC. 1122. DEFINITIONS.

    In this chapter:
            (1) Biological weapons convention.--The term 
        ``Biological Weapons Convention'' means the 1972 
        Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
        Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological 
        (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their 
        Destruction.
            (2) Compliance protocol.--The term ``compliance 
        protocol'' means that segment of a bilateral or 
        multilateral agreement that enables investigation of 
        questions of compliance entailing written data or 
        visits to facilities to monitor compliance.
    (3) Industry.--The term ``industry'' means any corporate or 
private sector entity engaged in the research, development, 
production, import, and export of peaceful pharmaceuticals and 
bio-technological and related products.

SEC. 1123. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The threat of biological weapons and their 
        proliferation is one of the greatest national security 
        threats facing the United States.
            (2) The threat of biological weapons and materials 
        represents a serious and increasing danger to people 
        around the world.
            (3) Biological weapons are relatively inexpensive 
        to produce, can be made with readily available 
        expertise and equipment, do not require much space to 
        make and can therefore be readily concealed, do not 
        require unusual raw materials or materials not readily 
        available for legitimate purposes, do not require the 
        maintenance of stockpiles, or can be delivered with 
        low-technology mechanisms, and can effect widespread 
        casualties even in small quantities.
            (4) Unlike other weapons of mass destruction, 
        biological materials capable of use as weapons can 
        occur naturally in the environment and are also used 
        for medicinal or other beneficial purposes.
            (5) Biological weapons are morally reprehensible, 
        prompting the United States Government to halt its 
        offensive biological weapons program in 1969, 
        subsequently destroy its entire biological weapons 
        arsenal, and maintain henceforth only a robust 
        defensive capacity.
            (6) The Senate gave its advice and consent to 
        ratification of the Biological Weapons Convention in 
        1974.
            (7) The Director of the Arms Control and 
        Disarmament Agency explained, at the time of the 
        Senate's consideration of the Biological Weapons 
        Convention, that the treaty contained no verification 
        provisions because verification would be ``difficult''.
            (8) A compliance protocol has now been proposed to 
        strengthen the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.
            (9) The resources needed to produce, stockpile, and 
        store biological weapons are the same as those used in 
        peaceful industry facilities to discover, develop, and 
        produce medicines.
            (10) The raw materials of biological agents are 
        difficult to use as an indicator of an offensive 
        military program because the same materials occur in 
        nature or can be used to produce a wide variety of 
        products.
            (11) Some biological products are genetically 
        manipulated to develop new commercial products, 
        optimizing production and ensuring the integrity of the 
        product, making it difficult to distinguish between 
        legitimate commercial activities and offensive military 
        activities.
            (12) Only a small culture of a biological agent and 
        some growth medium are needed to produce a large amount 
        of biological agents with the potential for offensive 
        purposes.
            (13) The United States pharmaceutical and 
        biotechnology industries are a national asset and 
        resource that contribute to the health and well-beingof 
the American public as well as citizens around the world.
            (14) One bacterium strain can represent a large 
        proportion of a company's investment in a 
        pharmaceutical product and thus its potential loss 
        during an arms control monitoring activity could 
        conceivably be worth billions of dollars.
            (15) Biological products contain proprietary 
        genetic information.
            (16) The proposed compliance regime for the 
        Biological Weapons Convention entails new data 
        reporting and investigation requirements for industry.
            (17) A compliance regime which contributes to the 
        control of biological weapons and materials must have a 
        reasonable chance of success in reducing the risk of 
        production, stockpiling, or use of biological weapons 
        while protecting the reputations, intellectual 
        property, and confidential business information of

                 Subtitle D--Defense Offsets Disclosure

SEC. 1241. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Defense Offsets 
Disclosure Act of 1999''.

SEC. 1242. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A fair business environment is necessary to 
        advance international trade, economic stability, and 
        development worldwide, is beneficial for American 
        workers and businesses, and is in the United States 
        national interest.
            (2) In some cases, mandated offset requirements can 
        cause economic distortions in international defense 
        trade and undermine fairness and competitiveness, and 
        may cause particular harm to small- and medium-sized 
        businesses.
            (3) The use of offsets may lead to increasing 
        dependence on foreign suppliers for the production of 
        United States weapons systems.
            (4) The offset demands required by some purchasing 
        countries, including some close allies of the United 
        States, equal or exceed the value of the base contract 
        they are intended to offset, mitigating much of the 
        potential economic benefit of the exports.
            (5) Offset demands often unduly distort the prices 
        of defense contracts.
            (6) In some cases, United States contractors are 
        required to provide indirect offsets which can 
        negatively impact nondefense industrial sectors.
            (7) Unilateral efforts by the United States to 
        prohibit offsets may be impractical in the current era 
        of globalization and would severely hinder the 
        competitiveness of the United States defense industry 
        in the global market.
            (8) The development of global standards to manage 
        and restrict demands for offsets would enhance United 
        States efforts to mitigate the negative impact of 
        offsets.
    (b) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of the United 
States to monitor the use of offsets in international defense 
trade, to promote fairness in such trade, and to ensure that 
foreign participation in the production of United States 
weapons systems does not harm the economy of the United States.

        States and its trading partners and competitors;
            (2) the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of 
        State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States 
        Trade Representative, or their designees, should raise 
        with other industrialized nations at every suitable 
        venue the need for transparency and reasonable 
        standards to govern the role of offsets in 
        international defense trade;
            (3) the United States Government should enter into 
        discussions regarding the establishment of multilateral 
        standards for the use of offsets in international 
        defense trade through the appropriate multilateral 
        fora, including such organizations as the Transatlantic

        8, and the World Trade Organization; and
            (4) the United States Government, in entering into 
        the discussions described in paragraph (3), should take 
        into account the distortions produced by the provision 
        of other benefits and subsidies, such as export 
        financing, by various countries to support defense 
        trade.

        the United States to private entities.
            (2) In very exceptional circumstances, when the

        proposed retransfer and end-use, such requests may be 
        favorably considered.
            (3) Such retransfers to private entities have been 
        authorized in very exceptional circumstances following 
        appropriate demilitarization and receipt of assurances 
        from the private entity that the item to be transferred 
        would be used solely in furtherance of Federal 
        Government contracts or for static museum display.
            (4) Nothing in this section should be construed as 
        a revision of long-standing policy referred to in 
        paragraph (1).
            (5) The Government of Greece has requested the 
        consent of the United States Government to the 
        retransfer of HS Rodos (ex-U.S.S. Bowman County (LST 
        391)) to the USS LST Ship Memorial, Inc.

        Government of Greece of HS Rodos (ex-U.S.S. Bowman 
        County (LST 391)) to the USS LST Ship Memorial, Inc.
            (2) Conditions for consent.--The President should 
        not exercise the authority under paragraph (1) unless 
        USS LST Memorial, Inc.--
                    (A) utilizes the vessel for public, 
                nonprofit, museum-related purposes; and
                    (B) complies with applicable law with 
                respect to the vessel, including law related to 
                demilitarization of guns prior to transfer and 
                to facilitation of Federal Government 
                monitoring and mitigation of potential 
                environmental hazards associated with aging

        State shall ensure that--
                    (A) United States national security 
                considerations and United States obligations 
                under the Missile Technology Control Regime are

        to its effectiveness at promoting national security and 
        economic competitiveness.

SEC. 1310. STUDY ON LICENSING PROCESS UNDER THE ARMS EXPORT CONTROL 
                    ACT.

    (a) Study.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State should submit to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the 
Committee on International Relations of the House of 
Representatives a study on the performance of the licensing

    (b) Contents.--The study should include the following:
            (1) An analysis of the typology of licenses on 
        which action was completed in 1999. The analysis should 
        provide information on major categories of license 
        requests, including--
                    (A) the number for nonautomatic small arms, 
                automatic small arms, technical data, parts and 
                components, and other weapons;
                    (B) the percentage of each category staffed 
                to other agencies;
                    (C) the average and median time taken for 
                the processing cycle for each category when 
                staffed and not staffed;
                    (D) the average time taken by Presidential 
                or National Security Council review or 
                scrutiny, if significant; and
                    (E) the average time spent at the 
                Department of State after a decision had been 
                taken on a license but before a contractor was 
                notified of the decision.
        For each major category of license requests under this 
        paragraph, the study should include a breakdown of 
        licenses by country and the identity of each country 
        that has been identified in the past three years 
        pursuant to section 3(e) of the Arms Export Control Act 
        (22 U.S.C. 2753(e)).
            (2) A review of the current computer capabilities 
        of the Department of State relevant to the processing 
        of licenses and its capability to communicate 
        electronically with other agencies and contractors, and 
        what improvements could be made that would speed the 
        process, including the cost for such improvements.
            (3) An analysis of the work load and salary 
        structure for export licensing officers of the Office 
        of Defense Trade Controls of the Department of State as 
        compared to comparable jobs at the Department of 
        Commerce and the Department of Defense.
            (4) Any suggestions of the Department of State 
        relating to resources and regulations, and any relevant 
        statutory changes that might expedite the licensing 
        process while furthering the objectives of the Arms 
        Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.).

SEC. 1311. REPORT CONCERNING PROLIFERATION OF SMALL ARMS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit 
to the appropriate committees of Congress a report containing--
            (1) an assessment of whether the global trade in 
        small arms poses any proliferation problems, 
        including--
                    (A) estimates of the numbers and sources of 
                licit and illicit small arms and light arms in 
                circulation and their origins;
                    (B) the challenges associated with

                States interests, including national security 
                interests;
            (2) an assessment of whether the export of small 
        arms of the type sold commercially in the United States 
        should be considered a foreign policy or proliferation 
        issue;
            (3) a description and analysis of the adequacy of 
        current Department of State activities to monitor and, 
        to the extent possible, ensure adequate control of,

                    (D) the functions of the Under Secretary of 
                State for Arms Control and International 
                Security pertaining to small arms and light 
                weapons; and
                    (E) the functions of the scientific and 
                policy advisory board on arms control, 
                nonproliferation, and disarmament pertaining to 
                small arms and light weapons; and

under the heading ``International Commissions'' for fiscal 
years 2000 and 2001.

                    MIGRATION AND REFUGEE ASSISTANCE

      Section 103 authorizes $750,000,000 for each of fiscal 
years 2000-2001. Where local expertise is unavailable, the rape 
counseling provided for in this provision should be provided 
through international organizations, U.S.-based non-
governmental organizations, nonprofit organizations, or health 
organizations and should be culturally appropriate and could be 
part of a comprehensive program of assistance aimed at 
reintegrating these women into their communities or resettling 
them elsewhere as appropriate.

    UNITED STATES INFORMATIONAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND CULTURAL PROGRAMS

      Section 104 authorizes $112,000,000 in fiscal year 2000 
and $120,000,000 in fiscal year 2001 for Fulbright Exchanges, 
and $98,329,000 in fiscal year 2000 and $105,000,000 in fiscal 
year 2001 for other educational and cultural programs. In 
addition, the bill includes certain earmarks.
Arab-Israeli Peace Partners Program
      This section includes an earmark for the Arab Israeli 
Peace Partners program. The program is intended to reach out to 
new groups of people who can influence and improve mutual 
understanding in the Middle East. The program is to include 
participants from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Arab 
countries and the United States. The focus of the program is 
the promotion of mutual understanding and conflict resolution. 
The Arab-Israeli Peace Partners program should include college 
and graduate students, as well as leaders and public policy 
advocates in various professions. Professionals in the fields 
of primary and high school education, administration of 
justice, journalism, communications, government, health, 
environment, technology, law or other community leaders are of 
particular importance. These people have the ability to reach 
out to other networks of people who can benefit from their 
experience.
      Grouping these exchanges by profession can stimulate 
like-minded individuals who have common ground for interaction 
to pursue other significant issues relevant to a more lasting 
peace process. The managers draw particular attention to the 
Seeds of Peace, an innovative and widely respected organization 
that helps Arab and Israeli teenagers overcome prejudice and 
build positive relationships. This has been a successful 
undertaking that focuses on future leaders. The Arab-Israeli 
program will provide those currently in the workforce or soon 
to enter with tools to establish the common ground for peaceful 
coexistence in the region.
Vietnam Fulbright Program
      This section also authorizes $4,000,000 for each of 
fiscal years 2000-2001 for the Vietnam Fulbright Program. The 
current lack of political and religious freedom in Vietnam 
raises concerns. However, exchange programs of this nature, 
which provide educational opportunities and exposure to 
American institutions and values, can be important tools in 
hastening the transition of countries like Vietnam into free 
and open societies. However, the Vietnamese Government does not 
select the participants in this program and any Vietnamese 
citizen can apply for admission to this program.
      The State Department is expected to continue to ensure 
that opportunities to participate in the program are made 
available to all qualified applicants and to administer this 
program under the guidelines set out in section 102 of the 
Human Rights, Refugee, and Other Foreign Provisions Act of 1996 
(Public Law 104-319), as modified in this Act. The success of 
the Vietnam Fulbright Program and similar programs in like 
countries will be marked by the extent of progress toward 
freedom and democracy. The appropriate Congressional committees 
will continue to monitor this program to evaluate its impact on 
such progress.

                     GRANTS TO THE ASIA FOUNDATION

      Section 105 authorizes $15,000,000 in appropriations 
under the heading ``The Asia Foundation'' for fiscal years 2000 
and 2001.

              CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

      Section 106 authorizes $940,000,000 in appropriations for 
fiscal year 2000 and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal 
year 2001 under the heading ``Contributions to International 
Organizations (CIO)'', and includes the following conditions:
No Growth Budget
      Of the funds authorized, subsection (b) makes available 
$80,000,000 on an annual basis only when the Secretary of State 
certifies to the Congress that no action has been taken by the 
United Nations to increase the United Nations 1998-99 budget of 
$2,533,000,000 during that period without finding an offset 
elsewhere in the United Nations budget during that period.
Inspector General
      Of the funds authorized, subsection (c) withholds 20 
percent of the funds made available for the United Nations 
until the Secretary of State certifies that the Office of 
Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) continues to function as an 
independent inspector general. This section requires the 
Director of the OIOS to report directly to the Secretary 
General on the adequacy of his resources and a certification by 
the Secretary of State that the OIOS has the authority to 
audit, inspect, or investigate each program, project or 
activity funded by the United Nations, and each Executive Board 
created under the United Nations has been notified of that 
authority. With regard to the distribution of reports required 
by this provision, what is essential is that the United States 
(and other Member States) have access to all annual and other 
relevant reports without modification, except to the extent it 
is necessary to protect the privacy rights of individuals. When 
privacy rights are impacted, the reports may be redacted to 
protect individuals. However, it is not anticipated that 
wrongdoers cited in such reports would be entitled to privacy 
protections.
Prohibition on Certain U.N. Global Conferences
      Of the funds authorized, subsection (d) prohibits U.S. 
funding of U.N. global conferences, except that it exempts 
conferences that were approved by the United Nations prior to 
October 1, 1998. The U.N. Global Conferences referred to in 
this section are those organized on a one-time basis with 
universal participation to address a single subject, such as 
the environment or population, outside of the normal course of 
regularly scheduled deliberations by existing U.N. bodies. For 
example, this section would have applied to the Rio Earth 
Summit, the Beijing Women's Conference, or the Habitat 
Conference. Should the U.N. schedule a conference of this kind 
during the two fiscal years under this Act, the United States 
will not fund such a conference nor any arrears related to such 
a conference. This section does not include conferences 
directed to the achievement of a binding international 
agreement, or other legal instrument, on a particular matter 
(such as the negotiation on the control and elimination of 
anti-personnel land mines in the U.N. Conference on anti-
personnel land mines in the U.N. Conference on Conventional 
Weapons and the U.N. Conference on Disarmament).
Prohibition on Funding Organizations Other Than the United Nations From 
        the United Nations Regular Budget
      Of the funds authorized, subsection (e) prohibits the 
U.S. contribution to the United Nations regular budget from 
being used to fund the operating cost of organizations that 
have been established through a framework treaty. Such 
organizations are those established under separate treaties of 
a framework nature, composed only of parties to the treaties, 
having their own secretariats. This term does not include U.N. 
human rights treaty bodies. Should any framework treaty 
organization be funded out of the regular budget, the provision 
will require that the U.S. withhold from it U.S. assessment to 
the U.N. budget the United States share of the amount budgeted 
for such organizations.

        CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES

      Section 107 authorizes appropriation of $500,000,000 in 
fiscal year 2000 and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal 
year 2001 for assessed contributions to international 
peacekeeping activities under United Nations auspices.

         VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

      Section 108 authorizes $293,000,000 in fiscal year 2000 
and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2001 with 
certain limitations. Although the section does not include an 
earmark for a grant to UNICEF for fiscal year 2001, it is 
expected that such a grant should be made in the amount of at 
least $110,000,000.

          UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING ACTIVITIES

      Section 121 authorizes $385,900,000 in fiscal year 2000 
and $393,618,000 in fiscal year 2001 for international 
broadcasting activities; $20,868,000 in fiscal year 2000 and 
$20,868,000 for fiscal year 2001 broadcasting capital 
improvements; $22,743,000 in fiscal year 2000 and $22,743,000 
in fiscal year 2001 for Broadcasting to Cuba, and $24,000,000 
in fiscal year 2000, and $30,000,000 in fiscal year 2001 for 
Radio Free Asia. Although it does not contain a further 
limitation for Radio and TV Marti, some note that there is 
increasing evidence that the Cuban dictatorship has intensified 
its efforts at disrupting the broadcasts of Radio Marti and TV 
Marti and now is receiving additional assistance toward this 
end from Chinese military and technical experts. It is expected 
that all possible efforts will be taken by the Broadcasting 
Board of Governors and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting to 
overcome these attempts, including the development and 
implementation of new technology and enhancement of current 
methods to strengthen and improve the transmission capabilities 
of Radio Marti and TV Marti.
      In addition, the Broadcasting Board of Governors should 
provide an update of the status of all lawsuits brought against 
the Voice of America (VOA) regarding minorities and women, and 
VOA's efforts in the area of minority recruitment. A written 
description of these issues should be provided to the 
appropriate committees by February 1, 2000.

             Department of State Authorities and Activities

                      OFFICE OF CHILDREN'S ISSUES

      Section 201 requires the State Department to make several 
changes with regard to its handling of international parental 
abduction and other children's issues. The section requires 
that: (1) the Director of the office is an individual of senior 
rank who can ensure long-term continuity to the office; (2) the 
staffing levels of the office include sufficient caseworkers so 
that the average caseload is 75; (3) each embassy designate a 
point of contact on parental abduction issues and the director 
of the office must regularly inform the contact of cases in 
that country and (4) parents are regularly informed of the 
status of pending cases. This office has been understaffed in 
the past, and more effort should be devoted to assisting 
parents to obtain the return of, or access to, their wrongfully 
abducted children. The issues of this office are not receiving 
adequate priority in diplomatic efforts by the United States--
particularly in countries which have ratified the Hague 
Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction (like Austria, Germany and Sweden) but are not 
implementing fully their commitments under the treaty. Those 
countries should be encouraged to establish organizations like 
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to 
assist with treaty implementation.

   STRENGTHENING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON THE CIVIL 
                ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION

      Section 202 extends and supplements existing reporting 
requirement for fiscal years 2000-2001. The report by the 
Secretary of State submitted in April 1999 pursuant to Section 
2803(a) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 
1998 (as enacted by division G of the Omnibus Consolidated and 
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999; Public Law 
105-277) on compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil 
Aspects of International Child Abduction failed to provide 
information consistent with the intent of the Congress to have 
a full accounting of cases of violations of, and a listing of 
countries that are non-compliant with, the Convention. 
Specifically, the report's finding that there are only 58 cases 
unresolved after 18 months, which fails to mention the country 
involved, renders the report almost useless. While stipulating 
that this listing of unresolved cases does not include those 
cases considered closed by the U.S. government, the report 
fails to include the criteria by which the decision to close a 
case is made.
      This provision extends the reporting requirement to 
fiscal years 2000 and 2001, and expands the scope of the report 
in order to elicit information that will adequately inform 
parents and judges involved in custody cases where there is a 
significant possibility that a child could be removed by a non-
custodial parent to a country which contains a record of non-
compliance with the Hague Convention. The new information that 
the Congress is requesting is intended to highlight the 
probability that an abducted, or wrongfully retained, child can 
be reasonably expected to be returned from a country that is a 
party to the Hague Convention based on its past record of 
compliance, and whether access to a child, either through the 
orders of that country's courts, or through U.S. court orders, 
has been enforced by the government concerned in the past.

                  REPORT CONCERNING ATTACK IN CAMBODIA

      Section 203 requires reports by the Secretary in 
consultation with the Attorney General, regarding the 
investigation of the March 30, 1997 grenade attack in Cambodia.

                       INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITIONS

      Section 204 does the following: (a) requires periodic 
reports to the Congress from the commissioners general of major 
United States pavilions or exhibits; (b) requires advance 
notification to the relevant committees before the Department 
of State obligates funds which may be made available by another 
agency of the United States to the Department of State for a 
major United States pavilion or exhibit; (c) clarifies that, 
absent express authorization and appropriation, the support 
that the Department of State may provide for major pavilions or 
exhibits under section 102(a)(3) of the Mutual Education and 
Cultural Exchange Act shall be for administrative purposes only 
(such as contract administration, legal and other advice, and 
similar support) and not for operating or capital expenses; (d) 
amends the general prohibition against the obligation of ``any 
funds'' by the State Department for non-expressly-authorized 
major United States pavilions or exhibits to apply only to 
funds appropriated to the State Department; and (e) makes 
certain other technical changes. The reprogramming procedures 
will apply to notifications under subsection (c) of this 
section.
The United States Exhibition in Hannover, Germany
      Recent reports suggest that sufficient private funds have 
not been raised to construct or operate the United States 
pavilion at the forthcoming Hannover, Germany international 
exposition. A clear policy has been in effect for years that 
taxpayer funds should not be used for the construction and 
operation of such pavilions. Despite that policy, commitments 
have been made to construct an elaborate pavilion at Hannover, 
even though privately raised funds areinsufficient and there 
has been no formal request for an authorization of appropriations. 
There is reason to be concerned that public funds may be informally 
requested to construct and operate a pavilion outside normal budgetary 
processes, as apparently occurred in the case of the Lisbon pavilion in 
1998. The Administration should address these concerns in the immediate 
future in communications to the relevant committees.

  RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AID INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE INTER-AMERICAN 
           FOUNDATION AND THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION

      Section 205 gives to the Inspector General of the United 
States Agency for International Development (USAID) the 
responsibility for the supervision, direction, and control of 
all audits and investigative activities relating to the 
programs and operations of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) 
and the African Development Foundation (ADF). In the interest 
of ensuring the independent operations of the Inspector 
General, and that audits and investigations not be dependent 
upon the availability of funds to the IAF and the ADF, it was 
decided not to include a provision mandating that the IAF and 
ADF reimburse the Inspector General for all costs incurred with 
regard to audits and investigations of programs and activities 
of those agencies. Nonetheless, any such costs shall be 
reimbursed to the IG at the IG's request.

                    REPORT ON CUBAN DRUG TRAFFICKING

      Section 206 requires the Secretary of State to report on 
the extent of international narcotics traffic through Cuba, the 
extent of involvement by the Cuban Government, its agents and 
entities, and United States actions to investigate or prosecute 
such acts. The report may include an assessment of the 
credibility of the information, in which case it shall also 
include a statement of the reasons for such assessment. The 
section provides for a classified annex in order to ensure that 
the inclusion of information in the report will not compromise 
ongoing investigations. The exclusion from the unclassified 
report of ``matters occurring before the grand jury'' within 
the meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) will be 
governed by the Rule to the same extent as the Rule would 
govern disclosure of such material to the public, and inclusion 
of such material in the classified annex shall be subject to 
the Rule to the same extent as the Rule would govern the 
sharing of such material among attorneys for the government. 
Information in the possession of the government which is 
subsequently given to a grand jury does not thereby 
automatically become grand jury material within the meaning of 
the Rule, although other considerations, such as protecting 
from disclosure the identities or testimony of witnesses, or 
information which would reveal the strategy or direction of an 
active investigation, is also protected by the Rule.

                   REVISION OF REPORTING REQUIREMENT

      Section 207 reduces the frequency of a current reporting 
requirement regarding Iraq.

                      FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY

      Section 208 requires an annual report to Congress 
containing data showing how many overseas positions are filled 
by language-qualified personnel. This reporting requirement 
replaces an analogous reporting provision in Section 304(c) of 
the Foreign Service Act of 1980.

                 CONTINUATION OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

      Section 209 extends certain reports for fiscal years 
2000-2001. In addition, the provision preserves certain reports 
that would otherwise be sunsetted by legislation enacted in 
1995 repealing a number of reports government-wide.

    JOINT FUNDS UNDER AGREEMENTS FOR COOPERATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL, 
                 SCIENTIFIC, CULTURAL AND RELATED AREAS

      Section 210 allows the State Department to use the 
interest earned on funds held under bilateral agreements for 
scientific, cultural, and technical cooperation to pay the 
programmatic and administrative expenses of these programs.

                  REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL EXTRADITION

      Section 211 requires a report by the Secretary of State 
120 days after enactment regarding a review of all extradition 
treaties and agreements to which the U.S. is a party.

                          Consular Authorities

                         MACHINE READABLE VISAS

      Section 231 authorizes the collection and use of fees for 
up to $316,715,000 for each of fiscal years 2000-2002; fees 
collected above that amount are subject to reprogramming 
procedures.

                 FEES RELATING TO AFFIDAVITS OF SUPPORT

      Section 232 allows the Secretary of State to charge a fee 
for services provided by the State Department for assistance in 
the preparation and filing of an affidavit of support as 
required by section 213A of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act.

                             PASSPORT FEES

      Section 233 repeals an anachronistic provision of the 
Passport Act of 1920 that provided for the discretionary refund 
of passport fees in the event that a traveler was not able to 
obtain a visa to the country of intended travel. That 
authority, which reflects long-outmoded passport practices, is 
no longer used. According to statistics provided by the 
Department of State, approximately twenty-eight percent of the 
passport fee refunds during fiscal year 1998 were to applicants 
determined to be non-citizens or otherwise ineligible to 
receive passports.Approximately ten percent were to persons who 
withdrew their applications, and about fifty percent of the refunds 
were to persons who may have been citizens but who were unable to 
provide acceptable documentation of their citizenship. Applicants in 
the latter category typically provided documents unacceptable to the 
Department, such as birth certificates provided by a hospital, and were 
deemed to have abandoned their cases after failing to respond to 
requests for supplementary documentation. The regulations described in 
this subsection will provide for the reinstatement or revival of 
applications without payment of an additional fee, where the 
application has been denied on the sole ground of inadequate 
documentation and such documentation is subsequently provided.

          DEATHS AND ESTATES OF UNITED STATES CITIZENS ABROAD

      Section 234 repeals section 1709 of the Revised Statutes 
(22 U.S.C. 4195) and replaces it with new provisions in the 
State Department Basic Authorities Act to provide a modified 
statutory basis for the traditional consular function of 
protection and conservation, and ultimately disposition, of the 
estates of Americans who die outside the United States in those 
cases where a legal representative is not appointed by the 
heirs or other beneficiaries within a reasonable time.

  DUTIES OF CONSULAR OFFICERS REGARDING MAJOR DISASTERS AND INCIDENTS 
                ABROAD AFFECTING UNITED STATES CITIZENS

      Section 235 expands the definition of U.S. employees who 
may perform consular functions in connection with deaths and 
estates of U.S. citizens abroad.

            ISSUANCE OF PASSPORTS FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE 14

      Section 236 requires the Secretary to issue regulations 
so that children under the age of 14 may be issued a passport 
only if both parents or the child's legal guardian execute the 
necessary documents, or a parent or guardian demonstrates sole 
custody or consent of the other parent or guardian. The 
Secretary may by regulation provide for exceptions to this 
requirement in the event of exigent or special family 
circumstances. These exceptions are not designed to become, in 
practice, gaping loopholes that would swallow the new rule 
created by this section. Rather, they are designed to provide 
flexibility to the Secretary in appropriate cases.

                    PROCESSING OF VISA APPLICATIONS

      Section 237 states that it shall be the policy of the 
State Department: (a) to process visa applications of immediate 
relatives and fiances of U.S. citizens within 30 days of 
receiving all necessary documents; and (b) to process 
applications sponsored by someone other than an immediate 
relative within 60 days. It also directs the Department to 
report every six months on the extent to which it is meeting 
these standards, and to establish a joint task force with other 
Federal agencies to reduce the overall processing time for visa 
applications.

 FEASIBILITY STUDY ON FURTHER PASSPORT RESTRICTIONS ON INDIVIDUALS IN 
                        ARREARS ON CHILD SUPPORT

      Section 238 requires the Secretary report on the costs 
and benefits of a reduction to $2,500 from $5,000 the amount of 
arrears for child support that would trigger a denial of a 
passport under existing law (sec. 452(k) of the Social Security 
Act).

                                Refugees

   UNITED STATES POLICY REGARDING THE INVOLUNTARY RETURN OF REFUGEES

      Section 251 carries over and slightly expands a provision 
of the Fiscal Year 1998-99 Foreign Relations Authorization Act 
prohibiting the use of funds for the involuntary return of any 
person to a country in which that person has a well-founded 
fear of persecution, and requiring notification to Congress 
when such funds are used for involuntary repatriation of 
persons deemed to be non-refugees.

                          HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTS

      Section 252 is a technical amendment. Information in the 
annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices on the extent 
to which countries extend protection to refugees is already 
required by the Human Rights, Refugee, and Other Foreign 
Relations Provisions Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-319). However, that 
statute only modified one of the two provisions in the Foreign 
Assistance Act dealing with the Country Reports. This section 
corrects that oversight by modifying the other section.

                GUIDELINES FOR REFUGEE PROCESSING POSTS

      Section 253 corrects two technical oversights in the 
refugee protection provisions of the International Religious 
Freedom Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-292). Although section 602(c) of 
the Act charged both the Attorney General and the Secretary of 
State to develop guidelines to address hostile biases in 
refugee processing, it referred only to biases of INS 
personnel. This section adds a reference to State Department 
personnel in the appropriate place. In addition, the Act 
prohibited the use of agents of persecuting governments to 
interpret conversations of persons seeking asylum in the United 
States. This section extends that prohibition to the overseas 
refugee adjudication process, and to agents of persecuting 
governments performing any function that could endanger the 
safety of the applicant or otherwise compromise the integrity 
of the process.

                 GENDER RELATED PERSECUTION TASK FORCE

      Section 254 requires the Secretary to establish the task 
force in consultation with the Attorney General with the goal 
of determining eligibility guidelines for women seeking refugee 
status overseas due to gender-related persecution.

                          VIETNAMESE REFUGEES

      An earlier House-passed provision regarding refugees was 
not included in this bill on the basis of assurances that U.S. 
refugee programs in Viet Nam will be conducted in accordance 
with most of the conditions set forth in section 274 of the 
House bill. Section 255, however, contains a provision designed 
to address one of the issues addressed by section 274. It 
extends through fiscal 2001 the McCain Amendment, which 
restores eligibility for U.S. refugee resettlement to certain 
sons and daughters of Vietnamese re-education camp survivors, 
and also provides such eligibility for sons and daughters who 
were denied the right to resettle in the United States because 
their government-issued residency documents did not prove 
``continuous coresidency'' with their parents.
      The Administration's decision that refugee programs in 
Viet Nam (as well as other closely related programs) will be 
directed by a Refugee Coordinator who will report directly to 
the Deputy Principal Officer at the Consulate General in Saigon 
and receive policy guidance from the Assistant Secretary for 
Population, Refugees, and Migration is appreciated. It is also 
important that these programs will use expatriate interpreters 
and case workers, so that refugee applicants will no longer be 
required to describe their persecution at the hands of the 
Vietnamese government in the presence of persons employed by or 
through that same government. The Administration's plan to send 
a special team of INS officers, similar in composition and 
training to the teams that adjudicated the ROVR cases, to 
interview former United States Government employees who have 
not yet been interviewed, and to use the results of these 
interviews in deciding whether to reopen the cases of former 
USG employees who may have been improperly denied is strongly 
supported.
      It is encouraging that the Department of State intends to 
contract with a non-governmental organization with expertise in 
refugee resettlement for the retention of an ``NGO Advisor'' to 
assist the Refugee Coordinator and to help ensure transparency 
in our Vietnamese refugee programs. It remains a matter of deep 
concern that the Department decided to terminate its Joint 
Voluntary Agency (JVA) contract with the International Catholic 
Migration Commission, which was the most refugee-friendly 
component in the old ODP program. Members of Congress will 
continue to monitor carefully whether the new ``Refugee 
Resettlement Unit'' is an adequate substitute. If not, Members 
of Congress will urge the Department to reinstitute a JVA 
arrangement for our Vietnamese refugee programs. The 
Administration's position that U.S. refugee programs should 
focus primarily on identifying and rescuing persons who have 
recently been persecuted and/or who are at risk of future 
persecution rather than those who suffered persecution in the 
distant past is supported. The guidelines prepared by the 
Department and the INS for the new in-country refugee program 
in Viet Nam will be a solid basis for such a program provided 
they are generously interpreted and applied. Assurances were 
made that this program will not be limited to a few ``high 
profile'' cases, but will be implemented so as to identify and 
offer resettlement to any Vietnamese national who can show that 
he or she has experienced recent persecution or has a well-
founded fear of future persecution on account of race, 
religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a 
particular social group.
      There is strong support for the view that the focus on 
the new program cannot justify peremptory treatment of 
applicants who may have been wrongly denied under existing 
programs, or who may never have had genuine access to such 
programs. The new program is strongly supported on its merits, 
but it is also important for the United States to keep its 
promises, both express and implied. The Administration's 
assurance that Montagnard combat veterans who fulfill the 
requirements for the ``HO'' subprogram of the Orderly Departure 
Program (ODP)--which include at least three years of detention 
in ``re-education camps''--will no longer be denied 
resettlement on the sole ground that in addition to their pre-
1975 military service, they continued to fight the Communists 
after 1975 is encouraging. These applicants have been rejected 
on the ground that their subsequent punishment by the 
Communists must have been solely on account of their post-1975 
activities rather than for their wartime service alongside U.S. 
forces. The Administration's commitment to review the cases of 
Montagnards who were previously registered for consideration 
for refugee resettlement but found not qualified for interview 
because part or all of their reeducation time was judged not to 
be associated with pre-1975 U.S. government policies or 
practices is a positive development. The Administration has 
agreed to implement this review not only for Montagnards who 
applied on or before the ODP deadline and have not yet been 
interviewed, but also for any previously registered Montagnards 
who contact the State Department and request review of their 
cases during a specified period of time. It is understood and 
expected that the specified period of time will be 
approximately one year beginning on or about January 1, 2000.
      Note has been taken of the Administration's agreement 
with respect to allied combat veterans whose detention began a 
few days prior to April 30, 1975 (the date of the fall of 
Saigon) because they were located in places such as Hue or Da 
Nang, which fell to the Communists before Saigon. These 
veterans have been wrongfully rejected on the ground that they 
were ``prisoners of war'' rather than re-education camp 
inmates. The Administration has agreed not to apply this rule 
against any applicants who applied on or before the ODP 
deadline and not yet interviewed. The Administration is urged 
to reconsider its decision not to review and reverse previous 
denials based on this hypertechnical rule.
      The undertaking by the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service (INS) to promulgate written guidance 
with respect to requests for reconsideration and/or reopening 
of denied refugee applications is appreciated. It is understood 
that the INS will issue guidelines which will assure that each 
applicant understands why his or her case was denied, both in 
the initial adjudication and in the event of a denial of a 
request for reconsideration or reopening, and that will ensure 
transparent and fair adjudication of such requests. It is 
expected that these guidelines will resolve various cases in 
which reconsideration has been denied although the original 
denial was clearly contrary to the interest of justice. 
Examples of such cases include those in which the adjudicator 
found that a family relationship was not proved, but in which 
the relationship can now be established by DNA tests; in which 
the denial was based on doubts about the validity of a document 
and in which the applicant can subsequently provide extrinsic 
evidence of the validity of the document; and in which an 
applicant recounts instances of persecution which would 
establish a prima facie case for refugee status, but which he 
or she was unwilling or unable to recount in the presence of an 
interpreter whom the applicant reasonably believed to be an 
agent of the persecuting government.
      Finally, many members of Congress strongly disagree with 
the Administration's refusal to reopen cases of applicants who 
missed the deadline for the ODP and ROVR programs due to 
circumstances beyond their control. According to refugee 
advocates, many of the people whomissed the 1994 ODP deadline, 
including Montagnards in remote areas of the Central Highlands as well 
as re-education camp survivors who had been sentenced to internal exile 
in equally remote New Economic Zones, had no way of knowing about the 
deadline. Others were denied access to the program by brutal and/or 
corrupt local officials. Many of these people suffered terribly for 
their wartime associations with the United States. They then heeded our 
admonitions not to leave Viet Nam illegally by land or sea, choosing 
instead to wait patiently for their turn to resettle in the United 
States. The recent normalization of the U.S.-Viet Nam diplomatic 
relationship should have been used as an opportunity to get access to 
these people. Similarly, some Vietnamese asylum seekers appear to have 
been effectively prevented from signing up for ROVR because they were 
detained away from the registration sites. Others appear to have been 
misinformed about the ROVR criteria, or even denied the right to 
register, by host country officials who were themselves misinformed 
about the program. Some refugees in Thailand were even threatened with 
punishment upon return to Vietnam by an official Vietnamese delegation 
visiting their camp for the ostensible purpose of encouraging return 
under the ROVR program. Many members of Congress continue to believe 
that the Administration should consider on the merits all cases of 
eligible applicants who missed program deadlines for these and other 
compelling reasons.

         Organization and Personnel of the Department of State

                          ORGANIZATION MATTERS

         LEGISLATIVE LIAISON OFFICES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE

      Section 301 requires the Department of State to develop a 
plan for establishing legislative liaison offices for the 
Department that would be based on Capitol Hill.

           STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FOR NORTHEASTERN EUROPE

      Section 302 requires the designation of a senior official 
from within the State Department to coordinate U.S. policy with 
regard to Northeastern Europe.

          SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ADVISER TO SECRETARY OF STATE

      Section 303 requires the Secretary to designate a science 
and technology adviser with relevant experience within the 
Department of State.

         APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LAWS TO PUBLIC DIPLOMACY FUNDS

      Section 304 rewrites section 1333(c) of the Foreign 
Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, to ensure that 
statutory restrictions on the use of public diplomacy funds 
will continue to apply either if funds are specifically 
authorized, or if funds are notified in a Congressional 
Presentation Document or reprogrammed for public diplomacy 
purposes. As this division does not include a separate 
authorization for public diplomacy funds. The substitute also 
reiterates that these restrictions will not impede the 
integration of USIA into the Department of State.
      Specifically, this section amends section 1333 so that 
the Smith-Mundt and Zorinsky provisions will apply to all funds 
identified as public diplomacy funds in the Department's 
Congressional Presentation Document (CPD) or in any 
reprogramming of funds for public diplomacy purposes. The 
amendment also adds a new paragraph on construction of the 
provision. In particular, it provides that the provisions of 
section 1333(c) do not supersede existing reprogramming 
procedures. This provision is intended only to make clear that 
if, subsequent to the submission of the CPD, the Administration 
submits a reprogramming notification in accordance with the 
procedures that apply to a reprogramming of funds under section 
34 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act, funds 
reprogrammed pursuant to such a notification for purposes other 
than public diplomacy will not be subject to the Smith-Mundt 
and Zorinsky restrictions on account of their previous 
identification as public diplomacy funds in a CPD.

          DIPLOMATIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROGRAM OFFICE

      Section 305 authorizes $18 million for enhancement of 
Diplomatic Telecommunications Service capabilities to be 
available until a comprehensive chargeback system is in place. 
In addition the provision requires the Diplomatic 
Telecommunications Service Program Office (DTS-PO) to: 1) 
ensure that enhancements of telecommunications capabilities be 
done with a priority on national security interests; 2) 
terminate leases for satellite systems located at posts in 
criteria countries be done not later than December 31, 1999, 
unless certain conditions are met; 3) institute a system of 
charges for utilization of bandwidth, and a chargeback system 
to recover the costs of telecommunications services provided to 
other federal agencies; 4) ensure that DTS-PO policies and 
procedures comply with those established by the Overseas 
Security Policy Board; and 5) maintain the allocation of the 
positions of Director and Deputy Director of DTS-PO as assigned 
as of June 1, 1999. Finally, it requires a report by the 
Director and Deputy Director of DTS-PO regarding the plan for 
improving specific communications capabilities.

                  Personnel of the Department of State

                    AWARDS OF FOREIGN SERVICE STARS

      Section 321 modifies the State Department Basic 
Authorities Act of 1956 to create the Foreign Service Star 
award. The Foreign Service Star may be awarded by the President 
to any member of the Foreign Service or other federal employee 
who is wounded, injured, or contracts an illness while employed 
in an official capacity overseas. The Secretary of State will 
determine the procedures for awarding the Foreign Service Star, 
as well as selecting those to be recommended for the award. 
Flexibility is provided to the Secretary as to the date of the 
incident for which the award is being given.

                  UNITED STATES CITIZENS HIRED ABROAD

      Section 322 deletes a statutory requirement that U.S. 
citizens hired locally by overseas posts be provided a total 
compensation package that has ``the equivalent cost to that 
received byforeign national employees occupying the similar 
position at post.''

    LIMITATION ON PERCENTAGE OF SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE ELIGIBLE FOR 
                            PERFORMANCE PAY

      Section 323 reduces the percentage of members of the 
senior Foreign Service who can receive performance pay in a 
fiscal year from 50 percent to 33 percent.

             PLACEMENT OF SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE PERSONNEL

      Section 324 requires a regular report on the placement of 
Senior Foreign Service Officers.

                     REPORT ON MANAGEMENT TRAINING

      Section 325 requires the Secretary of State to produce a 
report to Congress regarding modifications to existing training 
programs so as to provide Department employees with 
``significant and comprehensive management training at all 
career grades for Foreign Service personnel.''

  WORKFORCE PLANNING FOR FOREIGN SERVICE PERSONNEL BY FEDERAL AGENCIES

      Section 326 requires the Secretary of State to submit a 
report to the Congress every four years that describes the 
workforce plan for the following 5-year period, and that 
outlines the steps taken to promote uniform policies among 
agencies utilizing the Foreign Service personnel system.

                    RECORDS OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

      Section 327 requires that any disciplinary action of a 
Foreign Service member requiring more than five-days suspension 
from the Foreign Service be included in the member's personnel 
file until tenured or next promoted.

 LIMITATION ON SALARY AND BENEFITS FOR MEMBERS OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE 
                  RECOMMENDED FOR SEPARATION FOR CAUSE

      Section 328 requires the Secretary to place a Foreign 
Service Member on leave without pay if that individual is 
recommended for separation from the Service for cause.

                     TREATMENT OF GRIEVANCE RECORDS

      Section 329 amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to 
ensure that proper documentation of disciplinary action is 
available to tenure and selection boards, by permitting the 
placement in the performance file of an employee who has been 
disciplined a notice that the discipline has been reviewed and 
sustained by the Foreign Service Grievance Board.

                    DEADLINES FOR FILING GRIEVANCES

      Section 330 reduces from three years to two years the 
time for filing a grievance. It does provide flexibility of an 
additional year for members who are filing a grievance 
regarding an evaluation if the Foreign Service member is still 
supervised by the reviewer or rater of the evaluation.

             REPORTS BY THE FOREIGN SERVICE GRIEVANCE BOARD

      Section 331 requires the Foreign Service Grievance Board 
to compile information regarding its cases, and provide an 
annual report regarding the Board's activities during the 
previous year.

          EXTENSION OF USE OF FOREIGN SERVICE PERSONNEL SYSTEM

      Section 332 permits the State Department to allow non-
State Department agencies to use the Foreign Service Act to 
appoint individuals abroad and to use the Foreign Service 
personnel system for those employees.

                   BORDER EQUALIZATION PAY ADJUSTMENT

      Section 333 amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to 
provide for payment of a border equalization adjustment to an 
employee who regularly commutes from his or her home in the 
U.S. to an official duty station in Canada or Mexico. The 
adjustment is equal to the amount that the employee would 
receive as locality pay (under section 5304 of title 5, United 
States Code) if assigned to an official duty station within the 
United States locality pay area closest to the employee's 
official duty station. This provision was contained in the 
Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce, Justice, State Department 
Appropriations Act; this section would make the authority 
permanent.

      TREATMENT OF CERTAIN PERSONS REEMPLOYED AFTER SERVICE WITH 
                      INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

      Section 334 provides the full scope of retirement 
benefits to Federal employees who transfer to international 
organizations under 5 U.S.C. 3582 by allowing such employees to 
participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (``TSP'') for the period 
of their transfer to the international organization. This 
section amends the Thrift Savings provisions of Title 5 to 
allow persons who transfer to international organizations the 
ability to make up missed TSP contributions after they are re-
employed in Federal service. The employee's make-up 
contributions are limited by the maximum annual employee 
contribution for the year in which the contributions would have 
been made. This section also provides that, with respect to 
persons covered under the `new' retirement systems, the 
employing agency provides associated agency automatic 
contributions and retroactive matching contributions, as well 
as lost earnings on the agency contributions.

 TRANSFER ALLOWANCE FOR FAMILIES OF DECEASED FOREIGN SERVICE PERSONNEL

      Section 335 allows the Department to pay a ``transfer 
allowance'' (which covers certain costs associated with 
returning home to the United States) to surviving family 
members of overseas employees who are killed in the line of 
duty.

                      PARENTAL CHOICE IN EDUCATION

      Section 336 allows certain overseas employees to elect to 
send their dependents to schools away from post at government 
expense, so long as the cost does not exceed the cost to the 
government of sending those dependents to adequate schools at 
the post of the employee.

                      MEDICAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE

      Section 337 permits an advance of up to 3 months' pay to 
an employee who must undergo certain types of medical treatment 
abroad.

   REPORT CONCERNING FINANCIAL DISADVANTAGES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND 
                          TECHNICAL PERSONNEL

      Section 338 requests that the Department prepare a report 
for the Congress on the financial disadvantages suffered by 
administrative and technical personnel posted to U.S. missions 
abroad as a result of their not having diplomatic status.

    STATE DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL AND PERSONNEL INVESTIGATIONS

      Section 339 requires the State Department Inspector 
General when conducting criminal investigations to abide by 
professional standards applicable to all law enforcement 
agencies and to provide subjects of investigations an 
opportunity to provide exculpatory information. In addition the 
provision mandates that the Inspector General report to 
Congress the instances when persons named in a report were not 
provided an opportunity to refute allegations or assertions 
made about the person in a final report of investigations. This 
section clarifies that the Inspector General must provide an 
opportunity to comment on allegations of wrongdoing or 
assertions regarding a material fact when they are set out in a 
final report of investigation. In addition, this section makes 
clear that failure to comply with this section does not give 
rise to any private right of action. This section makes several 
additional changes.
      The term ``Final Report of Investigation'' as used in the 
provision means the written document produced by the Office of 
the Inspector General at the conclusion of the investigative 
phase of a case which is thereafter transmitted to the 
Department of Justice or Bureau of Personnel for possible 
prosecutorial or administrative action. Initial referrals or 
summaries provided to the Department of Justice by the 
Inspector General do not constitute a ``Final Report of 
Investigation'' as used in this amendment. This section is not 
intended to impede the development of a criminal prosecution by 
the Department of Justice.
      In addition the notification required by new subparagraph 
(F) of section 209(d)(2) of the Foreign Service Act may 
summarize briefly the cases where the Inspector General did not 
afford an opportunity to refute the allegation of wrong doing 
or assertion of material fact.

   STUDY OF COMPENSATION FOR SURVIVORS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS OVERSEAS

      Section 340 requires the President to examine and report 
on the current benefit structure of survivors of U.S. 
government employees who are killed while serving abroad. The 
purpose is to evaluate whether the benefits are adequate, fair, 
and equitably distributed.

              PRESERVATION OF DIVERSITY IN REORGANIZATION

      Section 341 amends the Foreign Affairs Reform and 
Restructuring Act of 1998 to ensure women and minorities are 
not adversely affected by the reorganization while maintaining 
the flexibility to transfer all employees throughout the 
Department of State.

    United States Informational, Educational, and Cultural Programs

 EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND SCHOLARSHIPS FOR TIBETANS AND 
                                BURMESE

      Section 401 extends the authorization for the exchange 
and scholarship programs for Tibetan and Burmese exiles 
(contained in Public Law 104-319, the Human Rights, Refugee, 
and Other Foreign Relations Provisions Act of 1996) through 
fiscal years 2000 and 2001. It also renames the Tibetan 
exchange program after Ngawang Choephel, the Fulbright Scholar 
and ethno-musicologist who is now serving a fifteen-year prison 
sentence on false charges brought by the Chinese government.

     CONDUCT OF CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS

      Section 402 revises the Human Rights, Refugee, and Other 
Foreign Relations Provisions Act of 1996. Subsection (a) is 
intended to ensure that programs of exchange with countries 
whose people do not fully enjoy freedom and democracy shall 
afford opportunities for significant participation for human 
rights and democracy leaders in such countries as well as to 
other persons who are committed to advancing human rights and 
democratic values. The term ``where appropriate'' in this 
section is intended solely to make clear that the section does 
not mandate significant participation by such persons in 
exchanges whose subject matter does not lend itself to such 
participation. The section does not require significant 
participation by human rights and democracy advocates in every 
single exchange with a country described in the section, but 
only that the programs in each such country, viewed in the 
aggregate, afford the opportunity for significant participation 
for such persons.
      It is particularly important to note that the term 
``where appropriate'' is not intended to allow the denial of 
participation in U.S. exchanges to human rights and democracy 
advocates possessing the requisite academic or professional 
qualifications on the grounds that such participation would 
cause political or diplomatic difficulties for the Department 
or for an exchangegrantee organization.
      The inclusion of human rights and democracy leaders or 
persons committed to the advancement of human rights and 
democratic values in U.S. exchange programs may in some cases 
involve an element of risk for the participant. The Department 
should take all appropriate steps to ensure that the personal 
safety of the participant is not compromised by inclusion in 
such a program.
      Subsection (b)(2) calls on the Department to consider, in 
selecting grantee organizations for such programs, the 
willingness and ability of the organization to ensure that the 
governments of the countries described in the section do not 
have ``inappropriate influence'' in the process of selecting 
participants. This provision requires, among other 
requirements, that grantee organizations not select individual 
participants who are so thoroughly committed to the suppression 
of human rights and democracy that their selection could create 
an impression that the United States condones such suppression.
      Finally, this section amends section 102 of the Human 
Rights, Refugee, and Other Foreign Relations Provisions Act of 
1996 to eliminate the illustrative list of countries whose 
people do not fully enjoy freedom and democracy. This list is 
unnecessary in light of the clear application to these and 
other countries of the generic description contained in the 
section. The elimination of the list is not intended to imply 
that the people of any of the listed countries now fully enjoy 
freedom and democracy.

                       NATIONAL SECURITY MEASURES

      Section 403 requires the State Department to take 
appropriate steps to ensure that foreign espionage agents do 
not participate in U.S.-funded exchange programs.

    SUNSET OF UNITED STATES ADVISORY COMMISSION ON PUBLIC DIPLOMACY

      Section 404 provides the U.S. Advisory Commission on 
Public Diplomacy with an additional two years of operation 
prior to sunsetting the authority. The Commission will operate 
at half the current staff and operating costs. The Commission 
will become a standard State Department advisory committee when 
its statutory authority sunsets at the end of fiscal year 2001.

                       ROYAL ULSTER CONSTABULARY

      Section 405 addresses certain training programs. For the 
past several years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has 
conducted training programs for members of the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary (RUC) at the National Academy training program in 
Quantico, Virginia. This section requires that before further 
FBI or other federal law enforcement training for RUC members 
takes place, the President must submit a report on the FBI 
training for RUC members over the past five fiscal years. The 
President also must certify that the training is necessary and 
includes a significant human rights component, and that vetting 
procedures have been established to ensure that RUC members who 
had substantial knowledge of human rights violations or 
harassment of defense attorneys but failed to act on this 
knowledge are not included in the training program.
      Such training should be conducted in a manner that 
supports the implementation of the September 1999 report issued 
by the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland. 
The report set forth 175 recommendations for the establishment 
of a new police service in Northern Ireland in the context of a 
peaceful resolution of the ``Troubles'' in Northern Ireland. 
One of the recommendations was a suggestion that 
``[i]nternational training exchanges should be further 
developed, focusing in particular on matters where the police 
in Northern Ireland need overseas police cooperation and on 
best practice developments in policing worldwide.'' 
(Recommendation 169).

           RUSSIAN AND UKRANIAN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT EDUCATION

      Sections 421-426 authorize $10,000,000 to provide 
training programs in Russia and Ukraine for their nationals to 
obtain skills in business administration, accounting, and 
marketing, with special emphasis on instruction in business 
ethics and in the basic terminology, techniques, and practices 
of those disciplines in order to achieve international 
standards of quality, transparency, and competitiveness.

          United States International Broadcasting Activities

                   REAUTHORIZATION OF RADIO FREE ASIA

      Section 501 extends the sunset of Radio Free Asia for 10 
years and provides for a cap of $30 million for fiscal years 
2000 and 2001 to operate Radio Free Asia.

 NOMINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BROADCASTING BOARD OF 
                               GOVERNORS

      Section 502 modifies the provision of law creating the 
Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees all U.S. 
government-sponsored international broadcasting. The section 
subjects the designation of the position of Chairman of the 
Broadcasting Board of Governors to Senate advice and consent. 
Current law provides that all members are subject to Senate 
confirmation, but the President may designate any of these 
members as chairman at any time. Given that the Board became an 
independent entity in October, pursuant to the Foreign Affairs 
Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, the Committee believes 
the appointment of the Chairman of the Board should be subject 
to Senate confirmation.

        PRESERVATION OF RFE/RL (RADIO FREE EUROPE/RADIO LIBERTY)

      Section 503 repeals a 1994 ``sense of Congress'' 
provision that RFE/RL should receive no U.S. government support 
after fiscal year 1999 and replaces it with a provision that 
would support RFE/RL broadcasting so long as certain specified 
conditions do not occur.

   IMMUNITY FROM CIVIL LIABILITY FOR BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS

      Section 504 provides the same immunity to the 
Broadcasting Board of Governors when acting with regard to RFE/
RL and Radio Free Asia (RFA) matters as they would have when 
acting as the Broadcasting Board of Governors.

             Embassy Security and Counterterrorism Measures

                              SHORT TITLE

      Section 601 states that this title may be cited as the 
``Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 
1999''.

                                FINDINGS

      Section 602 sets forth findings regarding the bombing of 
the U.S. Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, 
Kenya in August 1998, and the subsequent investigation by the 
State Department Accountability Review Boards, which were 
chaired by Admiral William Crowe, USN (ret.).

               UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC FACILITY DEFINED

      Section 603 defines the term ``United States diplomatic 
facility'' to track with those used to notify foreign 
governments of U.S. diplomatic presence. This definition 
extends to other agencies that have a bilateral agreement with 
the host government so long as the records are contained in the 
State Department records. It is expected that the State 
Department will ensure it retains a record of all such 
agreements in its files so that this provision will have the 
broad application to U.S. agencies that is intended.

                    AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS

      Section 604 authorizes $900 million in each of fiscal 
years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 for Embassy Security, 
Construction and Maintenance. It also provides that any amounts 
which are authorized in a particular fiscal year, but for which 
the full amount is not appropriated in that fiscal year, carry 
forward and remain available in subsequent fiscal years until 
such amounts are appropriated.

                      OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENDITURES

      Section 605 contains several provisions designed to 
ensure that funds appropriated to the Embassy Security, 
Construction and Maintenance Account are used only for (1) the 
intended purpose and (2) high priority projects.
      Subsection (a) provides that funds be made available only 
for new construction or major security enhancements needed to 
bring U.S. diplomatic facilities into compliance with security 
standards. The Secretary of State is required to submit an 
annual report on the facilities that are a priority for 
replacement because of their vulnerability to terrorist attack. 
The report must list such facilities in groups of 20. The 
groups of 20 must then be ranked in order of most to least 
vulnerable. Funds made available in the account may only be 
used for those facilities in the first four groups--that is, 
the 80 most vulnerable facilities.
      However, there are some exceptions: (1) The substitute 
provides an exception to the requirement that funds be used 
only for the first 80 facilities or posts on the list of 
facilities that are a priority for replacement. The amendment 
provides that the list required by subsection (a) may contain 
either diplomatic facilities or diplomatic and consular posts. 
This change is intended to allow the Department to identify 
either a single facility, or a city where a number of 
facilities are located, as occupying a single place on the 
list. (2) In addition, funds may be used for facilities beyond 
that list in two circumstances. First, if Congress authorizes 
or appropriates for a specific diplomatic facility, the 
Department may proceed with acquisition of such a facility even 
if it is not on the list. This exception recognizes that the 
President and the Secretary of State may request funds for 
acquisition of a new facility in the budget request. If 
Congress approves funds for that aspect of the budget request 
in a future authorization or appropriations bill, either 
specifically or in a lump sum authorization or appropriation, 
the Department may move forward with acquisition of the 
facility. Second, the exception applies if the Secretary 
notifies the appropriate congressional committees that the 
Department intends to use funds for such a facility in 
accordance with the procedures applicable to a reprogramming of 
funds under section 34 of the State Department Basic 
Authorities Act.
      Subsection (b) prohibits the transfer of funds from this 
account.
      Subsection (c) requires semiannual reports on obligations 
and expenditures from the account, projected obligations and 
expenditures, and the status of ongoing projects.

     SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES

      Section 606 identifies new security requirements with 
respect to United States diplomatic facilities. These new 
requirements, which are based on recommendations of the 
Accountability Review Board, are specifically focused on the 
threat of large vehicular bombs.
      The section requires: (1) the Emergency Action Plan of 
each United States mission to address the threat of large 
explosive attacks vehicles and the safety of employees during 
such an attack; (2) that the State Department Security 
Environment Threat List contain a section that addresses 
potential acts of international terrorism against United States 
diplomatic facilities based on threat identification criteria 
that emphasize the threat of transnational terrorism, host 
government support and other relevant factors; (3) the State 
Department, in selecting sites for diplomatic facilities, to 
adhere to its existing security standard (set forth in 12 
Foreign Affairs Handbook-5) requiring that all U.S. government 
offices and activities subject to the authority of the Chief of 
Mission be located in the same chancery buildings or on the 
same compound. Exceptions can be granted if the Secretary of 
State certifies to Congress that it is in the national interest 
of the United States to do so. This authority cannot be 
delegated by the Secretary of State; (4) each newly acquired or 
constructed U.S. diplomatic facility to be situated not less 
than 100 feet from the perimeter of the property on which the 
facility is situated. An exception can be granted if the 
Secretary of State certifies to Congress that it is in the 
national interest of the United States to do so. In addition to 
this primary threat, more attention should be given to 
providing integrated, real-time chemical and biological agent 
detection and identification, whichis critical to protecting 
diplomatic facilities. The State Department should also evaluate the 
possibility of integrating a detection capability for chemical and 
biological weapons, and immediate action response to such a detection, 
in the physical security procedures of diplomatic facilities overseas; 
(5) the State Department to conduct crisis management training for 
State Department Headquarters personnel, as well as personnel serving 
in facilities overseas; (6) the State Department to provide sufficient 
support to the Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST) to identify 
personnel to serve on the FEST as a collateral duty, conduct routine 
training exercises, and provide any additional support that may be 
necessary to make the FEST more effective in a post-crisis environment; 
(7) the President to develop a plan to replace on a priority basis the 
current FEST aircraft funded by the Department of Defense with a 
reliable replacement and backup aircraft. Not later than 60 days after 
the enactment of this act, the President shall submit to Congress a 
report describing the aircraft selected pursuant to this provision; (8) 
the Secretary of State to enter into a memorandum of understanding with 
the Secretary of Defense to better coordinate the requirements for a 
more effective rapid response procedure in times of emergency with 
respect to US diplomatic facilities; (9) all United States diplomatic 
facilities to maintain emergency equipment and records required stored 
at an offsite facility in case of an emergency situation; and (10) 
fitness standards be implemented for diplomatic security agents.
      This section clarifies that waivers required for 
collocation and setback may not be delegated in the case of 
chancery and consulate buildings. All other cases may be 
delegated, but those decisions will still be made by senior 
State Department officials. This flexibility was added with the 
expectation that waivers used by the Secretary would be 
infrequent and therefore considered more seriously in the 
instances such a waiver is exercised. The grant of authority to 
delegate has been provided to the State Department only and has 
not been provided to other federal agencies for decisions 
regarding collocation. In this context, ``chancery and 
consulate buildings'' means a building solely or substantially 
occupied by the U.S. Government that is newly constructed or 
otherwise acquired where the main business of the U.S. 
Government is performed in that city. For example, the American 
Presence Posts are regarded as ``consulates'' but do not 
perform the same tasks and are intended to operate with one or 
two American employees.

  AUTHORITY TO LEASE AIRCRAFT TO RESPOND TO A TERRORIST ATTACK ABROAD

      Section 606(a)(7) provides the FBI with the authority for 
indemnification in the event of leasing aircraft pursuant to 
the authority provided for in the Commerce-State-Justice-and 
the Judiciary Appropriation Act for fiscal year 2000.

                      REPORT ON OVERSEAS PRESENCE

      Section 607 requires the Secretary of State to review the 
report of the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel, which, 
according to its Charter, was charged with preparing a report 
recommending the criteria by which the Department, working with 
Chiefs of Mission, might determine the location, size, and 
composition of overseas posts in the coming decade. The Panel 
was also tasked with proposing a multi-year funding program for 
the Department to achieve the appropriate U.S. presence 
overseas.
      The Panel issued its report on November 5, 1999. After 
reviewing the work of the Panel, the Secretary is required by 
this section to submit to Congress a report responding to that 
review and specified items, regardless of whether these are 
addressed by the Overseas Presence Panel. The Secretary's 
report will determine whether any U.S. diplomatic facility 
should be closed due to high vulnerability to terrorist threat 
and if adequate security enhancements cannot be provided to 
that facility. It will contain an analysis of the concept of 
regional facilities and recommend whether such a concept should 
be implemented at appropriate diplomatic facilities.

                      ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW BOARDS

      Section 608 modifies Section 301 of the Omnibus 
Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, which 
requires the convening of Accountability Review Boards to 
examine an instance of serious injury, loss of life, or 
significant destruction of property at or related to a U.S. 
government mission abroad, or in case of serious breach of 
security involving intelligence activities of a foreign 
government. Under current law, there is no deadline for the 
convening of a board following such an event. This provision 
requires the Secretary of State to convene a board within 60 
days of the event, and allows two 30-day extensions of this 
deadline. This provision does not apply to breaches of security 
involving intelligence activities.

               INCREASED ANTITERRORISM TRAINING IN AFRICA

      Section 609 requires a report by the Secretary on the 
establishment of an International Law Enforcement Academy in 
Africa.

   International Commissions and Organizations Other Than the United 
                                Nations

                       INTERPARLIAMENTARY GROUPS

      Section 701 provides technical changes to the name of the 
Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue and the North Atlantic 
Assembly.

AUTHORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY AND WATER COMMISSION TO ASSIST 
                      STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

      Section 702 permits the U.S. Section of the International 
Boundary and Water Commission to provide tests, surveys, and 
other services on a reimbursable basis to state or local 
governments that request them. Reimbursements will be credited 
to the appropriation from which the cost of providing the 
services is paid.

              INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY AND WATER COMMISSION

      Section 703 authorizes the International Boundary and 
Water Commission (IBWC) to use contributions from binational 
organizations for projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. It 
wouldalso allow the U.S. section of the IBWC to apply a user 
fee toward operations and maintenance of the bridge between El Paso, 
Texas, and Juarez, Mexico.

     SEMIANNUAL REPORTS ON UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR MEMBERSHIP OR 
         PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

      Section 704 requires semiannual reports, with a 
classified annex, from the Secretary of State on the United 
States government's efforts to boost efforts toward Taiwan's 
appropriate membership or participation in international 
organizations.

 RESTRICTION RELATING TO UNITED STATES ACCESSION TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
                             CRIMINAL COURT

      Section 705 prohibits funding for use by, or in support 
of the International Criminal Court, without Senate advice and 
consent to the treaty establishing the Court. On July 17, 1998 
a majority of nations at the U.N. Diplomatic Conference in 
Rome, Italy, on the Establishment of an International Criminal 
Court voted 120-7, with 21 abstentions, in favor of a treaty 
that would establish an international criminal court. The court 
is empowered to investigate and prosecute war crimes, crimes 
against humanity, genocide and aggression. The United States 
voted against the treaty.

PROHIBITION ON EXTRADITION OR TRANSFER OF UNITED STATES CITIZENS TO THE 
                      INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT

      Section 706 prohibits the use of funds to extradite any 
U.S. citizen to a foreign country that is under an obligation 
to surrender individuals to the International Criminal Court 
unless that country provides direct assurances to the United 
States that applicable prohibitions in existing extradition 
treaties apply to such surrender or gives other satisfactory 
assurances to the United States that it will not transfer that 
individual to the International Criminal Court (ICC). This 
section also bars the United States from providing consent to 
the transfer of such individual to a third country under an 
obligation to surrender persons to the ICC unless that third 
country confirms to the United States that applicable 
prohibitions on reextradition apply or gives other satisfactory 
assurances to the United States that it will not transfer that 
individual to the ICC.

                    REPORTS REGARDING FOREIGN TRAVEL

      Section 707 extends the reporting requirement to fiscal 
years 2000-2001 and changes the reporting dates to January 31 
and July 31 of each year with regard to travel by the Executive 
Branch for purposes of diplomatic conferences.

 UNITED STATES REPRESENTATION AT THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY

      Section 708 eliminates the Washington-based 
representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
and shifts those duties to the existing post of U.S. 
Representative to U.N. agencies based in Vienna.

                       United Nations Activities

          UNITED NATIONS POLICY ON ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS

      Section 721 supports United States policy of seeking to 
end the inequity that Israel be denied participation in a 
regional bloc at the United Nations and therefore the 
opportunity of a rotating seat on the Security Council of the 
United Nations.
      This section also supports a United States policy seeking 
to abolish certain groups within the United Nations, such as 
the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the 
Palestinian People which reflects an anti-Israel bias.
      Annual reports and consultations with the Congress on 
actions to accomplish the stated policies are also a 
requirement.

   DATA ON COSTS INCURRED IN SUPPORT OF UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING 
                               OPERATIONS

      Section 722 requires the United States to report annually 
to the United Nations on the total costs of United States 
Department of Defense activities in support of Security Council 
resolutions--including assessed, voluntary and incremental 
costs. The section also requires the United States to request 
that the United Nations prepare and publish a report that 
compiles similar information for other United Nations member 
states. This comprehensive reporting will quantify all costs to 
the United States for peacekeeping activities, and enable the 
Congress to consider those costs in relation to the proposed 
operation or expansion of an operation prior to action by the 
United Nations Security Council.

 REIMBURSEMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE UNITED STATES TO 
                           THE UNITED NATIONS

      Section 723 is intended to ensure that the U.S. 
Government is reimbursed by the United Nations in a timely 
manner for military assistance it provides in support of the 
United Nations or U.N. peacekeeping operations, whether this 
assistance is provided to the United Nations or to another 
country participating in such an operation. The section is not 
intended to apply to civilian police monitors, which are funded 
individually by the nation contributing monitors. As drafted, 
this section does not impede the President in his ability to 
use any constitutional authority to provide assistance at any 
time. This section exempts the deployment of United States 
troops by the President from the requirement of reprogramming 
procedures under section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961. As written, this section does not affect the President's 
constitutional authority as Commander-in-Chief. Nothing in this 
section shall be construed as an authorization of the use of 
force.

CODIFICATION OF REQUIRED NOTICE OF PROPOSED UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING 
                               OPERATIONS

      Section 724 consolidates many current reporting 
requirements regarding international peacekeeping activities.

                        Miscellaneous Provisions

  DENIAL OF ENTRY INTO UNITED STATES OF FOREIGN NATIONALS ENGAGED IN 
ESTABLISHMENT OR ENFORCEMENT OF FORCED ABORTION OR STERILIZATION POLICY

      Section 801 requires the Secretary of State to deny a 
visa to any foreign national who the Secretary of State finds 
to have been directly involved in the establishment or 
enforcement of coercive population control policies. Drafted 
with flexibility for the executive branch in mind, this 
provision allows the Secretary of State to determine which 
officials meet this definition, contains exceptions for heads 
of state, heads of government and cabinet level officials, and 
also contains a national interest waiver. In addition, it 
provides the Secretary some flexibility in cases where a 
foreign national has discontinued support for or involvement 
with such coercive population policies.

                         TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS

      Section 802 makes several technical corrections to the 
Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act.

         REPORTS WITH RESPECT TO A REFERENDUM ON WESTERN SAHARA

      Section 803 requires reporting on the efforts of the 
Government of Morocco and the Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Seguia el Hamra, and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO) to bring about a 
referendum regarding the status of the Western Sahara.

  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER PLO COMMITMENTS COMPLIANCE ACT OF 1989

      Section 804 requires reporting regarding aid to the 
Palestinian Authority and democratic reforms.

   REPORT ON TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN WHICH UNITED STATES CITIZENS WERE 
                       KILLED AND RELATED MATTERS

      Section 805 requires reporting requirements regarding 
terrorist attacks in the territory of Israel or territories 
administered by Israel or the Palestinian Authority in which 
U.S. citizens were killed or injured.

  ANNUAL REPORTING ON WAR CRIMES, CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND GENOCIDE

      Section 806 requires that the annual human rights report 
contain information regarding commission of war crimes, crimes 
against humanity and genocide.

          RESTRICTIONS ON NUCLEAR COOPERATION WITH NORTH KOREA

      Subtitle B of Title VIII addresses issues of nuclear 
cooperation with North Korea. Under the 1994 Agreed Framework 
between the United States and North Korea, President Clinton 
committed the United States to arrange the construction in 
North Korea of two 1000 megawatt(e) light water nuclear 
reactors. Inasmuch as these reactors are to be of U.S. design, 
it will be necessary under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for 
the United States and North Korea to enter a bilateral 
agreement for cooperation in the field of nuclear energy before 
key components of the reactors can be transferred to North 
Korea. In recognition of this requirement under existing U.S. 
law, both countries explicitly committed themselves in the 
Agreed Framework to conclude such an agreement.
      The Agreed Framework contemplates that the bilateral 
agreement for nuclear cooperation will come into effect when a 
significant portion of the reactor project is completed. This 
coincides with the time under the Agreed Framework when North 
Korea is obligated to come into full compliance with its 
safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) and permit the IAEA full access to all sites and 
information in North Korea that the IAEA deems necessary to 
verify the accuracy and completeness of its initial report to 
the IAEA.
      This section requires that no agreement for nuclear 
cooperation with North Korea may become effective, no licenses 
may be issued for export directly or indirectly to North Korea 
of any nuclear material, facilities, components, or other 
goods, services or technology, and no approval may be given for 
the transfer or retransfer directly or indirectly to North 
Korea of any nuclear material, facilities, components, or other 
goods, services or technology, until the President makes a 
determination and report to specified committees of Congress.
      The determination requirement has seven elements. The 
basic thrust of the required determinations is that North Korea 
is in full compliance with its obligations under the Agreed 
Framework. Actions that would undermine the object and purpose 
of the Agreed Framework that are addressed in specific elements 
of the determination requirement include having a uranium 
enrichment facility or a nuclear reprocessing facility 
elsewhere than at the facilities frozen pursuant to the Agreed 
Framework, making significant progress toward acquiring or 
developing such facilities, and either having nuclear weapons 
or making significant efforts to acquire, develop, test, 
produce, or deploy such weapons.
      These requirements apply in addition to all other 
applicable procedures, requirements and restrictions contained 
in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and other laws.

                       People's Republic of China

                                FINDINGS

      Section 871 contains the findings that are largely a 
restatement and concurrence with the findings of the State 
Department in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 
which noted that serious human rights abuses persisted and, in 
some cases, intensified in China in 1998.

   FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL AT DIPLOMATIC POSTS TO REPORT ON 
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND HUMAN RIGHTS MATTERS IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC 
                                OF CHINA

      Section 872 provides $2,200,000 for each of fiscal years 
2000 and 2001 for additional personnel at the United States 
embassies in China and Nepal, and U.S. consulates in China, for 
the monitoring of political and social conditions with 
particular emphasis and respect for human rights.

    PRISONER INFORMATION REGISTRY FOR THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

      Section 873 requires the establishment of a registry to 
list and provide information on all known political prisoners 
in China. According to the State Department, there are thought 
to be thousands of such prisoners in China, but to date, no 
comprehensive list of all known prisoners exists. The 
provisions allow the State Department to make funds available 
to non-government organizations to assist in establishing and 
maintaining the registry.

                      Arrears Payments and Reform

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS

      This subtitle (sections 901 and 902) outlines the short 
title and key definitions regarding this title.

                    Arrearages to the United Nations

                    AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS

      Section 911 authorizes $100,000,000 in fiscal year 1998, 
$475 million in fiscal year 1999, and $244 million in fiscal 
year 2000 for the repayment of arrears to the United Nations, 
United Nations peacekeeping activities, United Nations 
specialized agencies, and other international organizations. 
Funds are authorized to remain available until expended. The 
funds for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 are already appropriated.

                  OBLIGATION AND EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS

      Section 912 outlines the manner in which disbursements 
will be made, and requires that certification of specified 
reforms be completed prior to any disbursement of funds by the 
United States. The Secretary of State must notify the Congress 
30 days prior to the disbursement of any funds. This section 
also provides the Secretary with the authority to waive two 
required certifications in order to disburse the funds 
authorized by this bill. Specifically, with respect to the 
funds authorized for fiscal year 1999, the Secretary may waive 
the certification that the United Nations has established a 
``contested arrears'' account for disputed arrears if there is 
substantial progress in meeting this condition. A waiver of 
this condition shall require the Secretary to notify the United 
Nations that the United States Congress does not consider the 
United States obligated to pay these amounts. With respect to 
fiscal year 2000 funds the Secretary may waive the requirement 
that the United Nations and specialized agencies cap at 20 
percent the U.S. share of the regular budget.

 FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS OWED BY THE UNITED NATIONS TO THE UNITED STATES

      Section 913 permits the President to forgive the United 
Nations up to $107 million in debt currently owed to the United 
States. In order to forgive this debt the United Nations must 
reduce its record of U.S. arrears to the United Nations by the 
amount of the debt forgiven by the United States.

                       United States Sovereignty

                       CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

Supremacy of the U.S. Constitution
      Section 921 requires that the Secretary of State certify 
that no action has been taken by the United Nations or any of 
its agencies cause the United States to violate the 
Constitution.
No United Nations Sovereignty
      Section 921 requires that the Secretary of State certify 
that neither the United Nations nor its specialized agencies 
have exercised authority over the United States or taken steps 
to require that the U.S. cede sovereignty.
No United Nations Taxation
      Section 921 requires the Secretary of State to certify 
that U.S. law does not give the United Nations any legal 
authority to tax the American people; no taxes or comparable 
fees have in fact been imposed; and there has been no effort 
sanctioned by the United Nations to develop, advocate or 
promote such a taxation proposal. The exception for fees 
charged by the World Intellectual Property Organization is not 
intended to limit the scope of the exception for ``fees for 
publications or other kinds of fees that are not tantamount to 
a tax on United States citizens'', thus fees such as those 
charged by the International Telecommunications Union may be 
viewed as falling under the broader exception.
No United Nations Standing Army
      Section 921 requires that the Secretary of State certify 
that the United Nations has not taken formal steps to create or 
develop a standing army under Article 43 of the United Nations 
Charter.
No Interest Fees
      Section 921 requires that the Secretary of State must 
certify that interest fees have not been levied on the United 
States for any arrears owed to the United Nations.
No United Nations Real Property Rights
      Section 921 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that neither the United Nations nor its specialized 
agencies have exercised any authority or control over public or 
private property in the United States. It is agreed that this 
section should not be construed to override obligations of the 
International Organization Immunities Act, the Agreement 
Regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations, supplemental 
agreements to the Agreement, the Convention on the Privileges 
and Immunities of the United Nations, or under any other 
agreement with the United States according the United Nations 
or its specialized agencies, privileges and immunities, or 
which are otherwise provided for under United States law, or 
apply to property occupied or utilized under lease, sublease, 
or contract with private or government owners.
Termination of Borrowing Authority
      Section 921 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the United Nations has not engaged in external 
borrowing, nor have the financial regulations of the United 
Nations or any of its specialized agencies been amended to 
permit borrowing, nor has the United States paid any interest 
for any loans incurred through external borrowing by the United 
Nations or its specialized agencies.

    Reform of Assessments and United Nations Peacekeeping Operations

                       CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

      Section 931 requires that the Secretary shall not make 
her 1999 certification if she determines the 1998 
certifications are no longer valid, and prior to payment of 
authorized arrears in fiscal year 1999, certify that the 
certification requirements set out below have been met.
Contested Arrears Account
      Section 931 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify a contested arrears account or some other appropriate 
mechanism has been created for the United States. This account 
represents the difference between what the United Nations says 
is owed by the United States and the amount recognized by the 
United States Congress. Thus, the sum of the obligations that 
the Congress is authorizing in this legislation is the total 
that the Congress will authorize to be appropriated to the 
United Nations for its arrears under the regular and 
peacekeeping budgets. Agreement must be reached with the United 
Nations that any monies identified in this account will not 
affect the voting rights of the United States as contained in 
Article 19 of the United Nations charter.
Limitation on Assessed Share of Budget for Peace Operations
      Section 931 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the share of the total peacekeeping budget for 
each United Nations assessed peace operation does not exceed 25 
percent for any member.
Limitation on Share of Regular Budget
      Section 931 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the share of the total regular budget assessment 
for the United Nations does not exceed 22 percent for any 
member.

                      Budget and Personnel Reform

                       CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

      Section 941 requires that the Secretary shall not make 
her fiscal year 2000 certification if she determines the fiscal 
year 1998 and 1999 certifications are no longer valid, and 
prior to payment of authorized arrears in fiscal year 2000, 
certify that the certification requirements set out below have 
been met.
Limitation on Assessed Share of Regular Budget
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the share of the total regular budget assessment 
for the United Nations and its specialized agencies does not 
exceed 20 percent for any member.
Inspector General for Certain Organizations
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the three largest U.N. specialized agencies--the 
International Labor Organization, the Food and Agriculture 
Organization, and the World Health Organization--have each 
established an internal inspector general office comparable to 
the Office of Internal Oversight Services established in the 
United Nations following a similar certification requirement in 
the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1994-95 
(section 401 of Public Law 103-236).
      With regard to subsection (B), the approval of the member 
states of those organizations need not be expressed in a formal 
voting procedure, but may be expressed by means of ascertaining 
and taking into account the view of the member states. If such 
means is used in lieu of a formal vote, the views of the United 
States must be taken into account. With regard to the 
distributionof reports in subsection (F) of this requirement, 
what is essential is that the United States (and other Member States) 
have access to all annual and other relevant reports without 
modification, except to the extent it is necessary to protect the 
privacy rights of individuals. When privacy rights are impacted, 
reports may be redacted to protect individuals. However, it is not 
anticipated that wrongdoer cited in such reports are entitled to 
privacy protections.
New Budget Procedures for the United Nations
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the United Nations is implementing budget 
procedures that require the budget agreed to at the start of a 
budgetary cycle to be maintained, and the system-wide 
identification of expenditures by functional categories. For 
purposes of this section, system-wide identification of 
expenditures by functional categories means an object class 
distribution of resources. The object class distribution should 
accompany the initial regular assessed budget estimates for 
both the United Nations and its specialized agencies.
Sunset Policy for Certain United Nations Programs
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the United Nations and the International Labor 
Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the 
World Health Organization have each established an evaluation 
system that requires a determination as to the relevance and 
effectiveness of each program. The United States is required to 
seek a ``sunset'' date for each program unless the program 
demonstrates relevance and effectiveness. There is strong 
objection to the incorporation of funding for terminated 
programs into the baseline of the U.N. budget for the next 
biennium. Funding for programs which have ceased and one-time 
expenditures should not be carried over into the next budget 
cycle. The sunset of programs should result in financial 
savings for the member states.
United Nations Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary 
        Questions
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the United States has a seat on the United Nations 
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ). 
Until 1997, the United States served on this committee since 
the creation of the United Nations. The ACABQ is key to the 
budgetary decisions at the United Nations and the United 
States, as the largest contributing nation, should have a seat 
on that Committee.
National Audits
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the General Accounting Office (GAO) contains 
access to United Nations financial data so that the GAO may 
perform nationally mandated reviews of all United Nations 
operations. Financial data means data pertaining to the 
financial transactions of the United Nations as well as data 
relating to its organization and activities. It is contemplated 
that as a result of this provision GAO will have access to the 
data it needs to conduct reviews of all U.N. operations.
Personnel
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the United Nations is enforcing a personnel system 
based on merit and is enforcing a worldwide availability of its 
international civil servants; a code of conduct is being 
implemented that requires, among other standards, financial 
disclosure statements by senior United Nations officials; a 
personnel evaluation system is being implemented; periodic 
assessments are being completed by the United Nations to 
determine total staffing levels and reporting of those 
assessments; and the United States has completed a review of 
the United Nations allowance system, including recommendations 
for reductions in allowances.
Reduction in Budget Authorities
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the International Labor Organization, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization, and the World Health Organization 
have each approved a budget that is a no-growth budget in the 
2000-2001 biennium as compared to levels agreed to for the 
1998-1999 budgets.
New Budget Procedures and Financial Regulations for Specialized 
        Agencies
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the International Labor Organization, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization, and the World Health Organization 
have each established procedures that require the budget agreed 
to at the start of a budgetary cycle to be maintained; the 
system-wide identification of expenditures by functional 
categories; and approval of supplemental budget requests to the 
Secretariat in advance of appropriations for those requests.
Limitation on Share of Regular Budget for Specialized Agencies
      Section 941 provides that the Secretary of State must 
certify that the share of the total regular budget assessment 
for the International Labor Organization, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization, and the World Health Organization 
does not exceed 22 percent for any member.

                        Miscellaneous Provisions

          STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION ON RELATION TO EXISTING LAWS

      Section 951 makes clear that this bill will not change or 
reverse any previous provision of law regarding restriction on 
funding to international organizations.

   PROHIBITION ON PAYMENTS RELATING TO UNIDO AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL 
   ORGANIZATIONS FROM WHICH THE UNITED STATES CONTAINS WITHDRAWN OR 
                           RESCINDED FUNDING

      Section 952 prohibits payment to organizations from which 
the United States has withdrawn or from which Congress has 
rescinded funding because the United States no longer 
participates in the organization, including the United Nations 
Industrial Organization and the World Tourism Organization.

  Division B--Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Security Assistance

                   Arms Control and Nonproliferation

                              ARMS CONTROL

                      KEY VERIFICATION ASSETS FUND

      Section 1111 gives an important new funding flexibility 
to the Department of State. The Senate proposal has been 
modified to authorize up to $5,000,000 to be made available, 
for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, to a ``Key Verification Assets 
Fund.'' This fund is expected to be used for the research, 
development, and acquisition of verification technologies. 
However, because only a limited amount of funds is available, 
the Fund is directed to be generally used only as ``seed 
money'' for the Department to capitalize upon projects 
undertaken by other agencies.
      Funds made available also may be used to retain 
verification assets. The Fund therefore can serve as a tool of 
the policy community in those instances when policy objectives 
diverge from intelligence community priorities. Again, because 
resources are limited, this Fund should not be used for the 
long-term retention of assets, but rather as an emergency, 
``stop-gap'' funding source to keep critical verification 
assets afloat until a more appropriate source of funds can be 
identified.
      In light of recent events, the Secretary of State needs 
to have discretionary funds available to prevent verification 
technologies and programs from falling by the wayside. The 
experience with the WC-135 aircraft (which is used to collect 
debris from nuclear tests) is a case in point. This plane is 
one of a kind, yet the Air Force tried to cancel this 
irreplaceable asset. Cancellation was narrowly avoided, and 
sufficient resources were scraped together to keep the plane 
flying for the near term, although longer-term commitment to 
the program by both the executive branch and Congress is still 
very much in doubt.
      Had resources been available under this account, the 
Secretary of State could have applied funds to keep the plane 
operating temporarily. Indeed, resources under the account may 
yet be needed. The Executive is urged to ensure that the Cobra 
Dane radar is retained.
      Finally, while the authority to transfer funds made 
available to the ``Key Verification Assets Fund'' resides with 
the Secretary, it is intended that the Assistant Secretary of 
State for Verification and Compliance assume responsibility for 
the identification of technologies or programs to be funded and 
manage those programs once State Department funds are applied. 
Funds, if appropriated, may not be reprogrammed from this 
account.

      ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR VERIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE

      Section 1112 establishes a bureau within the Department 
of State to be headed by an Assistant Secretary of State for 
Verification and Compliance, as proposed by the Senate. The 
Department of State has not provided for such a Bureau as a 
successor to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's Bureau 
for Intelligence, Verification, and Information Support (IVI), 
despite the fact that this Bureau was the only entity within 
the United States Government in which the principal function 
was the verification and enforcement of arms control treaties 
and commitments.
      The reorganization plan implemented by the Department of 
State to accomplish the merger with ACDA scattered IVI's staff, 
leaving in its stead a Special Assistant to the Under Secretary 
for Arms Control and International Security and a Deputy 
Assistant Secretary within a larger bureau, neither of whom is 
confirmed by the Senate. This is a demotion of verification and 
compliance functions, as the principal advocate for arms 
control verification now has a position of far less stature 
than his counterparts within the State Department regional 
bureaus, and elsewhere in the executive branch.
      It is essential that the verification and compliance 
aspects of arms control and nonproliferation agreements are 
given a voice at the most senior policy-making levels. A true 
commitment to vigorous enforcement of arms control and 
nonproliferation agreements and sanctions cannot be maintained 
by submerging compliance analysis within other bureaus.
      The need for an Assistant Secretary--and a Bureau--for 
Verification and Compliance is supported by former ACDA 
Directors Ron Lehman and Eugene Rostow, as well as several 
other key Reagan, Bush, and former Clinton Administration 
officials. In addition, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee have expressed support for such a 
step.
      Accordingly, this division establishes the position of 
Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance 
(V&C) and identifies the principal authorities and 
responsibilities of the position. Specifically, section 1112 
provides that the Assistant Secretary for V&C has primary 
responsibility for all verification and compliance issues 
associated with arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament 
agreements or commitments. As such, it is intended that the 
Assistant Secretary to have overall oversight of policy and 
resources relating to verification and compliance regarding not 
only various treaties, but also executive agreements and 
commitments, including those falling within the purview of 
regional bureaus (when such agreements or commitments pertain 
to arms control, nonproliferation, or disarmament).
      Section 1112 ensures that--with some specific 
exceptions--the Assistant Secretary shall serve as the 
principal State Department participant in all executive branch 
interagency groups, including intelligence groups, concerned 
with verification or compliance matters. Further, this section 
stipulates that the Assistant Secretary for V&C, rather than 
any other official within the Department of State or elsewhere, 
shall be considered the principal liaison to the intelligence 
community on verification and compliance issues.
      Finally, section 1112 identifies those reports, or 
portions thereof, for which the Assistant Secretary for V&C is 
to have primary responsibility. There is an inevitable tension 
between the enforcement of arms control, nonproliferation, and 
disarmament agreements and the implications that such 
enforcement has for various countries--and therefore the 
implications that the policies pursued by the Assistant 
Secretary for V&C will have for the policies pursued by other 
Bureaus. Therefore, these reports should be submitted to 
Congress as prepared by the Assistant Secretaryto the maximum 
extent possible, with any concerns of other Bureaus or State Department 
officials presented in annexes to such reports.

                   ENHANCED ANNUAL (``PELL'') REPORT

      Section 1113 expands the reporting requirement contained 
in section 403 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act to 
include an assessment of the adherence of other nations to 
commitments such as the Missile Technology Control Regime 
(MTCR). Compliance with commitments such as the MTCR (which is 
central to U.S. nonproliferation efforts) is no less important 
than compliance with arms control measures, and should be 
assessed in the same report, according to the same standards.
      Section 1113 further amends section 403 of the Arms 
Control and Disarmament Act by requiring that each report 
specifically identify, to the maximum extent practicable in 
unclassified form, each and every compliance question that 
arises. Although the need to protect sensitive intelligence 
information and information on diplomatic initiatives is 
understood, the argument that the confidentiality clause of the 
START Treaty, in and of itself, bars public identification of 
violations of that treaty is rejected by most Members. Previous 
reports included specific unclassified discussions of 
compliance.
      Additionally, section 1113 requires that compliance 
questions be carried in each successive report until the 
situation of concern has been resolved and the conclusion 
reported to the Congress. In this way, violations will not be 
allowed to go unresolved or be forgotten.

        REPORT ON START AND START II TREATIES MONITORING ISSUES

      Section 1114 requires an assessment of the capabilities 
of the intelligence community to monitor compliance with the 
START and START II Treaties. Specifically, the report requires 
an assessment of all monitoring activities, the intelligence 
community assets and capabilities that the Senate was informed 
would be necessary to accomplish those activities, and the 
status of those assets. In addition, the report must contain an 
assessment of all Russian activities relating to the START 
Treaty which have an impact on the United States' ability to 
monitor Russian compliance with that Treaty. This section also 
allows the Director of Central Intelligence to provide 
exceptionally sensitive, compartmented information separately 
to the Intelligence Committees. The Intelligence Committees, in 
turn, have an obligation to make the committees of jurisdiction 
aware of the pertinent aspects of such information.

                       STANDARDS FOR VERIFICATION

      Section 1115 amends section 306(a) of the Arms Export 
Control Act to provide the chairman and ranking minority member 
of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and 
International Relations Committee of the House of 
Representatives with the ability to request verifiability 
assessments of proposals made to, and by, the United States. 
The Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and 
Compliance is intended to be responsible for such assessments 
in accordance with the authorities under section 1112.

             CONTRIBUTION TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SEISMOLOGY

      Section 1116 relates to seismic monitoring of underground 
events such as nuclear tests and earthquakes. The scientists 
who work in the field of seismology provide an invaluable 
service around the world. Their close monitoring of data helps 
mankind to anticipate earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural 
disasters. The field of seismology also is critical to United 
States monitoring of the nuclear weapons test programs of 
foreign nations. Section 1116 ensures that the non-governmental 
U.S. seismological community is given immediate access to all 
unclassified seismological data provided to the United States 
Government by any international organization in which the 
United States participates that is directly responsible for 
seismological monitoring. If the United States is going to 
invest funds in such organizations, it should ensure that its 
participation benefits the nation's universities, science 
centers, and seismological community. Section 1116 is not 
intended to require, however, that the United States make 
public seismological data that a country might submit to an 
international organization, but that is not part of a network 
managed or sponsored by such organization.

                 PROTECTION OF UNITED STATES COMPANIES

      Section 1117 provides up to $2,000,000 in funds to be 
reimbursed by the Department of State to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, at the request of the FBI Director, for the 
Bureau's assistance in monitoring the activities of foreign 
nationals who must be given access to United States companies 
under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). When the Senate 
gave its advice and consent to the CWC, an issue of great 
concern was the right of international inspectors to conduct 
intrusive visits of any company in the United States. To guard 
against the potential for economic espionage, the Congress 
required that a special agent of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation accompany every inspection team. This imposes a 
financial burden on the FBI.
      Although this authority has been provided for the next 
two years, upon expiration of the two year period, it is 
expected that the FBI will assume all financial responsibility 
for continued implementation of the Bureau's obligation under 
the CWC Implementation Act. Section 1117 requires a report from 
the FBI no later than a year and half from the date of 
enactment. The purpose of this report is to provide Congress 
with assurance that the Bureau has taken the necessary steps to 
assume full responsibility for all aspects of its legal 
obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention 
Implementation Act of 1998.

                REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSMITTAL OF SUMMARIES

      Section 1118 requires that the committees of jurisdiction 
receive the various arms control summaries that are routinely 
prepared by United States delegations overseas. Such summaries 
are expected to be transmitted promptly to the committees.

         MATTERS RELATING TO THE CONTROL OF BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS

      Chapter 2 of Subtitle A of Title XI (sections 1121-1124) 
requires the conduct of nationaltrial visits and investigations 
at United States government facilities and, if at all possible, at 
private locations such as pharmaceutical plants and biotechnology 
companies. It further stipulates that personnel specializing in 
protecting national security and proprietary information participate in 
these trials to ensure that the risks associated with such measures are 
fully understood and minimized. A presidential study and report are 
required regarding the need for investigations and visits, the benefits 
to be expected, and the risk to national security and commercial 
industry of such investigations and visits under a Biological Weapons 
Convention (BWC) compliance protocol now under negotiation.
      It is noted that the threat of biological weapons attack 
is one of the greatest national security threats facing the 
United States. For a variety of reasons, the production and 
stockpiling of these weapons can be readily concealed. The 
executive branch has yet to articulate how various compliance 
measures being considered for addition to the existing 
Biological Weapons Convention will assist in the enforcement of 
that treaty. At the same time, United States companies that 
would be required to comply with compliance measures fear 
significant harm due to loss of proprietary information or 
unfounded allegations of BWC violations. Accordingly, Chapter 2 
requires the executive branch to engage in the same approach to 
the BWC as was taken in the case of the Chemical Weapons 
Convention--namely, the conduct of national trial visits and 
investigations.

         Nuclear Nonproliferation, Safety, and Related Matters

       CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION OF NONPROLIFERATION ACTIVITIES

      Section 1131 revises and expands the obligation of 
executive branch agencies to keep the Committee ``fully and 
currently'' informed of nonproliferation issues. Several 
agencies have had this obligation for decades, including the 
Departments of Commerce, Energy, Defense, and State. However, 
it is a matter of concern that few have been fulfilling their 
obligations in a timely manner.
      Section 1131 extends part of the reporting obligation 
contained in section 602 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 
1978 to the Director of Central Intelligence, makes clear that 
all proliferation matters are to be covered, and requires 
disclosure of sensitive matters relating to proliferation 
activities of foreign nations to the Foreign Relations 
Committee of the Senate and International Relations Committee 
of the House within 60 days of the executive branch agency in 
question becoming aware of such activity.

        EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES FOR NONPROLIFERATION PROGRAMS

      Section 1132 the allocation of any United States 
Government funds to any individual who is involved in offensive 
chemical or biological warfare programs. Such activities would 
violate the Chemical Weapons Convention or the Biological 
Weapons Convention. This prohibition does not extend to those 
individuals working on legitimate chemical or biological 
defense programs.

                 DISPOSITION OF WEAPONS-GRADE MATERIAL

      Section 1133 requires the Secretary of Energy, with the 
concurrence of the Secretary of Defense, to identify for 
Congress the number of nuclear weapons pits of each type that 
it intends to dismantle pursuant to an excess plutonium 
disposition agreement with Russia. It is not clear to the 
Executive branch has identified the sources for a self-declared 
fifty metric tons of ``excess'' plutonium. Nor are the 
implications clear of such a program for maintenance of the 
Stockpile Stewardship Program of the Department of Energy.
      Additionally, section 1133 seeks advance notice from the 
executive branch that when the agreement to establish a mixed 
oxide fuel fabrication or production facility in Russia is 
submitted to the Congress under section 123 of the Atomic 
Energy Act, the Secretary of State will be expected to certify 
that the proposed establishment of a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel 
plant in Russia will not become a major proliferation concern 
for future Administrations. Section 1133 seeks to guard against 
such nonproliferation concerns by insisting that clear 
guarantees be given to the United States by Russia that it will 
not supply fuel assemblies containing weapons-grade plutonium 
or sensitive technology related to the MOX facility to any 
country of concern to the United States. This is essential 
given the nuclear-supply relationship that Russia has with 
countries such as Iran and India. Further, section 1133 expects 
Russia to agree that the MOX facility will be subject to a 
sufficient level of international safeguards to ensure that 
special nuclear material (e.g. weapons-grade plutonium) is not 
diverted.

              PROVISION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION TO CONGRESS

      Section 1134 makes clear that no executive branch agency 
may legally withhold information that it is required to submit 
pursuant to section 602 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act. It 
also requires the issuance of directives by these agencies to 
ensure that all required information, including information 
contained in Special Access Programs, is provided to the 
Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and International 
Relations Committee of the House of Representatives in a timely 
fashion, as required by law.

              AMENDED NUCLEAR EXPORT REPORTING REQUIREMENT

      Section 1135 clarifies the type of information that the 
appropriate committees expect to receive in connection with 
Congressional notifications of nuclear-related exports for 
commercial power generation. This provision is not intended in 
any way to establish an arms sale or reprogramming notification 
process. It is expected, however, that the Executive branch 
begin fulfilling its legal obligation to make the requisite 
nuclear export notifications to the Foreign Relations Committee 
of the Senate and the International Relations Committee of the 
House.

           ADHERENCE TO THE MISSILE TECHNOLOGY CONTROL REGIME

      Section 1136 amends section 74 of the Arms Export Control 
Act (AECA), relating to the Missile Technology Control Regime 
(MTCR), to clarify the meaning of several terms and to revise 
the report that is required to Congress under this section of 
the AECA. Most notably, section 1136 makes clear that a country 
will enjoy substantial protection from the MTCR sanctions law 
only if it specifically agrees not to transfer any missile-
related equipment ortechnology that would be subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction under the AECA (if it were U.S.-origin equipment or 
technology). Any country that has not agreed to take this step--perhaps 
having only agreed to control production equipment, for instance--
should be aware that it still may be sanctioned under the AECA even if 
it concludes a bilateral understanding with the United States.
      Section 1136 also requires the Director of Central 
Intelligence to submit a detailed itemization of all credible 
information indicating that a country which has just concluded 
an MTCR-agreement with the United States has transferred, or 
conspired to transfer, equipment or technology in violation of 
the MTCR sanctions law in the previous two years.

                  AUTHORITY RELATING TO MTCR ADHERENTS

      Section 1137 is a conforming amendment necessitated by 
the provisions of section 1136(a). It provides the President 
with the authority to invoke MTCR sanctions against a 
proliferating entity if such person has not concluded a 
comprehensive agreement with the United States as defined by 
section 74(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act.

 TRANSFER OF FUNDING FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CENTERS IN THE FORMER 
                              SOVIET UNION

      Section 1138 authorizes the use of funds made available 
under the ``Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and 
Related Programs'' accounts, beginning in fiscal year 2001, for 
science and technology centers in the former Soviet Union. It 
was decided that the application of this authority would be 
delayed until 2001 in order to provide the Department of State 
sufficient time to adjust its foreign operations budget to 
incorporate this programmatic transfer. The NADR account is 
more appropriate for science and technology center programs 
since those activities are, in essence, nonproliferation 
programs.

   RESEARCH AND EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES BY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CENTERS

      Section 1139 clarifies that section 503(a)(5) of the 
FREEDOM Support Act of 1992 authorizes the use of funds to 
support research activity involving the participation of 
civilian scientists and engineers, provided that the 
participation of former Soviet weapons scientists predominates. 
Section 1139 also makes clear that funding of international 
exchanges is permitted in order to facilitate the commercial 
exposure of former weapons scientists. This new flexibility is 
important to enable the science and technology centers to 
continue performing their important defense conversion and 
nonproliferation functions.

                          Security Assistance

                  TRANSFERS OF EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES

  EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

      Section 1211 allows the Department of Defense during 
fiscal years 2000 and 2001 to reduce excess or obsolete stocks 
of defense articles by offering equipment to eligible foreign 
governments for enhancement of their defense capabilities. 
These equipment transfers are an important element of United 
States foreign policy. The reauthorization through fiscal year 
2004 of the authority to transfer excess defense articles to 
Greece and Turkey, in accordance with the established ratio, 
will benefit the security of the United States and bolster the 
military capabilities of these two important NATO allies.

          EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES FOR CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES

      Section 1212 gives the Department of Defense the 
authority to use funds appropriated for the national defense of 
the United States to pay for packing, crating, handling, and 
transportation of excess defense articles (EDA) to specific 
countries. Several countries operate under severe budget 
constraints, and could not afford the costs of packing, 
crating, handling, and transportation, even if the EDA itself 
were provided at no cost. Thus, utilization of this authority 
is recommended in such cases.
      There is concern with the potential impact of section 
1212 upon the Department of Defense. Accordingly, no funds 
shall be expended for the crating, packing, handling, or 
transportation of excess defense articles under this section 
until the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and the 
International Relations Committee of the House are notified of 
the amount proposed to be so expended. Through this 
notification procedure the committees of jurisdiction will 
minimize the impact upon the defense budget of the non-defense 
spending authorized under section 1212.

  INCREASE IN ANNUAL LIMITATION ON TRANSFER OF EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES

      Section 1213 increases the dollar value of excess 
equipment that may be given away for free by the Department of 
Defense on a yearly basis. The increase is substantial, from 
$350,000,000 to $425,000,000. This is needed because the United 
States Armed Forces have determined that it has stocks of 
obsolete equipment and munitions well in excess of the current 
ceiling. The military is unwilling to retain large quantities 
of obsolete material and will destroy or demilitarize useful 
equipment if it cannot be provided to another party in a timely 
manner.

                   Foreign Military Sales Authorities

           TERMINATION OF FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCED TRAINING

      Section 1221 provides the United States Government with 
the ability to terminate training or study programs with 
foreign nations in a more orderly fashion by allowing funds to 
be expended, under certain circumstances, to complete training 
or study programs already underway at the time of termination.

                  SALES OF EXCESS COAST GUARD PROPERTY

      Section 1222 authorizes the United States Government to 
provide excess Coast Guard equipment on a sales basis, in 
addition to the extant grant authority. On occasion, the United 
States Coast Guard determines that some of its smaller vessels 
are excess. These vessels are suitable for various countries 
which may not possess a ``blue water'' navy but are in need of 
equipment for coastal and riverine defense, and for Search-and-
Rescue Operations.
      Currently, section 516(i) of the Foreign Assistance 
Authorization Act of 1961 authorizes the grant transfer of 
excess Coast Guard equipment to eligible foreign countries for 
their defense capabilities. Current law, under section 21 of 
the AECA, does not authorize the sale of excess Coast Guard 
equipment. Section 1222 remedies this situation.
      The sale of excess Coast Guard equipment to foreign 
countries is preferable to donation under a grant authority. 
This will generate funds for the United States Treasury 
miscellaneous receipts account. To the maximum extent possible, 
Coast Guard vessels will be transferred pursuant to this sale 
authority rather than grant authority.

           COMPETITIVE PRICING FOR SALES OF DEFENSE ARTICLES

      Section 1223 permanently amends current law to include a 
provision contained in annual appropriations legislation since 
fiscal year 1996. Section 1223 allows direct costs associated 
with meeting additional or unique requirements for foreign 
customers to be paid with foreign military financing (FMF) 
grants. Loadings associated with such costs must be at the same 
rates as those applicable to the Defense Department. Under this 
provision the costs of defense goods and services are reduced 
to FMF grant recipients, thereby stretching scarce security 
assistance resources.

          NOTIFICATION OF UPGRADES TO DIRECT COMMERCIAL SALES

      Section 1224 amends the Arms Export Control Act to ensure 
that the committees of jurisdiction are notified of any 
upgrades or enhancements to the technology or capability of a 
defense article or service which already has been notified to 
the Committee pursuant to section 36(c) of the Arms Export 
Control Act (which relates to commercial arms sales).

                  UNAUTHORIZED USE OF DEFENSE ARTICLES

      Section 1225 amends section 3 of the Arms Export Control 
Act to require formal agreement between the United States and 
recipient nations that the United States retains the right to 
verify credible reports that United States Munitions List 
articles have been used for unauthorized purposes. Section 4 of 
the AECA enumerates the purposes for which defense articles may 
be furnished, including internal security and legitimate self-
defense. Therefore, although it may prove difficult, the 
executive branch must ensure that defense articles are used 
only for these or other permitted activities, and not for non-
authorized actions (such as torture and the violation of human 
rights).

         Stockpiling of Defense Articles for Foreign Countries

      ADDITIONS TO UNITED STATES WAR RESERVE STOCKPILES FOR ALLIES

      Pursuant to section 514 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, the Department of Defense can only make additions to War 
Reserve Stockpiles for Allies as specifically provided for in 
legislation. Section 1231, proposed by the House, authorizes 
the President to make $40,000,000 in additions to stockpiles in 
Korea and $20,000,000 in Thailand for fiscal year 2000.
      The War Reserve Stockpiles for Allies programs in both 
Korea and Thailand directly support the United States strategy 
of forward engagement in the Pacific theater. Both the Republic 
of Korea and the Government of Thailand assume the cost of 
storage, maintenance and security of these stockpiles, thereby 
saving the United States significant operating expenses. These 
stocks directly support the U.S. plans for the defense of 
Korea. They also help to ensure continued access to staging 
facilities in Thailand (which have become all the more 
important with the loss of base rights in the Philippines).
      Stockpiles enable equipment and supplies to be pre-
positioned in key parts of the world to enhance U.S. and host 
country defense readiness. While items in the stockpiles remain 
the property of the United States Government, they can be set 
aside for use by host nation forces in accordance with section 
514(a) of the FAA. Since 1972 the United States has maintained 
a war stockpile in the Republic of Korea, placing obsolete or 
excess munitions in storage as military requirements 
determined. The stockpile in Thailand has been maintained since 
1987.
      Section 1231 will enable the United States to avoid the 
maintenance, storage, transportation, and demilitarization 
costs of excess munitions by transferring these items to Korea. 
By agreement with the Government of Korea, United States 
payment of the storage of assets designated as war reserve 
stockpiles is deferred until the United States uses or sells 
the munitions to another country, although the assets remain 
under U.S. title at all times.
      While excess and obsolete munitions could be disposed of 
through either foreign military sales or demilitarization, 
neither option is optimal. Foreign military sales to other 
countries are limited due to the extra cost incurred by the 
buyer to transport the munitions from the Korean peninsula. 
Demilitarization is a very slow and expensive process. The cost 
to the United States Army to retrograde to the United States 
and demilitarize the munitions covered by section 1231 would 
also prove significant. Transfer of excess and obsolete 
munitions to the Korean War Reserve Stockpile, however, will 
result in the avoidance of those costs, increase storage space 
for U.S. Forces Korea, and improve the warfighting readiness of 
the Republic of Korea and the Combined Forces Command.
      The additional $20,000,000 authorization for Thailand is 
required to fulfill expected U.S. obligations under the 
Memorandum of Understanding establishing the Thai War Reserve 
Stockpiles program. It is expected that the U.S. contribution 
will be matched dollar-for-dollar by the Government of 
Thailand.

  TRANSFER OF CERTAIN OBSOLETE OR SURPLUS DEFENSE ARTICLES IN THE WAR 
                     RESERVES STOCKPILE FOR ALLIES

      Section 1232 provides authority to the United States 
Armed Forces to transfer obsolete or surplus stocks out of the 
War Reserve Stockpiles in Korea and Thailand. In exchange for 
providing these stocks to Korea and Thailand, the United States 
will negotiate concessions in theform of cash compensation, 
services, waiver of charges otherwise payable by the U.S. Government, 
and other items of value. During 1995 and 1996, the U.S. Government 
traded $66,620,000 in obsolete and surplus equipment to the Republic of 
Korea for a like sum in concessions. These concessions included 
reclamation of equipment that was deemed surplus or obsolete but for 
which a need subsequently arose, minus the costs associated with 
storing the items by the Republic of Korea. Additionally, the Republic 
of Korea demilitarized equipment at no cost to the United States and 
accepted older equipment such as the M48A5 tanks and the M-110A2 
Howitzer from the stockpiles which were missing spares and no longer 
supportable.
      Section 1232 requires fair market value compensation to 
the United States for surplus and obsolete munitions. It also 
will relieve the U.S. Government of financial indebtedness for 
back storage costs and other stockpile maintenance costs, and 
save millions in cost avoidance to demilitarize, destroy, or 
retrograde the munitions and equipment back to the United 
States.
      Section 1232 requires the Department of Defense to submit 
a report to the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and 
the International Relations Committee of the House of 
Representatives at least 30 days prior to any transfer by the 
Department of Defense to the Republic of Korea or the 
Government of Thailand, detailing such transfer and the 
negotiated concessions for excess or obsolete equipment. A more 
comprehensive accounting of such concessions is expected than 
was previously provided pursuant to authority contained in the 
Fiscal Year 1994-95 Foreign Relations Authorization Act (Public 
Law 103-236).

                       Defense Offsets Disclosure

                 DEFENSE OFFSETS DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1999

      Subtitle D of Title XII (sections 1241-1248) establishes 
United States policy on economic offsets, revises executive 
branch reporting requirements to Congress on such matters, 
expands the existing prohibition within the Arms Export Control 
Act relating to incentive payments, and establishes a National 
Commission on the Use of Offsets in Defense Trade to assess all 
aspects of the issue.
      The term ``offsets'' refers to the practice by foreign 
countries of demanding economic concessions as incentives to 
buy U.S. defense products. Notably, the demand by foreign 
nations for ``offsets'' in defense trade costs jobs and hurts 
the United States economy.
      However, it is also noted that, in this highly-
competitive era, offsets may prove necessary. As long as 
foreign competitors are willing to offer economic concessions 
and incentives, U.S. companies risk losing important sales if 
they refuse to do likewise. The Defense Offsets Disclosure Act 
of 1999 adopts a prudent, business-friendly approach to a 
matter that is of extreme sensitivity to United States 
companies. While the long-term objective of Subtitle D is to 
curtail the use of offsets in defense trade, as a practical 
matter the Act simply establishes a process whereby the 
President should seek multilateral agreement on standards for 
the use of offsets and may, if he concurs with the findings of 
a commission of experts, commence negotiation of a treaty to 
address the issue.

         Automated Export System Relating to Export Information

            PROLIFERATION PREVENTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1999

      Subtitle E of Title XII (sections 1251-1256) creates an 
electronic filing system for shippers export declarations made 
to the U.S. Customs Service. Specifically, the Act mandates use 
of an automated export system that has been in existence since 
1995, but which is only used by roughly 10 percent of the U.S. 
shipping community. Creation of an internet-based electronic 
system will enable the United States Government to track 
sophisticated efforts by nations to acquire sensitive 
technology. Currently, the United States is hampered in its 
efforts to track foreign acquisition efforts because the 
current export declaration process is paper-intensive, and 
because foreign nations seldom engage in ``one stop shopping.'' 
Indeed, many nations engage in diffuse procurement schemes to 
acquire components and materials from a wide array of sources. 
It is very difficult for those agencies within the executive 
branch tasked with monitoring foreign weapons programs to cull 
through mountains of paper to discover important patterns and 
linkages.
      The establishment of an internet system will assist in 
this effort. It also will, in the long-run, prove more 
``business friendly'' than the current system. Section 1252 
ensures that ``on-line'' help is given to those who must use 
the system, which must be secure and capable of handling the 
expected volume of information, and allows for printed hard 
copies of documents for business records. The Department of 
Commerce is expected to keep the Foreign Relations Committee of 
the Senate and the International Relations Committee of the 
House completely informed on the system's electronic 
architecture, and section 1254 requires the Department of 
Commerce to consult with other relevant agencies and submit a 
report on how the system can be optimized for law enforcement 
and nonproliferation purposes, consistent with the need to 
ensure the confidentiality of business information.
      Section 1255 also addresses concerns of the U.S. business 
community by eliminating current salary limitations for the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls of the Department of State. 
These limitations, imposed by the Office of Personnel 
Management, have severely impaired the ability of ODTC to 
recruit and retain licensing officers and other individuals. It 
is anticipated that the flexibility provided under section 
1255, together with the additional resources made available to 
ODTC under section 1310, will enable the Department of State to 
improve the efficiency of ODTC.

          INTERNATIONAL ARMS SALES CODE OF CONDUCT ACT OF 1999

      Subtitle F of Title XII (sections 1261 and 1262) directs 
the President to pursue negotiations to establish an 
international regime to promote global transparency with 
respect to arms transfers, and to limit, restrict, or prohibit 
arms transfers to countries that do not observe certain 
fundamentals of human liberty, peace, and international 
stability. While the President is given discretion in preparing 
a United States negotiating position, section 1262(b) 
enumerates criteria which should factor prominently.
      In order to maintain momentum for negotiation of an 
international code of conduct, section 1612(c) requires 
frequent reports detailing the progress made, if any, 
throughout such negotiations. Further, this section directs 
that the annual human rights report prepared pursuant to the 
Foreign Assistance Act describe the extent to which foreign 
nations meet the criteriaestablished under section 1262(b).

         Transfer of Naval Vessels to Certain Foreign Countries

                  AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER NAVAL VESSELS

      Section 1271 makes technical and conforming amendments to 
existing law relating to the transfer of naval vessels to 
foreign nations. Transfers of naval vessels, like the transfer 
of all military equipment, are subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and 
International Relations of the House of Representatives. 
However, for budgetary scoring reasons, the Congressional 
defense committees authorized a series of ship transfers under 
section 1018 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2000. That section authorizes the Secretary of the 
Navy to transfer naval vessels when, in fact, the authority 
should be given to the President in order to remain consistent 
with the requirements of the Foreign Assistance Act and the 
Arms Export Control Act. Section 1271 makes this minor 
technical amendment; it also transfers the authority to exempt 
naval vessel transfers from excess defense article limitations 
from the defense bill to the foreign affairs bill, which is the 
appropriate legislative vehicle for such an authority.

                        Miscellaneous Provisions

                PUBLICATION OF ARMS SALES CERTIFICATIONS

      Section 1301 amends section 36 of the Arms Export Control 
Act to ensure that the full unclassified text of all 
certifications of arms sales, including foreign military sales, 
commercial sales, and the provision of defense services, is 
published in the Federal Register in a timely fashion. This 
section also requires that if portions of such certifications 
are classified, pursuant to section 36(b) and (c), the 
classified information be accompanied by a description of the 
damage to the national security that could be expected to 
result from public disclosure of the information.

  NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL EXPORT OF ITEMS ON UNITED 
                         STATES MUNITIONS LIST

      Section 1302 requires U.S. commercial defense exporters 
to submit information to the Department of State which will 
help to improve arms export shipment data. This provision is 
necessary to address the long-standing problem of incomplete 
commercial arms delivery data.

                 ENFORCEMENT OF ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT

      Section 1303 strengthens enforcement of civil violations 
of the Arms Export Control Act. The Department of State relies 
on the Department of Justice to prosecute criminal violations 
of the AECA, but lacks resources to pursue administrative 
proceedings relating to civil violations as vigorously as would 
be desired.
      In order to streamline the procedures in a manner that 
would continue to ensure a fair opportunity for persons and 
firms to represent their views, while simultaneously 
encouraging the viable and vigorous enforcement that is 
critical to protecting U.S. national security, the Secretary of 
State is provided with authority similar to that used to 
enforce other statutes, including the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act, to assess civil penalties directly in 
accordance with regulations. It is expected that the Department 
of State will still be required to commence a civil action in 
order to recover such any such disputed penalties, thereby 
continuing to afford parties an opportunity to contest the 
assessment in court. It is further expected that the Department 
will provide draft regulations proposed to implement this 
section to the Committees on International Relations and 
Foreign Relations for review, thereby affording defense 
exporters the ability to provide input. Such regulations should 
permit the parties to explain their actions and make known 
their views fully through written submissions and provide ample 
opportunity for settlement.
      This provision is not intended to erode due process for 
defense exporters, and such exporters, under regulations 
promulgated to implement this section, will be provided a fair 
and transparent process to understand and address any charges 
being asserted against them.

         VIOLATIONS RELATING TO MATERIAL SUPPORT TO TERRORISTS

      Section 1304 modifies section 38 of the Arms Export 
Control Act to ensure that the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
within the Department of State, which issues commercial defense 
export licenses, is fully informed of any person that is 
subject to an indictment or has been convicted of a violation 
of law regarding providing material support to terrorists.

AUTHORITY TO CONSENT TO THIRD PARTY TRANSFER OF EX-U.S.S. BOWMAN COUNTY 
                     TO USS LST SHIP MEMORIAL, INC.

      Section 1305 enables a nonprofit veterans association to 
bring back to the United States from Greece a World War II Tank 
Landing Ship--the ex-U.S.S. Bowman County. This vessel will 
have its guns demilitarized prior to re-transfer and will be 
transformed into a movable museum that will dock at 
predetermined locations to teach children, and adults, about 
the crucial role played by tank landing ships and their crews 
during the Second World War. There is no more fitting a war 
memorial than a museum that is owned and operated by a group of 
its own veterans who are willing to dedicate their time to 
educating the citizens of the United States.

                   ANNUAL MILITARY ASSISTANCE REPORT

      Section 1306 expands and clarifies the information 
relating to military assistance and military exports that the 
President is required to transmit to Congress each February 1, 
pursuant to section 655 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. 
Currently, this report includes information about the 
International Military Education and Training (IMET) program, 
but not about other military education and training activities 
that the United States conducts with foreign countries. It is 
intended that future reports include information about 
activities under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, such as the 
Military-to-Military Contacts Program (MMCP) and the Joint 
Combined ExchangeTraining (JCET) program. This provision is not 
intended, however, to cover joint military exercises or NATO 
operations.
      Section 1306 also requires separate identification of 
defense articles furnished with the financial assistance of the 
U.S. government, such as Foreign Military Financing loans and 
U.S. government-backed loan guarantees. These items are 
currently grouped together with commercial sales. Finally, the 
provision requires that the report be published in unclassified 
form on the internet through the State Department.

                ANNUAL FOREIGN MILITARY TRAINING REPORT

      Section 1307 creates a new report to be jointly prepared 
by the Departments of State and Defense. The report is to cover 
all military training provided to foreign military personnel by 
the Departments of Defense and State. The provision also 
requires that the report be published in unclassified form on 
the State Department's internet website.

                SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR THE PHILIPPINES

      Section 1308 establishes United States policy for the 
transfer of excess defense articles to the Philippines and 
authorizes $5,000,000 in foreign military financing for each of 
fiscal years 2000 and 2001. The section encourages the 
President to transfer to the Philippines, on a grant basis, UH-
1H helicopters, A-4 aircraft, amphibious landing craft, and 
other naval vessels that become available under the excess 
defense articles program. Section 1309 is viewed as a way of 
expressing Congressional support for reinvigorating our 
security relationship with the Philippines.

          EFFECTIVE REGULATION OF SATELLITE EXPORT ACTIVITIES

      Section 1309 establishes a requirement for the Department 
of State to expedite the export of commercial communications 
satellites (and related equipment) to NATO and major non-NATO 
allies when appropriate. It is intended that the determination 
of appropriateness reside with the Department of State. Section 
1309 establishes four criteria that should denote a satellite 
or satellite-related license as eligible for expedited 
consideration. However, section 1309 makes clear that U.S. 
national security considerations and U.S. obligations under the 
Missile Technology Control Regime are given priority in the 
evaluation of any license, regardless of its end-user or time-
sensitive nature. Further, the provision makes clear that the 
Department of State is, at all times, to provide such time as 
is necessary for U.S. national security agencies to fully 
review a license.
      Section 1309 also seeks to expedite the licensing of 
United States Munitions List items across the board by applying 
additional resources to the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
within the Department of State. The provision authorizes 
$9,000,000 for ODTC for each of fiscal years 2000 and 2001. 
Additional resources are intended to be used to hire licensing 
officers and enforcement personnel, and to update ODTC's 
computer systems. Frequent, periodic briefings on ODTC plans 
and expenditures are expected and there is interest in progress 
toward implementing an internet-based filing and review system 
for Munitions List items.

      STUDY ON LICENSING PROCESS UNDER THE ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT

      Section 1310 requests that the Department of State 
undertake a highly-technical, highly-detailed analysis of the 
defense trade licensed by the Department of State. The broad 
scope of the information sought under section 1310 is intended 
to provide the Congress with information that will assist the 
committees of jurisdiction in working with the Department of 
State to improve the licensing process.

             REPORT CONCERNING PROLIFERATION OF SMALL ARMS

      Section 1311 requires the Department of State to complete 
an analysis of the global trade in small arms. The illicit 
transfer of small and light arms constitutes a source of global 
instability, but recognize that the monitoring of such 
trafficking is difficult. It is expected that Assistant 
Secretary for Verification and Compliance to be responsible for 
preparing portions of this report, including that relating to 
United States monitoring of the compliance of foreign 
governments with their commitments under international 
agreements.

                          CONFORMING AMENDMENT

      Section 1312 is a conforming amendment to the Fiscal Year 
1999 Defense Authorization Act. Specifically, section 1312 
ensures that the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and 
the International Relations Committee of the House will be 
notified of developments in the pursuit of alternatives to 
anti-personnel land mines.

                       SENSE OF CONGRESS LANGUAGE

      Sense of Senate or Sense of the Congress provisions 
approved in previous authorization bills were not included in 
the final bill. The House and Senate provisions, as passed, 
reflect the views of each of the respective houses of Congress.
      The conference agreement would enact the provisions of 
H.R. 3428, as introduced on November 17, 1999. The text of that 
bill follows:

A BILL To provide for the modification and implementation of the final 
rule for the consolidation and reform of Federal milk marketing orders, 
                         and for other purposes

      Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. USE OF OPTION 1A AS PRICE STRUCTURE FOR CLASS I MILK UNDER 
                    CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDERS.

    (a) Final Rule Defined.--In this section, the term ``final 
rule'' means the final rule for the consolidation and reform of 
Federal milk marketing orders that was published in the Federal 
Register on September 1, 1999 (64 Fed. Reg. 47897-48021), to 
comply with section 143 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement 
and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 7253).
    (b) Implementation of Final Rule for Milk Order Reform.--
Subject to subsection (c), the final rule shall take effect, 
and be implemented by the Secretary of Agriculture, on the 
first day of the first month beginning at least 30 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Use of Option 1A for Pricing Class I Milk.--In lieu of 
the Class I price differentials specified in the final rule, 
the Secretary of Agriculture shall price fluid or Class I milk 
under the Federal milk marketing orders using the Class I price 
differentials identified as Option 1A ``Location-Specific 
Differentials Analysis'' in the proposed rule published in the 
Federal Register on January 30, 1998 (63 Fed. Reg. 4802, 4809), 
except that the Secretary shall include the corrections and 
modifications to such Class I differentials made by the 
Secretary through April 2, 1999.
    (d) Effect of Prior Announcement of Minimum Prices.--If the 
Secretary of Agriculture announces minimum prices for milk 
under Federal milk marketing orders pursuant to section 1000.50 
of title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, before the effective 
date specified in subsection (b), the minimum prices so 
announced before that date shall be the only applicable minimum 
prices under Federal milk marketing orders for the month or 
months for which the prices have been announced.
    (e) Implementation of Requirement.--The implementation of 
the final rule, as modified by subsection (c), shall not be 
subject to any of the following:
            (1) The notice and hearing requirements of section 
        8c(3) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 
        608c(3)), reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural 
        Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, or the notice and 
        comment provisions of section 553 of title 5, United 
        States Code.
            (2) A referendum conducted by the Secretary of 
        Agriculture pursuant to subsections (17) or (19) of 
        section 8c of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 
        608c), reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural 
        Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.
            (3) The Statement of Policy of the Secretary of 
        Agriculture effective July 24, 1971 (36 Fed. Reg. 
        13804), relating to notices of proposed rulemaking and 
        public participation in rulemaking.
            (4) Chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code 
        (commonly known as the Paperwork Reduction Act).
            (5) Any decision, restraining order, or injunction 
        issued by a United States court before the date of the 
        enactment of this Act.

SEC. 2. FURTHER RULEMAKING TO DEVELOP PRICING METHODS FOR CLASS III AND 
                    CLASS IV MILK UNDER MARKETING ORDERS.

    (a) Congressional Finding.--The Class III and Class IV milk 
pricing formulas included in the final decision for the 
consolidation and reform of Federal milk marketing orders, as 
published in the Federal Register on April 2, 1999 (64 Fed. 
Reg. 16025), do not adequately reflect public comment on the 
original proposed rule published in the Federal Register on 
January 30, 1998 (63 Fed. Reg. 4802), and are sufficiently 
different from the proposed rule and any comments submitted 
with regard to the proposed rule that further emergency 
rulemaking is merited.
    (b) Rulemaking Required.--The Secretary of Agriculture 
shall conduct rulemaking, on the record after an opportunity 
for an agency hearing, to reconsider the Class III and Class IV 
milk pricing formulas included in the final rule for the 
consolidation and reform of Federal milk marketing orders that 
was published in the Federal Register on September 1, 1999 (64 
Fed. Reg. 47897-48021).
    (c) Time Period for Rulemaking.--On December 1, 2000, the 
Secretary of Agriculture shall publish in the Federal Register 
a final decision on the Class III and Class IV milk pricing 
formulas. The resulting formulas shall take effect, and be 
implemented by the Secretary, on January 1, 2001.
    (d) Effect of Court Order.--The actions authorized by 
subsections (b) and (c) are intended to ensure the timely 
publication and implementation of new pricing formulas for 
Class III and Class IV milk. In the event that the Secretary of 
Agriculture is enjoined or otherwise restrained by a court 
order from implementing a final decision within the time period 
specified in subsection (c), the length of time for which that 
injunction or other restraining order is effective shall be 
added to the time limitations specified in subsection (c) 
thereby extending those time limitations by a period of time 
equal to the period of time for which the injunction or other 
restraining order is effective.
    (e) Failure To Timely Complete Rulemaking.--If the 
Secretary of Agriculture fails to implement new Class III and 
Class IV milk pricing formulas within the time period required 
under subsection (c) (plus any additional period provided under 
subsection (d)), the Secretary may not assess or collect 
assessments from milk producers or handlers under section 8c of 
the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 608c), reenacted with 
amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 
for marketing order administration and services provided under 
such section after the end of that period until the pricing 
formulas are implemented. The Secretary may not reduce the 
level of services provided under that section on account of the 
prohibition against assessments, but shall rather cover the 
cost of marketing order administration and services through 
funds available for the Agricultural Marketing Service of the 
Department.
    (f) Implementation of Requirement.--The implementation of 
the final decision on new Class III and Class IV milk pricing 
formulas shall not be subject to congressional review under 
chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code.

SEC. 3. DAIRY FORWARD PRICING PROGRAM.

    The Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), 
reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing 
Agreement Act of 1937, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new section:

``SEC. 23. DAIRY FORWARD PRICING PILOT PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Pilot Program Required.--Not later than 90 days after 
the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary of 
Agriculture shall establish a temporary pilot program under 
which milk producers and cooperatives are authorized to 
voluntarily enter into forward price contracts with milk 
handlers.
    ``(b) Minimum Milk Price Requirements.--Payments made by 
milk handlers to milk producers and cooperatives, and prices 
received by milk producers and cooperatives, under the forward 
contracts shall be deemed to satisfy--
            ``(1) all regulated minimum milk price requirements 
        of paragraphs (B) and (F) of subsection (5) of section 
        8c; and
            ``(2) the requirement of paragraph (C) of such 
        subsection regarding total payments by each handler.
    ``(c) Milk Covered by Pilot Program.--
            ``(1) Covered milk.--The pilot program shall apply 
        only with respect to the marketing of federally 
        regulated milk that--
                    ``(A) is not classified as Class I milk or 
                otherwise intended for fluid use; and
                    ``(B) is in the current of interstate or 
                foreign commerce or directly burdens, 
                obstructs, or affects interstate or foreign 
                commerce in federally regulated milk.
            ``(2) Relation to class i milk.--To assist milk 
        handlers in complying with the limitation in paragraph 
        (1)(A) without having to segregate or otherwise 
        individually track the source and disposition of milk, 
        a milk handler may allocate milk receipts from 
        producers, cooperatives, and other sources that are not 
        subject to a forward contract to satisfy the handler's 
        obligations with regard to Class I milk usage.
    ``(d) Duration.--The authority of the Secretary of 
Agriculture to carry out the pilot program shall terminate on 
December 31, 2004. No forward price contract entered into under 
the program may extend beyond that date.
    ``(e) Study and Report on Effect of Pilot Program.--
            ``(1) Study.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall 
        conduct a study on forward contracting between milk 
        producers and cooperatives and milk handlers to 
        determine the impact on milk prices paid to producers 
        in the United States. To obtain information for the 
        study, the Secretary may use the authorities available 
        to the Secretary under section 8d, subject to the 
        confidentiality requirements of subsection (2) of such 
        section.
            ``(2) Report.--Not later than April 30, 2002, the 
        Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture, 
        Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate and the Committee 
        on Agriculture of the House of Representatives a report 
        containing the results of the study.''.

                    DAIRY COMPACT.

Stations by Satellite Carriers.--A secondary transmission of a 
performance or display of a work embodied in a primary 
transmission of a television broadcast station into the 
station's local market shall be subject to statutory licensing 
under this section if--
            ``(1) the secondary transmission is made by a 
        satellite carrier to the public;

    ``(b) Reporting Requirements.--
            ``(1) Initial lists.--A satellite carrier that 
        makes secondary transmissions of a primary transmission 
        made by a network station under subsection (a) shall, 
        within 90 days after commencing such secondary 
        transmissions, submit to the network that owns or is 
        affiliated with the network station a list identifying 
        (by name in alphabetical order and street address, 
        including county and zip code) all subscribers to which 
        the satellite carrier makes secondary transmissions of 
        that primary transmission under subsection (a).
            ``(2) Subsequent lists.--After the list is 
        submitted under paragraph (1), the satellite carrier 
        shall, on the 15th of each month, submit to the network 
        a list identifying (by name in alphabetical order and 
        street address, including county and zip code) any 
        subscribers who have been added or dropped as 
        subscribers since the last submission under this

            ``(4) Requirements of networks.--The submission 
        requirements of this subsection shall apply to a 
        satellite carrier only if the network to which the 
        submissions are to be made places on file with the 
        Register of Copyrights a document identifying the name 
        and address of the person to whom such submissions are 
        to be made. The Register of Copyrights shall maintain 
        for public inspection a file of all such documents.

secondary transmissions are subject to statutory licensing 
under subsection (a) shall have no royalty obligation for such 
secondary transmissions.
    ``(d) Noncompliance With Reporting and Regulatory 
Requirements.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the willful or 
repeated secondary transmission to the public by a satellite 
carrier into the local market of a television broadcast station 
of a primary transmission embodying a performance or display of 
a work made by that television broadcast station is actionable 
as an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully 
subject to the remedies provided under sections 502 through 506 
and 509, if the satellite carrier has not complied with the 
reporting requirements of subsection (b) or with the rules, 
regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications 
Commission concerning the carriage of television broadcast 
signals.
    ``(e) Willful Alterations.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), 
the secondary transmission to the public by a satellite carrier 
into the local market of a television broadcast station of a 
performance or display of a work embodied in a primary 
transmission made by that television broadcast station is 
actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is 
fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 
506 and sections 509 and 510, if the content of the particular 
program in which the performance or display is embodied, or any 
commercial advertising or station announcement transmitted by 
the primary transmitter during, or immediately before or after, 
the transmission of such program, is in any way willfully 
altered by the satellite carrier through changes, deletions, or 
additions, or is combined with programming from any other 
broadcast signal.

        broadcast station to a subscriber who does not reside 
        in that station's local market, and is not subject to

        of a work made by a television broadcast station to 
        subscribers who do not reside in that station's local 
        market, and are not subject to statutory licensing 
        under section 119 or a private licensing agreement,

consideration in exchange either for carriage of local 
television broadcast stations in fulfillment of the 
requirements of this section or for channel positioning rights 
provided to such stations under this section, except that any 
such station may be required to bear the costs associated with 
delivering a good quality signal to the local receive facility 
of the satellite carrier.
    ``(f ) Remedies.--
            ``(1) Complaints by broadcast stations.--Whenever a 
        local television broadcast station believes that a 
        satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations 
        under subsections (b) through (e) of this section, such 
        station shall notify the carrier, in writing, of the 
        alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing 
        that the satellite carrier failed to comply with such 
        obligations. The satellite carrier shall, within 30 
        days after such written notification, respond in 
        writing to such notification and comply with such 
        obligations or state its reasons for believing that it 
        is in compliance with such obligations. A local 
        television broadcast station that disputes a response 
        by a satellite carrier that it is in compliance with 
        such obligations may obtain review of such denial or 
        response by filing a complaint with the Commission. 
        Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such 
        satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations 
        and the basis for such allegations.
            ``(2) Opportunity to respond.--The Commission shall 
        afford the satellite carrier against which a complaint 
        is filed under paragraph (1) an opportunity to present 
        data and arguments to establish that there has been no 
        failure to meet its obligations under this section.
            ``(3) Remedial actions; dismissal.--Within 120 days 
        after the date a complaint is filed under paragraph 
        (1), the Commission shall determine whether the 
        satellite carrier has met its obligations under 
        subsections (b) through (e). If the Commission 
        determines that the satellite carrier has failed to 
        meet such obligations, the Commission shall order the 
        satellite carrier to take appropriate remedial action. 
        If the Commission determines that the satellite carrier 
        has fully met the requirements of such subsections, the 
        Commission shall dismiss the complaint.
    ``(g) Regulations by Commission.--Within 1 year after the 
date of the enactment of this section, the Commission shall 
issue regulations implementing this section following a 
rulemaking proceeding. The regulations prescribed under this 
section shall include requirements on satellite carriers that 
are comparable to the requirements on cable operators under

        States Code, within 1 year after the date of the 
        enactment of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act 
        of 1999, the Commission shall conclude an inquiry to 
        evaluate all possible standards and factors for 
        determining eligibility for retransmissions of the 
        signals of network stations, and, if appropriate--
                    ``(A) recommend modifications to the Grade 
                B intensity standard for analog signals set 
                forth in section 73.683(a) of its regulations

        retransmission of a signal of a network station under 
        section 119 of title 17, United States Code, may 
        request a waiver from such denial by submitting a 
        request, through such subscriber's satellitecarrier, to 
the network station asserting that the retransmission is prohibited. 
The network station shall accept or reject a subscriber's request for a 
waiver within 30 days after receipt of the request. The subscriber 
shall be permitted to receive such retransmission under section 
119(d)(10)(B) of title 17, United States Code, if such station agrees 
to the waiver request and files with the satellite carrier a written 
waiver with respect to that subscriber allowing the subscriber to 
receive such retransmission. If a television network station fails to 
accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within the 30-day 
period after receipt of the request, that station shall be deemed to 
agree to the waiver request and have filed such written waiver.

        necessary, including any reconsideration, to develop 
        and prescribe by rule a point-to-point predictive model 
        for reliably and presumptively determining the ability 
        of individual locations to receive signals in 
        accordance with the signal intensity standard in effect 
        under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, United States 
        Code. In prescribing such model, the Commission shall 
        rely on the Individual Location Longley-Rice model set 
        forth by the Federal Communications Commission in 
        Docket No. 98-201 and ensure that such model takes into 
        account terrain, building structures, and other land 
        cover variations. The Commission shall establish

section338 shall not apply to the carriage of the signal of such 
station by such satellite carrier.'';
            (4) in paragraph (5), by striking ``614 or 615'' 
        and inserting ``338, 614, or 615''; and
            (5) by adding at the end the following new 
        paragraph:
            ``(7) For purposes of this subsection, the term--

        $25,000 per violation, in accordance with paragraph 
        (5), and the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the

        government officials, official candidates, and 
        potential official candidates for Federal, State, or

        electoral process or the public's ability to access 
        accurate and reliable information regarding such 
        individuals;
            (5) existing remedies, whether under State law or 
        otherwise, and the extent to which such remedies are

        under the patent to the extent such rights would have 
        been exhausted had such sale or other disposition been 
        made by the patent owner.
            ``(3) Limitations and qualifications of defense.--
        The defense to infringement under this section is 
        subject to the following:
                    ``(A) Patent.--A person may not assert the 
                defense under this section unless the invention 
                for which the defense is asserted is for a 
                method.
                    ``(B) Derivation.--A person may not assert 
                the defense under this section if the subject 
                matter on which the defense is based was 
                derived from the patentee or persons in privity 
                with the patentee.
                    ``(C) Not a general license.--The defense 
                asserted by a person under this section is not 
                a general license under all claims of the 
                patent at issue, but extends only to the 
                specific subject matter claimed in the patent 
                with respect to which the person can assert a 
                defense under this chapter, except that the 
                defense shall also extend to variations in the 
                quantity or volume of use of the claimed 
                subject matter, and to improvements in the 
                claimed subject matter that do not infringe 
                additional specifically claimed subject matter 
                of the patent.
            ``(4) Burden of proof.--A person asserting the 
        defense under this section shall have the burden of 
        establishing the defense by clear and convincing 
        evidence.
            ``(5) Abandonment of use.--A person who has 
        abandoned commercial use of subject matter may not rely 
        on activities performed before the date of such 
        abandonment in establishing a defense under this 
        section with respect to actions taken after the date of 
        such abandonment.
            ``(6) Personal defense.--The defense under this 
        section may be asserted only by the person who 
        performed the acts necessary to establish the 
defenseand, except for any transfer to the patent owner, the right to 
assert the defense shall not be licensed or assigned or transferred to 
another person except as an ancillary and subordinate part of a good 
faith assignment or transfer for other reasons of the entire enterprise 
or line of business to which the defense relates.
            ``(7) Limitation on sites.--A defense under this 
        section, when acquired as part of a good faith 
        assignment or transfer of an entire enterprise or line 
        of business to which the defense relates, may only be 
        asserted for uses at sites where the subject matter 
        that would otherwise infringe one or more of the claims 
        is in use before the later of the effective filing date 
        of the patent or the date of the assignment or transfer 
        of such enterprise or line of business.
            ``(8) Unsuccessful assertion of defense.--If the 
        defense under this section is pleaded by a person who 
        is found to infringe the patent and who subsequently 
        fails to demonstrate a reasonable basis for asserting 
        the defense, the court shall find the case exceptional 
        for the purpose of awarding attorney fees under section 
        285 of this title.
            ``(9) Invalidity.--A patent shall not be deemed to 
        be invalid under section 102 or 103 of this title 
        solely because a defense is raised or established under 
        this section.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections at the 
beginning of chapter 28 of title 35, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following new item:

``273. Defense to infringement based on earlier inventor.''.

        applicant, an application may be published earlier than 
        the end of such 18-month period.
            ``(B) No information concerning published patent 
        applications shall be made available to the public

            ``(2) Exceptions.--(A) An application shall not be 
        published if that application is--
                    ``(i) no longer pending;
                    ``(ii) subject to a secrecy order under 
                section 181 of this title;
                    ``(iii) a provisional application filed 
                under section 111(b) of this title; or
                    ``(iv) an application for a design patent 
                filed under chapter 16 of this title.
            ``(B)(i) If an applicant makes a request upon 
        filing, certifying that the invention disclosed in the 
        application has not and will not be the subject of an 
        application filed in another country, or under a 
        multilateral international agreement, that requires 
        publication of applications 18 months after filing, the 
        application shall not be published as provided in 
        paragraph (1).
            ``(ii) An applicant may rescind a request made 
        under clause (i) at any time.
            ``(iii) An applicant who has made a request under 
        clause (i) but who subsequently files, in a foreign 
        country or under a multilateral international agreement 
        specified in clause (i), an application directed to the 
        invention disclosed in the application filed in the 
        Patent and Trademark Office, shall notify the Director 
        of such filing not later than 45 days after the date of 
        the filing of such foreign or international 
        application. A failure of the applicant to provide such 
        notice within the prescribed period shall result in the 
        application being regarded as abandoned, unless it is 
        shown to the satisfaction of the Director that the 
        delay in submitting the notice was unintentional.
            ``(iv) If an applicant rescinds a request made 
        under clause (i) or notifies the Director that an 
        application was filed in a foreign country or under a 
        multilateral international agreement specified in 
        clause (i), the application shall be published in 
        accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) on oras 
soon as is practical after the date that is specified in clause (i).

        or more foreign countries, directly or through a 
        multilateral international agreement, and such foreign 
        filed applications corresponding to an application 
        filed in the Patent and Trademark Office or the 
        description of the invention in such foreign filed 
        applications is less extensive than the application or 
        description of the invention in the application filed 
        in the Patent and Trademark Office, the applicant may 
        submit a redacted copy of the application filed in the 
        Patent and Trademark Office eliminating any part or 
        description of the invention in such application that 
        is not also contained in any of the corresponding 
        applications filed in a foreign country. The Director 
        may only publish the redacted copy of the application 
        unless the redacted copy of the application is not 
        received within 16 months after the earliest effective 
        filing date for which a benefit is sought under this 
        title. The provisions of section 154(d) shall not apply 
        to a claim if the description of the invention 
        published in the redacted application filed under this 
        clause with respect to the claim does not enable a 
        person skilled in the art to make and use the subject 
        matter of the claim.
    ``(c) Protest and Pre-Issuance Opposition.--The Director 
shall establish appropriate procedures to ensure that no 
protest or other form of pre-issuance opposition to the grant 
of a patent on an application may be initiated after 
publication of the application without the express written 
consent of the applicant.
    ``(d) National Security.--No application for patent shall 
be published under subsection (b)(1) if the publication or 
disclosure of such invention would be detrimental to the 
national security. The Director shall establish appropriate 
procedures to ensure that such applications are promptly 
identified and the secrecy of such inventions is maintained in 
accordance with chapter 17 of this title.''.
    (b) Study.--
            (1) In general.--The Comptroller General shall 
        conduct a 3-year study of the applicants who file only 
        in the United States on or after the effective date of 
        this subtitle and shall provide the results of such 
        study to the Judiciary Committees of the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate.
            (2) Contents.--The study conducted under paragraph 
        (1) shall--
                    (A) consider the number of such applicants 
                in relation to the number of applicants who 
                file in the United States and outside of the 
                United States;
                    (B) examine how many domestic-only filers 
                request at the time of filing not to be 
                published;
                    (C) examine how many such filers rescind 
                that request or later choose to file abroad;
                    (D) examine the status of the entity 
                seeking an application and any correlation that 
                may exist between such status and the 
                publication of patent applications; and
                    (E) examine the abandonment/issuance ratios 
                and length of application pendency before 
                patent issuance or abandonment for published 
                versus unpublished applications.

and Trademark Office, identifying the foreign application by 
specifying the application number on that foreign application, 
the intellectual property authority or country in or for which 
the application was filed, and the date of filing the 
application, at such time during the pendency of the 
application as required by the Director.
    ``(2) The Director may consider the failure of the 
applicant to file a timely claim for priority as a waiver of 
any such claim. The Director may establish procedures, 
including the payment of a surcharge, to accept an 
unintentionally delayed claim under this section.
    ``(3) The Director may require a certified copy of the 
original foreign application, specification, and drawings upon 
which it is based, a translation if not in the English 
language, and such other information as the Director considers 
necessary. Any such certification shall be made by the foreign 
intellectual property authority in which the foreign 
application was filed and show the date of the application and 
of the filing of the specification and other papers.''.
    (b) In the United States.--
            (1) In general.--Section 120 of title 35, United 
        States Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
        following: ``No application shall be entitled to the

        section unless an amendment containing the specific 
        reference to the earlier filed application is submitted 
        at such time during the pendency of the application as 
        required by the Director. The Director may consider the 
        failure to submit such an amendment within that time 
        period as a waiver of any benefit under this section. 
        The Director may establish procedures, including the 
        payment of a surcharge, to accept an unintentionally 
        delayed submission of an amendment under this 
        section.''.

        the following: ``No application shall be entitled to

        under this subsection unless an amendment containing 
        the specific reference to the earlier filed provisional 
        application is submitted at such time during the 
        pendency of the application as required by the 
        Director. The Director may consider the failure to 
        submit such an amendment within that time period as a 
        waiver of any benefit under this subsection. The 
        Director may establish procedures, including the 
        payment of a surcharge, to accept an unintentionally 
        delayed submission of an amendment under this 
        subsection during the pendency of the application.''.

``Sec. 312. Determination of issue by Director

    ``(a) Reexamination.--Not later than 3 months after the 
filing of a request for inter partes reexamination under 
section 311, the Director shall determine whether a substantial 
new question of patentability affecting any claim of the patent 
concerned is raised by the request, with or without 
consideration of other patents or printed publications. On the 
Director's initiative, and at any time, the Director may 
determine whether a substantial new question of patentability 
is raised by patents and publications.
    ``(b) Record.--A record of the Director's determination 
under subsection (a) shall be placed in the official file of 
the patent, and a copy shall be promptly given or mailed to the 
owner of record of the patent and to the third-party requester,

``Sec. 313. Inter partes reexamination order by Director

    ``If, in a determination made under section 312(a), the 
Director finds that a substantial new question of patentability 
affecting a claim of a patent is raised, the determination

patent for resolution of the question. The order may be 
accompanied by the initial action of the Patent and Trademark 
Office on the merits of the inter partes reexamination 
conducted in accordance with section 314.

``Sec. 314. Conduct of inter partes reexamination proceedings

    ``(a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided in this

shall be permitted to propose any amendment to the patent and a 
new claim or claims, except that no proposed amended or new 
claim enlarging the scope of the claims of the patent shall be 
permitted.
    ``(b) Response.--(1) This subsection shall apply to any 
inter partes reexamination proceeding in which the order for 
inter partes reexamination is based upon a request by a third-
party requester.

the patent subject to the inter partes reexamination 
proceeding.

an action on the merits from the Patent and Trademark Office, 
the third-party requester shall have one opportunity to file 
written comments addressing issues raised by the action of the 
Office or the patent owner's response thereto, if those written 
comments are received by the Office within 30 days after the 
date of service of the patent owner's response.
    ``(c) Special Dispatch.--Unless otherwise provided by the 
Director for good cause, all inter partes reexamination 
proceedings under this section, including any appealto the 
Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, shall be conducted with 
special dispatch within the Office.

``Sec. 315. Appeal

    ``(a) Patent Owner.--The patent owner involved in an inter 
partes reexamination proceeding under this chapter--
            ``(1) may appeal under the provisions of section 
        134 and may appeal under the provisions of sections 141 
        through 144, with respect to any decision adverse to 
        the patentability of any original or proposed amended 
        or new claim of the patent; and
            ``(2) may be a party to any appeal taken by a 
        third-party requester under subsection (b).
    ``(b) Third-Party Requester.--A third-party requester may--
            ``(1) appeal under the provisions of section 134 
        with respect to any final decision favorable to the 
        patentability of any original or proposed amended or 
        new claim of the patent; or
            ``(2) be a party to any appeal taken by the patent 
        owner under the provisions of section 134, subject to 
        subsection (c).
    ``(c) Civil Action.--A third-party requester whose request 
for an inter partes reexamination results in an order under 
section 313 is estopped from asserting at a later time, in any 
civil action arising in whole or in part under section 1338 of 
title 28, United States Code, the invalidity of any claim 
finally determined to be valid and patentable on any ground 
which the third-party requester raised or could have raised 
during the inter partes reexamination proceedings. This 
subsection does not prevent the assertion of invalidity based 
on newly discovered prior art unavailable to the third-party 
requester and the Patent and Trademark Office at the time of 
the inter partes reexamination proceedings.

``Sec. 316. Certificate of patentability, unpatentability, and claim 
                    cancellation

    ``(a) In General.--In an inter partes reexamination 
proceeding under this chapter, when the time for appeal has 
expired or any appeal proceeding has terminated, the Director 
shall issue and publish a certificate canceling any claim of 
the patent finally determined to be unpatentable, confirming 
any claim of the patent determined to be patentable, and 
incorporating in the patent any proposed amended or new claim 
determined to be patentable.
    ``(b) Amended or New Claim.--Any proposed amended or new 
claim determined to be patentable and incorporated into a 
patent following an inter partes reexamination proceeding shall 
have the same effect as that specified in section 252 of this 
title for reissued patents on the right of any person who made, 
purchased, or used within the United States, or imported into 
the United States, anything patented by such proposed amended 
or new claim, or who made substantial preparation therefor, 
prior to issuance of a certificate under the provisions of 
subsection (a) of this section.

``Sec. 317. Inter partes reexamination prohibited

    ``(a) Order for Reexamination.--Notwithstanding any 
provision of this chapter, once an order for inter partes 
reexamination of a patent has been issued under section 313, 
neither the patent owner nor the third-party requester, if any, 
nor privies of either, may file a subsequent request for inter 
partes reexamination of the patent until an inter partes 
reexamination certificate is issued and published under section 
316, unless authorized by the Director.
    ``(b) Final Decision.--Once a final decision has been 
entered against a party in a civil action arising in whole or 
in part under section 1338 of title 28, United States Code, 
that the party has not sustained its burden of proving the 
invalidity of any patent claim in suit or if a final decision 
in an inter partes reexamination proceeding instituted by a 
third-party requester is favorable to the patentability of any 
original or proposed amended or new claim of the patent, then 
neither that party nor its privies may thereafter request an 
inter partes reexamination of any such patent claim on the 
basis of issues which that party or its privies raised or could 
have raised in such civil action or inter partes reexamination 
proceeding, and an inter partes reexamination requested by that 
party or its privies on the basis of such issues may not 
thereafter be maintained by the Office, notwithstanding any 
other provision of this chapter. This subsection does not 
prevent the assertion of invalidity based on newly discovered 
prior art unavailable to the third-party requester and the 
Patent and Trademark Office at the time of the inter partes 
reexamination proceedings.

``Sec. 318. Stay of litigation

    ``Once an order for inter partes reexamination of a patent 
has been issued under section 313, the patent owner may obtain 
a stay of any pending litigation which involves an issue of 
patentability of any claims of the patent which are the subject 
of the inter partes reexamination order, unless the court 
before which such litigation is pending determines that a stay 
would not serve the interests of justice.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of chapters for part 
III of title 25, United States Code, is amended by striking the 
item relating to chapter 30 and inserting the following:

``30. Prior Art Citations to Office and Ex Parte Reexamination of

        response by the patent owner in any reexamination

SEC. 5008. LOW-POWER TELEVISION.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the 
``Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since the creation of low-power television 
        licenses by the Federal Communications Commission, a 
        small number of license holders have operated their 
        stations in a manner beneficial to the public good 
        providing broadcasting to their communities that would 
        not otherwise be available.
            (2) These low-power broadcasters have operated 
        their stations in a manner consistent with the 
        programming objectives and hours of operation of full-
        power broadcasters providing worthwhile services 
totheir respective communities while under severe license limitations 
compared to their full-power counterparts.
            (3) License limitations, particularly the temporary 
        nature of the license, have blocked many low-power 
        broadcasters from having access to capital, and have 
        severely hampered their ability to continue to provide 
        quality broadcasting, programming, or improvements.
            (4) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 
        1996 has added to the uncertainty of the future status 
        of these stations by the lack of specific provisions 
        regarding the permanency of their licenses, or their 
        treatment during the transition to high definition, 
        digital television.
            (5) It is in the public interest to promote 
        diversity in television programming such as that 
        currently provided by low-power television stations to 
        foreign-language communities.
    (c) Preservation of Low-Power Community Television 
Broadcasting.--Section 336 of the Communications Act of 1934 
(47 U.S.C. 336) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (f ) and (g) as 
        subsections (g) and (h), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following 
        new subsection:
    ``(f ) Preservation of Low-Power Community Television

                available to licensees of qualifying low-power

        license for advanced television services to the 
        licensee of a class A television station under this 
        subsection, or to any licensee of any television

                  TITLE VI--SUPERFUND RECYCLING EQUITY

SEC. 6001. SUPERFUND RECYCLING EQUITY.

    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            (1) to promote the reuse and recycling of scrap 
        material in furtherance of the goals of waste 
        minimization and natural resource conservation while 
        protecting human health and the environment;
            (2) to create greater equity in the statutory 
        treatment of recycled versus virgin materials; and
            (3) to remove the disincentives and impediments to 
        recycling created as an unintended consequence of the 
        1980 Superfund liability provisions.
    (b) Clarification of Liability Under CERCLA for Recycling 
Transactions.--
            (1) Clarification.--Title I of the Comprehensive 
        Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
        of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) is amended by adding 
        at the end the following new section:

``SEC. 127. RECYCLING TRANSACTIONS.

    ``(a) Liability Clarification.--
            ``(1) As provided in subsections (b), (c), (d), and 
        (e), a person who arranged for recycling of recyclable 
        material shall not be liable under sections 107(a)(3) 
        and 107(a)(4) with respect to such material.
            ``(2) A determination whether or not any person 
        shall be liable under section 107(a)(3) or section 
        107(a)(4) for any material that is not a recyclable 
        material as that term is used in subsections (b) and 
        (c), (d), or (e) of this section shall be made, without 
        regard to subsections (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this 
        section.
    ``(b) Recyclable Material Defined.--For purposes of this 
section, the term `recyclable material' means scrap paper, 
scrap plastic, scrap glass, scrap textiles, scrap rubber (other 
than whole tires), scrap metal, or spent lead-acid, spent 
nickel-cadmium, and other spent batteries, as well as minor 
amounts of material incident to or adhering to the scrap 
material as a result of its normal and customary use prior to 
becoming scrap; except that such term shall not include--
            ``(1) shipping containers of a capacity from 30 
        liters to 3,000 liters, whether intact or not, having 
        any hazardous substance (but not metal bits and pieces 
        or hazardous substance that form an integral part of 
        the container) contained in or adhering thereto; or
            ``(2) any item of material that contained 
        polychlorinated biphenyls at a concentration in excess 
        of 50 parts per million or any new standard promulgated 
        pursuant to applicable Federal laws.
    ``(c) Transactions Involving Scrap Paper, Plastic, Glass, 
Textiles, or Rubber.--Transactions involving scrap paper, scrap 
plastic, scrap glass, scrap textiles, or scrap rubber (other 
than whole tires) shall be deemed to be arranging for recycling 
if the person who arranged for the transaction (by selling 
recyclable material or otherwise arranging for the recycling of 
recyclable material) can demonstrate by a preponderance of the 
evidence that all of the following criteria were met at the 
time of the transaction:
            ``(1) The recyclable material met a commercial 
        specification grade.
            ``(2) A market existed for the recyclable material.
            ``(3) A substantial portion of the recyclable 
        material was made available for use as feedstock for 
        the manufacture of a new saleable product.
            ``(4) The recyclable material could have been a 
        replacement or substitute for a virgin raw material, or 
        the product to be made from the recyclable material 
        could have been a replacement or substitute for a 
        product made, in whole or in part, from a virgin raw 
        material.
            ``(5) For transactions occurring 90 days or more 
        after the date of enactment of this section, the person 
        exercised reasonable care to determine that the 
        facility where the recyclable material was handled, 
        processed, reclaimed, or otherwise managed by another 
        person (hereinafter in this section referred to as a 
        `consuming facility') was in compliance with 
        substantive (not procedural or administrative) 
        provisions of any Federal, State, or local 
        environmental law or regulation, or compliance order or 
        decree issued pursuant thereto, applicable to the 
        handling,processing, reclamation, storage, or other 
management activities associated with recyclable material.
            ``(6) For purposes of this subsection, `reasonable 
        care' shall be determined using criteria that include 
        (but are not limited to)--
                    ``(A) the price paid in the recycling 
                transaction;

                the nature of the consuming facility's 
                operations concerning its handling, processing, 
                reclamation, or other management activities 
                associated with recyclable material; and
