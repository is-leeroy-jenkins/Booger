An Act

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Digital Accountability and Transparency 
Act of 2014’’ or the ‘‘DATA Act’’. 

SEC. 2. PURPOSES. 

The purposes of this Act are to— 

(1) expand the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency 
Act of 2006 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note) by disclosing direct 
Federal agency expenditures and linking Federal contract, loan, 
and grant spending information to programs of Federal agencies 
to enable taxpayers and policy makers to track Federal 
spending more effectively; 
(2) establish Government-wide data standards for financial 
data and provide consistent, reliable, and searchable Govern-
ment-wide spending data that is displayed accurately for taxpayers 
and policy makers on USASpending.gov (or a successor 
system that displays the data); 
(3) simplify reporting for entities receiving Federal funds 
by streamlining reporting requirements and reducing compliance 
costs while improving transparency; 
(4) improve the quality of data submitted to 
USASpending.gov by holding Federal agencies accountable for 
the completeness and accuracy of the data submitted; and 
(5) apply approaches developed by the Recovery Accountability 
and Transparency Board to spending across the Federal 
Government.
