        conditions of the licenses under such sections, an analysis of
        whether these differences are required or justified by
        historical, technological, or regulatory differences that affect
        the satellite and cable industries, and an analysis of whether
        the cable or satellite industry is placed in a competitive

        cable and satellite companies have passed to subscribers any
        savings realized as a result of the royalty structure and
        amounts under such sections.
            (5) An analysis of issues that may arise with respect to the
        application of the licenses under such sections to the secondary
        transmissions of the primary transmissions of network stations
