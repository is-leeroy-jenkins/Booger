                     PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY

    During fiscal year 2007, for the purposes of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 
99-177), as amended, with respect to appropriations contained 
in the accompanying bill, the terms ``program, project, and 
activity'' [PPA] shall mean any item for which a dollar amount 
is contained in appropriations acts (including joint 
resolutions providing continuing appropriations) or 
accompanying reports of the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, or accompanying conference reports and joint 
explanatory statements of the committee of conference. This 
definition shall apply to all programs for which new budget 
(obligational) authority is provided, as well as to 
discretionary grants and discretionary grant allocations made 
through either bill or report language. In addition, the 
percentage reductions made pursuant to a sequestration order to 
funds appropriated for facilities and equipment, Federal 
Aviation Administration, shall be applied equally to each 
budget item that is listed under said account in the budget 
justifications submitted to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations as modified by subsequent appropriations acts 
and accompanying committee reports, conference reports, or 
joint explanatory statements of the committee of conference.

                        REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES

    The Committee includes a provision (sec. 710) establishing 
the authority by which funding available to the agencies funded 
by this Act may be reprogrammed for other purposes. The 
provision specifically requires the advanced approval of the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations of any proposal 
to reprogram funds that: (1) creates a new program; (2) 
eliminates a program, project, or activity [PPA]; (3) increases 
funds or personnel for any PPA for which funds have been denied 
or restricted by the Congress; (4) proposes to redirect funds 
that were directed in such reports for a specific activity to a 
different purpose; (5) augments an existing PPA in excess of 
$5,000,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less; (6) reduces an 
existing PPA by $5,000,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less; or 
(7) creates, reorganizes, or restructures offices different 
from the congressional budget justifications or the table at 
the end of the Committee report, whichever is more detailed.
    The Committee retains the requirement that each agency 
submit an operating plan to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations not later than 60 days after enactment of this 
Act to establish the baseline for application of reprogramming 
and transfer authorities provided in this act. Specifically, 
each agency should provide a table for each appropriation with 
columns displaying the budget request; adjustments made by 
Congress; adjustments for rescissions, if appropriate; and the 
fiscal year enacted level. The table shall delineate the 
appropriation both by object class and by PPA. The report must 
also identify items of special congressional interest.
    The Committee expects the agencies and bureaus to submit 
reprogramming requests in a timely manner and to provide a 
thorough explanation of the proposed reallocations, including a 
detailed justification of increases and reductions and the 
specific impact the proposed changes will have on the budget 
request for the following fiscal year. Except in emergency 
situations, reprogramming requests should be submitted no later 
than June 30.
    The Committee expects each agency to manage its programs 
and activities within the amounts appropriated by Congress. The 
Committee reminds agencies that reprogramming requests should 
be submitted only in the case of an unforeseeable emergency or 
a situation that could not have been anticipated when 
formulating the budget request for the current fiscal year. 
Further, the Committee notes that when a Department or agency 
submits a reprogramming or transfer request to the Committees 
on Appropriations and does not receive identical responses from 
the House and Senate, it is the responsibility of the 
Department to reconcile the House and Senate differences before 
proceeding, and if reconciliation is not possible, to consider 
the request to reprogram funds unapproved.
    The Committee would also like to clarify that this section 
applies to Working Capital Funds and Forfeiture Funds and that 
no funds may be obligated from such funds to augment programs, 
projects or activities for which appropriations have been 
specifically rejected by the Congress, or to increase funds or 
personnel for any PPA above the amounts appropriated by this 
Act.

                    RELATIONSHIP WITH BUDGET OFFICES

    Through the years, the Committee has channeled most of its 
inquiries and requests for information and assistance through 
the budget offices of the various departments, agencies, 
offices, and commissions. The Committee has often pointed to 
the natural affinity and relationship between the budget 
offices and the Committee which makes such a relationship 
workable. The Committee reiterates its longstanding position 
that while the Committee reserves the right to call upon any 
office or officer in the departments, agencies, and 
commissions, the primary conjunction between the Committee and 
these entities must be through the budget offices. To help 
ensure the Committee's ability to perform its responsibilities, 
the Committee insists on having direct, unobstructed, and 
timely access to the budget offices and expects to be able to 
receive forthright and complete responses from that office and 
its employees.

                  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS

    While the Committee supports the concept of the Program 
Assessment Rating Tool [PART] as a method for evaluating 
programs by linking performance, goals, and benchmarks with 
funding decisions, the process has failed largely through the 
inability of the administration to establish meaningful 
benchmarks and program goals that can be used as a valid 
measure for the success of a program and its funding 
requirements/needs. In too many cases, the PART analysis 
appears to be overly subjective and designed to reach certain 
preconceived conclusions about a program's validity and 
accomplishments and its budget needs.
    This approach reduces PART's value as a tool for measuring 
the contributions of a program and to what extent a program 
should be funded. More troubling, OMB and Federal agencies have 
tended to accommodate an increasing amount of PART performance 
data in the budget justifications by eliminating fundamental 
and objective programmatic budget data that is critical to the 
work of the Committee. This trend has made it increasingly 
difficult for the Committee to perform a meaningful review of 
budget justifications, including the ability to conduct 
necessary budget oversight work as well as the ability to reach 
valid and comprehensive funding decisions absent a substantial 
amount of additional review and budget analysis.
    Budget justifications are prepared not for the use of the 
agency, but instead are the primary tool used by the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations to evaluate the resource 
requirements and fiscal needs of agencies. The Committee is 
aware that the format and presentation of budget materials is 
largely left to the agency within presentation objectives set 
forth by OMB. In fact, OMB Circular A-11, part 6 specifically 
states that the ``agency should consult with your congressional 
committees beforehand to ensure their awareness of your plans 
to modify the format of agency budget documents.'' The 
Committee is disappointed that none of the agencies funded 
under this act have recently heeded this direction. 
Nevertheless, the Committee expects all the budget 
justification to provide the data needed to make appropriate 
and meaningful funding decisions.
    While the Committee values the inclusion of performance 
data and presentations, it is important to ensure that, in the 
implementation of the PART analysis, vital budget information 
that the Committee needs is not lost. Therefore, the Committee 
directs that justifications submitted with the fiscal year 2008 
budget request by agencies funded under this act must contain 
the customary level of detailed data and explanatory statements 
to support the appropriations requests at the level of detail 
contained in the funding table included at the end of the 
report. Among other items, agencies shall provide a detailed 
discussion of proposed new initiatives, proposed changes in the 
agency's financial plan from prior year enactment, and detailed 
data on all programs and comprehensive information on any 
office or agency restructurings. At a minimum, each agency must 
also provide adequate justification for funding and staffing 
changes for each individual office and materials that compare 
programs, projects, and activities that are proposed for fiscal 
year 2008 to the fiscal year 2007 enacted level.
    The Committee is aware that the analytical materials 
required for review by the Committee are unique to each agency 
in this act. Therefore, the Committee expects that the each 
agency will coordinate with the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations in advance on its planned presentation for its 
budget justification materials in support of the fiscal year 
2008 budget request.

                          HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS

    The Senate Committee recommendation excludes District of 
Columbia appropriations items that were funded by the House in 
this bill. The Committee believes that it is appropriate to 
fund those items in a separate bill. For ease of comparison, 
the Committee report excludes in the ``House allowance'' those 
items that are addressed in the District of Columbia 
Appropriations Act, 2007, an original Senate bill.

                                TITLE I

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Working Capital Fund [WCF] provides common 
administrative services to the Department's operating 
administrations and other Federal entities. The services are 
centrally performed in the interest of economy and efficiency 
and are funded through negotiated agreements with Department 
operating administrations and other Federal customers and are 
billed on a fee-for-service basis to the maximum extent 
possible.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation of $123,418,000 on 
activities financed through the Working Capital Fund. The 
budget request proposes to remove the obligation limitation on 
the Working Capital Fund for services to the operating 
administrations of the Department. The Committee, however, 
insists that the discipline of an annual limitation is 
necessary to keep assessments and services of the Working 
Capital Fund in line with costs. As in past years, the bill 
specificies that the limitation shall apply only to the 
Department and not to services provided by other entities. The 
Committee directs that services shall be provided on a 
competitive basis to the maximum extent possible.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Minority Business Resource Center of the Office of 
Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization provides 
assistance in obtaining short-term working capital for 
disadvantaged, minority, and women-owned businesses. The 
program enables qualified businesses to obtain loans at prime 
interest rates for transportation-related projects. As required 
by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, this account records 
the subsidy costs associated with guaranteed loans for this 
program as well as administrative expenses of this program.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $891,000 to 
cover the subsidy costs for guaranteed loans and $396,000 for 
administrative expenses to carry out the guaranteed loan 
program. The recommendation is the same as the budget estimate 
and is equal to the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The 
Committee also recommends a limitation on guaranteed loans of 
$18,367,000, the same amount as the budget request and the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

                       MINORITY BUSINESS OUTREACH

    This appropriation provides contractual support to assist 
small, women-owned, Native American, and other disadvantaged 
business firms in securing contracts and subcontracts arising 
out of transportation-related projects that involve Federal 
spending. It also provides support to historically black and 
Hispanic colleges. Separate funding is requested by the 
administration since this program provides grants and contract 
assistance that serves Department-wide goals and not just OST 
purposes.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $2,970,000 for grants and 
contractual support provided under this program for fiscal year 
2007. The recommendation is the same as the budget request and 
the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

                       NEW HEADQUARTERS BUILDING

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This appropriation finances the tenant-related costs for a 
new Department of Transportation headquarters building. The 
proposed concept would consolidate all of the department's 
headquarters operating administration functions (except FAA), 
from various locations in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area 
into leased buildings within the central employment area of the 
District of Columbia.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $59,400,000 for tenant-related 
costs for new headquarters building. The recommendation is 
equal to the budget estimate and $9,900,000 more than fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level.
    Headquarters Security.--The Committee encourages the 
Secretary to explore purchasing the requisite software, 
hardware and installation services necessary to meet Homeland 
Security Presidential Directive-12 standards. The Secretary 
should explore smart card and biometric authentication for 
access to critical networks and applications as well as 
ingress/egress points in the new DOT headquarters building. In 
addition, the Secretary is encouraged to utilize small business 
concerns in meeting this requirement.

\1\ From overflight fees or funds otherwise provided to the Federal Aviation Administration pursuant to 49
  U.S.C. 41742.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This appropriation provides additional funding for the 
Essential Air Service [EAS] program, which was created as a 10-
year transition program to continue air service to communities 
that had received federally mandated air service prior to 
deregulation of commercial aviation in 1978. The program 
currently provides subsidies to air carriers serving small 
communities that meet certain criteria.
    The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 
1996 (Public Law 104-264) authorized the collection of user 
fees for services provided by the Federal Aviation 
Administration [FAA] to aircraft that neither take off from, 
nor land in, the United States. These are commonly known as 
overflight fees. In addition, the act stipulated that the first 
$50,000,000 of annual fee collections must be used to finance 
the EAS program. In the event of a shortfall in fees, the law 
requires FAA to make up the difference from other funds 
available to the agency.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    For fiscal year 2007, the administration proposes no 
appropriated funds for the EAS program, although the budget 
includes $50,000,000 for the EAS program to be funded by 
overflight fees collected by the FAA. The Committee 
recommendation provides a total of $117,000,000 for the 
Essential Air Service program, which is comprised of an 
appropriation under this heading of $67,000,000 and $50,000,000 
derived from overflight fees or funds otherwise available to 
the FAA. The Committee recommendation is $67,000,000 more than 
the budget estimate and $7,600,000 more than the fiscal year 
2006 enacted level. Based on the latest projections from the 
Department of Transportation, the funding level that the 
Committee recommends is sufficient to continue air service 
during fiscal year 2007 for every community currently receiving 
service through the EAS program as of February 1, 2006.
    EAS Program Growth.--The Committee is concerned about the 
substantial growth of the costs of the EAS program and about 
its ability to continue to provide sufficient funding for 
subsidies so that no community currently in the EAS system 
loses current service levels. The Department will have to renew 
a number of contracts during fiscal year 2007, and costs of the 
new contracts are expected to increase due to higher fuel 
prices and other factors. While the Committee's recommended 
funding level attempts to account for such factors, it is clear 
that the program will face additional pressure during a time of 
extreme fiscal constraint. Although intended as a temporary 
program, many communities depend on this air service. 
Consequently, the Committee directs the Secretary to consider 
implementing section 402 of Vision 100--The Century of Aviation 
Reauthorization Act (Public Law 108-176) which permits an 
increase in the rates of compensation to air carriers due to 
the significant increase in the cost of fuel. This was 
unanticipated and outside the control of air carriers.
    The following table reflects the points currently receiving 
service and the annual rates as of February 1, 2006 in the 
continental United States and Hawaii.

                    Federal Aviation Administration


                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for the 
safe movement of civil aviation and the evolution of a national 
system of airports. The Federal Government's regulatory role in 
civil aviation began with the creation of an Aeronautics Branch 
within the Department of Commerce pursuant to the Air Commerce 
Act of 1926. This act instructed the agency to foster air 
commerce; designate and establish airways; establish, operate, 
and maintain aids to navigation; arrange for research and 
development to improve such aids; issue airworthiness 
certificates for aircraft and major aircraft components; and 
investigate civil aviation accidents. In the Civil Aeronautics 
Act of 1938, these activities were transferred to a new, 
independent agency named the Civil Aeronautics Authority.
    Congress streamlined regulatory oversight in 1957 with the 
creation of two separate agencies, the Federal Aviation Agency 
and the Civil Aeronautics Board. When the Department of 
Transportation [DOT] began its operations in 1967, the Federal 
Aviation Agency was renamed the Federal Aviation Administration 
[FAA] and became one of several modal administrations within 
DOT. The Civil Aeronautics Board was later phased out with 
enactment of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, and ceased 
to exist in 1984. Responsibility for the investigation of civil 
aviation accidents was given to the National Transportation 
Safety Board in 1967. FAA's mission expanded in 1995 with the 
transfer of the Office of Commercial Space Transportation from 
the Office of the Secretary, and decreased in December 2001 
with the transfer of civil aviation security activities to the 
new Transportation Security Administration.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The total recommended program level for the FAA for fiscal 
year 2007 amounts to $8,366,000,000, which is $261,860,000 more 
than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The following table 
summarizes the Committee's recommendations:

    This appropriation provides funds for the operation, 
maintenance, communications, and logistical support of the air 
traffic control and air navigation systems. It also covers 
administrative and managerial costs for the FAA's regulatory, 
international, commercial space, medical, engineering and 
development programs, as well as policy oversight and agency 
management functions. The operations appropriation includes the 
following major activities: (1) the air traffic organization 
which operates, on a 24-hour daily basis, the national air 
traffic system, including the establishment and maintenance of 
a national system of aids to navigation, the development and 
distribution of aeronautical charts and the administration of 
acquisition, and research and development programs; (2) the 
regulation and certification activities including establishment 
and surveillance of civil air regulations to assure safety and 
development of standards, rules and regulations governing the 
physical fitness of airmen as well as the administration of an 
aviation medical research program; (3) the office of commercial 
space transportation; and (4) headquarters, administration and 
other staff and support offices.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a total of $8,366,000,000 for FAA 
operations, an increase of $261,860,000 above the level 
provided for fiscal year 2006 and the same as the budget 
estimate. The Committee recommendation derives $5,445,000,000 
of the appropriation from the airport and airway trust fund. 
The level is equal to the budget estimate. The balance of the 
appropriation will be drawn from the general fund of the 
Treasury.
    As in past years, FAA is directed to report immediately to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations in the event 
resources are insufficient to operate a safe and effective air 
traffic control system.
    Second Career Training Program.--The Committee includes 
language which prohibits the use of funds for the second career 
training program.
    Sunday Premium Pay.--The Committee prohibits FAA from 
paying Sunday premium pay, except in those cases where the 
individual actually worked on a Sunday.
    Manned Auxiliary Flight Service Stations.--The Committee 
continues a prohibition against the use of funds for operating 
a manned auxiliary flight service station in the contiguous 
United States.
    Aeronautical Charting and Cartography.--The Committee 
prohibits the use of funds to conduct aeronautical charting and 
cartography [AC&C] activities through the working capital fund 
[WCF]. Public Law 106-181 had authorized the transfer of these 
activities from the Department of Commerce to the FAA.
    Government-issued Credit Cards.--The Committee prohibits 
the use of a government-issued credit card to purchase a store 
gift card or gift certificate.
    The following table summarizes the Committee's 
recommendation in comparison to the budget estimate and fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level:

                        AIR TRAFFIC ORGANIZATION

    The Committee recommends $6,690,108,000 for the Air Traffic 
Organization to operate and maintain the national air traffic 
control system. The recommended level is $140,350,000 more than 
the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The Committee is confident 
that the recommended funding level is sufficient to continue 
safe and efficient management of the National Airspace System 
[NAS].
    Air Traffic Controller Contract.--Recently, the FAA 
implemented a new contract for its air traffic controller 
workforce. Under this contract, most current air traffic 
controllers would continue to receive their existing base 
salaries and benefits while newly hired controllers would be 
hired at lower wage rates. The FAA has maintained that this 
contract will result in significant cost savings, freeing up 
resources for other critical agency needs. However, the 
Committee is concerned that the imposition of these new 
contract terms could result in an even larger number of senior 
controllers choosing to retire than was originally contemplated 
by the FAA. Given the overarching need for the agency to retain 
a seasoned and experienced workforce to maintain safety, the 
Committee plans to monitor this situation carefully. As such, 
in addition to the prompt and regular submission of the 
controller workforce staffing plan, the Committee directs FAA 
to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
on the extent of controller retirements and any trends they are 
experiencing in comparison to the number of retirements 
anticipated by the FAA for the current year and the number of 
retirements experienced in prior years. This report is due no 
later than April 15, 2007.
    FAA Workforce Plans.--The bill includes provisions that 
require the FAA to submit to Congress its annual air traffic 
controller workforce plan by March 1 of each year, and that 
would reduce the appropriation to the FAA's Operations account 
by $100,000 for each day that the report is late. The Committee 
is greatly frustrated by the FAA's failure to transmit an 
update to its workforce plan. The original plan was transmitted 
to Congress in December 2004, and despite promises that the 
plan would be updated annually, the Committee is still waiting 
for the revised plan. On May 4, 2006, the Administrator 
testified before the Committee that an updated report would be 
submitted in a short period of time. The report, however, is 
now seven months late. The Committee directs the FAA to submit 
its 2006 plan immediately. The Committee also notes that half 
of the FAA's inspector workforce is expected to retire by the 
year 2010. The Committee believes that an effective safety 
staff is vital to protecting the public, and that supporting 
this staff is essential to ensuring the safety of an increasing 
complex aviation system. Consequently, the bill includes a 
provision that requires the FAA to submit to Congress a 
workforce plan that describes a strategy for maintaining a 
sufficient aviation safety staff that is similar in its content 
and identical in its format to the air traffic controller 
workforce plan. The Committee expects the aviation safety 
workforce plan will provide a background to the current 
staffing levels, describe the challenges to hiring sufficient 
safety staff, forecast expected attrition, set specific and 
realistic hiring targets over a ten-year period, and detail 
strategies for meeting staffing needs through better management 
practices in the same manner as was utilized in the initial air 
traffic controller workforce plan. The bill includes a 
provision that would reduce the appropriation to the FAA's 
Operations account by $100,000 for each day that the report is 
late.
    Air Traffic Control Supervisor Staffing.--The Committee 
remains concerned that there are not enough Air Traffic Control 
Supervisors in place to assure flight safety. Additional 
supervisors are necessary to reduce operational errors that 
have led to dangerous runway incursions and serious in flight 
errors. To remedy this, Congress mandated in fiscal year 2005 
Transportation Appropriations bill that the FAA have 1,846 
supervisors in place by September 30, 2005. The FAA only had 
1,801 in September and the number has since fallen to 1,777 on 
March 18, 2006 at the same time operational errors continue to 
rise. We are concerned that the FAA is moving in the wrong 
direction and is not promoting controllers to supervisory 
ranks. The Committee expects the FAA to fill supervisor 
vacancies and to meet the mandated floor of 1,846 Supervisors. 
The Committee directs FAA to submit a report by January 31, 
2007, stating how many Air Traffic Control Supervisors are in 
place on September 30, 2006 and the FAA's plan to hire 
additional supervisors to address the problem of increased 
operational errors.
    Alien Species Action Plan [ASAP].--The Committee recommends 
$1,600,000 to continue the implementation of the Alien Species 
Action Plan which was adopted by the FAA as part of its August 
26, 1998, record of decision approving certain improvements at 
Kahului Airport on the Island of Maui. These funds will be used 
to execute capital projects and continue the operational 
requirements imposed by the ASAP.

                            AVIATION SAFETY

    The Committee recommends $997,718,000 for aviation safety. 
The recommendation is $48,761,000 more than the enacted level.
    Aviation Safety Inspectors and Aircraft Certification 
Staff.--The Committee provides $48,711,612 for aviation safety, 
an increase of $16,000,000 over the budget request to increase 
critical safety staff in the Office of Aviation Flight 
Standards [AFS] and the Office of Aircraft Certification [AIR]. 
The bill specifies that $32,474,408--or two-thirds of the total 
funding for aviation safety--shall be used to increase the 
staff of the AFS office and that $16,237,204--or one-third of 
the total--shall be used to increase the staff of the AIR 
office. The bill also prohibits the FAA from reprogramming 
those funds between the two offices or transferring the funds 
to any other activity.
    For fiscal year 2006, the Committee provided $12,000,000 
above the budget request with the expectation that the FAA 
would increase safety staff by 238 new safety personnel. This 
increase in funding included $8,000,000 for AFS inpectors, and 
$4,000,000 for AIR safety inspectors, engineers, pilots, and 
scientists. In May, the Committee was disappointed to learn 
that the FAA would be able to add only 171 new employees to its 
safety staff. The Committee recognizes that the across-the-
board cut and mandatory pay raise enacted for fiscal year 2006 
constrains the FAA's ability to hire more aggressively; 
however, the Committee remains convinced that the staffing 
levels in the offices of flight standards and aircraft 
certification are not satisfactory. The Committee is especially 
concerned that the dearth of safety inspectors limits the FAA's 
ability to protect the safety of our air transportation system.
    Finally, the Committee is frustrated by the FAA's failure 
to provide timely information on its hiring practices. The 
Committee repeatedly requested for information from the FAA on 
the progress the agency was making in increasing its safety 
staff, but never received an adequate response until days 
before the Committee held a hearing on the FAA's budget. 
Furthermore, the Committee notes that FAA has not yet followed 
directions in the Statement of Managers of the 2006 Act that 
instructs the FAA to provide semi-annual reports on its safety 
staff. In light of this communication gap, the bill now 
includes a requirement for the FAA to provide quarterly reports 
on the agency's progress in increasing the staff of its safety 
offices.
    Medallion Program.--The Committee recommends $5,000,000 to 
continue the medallion five star shield program, a key safety 
initiative in the FAA's current strategic plan for reducing 
general aviation accidents in Alaska.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Facilities and Equipment [F&E] appropriation provides 
funding for modernizing and improving air traffic control and 
airway facilities, equipment, and systems. The appropriation 
also finances major capital investments required by other 
agency programs, experimental research and development 
facilities, and other improvements to enhance the safety and 
capacity of the airspace system. The program aims to keep pace 
with the increasing demands of aeronautical activity and remain 
in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's 
comprehensive 5-year capital investment plan [CIP].

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $2,549,510,000 
for the Facilities and Equipment of the Federal Aviation 
Administration. The Committee recommendation is $46,510,000 
more than the budget estimate and $34,910,000 more than the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The bill provides that 
$2,101,610,000 is available for obligation until September 30, 
2009, and $447,900,000 is available until September 30, 2007.
    The Committee recommendations focus on reinforcing greater 
accountability and mission goals, and strive for better or 
alternative ways of improving and modernizing the system. 
Furthermore, in reviewing the budget estimate for this account, 
the Committee has placed priority on funding programs necessary 
to upgrade current equipment for future capacity requirements 
or programs that will enable the FAA to proceed with 
initiatives to improve safety and initiatives to alleviate 
congestion, reduce aircraft spacing, and increase the 
efficiency of the NAS.
    The Committee reiterates the need for the FAA to take 
immediate steps to control personnel cost growth and to impose 
budget and schedule discipline on major acquisition programs in 
a time of fiscal constraints and declining capital budget 
funding. Our Nation's air traffic control system has failed to 
keep up with the increasing and changing demands of civil 
aviation, and the FAA will not be able to meet future demands 
and needs without changing and improving the ways the agency 
modernizes the NAS. This challenge is unlikely to be met 
without changing the FAA culture. Ultimately, changing the FAA 
culture is a long-term proposition, but the failure to do so 
will harm the aviation industry, inconvenience the flying 
public, and serve as an obstacle to national economic growth.
    Budget Activities Format.--The Committee directs that the 
fiscal year 2008 budget request for the Facilities and 
Equipment account conform to the same organizational structure 
of budget activities.
    The Committee's recommended distribution of funds for each 
of the budget activities funded by the appropriation follows:

    Runway Obstruction Warning System.--The Committee 
recommends an increase of $2,000,000 for the ATDP budget line 
to continue development, enhancement, and evaluation of the 
Runway Obstruction Warning System at the test bed at Gulfport-
Biloxi Airport.
    Mobile Object Infrastructure Technology.--The Committee 
recommends $3,000,000 to advance technology to pre-deployment 
status and demonstrate the mobile object infrastructure 
technology's ability to provide remote maintenance and 
monitoring; data collection from disparate and unspecified 
sources; quality assurance in a secure and dynamic 
infrastructure; and, to establish one of FAA's labs as an 
official system wide information management node.
    Safe Flight 21.--The Committee supports the Safe Flight 21 
program and recommends $30,700,000, an increase of $11,000,000 
above the budget estimate. The Committee is disappointed that 
the administration has slashed the overall funding for Safe 
Flight 21; a program that is critical to the safety of general 
aviation in Alaska. The Committee urges the administration and 
FAA to be more sensitive to this and other important aviation 
programs.
    System-Wide Information Management [SWIM].--The bill 
includes $24,000,000 for the System Wide Information Management 
[SWIM] program, which will provide the foundation necessary for 
transforming the national airspace system into a network-
centric operation. The Committee urges the FAA not to focus on 
narrowly defined connectivity projects and upgrades for 
existing FAA systems, and instead directs the FAA to use the 
funding provided to continue the developments in the overall 
SWIM architecture, standards, core information services, and 
demonstrations that are underway in the Global Communications, 
Navigation, Surveillance System program. In addition, the 
Committee urges the FAA to align its work on SWIM with the 
efforts of the Joint Planning and Development Office to build 
the next generation air transportation system. The Committee 
directs the FAA to submit a report to the Committee not later 
than January 30, 2007, that details how the agency will spend 
the $24,000,000 provided for SWIM, including how much of the 
funding will be spent directly on SWIM systems architecture, 
standards and core information services. The Committee expects 
that all major information and automation programs in the 
national airspace system will use their existing program funds 
to support connectivity to the SWIM architecture. The Committee 
directs the FAA to highlight its plans and the funds allocated 
for achieving SWIM compliance and connectivity for each 
appropriate item in the Facilities and Equipment account in the 
agency's budget justifications for fiscal year 2008.
    Volcano Monitoring.--The Committee recommendation provides 
$5,000,000 to continue the volcano monitoring program.
    Air Traffic Control Training Simulators.--The Committee 
recommends that the FAA continue to procure control tower 
simulators under an existing Air Force contract, which was a 
full and open competition, in order to continue upgrading their 
training capabilities in order to meet the needs identified in 
the Controller Workforce Plan [CWP] and the Capital Investment 
Plan [CIP]. The Committee understands that the FAA can request 
the Air Force to extend the existing contract by making a 
formal request to the Air Force to extend the time and pricing 
considerations. Currently, there are 121 tower control training 
simulators in place supporting ATC training in the United 
States with the military, the FAA and several universities that 
support the FAA's Collegiate Training Initiative [CTI] program.
    Terminal Air Traffic Control Facilities Replacement.--The 
Committee recommendation includes $149,000,000 for new and 
replacement air traffic control tower [ATCT] and ATCT/TRACON 
consolidation projects, an increase of $25,000,000 from the 
budget request. Funding shall be available for the following 
projects in the corresponding amounts:

    Reprogramming of Appropriated Funds for Tower and TRACON 
Replacements.--The Committee notes that the FAA has initiated 
an effort to evaluate and prioritize the need to replace 
individual air traffic control towers and terminal radar 
approach control facilities. Part of this effort has included 
the preparation of a long-overdue accounting of prior-
appropriated funds for this activity. Too often in the past, 
the FAA has delayed the construction of necessary projects for 
which funds had already been appropriated in order to reprogram 
resources to alternative projects without congressional 
notification or consultation. Most recently, the FAA has sought 
to alter this practice by seeking a formal reprogramming of 
funds toward the replacement of LaGuardia tower [LGA]. Much of 
this funding proposed to be reprogrammed for the LGA tower is 
to be derived from monies appropriated for some 20 other 
projects in 2004 and 2005.
    At this point in time, the Committee has no choice but to 
approve this reprogramming. Much of the funding proposed for 
reprogramming was initially appropriated in 2004 and is now at 
risk of lapsing due to the agency's failure to spend the 
funding on the projects for which they were intended. For 
example, almost none of the funds that the Committee 
appropriated for fiscal year 2004 for the replacement of towers 
at Las Vegas, Nevada, Missoula, Montana, Traverse City, 
Michigan, Dayton, Ohio, and Kalamazoo, Michigan have been 
spent. The FAA has stated that they are likely to pursue those 
projects some time in the future and, if necessary, seek 
additional funding to complete them either through additional 
reprogrammings or through new requests for appropriations. The 
Committee should not have to appropriate funding twice for the 
same project due to the agency's bureaucratic dithering and its 
failure to rapidly initiate design and construction of the 
projects that have been funded. Moreover, the Committee is 
concerned that the FAA's commitment to seek the necessary 
funding to complete these projects at some later time might 
prove to be a hollow promise, given the administration's 
propensity to propose funding cuts for the aviation capital 
programs and the pressure the FAA will face to fund other 
modernization needs.
    As such, the Committee has appropriated $25,000,000 in this 
bill to immediately replace the funds that have been 
reprogrammed away from tower projects that have not yet been 
completed and will need more funds in the future. These funds 
have been provided in lieu of funding the Administrator's 
request for the Wide Area Augmentation System [WAAS] which the 
Committee views as a lower priority. In making these funds 
available now, the Committee directs the Administrator to move 
out immediately with the completion of these projects. The 
Committee expects the Administrator to revisit her schedule for 
initiating design and construction for the projects cited 
above. The Committee has no intention of waiting until 2010 or 
later to see construction contracts awarded for tower 
replacement projects that received initial appropriations as 
long ago as 2001. In the future, baring any unusual 
circumstance, the Committee expects the FAA to restrict funding 
for any specific tower replacement to the facility for which it 
is appropriated.
    Terminal Digital Radar (ASR-11).--The Committee recommends 
$44,050,000, the same amount as the budget request. The ASR-11 
program will replace 100 existing FAA radar systems at low-to-
medium density terminal facilities.
    The Committee is aware of the desire for a terminal radar 
to serve the regions of Utah County, Utah and Las Vegas, 
Nevada. The Committee encourages the FAA to work with Utah 
County, Utah and Las Vegas, Nevada to improve radar coverage 
for both areas.
    Terminal Radar [ASR]--Improve.--The Committee has provided 
$3,532,848 for the improvement of terminal radar [ASR] 
infrastructure throughout the NAS. Within the amount provided, 
$600,000 shall be for in-service engineering and $1,422,848 
shall be for radar improvements in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Dallas-Fort 
Worth, Texas; Tampa, Florida; Azle, Texas, Denver, Colorado; 
and Roanoke, Virginia. The remaining $1,510,000 shall be for 
the relocation of the ASR-8 radar at Bismarck, North Dakota.
    Instrument Landing System [ILS] Establishment.--The 
Committee recommends $8,000,000 for establishment of instrument 
landing systems. The Committee directs funds to be distributed 
as follows:
    $1,300,000 to establish an ILS at Aiken Municipal Airport, 
South Carolina;
    $750,000 to establish and ILS at Alliance Municipal Airport 
in Alliance, Nebraska;
    $2,200,000 To upgrade ILS to Category III on Runway 31, 
Atlantic City, New Jersey; and
    $2,400,000 To acquire and install ILS at Council Bluffs 
Municipal Airport, Iowa.
    Approach Lighting System Improvement Program [ALSIP].--The 
Committee recommends $22,000,000 for the procurement and 
installation of frangible approach lighting equipment including 
high intensity approach lighting system with sequenced flashing 
lights [ALSF-2] and medium intensity approach lighting system 
[MALSR]. The amount provided is $8,000,000 more than the budget 
request. The Committee expects that $4,000,000 of the amount 
provided above the request shall be used to install previously 
procured MALSR systems presently stored in the FAA depot, 
utilizing the same four-phase approach presently being utilized 
for the installation of these systems: $1,000,000, the 
Committee expects the FAA to procure two Low Cost MALSR systems 
for the continued evaluation of this new technology system, 
which will reduce life cycle costs; and the recommendation 
includes $5,000,000 to continue the program of providing 
lighting systems at rural airfields throughout Alaska.
    Loran-C.--The Committee recommends $10,000,000 to continue 
the program to modernize the Loran-C navigation system. The 
Committee is aware that recapitalization of the loran 
radionavigational system in the contiguous United States has 
largely been completed, but notes that substantial work remains 
in Alaska. Ultimately there needs to be a resolution between 
the GPS system and Loran-C. The best system deserves concrete 
investment. The Committee strongly believe there should be a 
worldwide system subject to rational criteria.
    Stand Alone Weather Sensors.--The Committee notes that the 
budget does not request funding for the Stand Alone Weather 
Sensors program. The Committee is concerned that significant 
taxpayer funds have been spent on this program only to have the 
FAA warehouse important weather monitoring stations for class C 
airports nationwide. The Committee directs the FAA 
Administrator to submit a report by March 15, 2007, to the 
Committee detailing the number of SAWS systems purchased and 
deployed, improvements in flight safety at deployed airports, 
safety impacts at class C airports yet to receive SAWS systems, 
accounting of current class C airports, and the FAA's plan to 
proceed with the original intent of SAWS deployment at all 
class C airports.
    FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure.--The purpose of the 
FTI program is to replace seven existing FAA-owned and -leased 
telecommunications networks with a single new network that 
would cost less to operate. FTI is an important program because 
it is expected to reduce FAA's growing operations costs and 
provide the backbone for several initiatives associated with 
the next generation air traffic management system. The 
Committee is concerned about delays to this program and 
diminishing benefits.
    Specifically, the Committee was greatly dismayed to learn 
from the DOT Inspector General that the FAA failed to realize 
roughly $33,000,000 in anticipated operating savings from the 
FTI program in fiscal year 2005 due to the agency's inability 
to disconnect legacy circuits in a safe and timely manner. The 
Inspector General also reported the FAA was at further risk of 
sacrificing over $100,000,000 in planned operating savings in 
the current fiscal year because of program delays. The failure 
of the agency to capture these planned savings is unacceptable. 
Among other problems, these failures have undermined the 
Administrator's ability to adequately hire and train critically 
needed safety personnel, including safety inspector positions 
which the Committee funded in 2006 with resources provided in 
excess of the agency's budget request.
    In April 2006, the Inspector General reported that FTI is a 
high risk effort and recommended that FAA take a number of 
actions. These include developing a realistic master schedule 
and effective transition plan by coordinating with all parties 
involved with the FTI transition, and validating cost estimates 
and benefits.
    FAA is taking overdue but positive steps by including its 
regions, the current service provider, and the FTI contractor 
to improve the overall transition to FTI. While FAA has made 
some progress in improving FTI service deliveries, a 
significant number of FTI services that were accepted by FAA 
have not been cutover, thus requiring considerable rework and 
causing an increased backlog.
    FAA also engaged MITRE to independently validate the FTI 
schedule. Based on MITRE's report, it appears that FTI will not 
be completed as planned in December 2007, but is more likely to 
be completed later in 2008. This will result in additional 
unplanned costs and a further reduction in projected cost 
savings from this program.
    The Committee is aware that FAA will be reviewing the FTI 
cost and schedule baselines in August. After that review, the 
Committee expects the FAA to provide it with a clear 
understanding of the work required to complete FTI, a realistic 
estimate of when FTI will be completed, how potential risks to 
ATC operations will be minimized, and when the Agency will 
begin to realize benefits from this multi-billion dollar 
investment. The Committee cautions FAA that future funding for 
this program is dependent on providing this information to this 
Committee in a timely manner.

                        IMPROVE AVIATION SAFETY

    Propulsion and Fuel Systems.--The Committee recommends 
$5,048,000 for propulsion and fuel systems research to reduce 
commercial fatalities. The Committee provides $1,000,000 to 
complete the evaluation of the effects of molecular markers 
designed for the purpose of detecting adulteration or dilution 
of jet fuel for use in aviation engines.
    Advanced Materials/Structural Safety.--The Committee 
recommends $4,843,000 for advanced materials/structural safety 
research. The recommendation is an increase of $2,000,000 from 
the budget estimate and an decrease of $1,038,000 from the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The Committee recommends 
$500,000 to support and improve ongoing metallic and composite 
structures research at the National Institute for Aviation 
Research.
    Aeromedical Research.--The Committee recommends $8,462,000 
for aeromedical research, an increase of $1,500,000 above the 
budget estimate. The Committee recommends $1,000,000 to 
continue studies related to cabin air quality to be conducted 
by the center of excellence for cabin environment research.
    Flight Attendant Fatigue.--The Committee continues to be 
concerned about the issue of flight attendant fatigue, and 
whether current regulations provide adequate rest time for 
flight attendants. Pursuant to the Committee's request in the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, the FAA submitted a 
report in July 2006 on the impact of the minimum rest 
requirements of FAR 121.467 and FAR 135.273. The study was 
limited in nature; however, the report stated that flight 
attendants are ``experiencing fatigue and tiredness and as 
such, (fatigue) is a salient issue warranting further 
evaluation.'' In order to gain a fuller understanding of the 
impact of fatigue on flight attendants, the Committee directs 
FAA to utilize $500,000 of its appropriation for CAMI to carry 
out its recommendations for further study of this problem. The 
Committee directs CAMI to submit a report to the Congress not 
later than December 31, 2008, and expects the report to include 
analysis in the six areas that CAMI identified in its report of 
July 2006: a survey of field operations, a focused study of 
incident reports, field research on the effects of fatigue, a 
validation of models for assessing flight attendant fatigue, 
international policies and practices, and the potential 
benefits of training.

                      (LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)

                    (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)

Limitation, 2006........................................  $3,514,500,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................   2,750,000,000
House allowance.........................................   3,700,000,000
Committee recommendation................................   3,520,000,000

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations of 
$3,520,000,000 for grants-in-aid to airports for fiscal year 
2007, which is $770,000,000 more than the budget estimate and 
$5,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The 
Committee recommendation is sufficient to continue the 
important tasks of enhancing airport and airway safety, 
ensuring that airport standards continue to be met, maintaining 
existing airport capacity, and developing additional capacity.
    The Committee recommends several changes to the Grants-in-
Aid for Airports programs by including language that allows 
funds appropriated to the Small Community Air Service 
Development Program [SCASDP] to be used for expenses associated 
with administering the program. This language further exempts 
SCASDP from the obligation cap for administration and transfers 
the amount appropriated to the account available to administer 
the program. This language would also exempt the Small 
Community Air Service Development Program's obligation of funds 
for administrative purposes from the Trust Fund obligation cap 
for administrative expenses.
    In addition, these changes solve an inadvertent problem 
that was created in prior year appropriations. Because there is 
a prohibition on transfers, unless explicitly exempted, the 
funds for the SCASDP program cannot be transferred to the 
account where the program is currently administered. This 
language would allow the money to be transferred and align 
program funding with managed responsibility. In prior years, 
the SCASDP program has not been given the authority to use 
appropriated funds for administering the program. This language 
gives authority for funds appropriated to be used for 
administering the program.
    Airport Discretionary Grants.--Of the funds covered by the 
obligation limitation in this bill, the Committee directs FAA 
to provide not less than the following funding levels, out of 
available resources, for the following projects in the 
corresponding amounts. The Committee agrees that State 
apportionment funds may be construed as discretionary funds for 
the purposes of implementing this provision. To the maximum 
extent possible, the administrator should work to ensure that 
airport sponsors for these projects first use available 
entitlement funds to finance the projects. However, the FAA 
should not require sponsors to apply carryover entitlement to 
discretionary projects funded in the coming year, but only 
those entitlements applicable to the fiscal year 2007 
obligation limitation. The Committee further directs that the 
specific funding allocated above shall not diminish or 
prejudice the application of a specific airport or geographic 
region to receive other AIP discretionary grants or multi-year 
letters of intent.

    Panama City-Bay County International Airport, Florida.--The 
Committee encourages the FAA to give priority consideration to 
the application for a letter of intent that the Panama City-Bay 
County International Airport Authority and Industrial District 
submitted for construction of a new airport. The FAA has noted 
that the runways at the current airport do not meet Federal 
safety and design standards. The FAA's draft environmental 
impact statement further noted that the ``No Action'' 
alternative is ``not reasonable, feasible, practicable or 
prudent.'' The Committee has been informed that substantial 
safety and capacity benefits will accrue from the completion of 
this project. The Committee also understands this project has 
several unique characteristics, including having a private 
entity donate the new site and reducing conflict with military 
aircraft. In addition, the Committee understands that more than 
two-thirds of this project will be funded from non-Federal 
sources. The Committee supports the application as submitted 
and believes this is a unique opportunity to leverage Federal 
funds.
    Runway Incursion Prevention Systems and Devices.--The bill 
includes a provision that allows funds for grants-in-aid to 
airports to be used by airports to procure and install runway 
incursion prevention systems and devises.
    Airport Technology.--The budget estimate includes 
$18,870,000 for airport technology research. The Committee 
recommendation is $1,000,000 more than the budget request, and 
funds recommended in addition to the estimate are for the 
airfield pavements research program. The program is designed to 
develop safer, more cost-effective, and durable asphalt and 
concrete airfield pavements.

                    (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)

                 (RESCISSION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)

Rescission, 2006........................................ -$1,032,000,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      -1,582,000

Committee recommendation................................    -765,490,000

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a rescission of contract 
authorization of $765,490,000 of contract authority from the 
Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Section 48112 of title 49, 
United States Code, stipulates that additional contract 
authorization for the grants-in-aid program is automatically 
made available in an amount equal to the difference between the 
appropriated level for the facilities and equipment program and 
the authorized amount for the same fiscal year.

       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION

    Section 110 limits the number of technical staff years at 
the Center for Advanced Aviation Systems Development to no more 
than 395 in fiscal year 2007.
    Section 111 permits the Administrator to reimburse FAA 
appropriations for amounts made available for 49 U.S.C. 
41742(a)(1) as fees are collected and credited under 49 U.S.C. 
45303.
    Section 112 allows funds received to reimburse FAA for 
providing technical assistance to foreign aviation authorities 
to be credited to the Operations account.
    Section 113 extends the terms and conditions of the 
aviation insurance program, commonly known as ``war risk 
insurance,'' and the limitation on air carrier liability for 
third party claims arising out of acts of terrorism to August 
31, 2007 and includes an option for the Secretary to futher 
extend the program until December 31, 2007.
    Section 114 extends the retirement age for pilots to age 
65.
    Section 115 prohibits funds in this act to be used to adopt 
guidelines or regulations requiring airport sponsors to provide 
the Federal Aviation Administration ``without cost'' buildings, 
maintenance, or space for FAA services. The prohibition does 
not apply to negotiations between FAA and airport sponsors 
concerning ``below market'' rates for such services or to grant 
assurances that require airport sponsors to provide land 
without cost to the FAA for air traffic control facilities.

                     Federal Highway Administration


                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The principal mission of the Federal Highway Administration 
is, in partnership with State and local governments, to foster 
the development of a safe, efficient, and effective highway and 
intermodal system nationwide including access to and within 
national forests, national parks, indian lands and other public 
lands.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    Under the Committee recommendations, a total program level 
of $39,865,464,863 would be provided for the activities of the 
Federal Highway Administration in fiscal year 2007.

                 LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $360,991,620

Committee recommendation................................     378,504,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This limitation on obligations provides for the salaries 
and expenses of the Federal Highway Administration for program 
management, direction, and coordination; engineering guidance 
to Federal and State agencies; and advisory and support 
services in field offices.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations of 
$378,504,000 for administrative expenses of the agency.
    This limitation is $6,000,000 more than the budget request 
and $17,512,380 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. 
The Committee recommends the additional funding be used to 
continue to improve oversight and stewardship of the Federal-
aid highway funds to ensure that every Federal dollar is well 
spent and that program operations and processes are efficient 
and streamlined. The funds should be applied to the Financial 
Integrity Review and Evaluation program, improvements to FHWA's 
Fiscal Information Management System, as well as permanent 
change of station moves.

                 LIMITATION ON TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH

Limitation, 2006........................................    $425,502,000

research and technology programs of the FHWA. This limitation 
includes the intelligent transportation systems, surface 
transportation research, technology deployment, training and 
education, and university transportation research. Funding for 
the Bureau of Transportation Statistics [BTS] is also included 
within this limitation even though BTS is organizationally 
placed within the Research and Innovative Technology 
Administration [RITA]. Additional information regarding BTS is 
included in the RITA section of this report.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations for 
transportation research of $429,800,000. This limitation is 
consistent with the Senate-passed authorization level and is 
$4,298,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

                          FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS

                      (LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)

                          (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)

Limitation, 2006........................................ $35,672,020,464
Budget estimate, 2007...................................  39,086,464,683
House allowance.........................................  39,086,464,683
Committee recommendation................................  39,086,464,683

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Federal-aid highways program provides financial support 
to States and localities for development, construction, and 
repair of highways and bridges through grants. The program is 
financed from the Highway Trust Fund and most of the funds are 
distributed through apportionments and allocations to States. 
Title 23 of the United States Code and other supporting 
legislation provide authority for the various activities of the 
FHWA. Funding is provided by contract authority, with program 
levels established by annual limitations on obligations set in 
appropriations acts.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends limiting fiscal year 2007 Federal-
aid highways obligations to $39,086,464,683, which is 
$3,414,444,220 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

                     FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS PROGRAMS

    The roads and bridges that make up our Nation's highway 
infrastructure are built, operated, and maintained through the 
joint efforts of Federal, State, and local governments. States 
have much flexibility to use Federal-aid highway funds to best 
meet their individual needs and priorities, with FHWA's 
assistance and oversight.
    The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation 
Equity Act: A Legacy for Users [SAFETEA-LU], the highway, 
highway safety, and transit authorization through fiscal year 
2009, makes Federal-aid highways funds available in the 
following major categories:
    National Highway System [NHS].--The Intermodal Surface 
Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA] of 1991 authorized the 
NHS, which was subsequently established as a 161,000 mile road 
system by the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995. 
This system serves major population centers, intermodal 
transportation facilities, international border crossings, and 
major destinations. The NHS program provides funding for this 
system consisting of roads that are of primary Federal 
interest. The NHS consists of the current Interstate, other 
rural principal arterials, urban freeways and connecting urban 
principal arterials, and facilities on the Defense Department's 
designated Strategic Highway Network, and roads connecting the 
NHS to intermodal facilities. The Federal share for the NHS 
program is generally 80 percent, subject to the sliding scale 
adjustment, with an availability period of 4-years.
    Interstate Maintenance [IM].--The 46,876 mile Dwight D. 
Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways 
retains a separate identity within the NHS. The IM program 
finances projects to rehabilitate, restore, resurface and 
reconstruct the Interstate system. Reconstruction that 
increases capacity, other than HOV lanes, is not eligible for 
IM funds. The Federal share for the IM program is 90 percent, 
subject to the sliding scale adjustment, and funds are 
available for 4 years.
    Surface Transportation Program [STP].--STP is a flexible 
program that may be used by States and localities for projects 
on any Federal-aid highway, bridge projects on any public road, 
transit capital projects, and intracity and intercity bus 
terminals and facilities. A portion of STP funds are set aside 
for transportation enhancements and State sub-allocations are 
provided. The Federal share for STP is generally 80 percent, 
subject to the sliding scale adjustment, with a 4-year 
availability period.
    Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation.--The bridge program 
enables States to improve the condition of their bridges 
through replacement, rehabilitation, and systematic preventive 
maintenance. The funds are available for use on all bridges, 
including those on roads functionally classified as rural minor 
collectors and as local. Bridge program funds have a 4-year 
period of availability with a Federal share for all projects, 
except those on the Interstate System, of 80 percent, subject 
to the sliding scale adjustment. For those bridges on the 
Interstate System, the Federal share is 90 percent, subject to 
the sliding scale adjustment. There is a set-aside of 
$100,000,000 from the fiscal year 2006-2009 funding for 
specific projects listed in SAFETEA-LU.
    Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program 
[CMAQ].--The CMAQ program directs funds toward transportation 
projects and programs to help meet and maintain national 
ambient air quality standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, and 
particulate matter. A minimum one-half percent of the 
apportionment is guaranteed to each State.
    Highway Safety Improvement Program [HSIP].--The new highway 
infrastructure safety program (previously funded by a set-aside 
from STP), was established as a core program beginning in 2006. 
The program, which features strategic safety planning and 
performance, devotes additional resources and supports 
innovative approaches to reducing highway fatalities and 
injuries on all public roads.
    Federal Lands Highways.--This category funds improvements 
for forest highways; park roads and parkways; Indian 
reservation roads; and refuge roads. The Federal lands highway 
program provides for transportation planning, research, 
engineering, and construction of highways, roads, parkways, and 
transit facilities that provide access to or within public 
lands, national parks, and Indian reservations.
    The Committee directs that the funds allocated for this 
program in this bill and in permanent law are to be derived 
from the FHWA's public lands discretionary program, and not 
from funds allocated to the National Park Service's regions.
    Equity Bonus.--The equity bonus (replaces TEA21's minimum 
guarantee) provides additional funds to States to ensure that 
each State's total funding from apportioned programs and for 
High Priority Projects meets certain equity considerations. 
Each State is guaranteed a minimum rate of return on its share 
of contributions to the highway account of the Highway Trust 
Fund, and a minimum increase relative to the average dollar 
amount of apportionments under TEA21. Certain States will 
maintain the share of total apportionments they each received 
during TEA21. An open-ended authorization is provided, ensuring 
that there will be sufficient funds to meet the objectives of 
the equity bonus.
    Emergency Relief [ER].-- Section 125 of title 23, United 
States Code, authorizes $100,000,000 annually for the ER 
program. This program provides funds for the repair or 
reconstruction of Federal-aid highways and bridges and 
federally owned roads and bridges that have suffered serious 
damage as the result of natural disasters or catastrophic 
failures. The ER program supplements the commitment of 
resources by States, their political subdivisions, or Federal 
agencies to help pay for unusually heavy expenses resulting 
from extraordinary conditions.
    Ferry Boats and Ferry Terminal Facilities.--SAFETEA-LU 
reauthorized funding for the construction of ferry boats and 
ferry terminal facilities and requires that $20,000,000 from 
each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 be set aside for marine 
highway systems that are part of the National Highway System 
for use by the States of Alaska, New Jersey, and Washington.
    National Scenic Byways.--This program provides funding for 
roads that are designated by the Secretary of Transportation as 
All American Roads [AAR] or National Scenic Byways [NSB]. These 
roads have outstanding scenic, historic, cultural, natural, 
recreational, and archaeological qualities.
    Transportation and Community and System Preservation 
[TCSP].--SAFETEA-LU continues the TCSP program to provide 
grants to States and local governments for planning, 
developing, and implementing strategies to integrate 
transportation and community and system preservation plans and 
practices. These grants may be used to improve the efficiency 
of the transportation system; reduce the impacts of 
transportation on the environment; reduce the need for costly 
future investments in public infrastructure; and provide 
efficient access to jobs, services, and centers of trade.
    Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation 
[TIFIA].--The TIFIA credit program provides funds to assist in 
the development of major infrastructure facilities through 
greater non-Federal and private sector participation, building 
on public willingness to dedicate future revenues or user fees 
in order to receive transportation benefits earlier than would 
be possible under traditional funding techniques. The TIFIA 
program provides secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby 
lines of credit that may be drawn upon to supplement project 
revenues, if needed, during the first 10 years of project 
operations.
    Appalachian Development Highway System.--This program makes 
funds available to construct highways and access roads under 
section 201 of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 
1965. Under SAFETEA-LU, funding is authorized for each of 
fiscal years 2005 through 2009, is available until expended, 
and is distributed among the 13 eligible States based on the 
latest available cost-to-complete estimate prepared by the 
Appalachian Regional Commission.
    High Priority Projects.--Funds are provided for specific 
projects identified in SAFETEA-LU. Over 5,000 projects are 
identified, each with a specified amount of funding over the 5 
years of SAFETEA-LU.
    Projects of National and Regional Significance.--This 
program provides funding for specific projects of national or 
regional importance. All the funds authorized for this program 
from the Highway Trust Fund are designated for projects listed 
in SAFETEA-LU.

              Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration


                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration [FMCSA] was 
established within the Department of Transportation by the 
Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act [MCSIA] (Public Law 106-
159) in December 1999. Prior to this legislation, motor carrier 
safety responsibilities were under the jurisdiction of the 
Federal Highway Administration.
    FMCSA's primary mission is to improve the safety of 
commercial vehicle operations on our Nation's highways. To 
accomplish this mission, FMCSA is focused on reducing the 
number and severity of large truck crashes. FMCSA is 
responsible for ensuring that Mexican commercial vehicles 
entering the United States operate in accordance with the North 
American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] and comply with all U.S. 
hazardous material and safety regulations. In addition, FMCSA 
oversees compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Commercial 
Regulations through increased household goods carrier 
enforcement, education and outreach.
    Agency resources and activities contribute to safety in 
commercial vehicle operations through enforcement, including 
the use of stronger enforcement measures against safety 
violators; expedited safety regulation; technology innovation; 
improvements in information systems; training; and improvements 
to commercial driver's license testing, recordkeeping, and 
sanctions. To accomplish these activities, FMCSA works closely 
with Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies, the motor 
carrier industry, highway safety organizations, and individual 
citizens.
    MCSIA and the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient 
Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users [SAFETEA-LU] 
provides funding authorizations for FMCSA's Motor Carrier 
Safety Operations and Programs and Motor Carrier Safety Grants. 
Under these authorizations, funding supports FMCSA's expanded 
scope as authorized by the USA PATRIOT Act, which created new 
and enhanced security measures. Additionally, funding supports 
border enforcement and safety-related activities associated 
with implementation of the NAFTA requirement that Mexican long-
haul shippers be allowed to operate within the United States 
subject to the same safety requirements placed on U.S. 
carriers.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a total of $517,000,000 for FMCSA 
in fiscal year 2007, which is equal to the requested amount and 
$26,950,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 level.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides the necessary resources to support 
motor carrier safety program activities and maintain the 
agency's administrative infrastructure. Funding supports 
nationwide motor carrier safety and consumer enforcement 
efforts, including Federal safety enforcement activities at the 
U.S./Mexico border to ensure that Mexican carriers entering the 
United States are in compliance with Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Regulations. Resources are also provided to fund motor 
carrier regulatory development and implementation, information 
management, research and technology, safety education and 
outreach, and the 24-hour safety and consumer telephone 
hotline.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations of 
$223,000,000 for FMCSA's Operations and Programs. The 
recommendation is consistent with SAFETEA-LU authorization 
levels and is $12,130,000 more than fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level.
    The bill specifies that $10,296,000 for the research and 
technology program is available for obligation until September 
30, 2010.

                           OPERATING EXPENSES

    The Committee recommends $151,107,000 for operating 
expenses.
    State Enforcement of Farm Operations.--The Committee is 
concerned about the confusion and the unnecessary burdens 
imposed on farm operators and State enforcement officials 
associated with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 
title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, parts 381-397. Clearly, 
farmers operating their own equipment to transport their own 
farm commodities to local markets are intended in many if not 
most cases to be exempt from the Federal regulatory 
requirements imposed on commercial operators. In regard to the 
regulations referenced, the Committee directs the FMCSA to 
review and provide a report to the Committee within 90 days 
after the date of enactment of this act outlining: the explicit 
legal requirements for farm operators and State enforcement 
officials; the flexibility, waivers and exemptions available to 
States in enforcing Federal requirements; the conditions 
related to farm operator compliance that compel the DOT to 
withhold Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program assistance to 
States; and, recommendations on how these Federal requirements 
may be simplified and made more uniform to avoid unnecessary 
and unintended confusion and regulatory burdens.
    Household Goods Enforcement.--The Committee recommends 
$1,500,000 for household goods enforcement. The Committee 
encourages FMCSA to assert its role to enforce Federal laws and 
regulations with respect to transportation of household goods 
and to do everything possible to increase the number of 
investigations against unscrupulous household goods movers.
    Working Capital Fund.--The Committee recommends $4,087,000 
for the working capital fund. The Committee recommendation is 
consisent with the budget request and more than a 6 percent 
increase above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.
    U.S.-Mexico Cross Border Trucking.--Section 350 of the 
fiscal year 2002 Transportation Appropriations Act (Public Law 
107-87) mandated that certain safety requirements must be met 
for Mexican motor carriers to enter the United States. Prior to 
the enactment of that legislation, on June 27, 2002, the 
Committee held a joint hearing with the Committee on Commerce, 
Science and Transportation on cross-border truck and bus 
operations at the United States-Mexico border. At that hearing, 
the Department of Transportation's Inspector General pointed 
out that, despite the fact that FMCSA had issued a rule 
requiring States to authorize their enforcement personnel to 
take action when they encounter a vehicle without valid 
operating authority, only two States had taken the necessary 
action by the time of that hearing. Today, more than 3 years 
later, some States have still not provided authorization for 
their enforcement personnel to take trucks without the proper 
operating authority out-of-service despite the fact that the 
FMCSA established a deadline for compliance with this 
requirement of September 30, 2003.
    The Committee is frustrated and dismayed to learn of the 
slow responsiveness by several States in complying with this 
Federal requirement. The Committee has tasked the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration with carrying out congressional 
intent on all of the safety requirements established in section 
350 of Public Law 107-87 and the implementation of all Federal 
motor carrier safety regulations. This includes the provision 
in section 350 requiring that inspectors of Mexican trucks 
affix a Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance [CVSA] decal showing 
that the vehicle meets all necessary requirements. Given the 
Agency's disappointing results in compelling compliance by the 
States to the above-cited requirements, the Committee directs 
the Administrator to redouble her efforts and take whatever 
steps are necessary to ensure that States come into full 
compliance with all the safety requirements and intent set 
forth in section 350.
    Federally Conducted Compliance Reviews.--The Committee is 
concerned that the number of federally conducted compliance 
reviews and enforcement actions have decreased significantly 
since the new entrant program commenced and directs FMCSA to 
ensure that it reverses this trend consistent with the 
objectives and goals of MCSIA. The Committee also directs FMCSA 
to work closely with the States to promote their continued 
participation in a vigorous compliance review program. In order 
to monitor its progress, FMCSA shall provide a report to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the number of 
completed compliance reviews and new extrant safety audits in 
conjunction with the Agency's fiscal year 2008 budget request.

                            PROGRAM EXPENSES

    The Committee recommends $70,893,000 for FMCSA's program 
expenses.
    Research and Technology.--The Committee recommends 
$10,296,000 for research and technology. The recommendation is 
consistent with the requested amount and $313,000 more than the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level.
    Outreach and Education.--The Committee recommends 
$4,000,000 for the outreach and education program, consistent 
with the budget request and the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. 
The Committee reminds FMCSA that data collection and analysis 
are two of the most important aspects of any program that 
focuses on ways to inform and influence behavior. The Committee 
expects FMCSA to manage the Outreach and Education program with 
the same performance, data, and analysis-driven focus which the 
Agency is implementing for the enforcement programs. The 
Committee directs FMCSA to use funds provided above the budget 
estimate to continue the outreach program with the goal of 
enhancing the coordination and effective enforcement of Federal 
laws and regulations with respect to household goods 
transportation. The Committee directs FMCSA to develop a 
process as part of the household goods outreach program for 
State safety authorities and law enforcement agencies to refer 
investigations to the appropriate Federal authorities.
    Information Management Program.--The Committee recommends 
$43,175,000 for FMCSA's information management program [IMP], 
which is consistent with the budget request and $1,504,000 more 
than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides the necessary resources for the Motor 
Carrier Safety Assistance Program [MCSAP] State grants. Grants 
will be used to support State compliance reviews; identify and 
apprehend traffic violators; conduct roadside inspections; and 
support safety audits on new entrant carriers. Grants are also 
provided to States for enforcement efforts at both the southern 
and northern borders to ensure that all points of entry into 
the United States are fortified with comprehensive safety 
measures; improvement of State commercial driver's license 
[CDL] oversight activities to prevent unqualified drivers from 
being issued CDL's; and the Performance Registration 
Information Systems and Management [PRISM] program, which links 
State motor vehicle registration systems with carrier safety 
data in order to identify unsafe commercial motor carriers.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

                (LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)

    The Committee recommends a liquidation of contract 
authorization of $294,000,000 for the payment of obligations 
incurred in carrying out motor carrier safety grant programs. 
The Committee recommendation is consistent with the budget 
estimate and is consistent with the amount of contract 
authorization for this program under SAFETEA-LU.

                      (LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)

    The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations of 
$294,000,000 for motor carrier safety grants. The recommended 
limitation is consistent with the budget estimate and is 
consistent with the amount of contract authorization for this 
program under SAFETEA-LU. The Committee recommendation is 
$14,820,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. In 
addition, the Committee recommends the allocation of $3,502,000 
of revenue aligned budget authority [RABA] from the Federal-aid 
highway program to this account as authorized by SAFETEA-LU. 
The Committee recommends a separate limitation for each grant 
program funded under this account with the following funding 
allocations:

    Section 130 subjects the funds in this act to section 350 
of Public Law 107-87 in order to ensure the safety of all 
cross-border long haul operations conducted by Mexican-
domiciled commercial carriers.
    Section 131. SAFETEA-LU includes a provision for the repeal 
of the Single State Registration System [SSRS] on January 1, 
2007, and its replacement with a new Unified Carrier 
Registration System [UCR]. The Committee, however, believes 
that a repeal of SSRS is premature given that progress on 
instituting the UCR has been insignificant. The current SSRS 
brings in approximately $100,000,000 in registration fees to 
the States that participate in the program, funds that are 
often used to cover the cost of transportation safety and 
enforcement programs. For this reason, the Committee includes 
language that would delay the repeal of SSRS by 12 months, and 
require the Government Accountability Office to report to the 
Congress on the progress being made in establishing the UCR.
    Section 132. This section makes a correction to Public Law 
109-59 regarding the definition of a commercial motor vehicle 
and regulation of freight forwarders and brokers.

             National Highway Traffic Safety Administration


                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] 
is responsible for motor vehicle safety, highway safety 
behavioral programs, and the motor vehicle information and 
automobile fuel economy programs. The Federal Government's 
regulatory role in motor vehicle and highway safety began in 
September 1966 with the enactment of the National Traffic and 
Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (codified as chapter 301 of 
title 49, United States Code) and the Highway Safety Act of 
1966 (codified as chapter 4 of title 23, United States Code). 
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 
instructs the Secretary to reduce traffic crashes and deaths 
and injuries resulting from traffic crashes; establish motor 
vehicle safety standards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
equipment in interstate commerce; carry out needed safety 
research and development; and expand the National Driver 
Register. The Highway Safety Act of 1966 instructs the 
Secretary to increase highway safety by providing for a 
coordinated national highway safety program through financial 
assistance to the States.
    In October 1966, these activities, originally under the 
jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce, were transferred to 
the Department of Transportation, to be carried out through the 
National Traffic Safety Bureau. In March 1970, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] was established 
as a separate organizational entity in the Department. It 
succeeded the National Highway Safety Bureau, which previously 
had administered traffic and highway safety functions as an 
organizational unit of the Federal Highway Administration.
    NHTSA's mission was expanded in October 1972 with the 
enactment of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act 
(now codified as chapters 321, 323, 325, 327, 329, and 331 of 
title 49, United States Code). This act as originally enacted, 
instructs the Secretary to establish low-speed collision bumper 
standards, consumer information activities, and odometer 
regulations. Three major amendments to this act have been 
enacted: (1) a December 1975 amendment directs the Secretary to 
set and administer mandatory automotive fuel economy standards; 
(2) an October 1984 amendment directs the Secretary to require 
certain passenger motor vehicles and their major replacement 
parts to be marked with identifying numbers or symbols; and (3) 
an October 1992 amendment directs the Secretary to set and 
administer automobile content labeling requirements.
    NHTSA's current programs are authorized in five major laws: 
(1) the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (chapter 
301 of title 49, United States Code ); (2) the Highway Safety 
Act (chapter 4 of title 23, U.S.C.); (3) the Motor Vehicle 
Information and Cost Savings Act [MVICSA] (part C of subtitle 
VI of title 49, United States Code); (4) the National Driver 
Register Act of 1982; and (5) the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, 
Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users 
[SAFETEA-LU].
    The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act provides 
for the establishment and enforcement of safety standards for 
vehicles and associated equipment and the conduct of supporting 
research, including the acquisition of required testing 
facilities and the operation of the National Driver Register, 
which was reauthorized by the National Driver Register Act of 
1982.
    The Highway Safety Act provides for coordinated national 
highway safety programs (section 402 of title 23, United States 
Code) to be carried out by the States and for highway safety 
research, development, and demonstration programs (section 403 
of title 23, United States Code). The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 
1988 (Public Law 100-690) authorized a new drunk driving 
prevention program (section 410 of title 23, United States 
Code) to make grants to States to implement and enforce drunk 
driving prevention programs.
    SAFETEA-LU, which was enacted on August 10, 2005, either 
reauthorized or added new authorizations for the full range of 
NHTSA programs for fiscal years 2005 through 2009.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommendation of $819,250,000 provides 
sufficient funding for the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration to maintain current programs and continue the 
mobilization and paid media initiatives that have proven so 
effective in increasing safety belt use and impaired driving 
awareness.
    The following table summarizes the Committee 
recommendations:

    These programs support traffic safety programs and related 
research, demonstrations, technical assistance, and national 
leadership for highway safety programs conducted by State and 
local government, the private sector, universities, research 
units, and various safety associations and organizations. These 
highway safety programs emphasize alcohol and drug 
countermeasures, vehicle occupant protection, traffic law 
enforcement, emergency medical and trauma care systems, traffic 
records and licensing, State and community traffic safety 
evaluations, motorcycle riders, pedestrian and bicycle safety, 
pupil transportation, distracted and drowsy driving, young and 
older driver safety programs, and development of improved 
accident investigation procedures.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a total of $231,500,000 in new 
budgetary resources, which is $4,250,000 above the budget 
request and $2,592,430 less than the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level.
    The Committee recommends funds to be distributed to the 
following program activities in the following amounts:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Total...........................................      231,500,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           OPERATING EXPENSES

    Budget Documentation.--The Committee reminds NHTSA that 
budget request materials submitted to the Congress should not 
only include explanatory documentation for any proposed budget 
increases; the budget materials should also describe any 
proposed decreases to programs from the prior year's funding 
levels.
    The Committee recommends $5,403,000 for the working capital 
fund, equal to the budget request.
    Administrative Expenses.--Section 2001(11) of SAFETEA-LU 
provides for administrative and related operating expenses for 
NHTSA carrying out chapter 4 of title 23, United States Code, 
and for the highway safety title of Public Law 109-59. The 
Committee recommends $17,750,000, to NHTSA for administrative 
expenses associated with administering the highway safety grant 
programs and related operating expenses.

                           SAFETY PERFORMANCE

    Vehicle Safety Harmonization.--The Committee recommends 
$206,000 for international harmonization activities, an amount 
equal to the budget request.
    New Car Assessment Program.--The Committee recommends 
$10,500,000 for the New Car Assessment Program [NCAP].
    Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems.--The TREAD Act included a 
requirement that the Secretary of Transportation issue a rule 
mandating new motor vehicles have a warning system to alert 
operators when a tire is significantly under-inflated. In 
compliance with this directive, in April of 2005 NHTSA 
published a final rule that requires Tire Pressure Monitoring 
Systems [TPMS] to be installed in every new vehicle by model 
year 2006. NHTSA notes the potential of TPMS in preventing 
injury, saving lives and improving fuel economy. However, the 
Committee is concerned that these impacts may be undermined if 
consumers do not fully understand the technology. Therefore, 
the Committee provides NHTSA with $750,000 and directs NHTSA to 
carry out a consumer education campaign that would assist 
drivers in understanding new TPMS technologies, their purpose, 
and the valuable safety information that they provide.

                        highway safety programs

    The Committee recommends funds to be distributed to the 
following program activities in the following amount:

      Total...........................................       50,965,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Impaired Driving.--The Committee recommends $11,300,000 to 
support the impaired driving program. This amount is equal to 
the budget request. These additional funds will allow NHTSA to 
continue to: (1) promote high visibility law enforcement; (2) 
educate prosecutors, judges and law enforcement regarding 
impaired driving and promote specialized or enhanced court 
systems; (3) develop effective messages and countermeasures to 
reach high risk groups; and (4) encourage widespread adoption 
of medical screening and brief intervention for individuals 
with alcohol abuse problems.
    Judicial and Prosecutorial Awareness.--The Committee 
recommends $1,100,000 for judicial and prosecutorial awareness 
to expedite the detection, identification and tracking of hard 
core drunk drivers. The Committee is aware that one of the 
major factors in alcohol-related crashes is the number of 
habitual drunk drivers involved in alcohol-related traffic 
crashes.
    The Committee directs NHTSA to work with State and local 
law enforcement officials, judges, prosecutors and parole 
officers to assist them in developing strategies that 
specifically target the removal of habitual drunk drivers from 
the road.
    Motorcycles.--NHTSA's budget documents state that 
motorcycle fatalities have increased for 7 straight years, for 
a total 89 percent increase since 1997. Helmet use continues to 
play a role in 40 percent of motorcycle accidents. The 
Committee recommends $800,000 for motorcycle program 
activities, the same as the fiscal year 2006 level.
    National Occupant Protection Program.--Recent years have 
seen encouraging increases in safety belt use across the 
country, reaching 82 percent for 2005.
    The Committee continues to urge NHTSA to be vigilant and 
resourceful in its efforts to not only increase the seat belt 
rate, but ensure that this vigilance is not overshadowing the 
overall goal of reducing fatalities in this and every aspect of 
highway safety. The Committee recommends $11,224,000 for 
NHTSA's occupant protection efforts, which is the requested 
amount.
    To supplement NHTSA's overall safety belt effort, the 
Committee recommends funding to continue the ``Click It or 
Ticket'' national public service message program.
    Emergency Medical Services.--The Committee continues to 
support the development of a national database to collect EMS 
data similar to those that exist for fire and police services. 
The Committee recommends an increase of $2,000,000 for fiscal 
year 2007, of which $1,000,000 is to continue the 
implementation of the National Emergency Medical Services 
Information System [NEMISIS] data collection initiative at the 
National Center for Statistics and Analysis. The Committee 
views the implementation of NEMISIS, to be extremely important 
in light of NHTSA's role as Federal coordinator of all EMS 
systems.
    International Activities.--The Committee recommends 
$100,000 for NHTSA's international activities initiative.
    The Committee recommends $500,000 for necessary expenses of 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to support 
the E-911 Implementation Coordination Office, established 
pursuant to section 104 of Public Law 108-494.

                         RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS

    Biomechanical Research.--The Committee recommends 
$12,500,000 for biomechanics research. The Committee's 
recommendation includes necessary resources for the continued 
research of the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network 
program.
    Maternal and Fetal Injuries in Vehicle Crashes.--The 
Committee has become aware of possible increases in vehicle 
crashes involving pregnant women. These vehicle crashes put 
both the expectant mother and fetus at risk, yet little is 
known of the incident, risks and characteristics of pregnant 
women in crashes. The Committee directs NHTSA to explore the 
feasibility of adding a gravid anthropomorphic dummy to its 
vehicle testing procedures. A Federal standard on a gravid 
anthropomorphic dummy may help spur the research to improve the 
crashworthiness of vehicles for pregnant women. NHTSA shall 
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
within 9 months of enactment of this act on the number of 
crashes involving pregnant women and the injuries and 
fatalities associated with those crashes. Also, the report 
shall include an assessment of creating a crash test dummy that 
would measure the injuries to the women and the fetus.
    CIREN Research on Older Drivers.--The Committee is aware of 
the growing population of older Americans, which is expected to 
nearly double by 2030. In recognition of this growth and the 
different health issues facing older Americans, the Committee 
directs NHTSA as part of its CIREN program, to collect data 
that will measure the impact of crashes on older populations 
and that would assist in the possible development of a crash 
test dummy representing older occupants. NHTSA is directed to 
update the Committee on the CIREN program including its efforts 
related to older drivers.
    Plastic and Composite Vehicles.--The Committee recognizes 
the development of plastics and polymer-based composites in the 
automotive industry and the important role these technologies 
play in improving and enabling automobile performance. The 
Committee recommends $500,000 to continue development of 
Lightweight Plastic and Composite Intensive Vehicles [PCIV] 
research to examine possible safety benefits. The program will 
help facilitate a foundation of cooperation between DOT, the 
Department of Energy and industry stakeholders for the 
development of safety-centered approaches for future light-
weight automotive design.
    Crash Avoidance and Human Vehicle Performance.--The 
Committee includes $6,750,000 for the crash avoidance and human 
vehicle performance program as requested in the budget 
estimate. Within the funds provided, the Committee directs that 
no less than $3,000,000 be utilized for the National Advance 
Driving Simulator.
    Fatality Analysis Reporting System.--The Committee 
recommends $7,063,000 for the Fatality Analysis Reporting 
System [FARS], equal to the proposed budget request and the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted base funding.
    FAST FARS.--The Committee recommends $1,000,000 for the 
FAST FARS data collection program. An effective FAST FARS 
system will permit the agency to analyze the effectiveness of 
its programs more quickly, thereby improving decision making to 
better utilize limited safety funding resources.
    Vehicle Crash Causation Study.--The Committee continues to 
support the ongoing vehicle crash causation study and provides 
$7,000,000, the requested level, for this purpose.
    Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Safety.--
The Committee strongly supports NHTSA's initiative to address 
possible safety concerns as hydrogen fuel cell and other 
alternative fuel cell vehicles are introduced into the Nation's 
fleet. The fiscal year 2007 budget request, $925,000, is 
provided for this purpose.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    SAFETEA-LU reauthorizes three State grant programs: highway 
safety programs, occupant protection incentive grants, and 
alcohol-impaired driving countermeasures incentive grants; and 
authorizes for the first time an additional five State 
programs: safety belt performance grants, State traffic safety 
information systems improvement grants, high visibility 
enforcement program, child safety and child booster seat safety 
incentive grants, and motorcyclist safety grants.
    The highway safety grant program under section 402 of title 
23, United States Code SAFETEA-LU established a new safety belt 
performance incentive grant program under section 406 of title 
23, United States Code; SAFETEA-LU also established a new 
program of incentive grants under section 408 of title 23, 
United States Code; SAFETEA-LU amended the alcohol-impaired 
driving countermeasures incentive grant program authorized by 
section 410 of title 23, United States Code; SAFETEA-LU 
establishes a new program to administer at least two high-
visibility traffic safety law enforcement campaigns each year 
to achieve one or both of the following objectives: (1) reduce 
alcohol-impaired or drug-impaired operation of motor vehicles; 
and/or (2) increase the use of safety belts by occupants of 
motor vehicles.
    Motorcyclist Safety.--Section 2010 of SAFETEA-LU 
established a new program of incentive grants for motorcycle 
safety training and motorcyclist awareness programs. Section 
2011 of SAFETEA-LU established a new incentive grant program 
these grants may be used only for child safety seat and child 
restraint programs.
    Grant Administrative Expenses.--Section 2001(a)(11) of 
SAFETEA-LU provides funding for salaries and operating expenses 
related to the administration of the grants programs and 
supports the national occupant protection user survey and 
highway safety research programs.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

                (LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)

    The Committee recommends an appropriation for liquidation 
of contract authorization of $583,750,000 for payment on 
obligations incurred in carryout provision of the highway 
traffic safety grant programs. The Committee recommendation is 
consistent with the amount of contract authorization for 
highway traffic safety grant programs under SAFETEA-LU. The 
recommended liquidating cash appropriation is equal to the 
budget estimate and $5,574,000 more than fiscal year 2006 
enacted level.

                      (LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)

    The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations of 
$583,750,000 for the highway traffic safety grant programs 
funded under this heading. The recommended limitation is equal 
to the budget estimate and $11,356,000 more than fiscal year 
2006 enacted level.
    The Committee continues to recommend prohibiting the use of 
section 402 funds for construction, rehabilitation or 
remodeling costs, or for office furnishings and fixtures for 
State, local, or private buildings or structures.
    The Committee recommends a separate limitation on 
obligations for administrative expenses and for each grant 
program as follows:

                    Federal Railroad Administration

    The Federal Railroad Administration [FRA] became an 
operating administration within the Department of 
Transportation on April 1, 1967. It incorporated the Bureau of 
Railroad Safety from the Interstate Commerce Commission, the 
Office of High Speed Ground Transportation from the Department 
of Commerce, and the Alaska Railroad from the Department of the 
Interior. The Federal Railroad Administration is responsible 
for planning, developing, and administering programs to achieve 
safe operating and mechanical practices in the railroad 
industry. Grants to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation 
(Amtrak) and other financial assistance programs to 
rehabilitate and improve the railroad industry's physical 
infrastructure are also administered by the Federal Railroad 
Administration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) is a 
for-profit corporation that operates intercity passenger rail 
services in 46 States and the District of Columbia, in addition 
to serving as a contractor in various capacities for several 
commuter rail agencies. Congress created Amtrak in the Rail 
Passenger Service Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-518) in response 
to private carriers' inability to profitably operate intercity 
passenger rail service due a steady decline in ridership that 
began in the 1920's. Thereafter, Amtrak assumed the common 
carrier obligations of the private railroads in exchange for 
the right to priority access of their tracks for incremental 
cost.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

     CAPITAL GRANTS FOR THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION

    The Committee recommends $750,000,000 for capital grants to 
Amtrak. Of this amount, no more than $295,000,000 is available 
for debt service payments. The Committee is concerned about the 
safety and efficiency of the Nation's passenger rail system and 
has provided the funds needed to ensure Amtrak's major capital 
needs are met. The Committee continues to believe that 
providing funds in the forms of grants for Amtrak's capital 
needs ensures greater oversight and more optimal use of 
taxpayers' resources.
    Because the Committee is concerned about the uncertainty of 
what benchmarks must be reached to achieve a systemwide state-
of-good repair, the Committee has included a new provision 
allowing the Federal Railroad Administration to retain up to 
one-quarter of 1 percent of Amtrak's capital subsidy to provide 
meaningful oversight to Amtrak's major capital investments. 
Amtrak has begun to undertake projects that are significant in 
size and cost, such as the replacement of the bridges across 
the Thames and Niantic Rivers in Connecticut and the 
ventilation towers for the Hudson and East River tunnels in New 
York and New Jersey. Moreover, as the failure of Amtrak's 
electrification system between New York City and Washington, 
DC, on May 25 of this year demonstrated, the lack of action on 
Amtrak's major capital assets has the potential for adversely 
affecting transportation over a wide region.
    While the FRA has assumed the responsibility of providing 
annual capital grants to Amtrak, the FRA has yet to possess the 
resources necessary to provide meaningful oversight of major 
capital investments. As an example, FRA does not have the 
resources to review independently the design and cost estimates 
for the new bridges, to assess whether the bridges have been 
built according to design, or to review and, if necessary, 
recommend corrective measures if the bridge fabrication and 
construction begins to exceed estimates and schedules. Indeed, 
FRA's oversight is limited to reviewing reports on project 
progress from Amtrak's engineering and mechanical departments 
except where FRA's limited staff might have expertise in a 
specific area that coincides with a capital project. The 
Federal Transit Administration performs its oversight of major 
projects through Project Management Oversight consultants. The 
Committee believes that FRA should use a similar approach. 
While the amount provided for this purpose is modest in 
absolute terms, it should be adequate to initiate the oversight 
program and for FRA to review those large projects important 
for maintaining or improving safety and operational reliability 
where there may be significant risk in achieving the expected 
cost, schedule or scope of the project. It is expected that 
with this enhanced ability that FRA will report to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on a regular basis on 
the state of Amtrak's capital program.
    The Committee remains concerned about the significant costs 
associated with Amtrak's food and beverage and first-class 
services. While Amtrak has shown commendable progress in its 
efforts to reform these services, the Committee believes that 
further oversight and accountability is needed. The Committee 
has included a provision that prohibits the Secretary of 
Transportation from approving any capital grant request that 
proposes spending funds on the retrofitting, refurbishing or 
maintenance of equipment or facilities used for food and 
beverage or sleeper class services unless the proposed plans 
comply with the stated goal of eliminating Federal subsidies 
for these services by 2011. While Amtrak's services meet basic 
mobility needs, the Committee does not believe that Federal 
subsidies should be directed toward the enhancement of services 
and amenities that only add to Amtrak's operational losses.
    As Amtrak itself has noted, Amtrak's equipment and 
infrastructure require significant investment to achieve a 
state-of-good repair. Amtrak has, on repeated occasions, 
diverted funds needed for capital investments to cover 
operational losses. This has had the effect of leaving Amtrak's 
system in a less than optimal state. While the Committee has 
pressed both Amtrak and the Department of Transportation to 
provide a detailed and prioritized list of needs to return 
Amtrak's infrastructure to a state-of-good repair, both 
entities have either been unable or unwilling to do so. The 
administration's capital grant request for Amtrak for fiscal 
year 2007 is $500,000,000, but it remains unclear what this 
number will achieve in restoring Amtrak's system to the 
necessary state-of-good repair. If the Committee were better 
able to discern what projects could be funded with more 
resources, it would be better positioned to justify the 
provision of such resources. The Committee has, therefore, 
included provisions mandating that the administration's budget 
submission for fiscal year 2008 include a detailed capital 
investment plan that prioritizes and provides cost estimates 
for capital projects necessary to achieve safe, efficient, and 
timely intercity passenger rail service. This plan should 
incorporate input from the States and railroads where Amtrak 
provides services or its infrastructure is used detailing what 
investments are necessary to ensure timely and safe 
transportation services. The Committee believes that such a 
plan will better enable Congress, Amtrak, and the 
administration to chart a future path for Amtrak and to more 
strategically provide for Amtrak's many capital needs.

    EFFICIENCY INCENTIVE GRANTS TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER 
                              CORPORATION

    Despite the lack of action on a comprehensive 
reauthorization of Amtrak, the Committee notes that there are 
signs that Amtrak is making some progress in addressing the 
significant imbalance between its operating expenses and 
revenues. The Committee is pleased with reports of savings and 
other efficiencies achieved through the reforms contained in 
the fiscal year 2006 Transportation appropriations act 
directing savings through operating efficiencies, including, 
but not limited to, modifications to food and beverage service 
and first-class service. Amtrak also has improved its 
accounting and its capital project management and reporting. It 
has renewed focus on improving on-time performance on the 
Northeast Corridor that is resulting in measurable 
improvements. Amtrak is implementing a consistent approach to 
seeking compensation from States for service largely within one 
State modeled after what States on the Pacific Coast have been 
doing for years and Amtrak has initiated a review of the future 
of its long distance service. All of these initiatives are 
positive signs. While most of these reforms can be found in 
directives from this Committee or conditions in Amtrak's grant 
agreement with FRA, the Amtrak Board, and Amtrak's current 
management deserve credit for serving as instruments and 
advocates of needed change.
    Despite the concerns stated previously, the Committee is 
pleased that Amtrak has implemented strategic initiatives in 15 
areas including: a plan for restructurings its food and 
beverage service and dining and lounge car operations over 
several years; adopting a reliability-centered maintenance 
approach to increase fleet maintenance efficiencies; 
consolidating maintenance facilities and reducing maintenance 
overtime; outsourcing and reducing staff at stations; improving 
fuel efficiency; renegotiating labor agreements to eliminate 
outsourcing and work rule restrictions; and reducing outside 
legal fees. While Amtrak is making positive steps toward 
reforms, the Committee remains concerned that other initiatives 
such as restructuring long-distance train services, improving 
financial management systems, and improving service reliability 
on the Northeast Corridor are only in the beginning of the 
planning stage, and that many of the initiatives have not yet 
translated into any meaningful way of improving Amtrak's bottom 
line.
    The Committee remains interested in making sure that Amtrak 
is fully addressing reform opportunities and meeting 
benchmarked goals that are sustainable over the long term on 
food and beverage reforms, sleeper car and long distance 
service in particular. Amtrak continues to require a 
significant claim on the discretionary Federal financial 
resources available for transportation and places significant 
stress on this Committee in finding sufficient resources to 
keep Amtrak running. For this reason, the Committee will 
continue to insist on reform initiatives with timelines and set 
benchmarked goals so that the Committee will know with some 
degree of confidence that the Federal taxpayer's funds, 
regardless of the amount, provides a high quality product in a 
cost-effective manner.
    The most glaring examples of the failure of Amtrak to serve 
as an effective steward of the taxpayer's investments are in 
the areas of food and beverage service and first-class service. 
Both the Amtrak Inspector General and the Department of 
Transportation Inspector General have singled out these 
functions as primary examples of misplaced priorities in the 
use of the financial resources available to the Corporation. In 
fiscal year 2006, Amtrak's losses on food and beverage service 
will equal over 10 percent of Amtrak's total subsidy and over 
20 percent of its operating subsidy. Amtrak loses even more on 
its first-class service.
    While the Committee believes there is a role for Federal 
subsidies on intercity passenger rail service, in particular 
for capital investment, it cannot accept the concept that the 
Federal taxpayers should pay for the cost of dinner and drinks 
on the train or of first-class accommodations. Indeed, 49 
U.S.C. 305(c)(4) authorizes Amtrak to ``provide food and 
beverage service on its trains only if the revenues from the 
services each year at least equal the cost of providing the 
service.'' This statutory requirement seems to have been 
ignored by Amtrak. The Committee recognizes that passengers on 
trains, particularly those trains that operate on extended 
schedules, need food. This does not mean that the food and 
beverage or the first-class accommodations should receive a 
Federal subsidy. The Committee notes that Amtrak has begun 
initiatives for improving the financial performance of food and 
beverage and first-class services--initiatives that the 
Committee wants to nurture. Indeed, the history of Amtrak is 
replete with initiatives that have been forgotten or ignored 
because the attention of management, Amtrak's Board of 
Directors, the Department of Transportation, and the Congress 
have been diverted to other issues. Thus, this year, the 
Committee wishes to build upon Amtrak's early work by requiring 
that Amtrak develop realistic plans with meaningful milestones 
to eliminate the Federal subsidies of these services over the 
next 5 years. Amtrak is directed to reduce the net Federal 
subsidy of food and beverage service and sleeper/first-class 
service in fiscal year 2007 by 20 percent over the level of 
subsidy, including that attributable to the operation and 
maintenance of equipment and facilities solely used for these 
services, in fiscal year 2005. The Committee requests that 
Amtrak's Inspector General provide the Senate and House 
Appropriations Committees with regular reports on Amtrak's 
performance.
    To better understand the cost effectiveness of Amtrak 
today, the Committee directs FRA, in consultation with Amtrak, 
Amtrak's Inspector General, the Government Accountability 
Office, and such other entities that the Administrator deems 
appropriate, to develop a set of metrics for important 
functions performed by Amtrak, be they important from a safety 
or operational perspective or important because these functions 
consume a large amount of Amtrak's financial resources. FRA and 
Amtrak will then identify how Amtrak and corporations and/or 
public agencies with functions similar to Amtrak, performed 
against these metrics in fiscal year 2006 or the most recent 
year in which data are available. Amtrak will include in its 
quarterly reports updates of its performance against these 
metrics.
    Another approach to determining the extent to which the 
quality and cost of providing intercity passenger rail service 
can be improved is to determine whether an entity other than 
Amtrak can provide such services more efficiently and 
effectively. While there has been an ongoing debate over 
whether others could do better than Amtrak, there has yet to be 
an effective test. This issue certainly resonates with the 
States that provide financial support for intercity passenger 
rail service. Amtrak's de facto monopoly limits any incentive 
on Amtrak's part to control costs or enhance the quality of its 
operation, and States must pay whatever Amtrak demands. The 
Committee believes that, in the absence of reauthorization 
legislation, an appropriate interim measure to determine the 
feasibility of a State assuming greater responsibility over 
intercity passenger rail would be a pilot program to determine 
whether a State can reduce its costs and, thus, reduce the 
Federal operating subsidy while maintaining or improving 
service quality. This will be achieved by enabling a State to 
assume responsibility for part or all of the functions that the 
State presently pays Amtrak to do.
    The Secretary of Transportation is directed to require 
Amtrak to conduct a pilot program under which a State would 
assume the financial responsibility for a train, route or 
corridor that the State either presently subsidizes or has 
committed to subsidize. The State would receive 75 percent of 
the current fully allocated operating loss, which effectively 
is the Federal subsidy of the service in the first year and 50 
percent in the second and third years. Thus, this pilot would 
not only yield information on the potential long-term benefits 
of States assuming responsibility for trains they deem 
important, it offers some reduction in the Federal operating 
subsidy needs in the short term. This pilot would be 
implemented as a contract between a State and Amtrak. The State 
would use established State procedures to arrange for another 
entity or entities to provide those functions the State wishes 
to assume. Amtrak would make whatever other services, 
equipment, facilities, including crew where incorporated into a 
State's plan, available to the State at a cost that covers 
Amtrak's expenses. The Secretary would effectively oversee 
Amtrak's implementation of this provision. Amtrak and the State 
should reach an agreement through amicable negotiations. The 
Secretary would also be charged with keeping the process moving 
and, where the State and Amtrak could not reach agreement, 
serve to resolved such issues as the appropriate terms and 
conditions for the use of Amtrak-controlled equipment.
    On-Time Performance of Amtrak Long Distance Trains.---The 
Committee is greatly dismayed with Amtrak's deteriorating on-
time performance outside of the Northeast Corridor. Such 
delays, frequently longer than 3 or 4 hours, undermine Amtrak's 
ability to attract repeat customers. Outside of the Northeast 
corridor, Amtrak trains are dispatched by the freight railroads 
over whose territory they operate. Under section 24308(c) of 
title 49 of the United States Code, Amtrak trains have 
``preference over freight transportation in using a rail line, 
junction, or crossing'' unless the Secretary of Transportation 
provides a specific exemption to this law. For this reason, the 
Committee directs the DOT Inspector General to investigate the 
root causes of Amtrak delays and compliance with the above 
cited subsection of title 49. The report shall investigate all 
pertinent issues regarding practices in dispatching trains and 
delays in maintaining track used by Amtrak.
    The Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing 
[RRIF].--The RRIF program was established by Public Law 109-178 
to provide direct loans and loan guarantees to State and local 
governments, government-sponsored entities, or railroads. 
Credit assistance under the program may be used for 
rehabilitating or developing rail equipment and facilities. 
SAFETEA-LU expanded the authority under the RRIF program; 
currently, the unpaid principal amounts of the obligations may 
not exceed $35,000,000,000 at any one time. Of this total, not 
less than $7,000,000,000 is reserved for projects benefiting 
freight railroads other than class I carriers. No Federal 
appropriation is required to implement the program because a 
non-Federal partner may contribute the subsidy amount required 
by the Credit Reform Act of 1990 in the form of a credit risk 
premium. The Committee continues bill language specifying that 
no new direct loans or loan guarantee commitments may be made 
using Federal funds for the payment of any credit premium 
amount during fiscal year 2007.

                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

    Section 150 allows DOT to purchase promotional items of 
nominal value for use in certain outreach activities.
    Section 151 prohibits funds for the National Railroad 
Passenger Corporation from being available if the Corporation 
contracts for services at or from any location outside of the 
United States which were, as of July 1, 2006, performed by a 
full-time or part-time Amtrak employee within the United 
States.

                     Federal Transit Administration

    The Federal Transit Administration was established as a 
component of the Department of Transportation by Reorganization 
Plan No. 2 of 1968, effective July 1, 1968, which transferred 
most of the functions and programs under the Federal Transit 
Act of 1964, as amended (78 Stat. 302; 49 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), 
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The 
missions of the Federal Transit Administration are: to assist 
in the development of improved mass transportation facilities, 
equipment, techniques, and methods; to encourage the planning 
and establishment of urban and rural transportation services 
needed for economical and desirable development; to provide 
mobility for transit dependents in both metropolitan and rural 
areas; to maximize the productivity and efficiency of 
transportation systems; and to provide assistance to State and 
local governments and their instrumentalities in financing such 
services and systems.
    The programs funded by the FTA are contained in the Safe, 
Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A 
Legacy for Users [SAFETEA-LU], Public Law 109-59. The budget 
request follows a new account structure, established under 
SAFETEA-LU, which consists of four major accounts, three of 
which are general funded--Administrative Expenses, Research, 
and University Research Centers, and Capital Investment Grants. 
The fourth, Formula and Bus Grants, is funded solely from the 
Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund.

    The Committee recommends a total of $85,000,000 for the 
agency's salaries and administrative expenses. The recommended 
level of funding is $5,800,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Committee recommendation includes language authorizing 
the Administrator to transfer funding between offices. Any 
transfers totaling more than 5 percent of the initial 
appropriation from this account must be approved by the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations through the same 
process used for reprogramming funds.
    Budget Justifications.--The FTA is directed to submit its 
fiscal year 2008 congressional justification for administrative 
expenses by office, with material detailing salaries and 
expenses, staffing increases, and programmatic initiatives of 
each office.
    Project Management Oversight Activities.--The Committee 
directs FTA to continue to submit to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations the quarterly FMO and PMO reports 
for each project with a full funding grant agreement.
    To further support oversight activities, the bill continues 
a provision requiring FTA to reimburse the DOT Office of 
Inspector General [OIG] $2,000,000 for costs associated with 
audits and investigations of transit-related issues, including 
reviews of new fixed guideway systems. This reimbursement must 
come from funds available for the execution of contracts. Over 
the past several years, the OIG has provided critical oversight 
of a number transit projects and FTA activities, which the 
Committee has found invaluable. The Committee anticipates that 
the Inspector General will continue such activities in fiscal 
year 2007.
    Full Funding Grant Agreements [FFGAs].--TEA21, as amended, 
requires that FTA notify the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, as well as the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on 
Banking, 60 days before executing a full funding grant 
agreement. In its notification to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations, the Committee directs FTA to 
submit the following information: (1) a copy of the proposed 
full funding grant agreement; (2) the total and annual Federal 
appropriations required for the project; (3) the yearly and 
total Federal appropriations that can be planned or anticipated 
for future FFGAs for each fiscal year through 2008; (4) a 
detailed analysis of annual commitments for current and 
anticipated FFGAs against the program authorization, by 
individual project; (5) an evaluation of whether the 
alternatives analysis made by the applicant fully assessed all 
the viable alternatives; (6) a financial analysis of the 
project's cost and sponsor's ability to finance the project, 
which shall be conducted by an independent examiner and which 
shall include an assessment of the capital cost estimate and 
finance plan; (7) the source and security of all public and 
private sector financing; (8) the project's operating plan, 
which enumerates the project's future revenue and ridership 
forecasts; and (9) a listing of all planned contingencies and 
possible risks associated with the project.
    The Committee also directs FTA to inform the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations in writing 30 days before 
approving schedule, scope, or budget changes to any full 
funding grant agreement. Correspondence relating to all changes 
shall include any budget revisions or program changes that 
materially alter the project as originally stipulated in the 
FFGA, including any proposed change in rail car procurement.
    The Committee directs FTA to continue to provide a monthly 
new start project update to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, detailing the status of each project. This 
update should include FTA's plans and specific milestone 
schedules for advancing projects, especially those within 2 
years of a proposed full funding grant agreement. In addition, 
FTA should notify the Committees 10 days before any project in 
the new starts process is given approval by FTA to advance to 
preliminary engineering or final design.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    As proposed in the budget, Formula and Bus Grants includes 
the following programs: urbanized area formula grants; clean 
fuels formula grants; formula grants for special needs of 
elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities; formula 
grants for non-urbanized areas; job access and reverse commute 
grants; new freedom grants; growing States and high density 
States grants; bus and bus facility grants; rail modernization 
grants; alternatives analysis; alternative transportation in 
parks and public lands; and the national transit database. In 
addition, set-asides from formula funds are directed to a grant 
program for intercity bus operators to finance Americans with 
Disabilities Act accessibility costs.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $7,262,775,000 for transit formula 
and bus grants from a limitation on obligations from the mass 
transit account of the highway trust fund. The recommendation 
is $352,643,310 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. 
This account includes a rescission of $28,660,920.
    The Committee recommendation maintains the set-aside for 
project oversight in current law instead of providing an 
increase for program management of formula funds, as requested. 
The Committee distributes, the total level of funding among the 
formula categories as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 3009 of SAFETEA-LU amends U.S.C. 5307, urbanized 
formula grants, by providing for a phase-out of operating 
eligibility for urbanized areas which crossed over 200,000 in 
population for the first time in the 2000 census, but continues 
to allow the Secretary to make operating grants to urbanized 
areas with a population of less than 200,000. Generally, 
urbanized formula grants may be used to fund capital projects 
and to finance the planning and improvement costs of equipment, 
facilities, and associated capital maintenance used in mass 
transportation. All urbanized areas greater than 200,000 in 
population are statutorily required to use 1 percent of their 
annual formula grants on enhancements, which include 
landscaping, public art, bicycle storage, and connections to 
parks.
    Formula and Bus funds can be used for all transit purposes, 
including planning, bus and railcar purchases, facility repair 
and construction, maintenance and, where eligible, operating 
expenses. These funds help transit systems alleviate 
congestion, ensure basic mobility, promote economically vibrant 
communities, and meet the requirements of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act [ADA] and the Clean Air Act [CAA].
    The following table displays the State-by-State 
distribution of the formula program funds within each of the 
program categories:

    Limited Extensions of Discretionary Funds.--There have been 
occasions when the Committee has extended the availability of 
capital investment funds for longer than the original 3-year 
availability. The Committee, however, has extended funding for 
many of these projects for more than 1 fiscal year, in an 
effort to give transit agencies and FTA the opportunity to 
spend these funds. The Committee strongly urges FTA to obligate 
the grants before the commencement of the fiscal year 2007 
calendar, as the Committee will not look favorably upon any 
further requests for an extension of funds past 1 fiscal year. 
Three, even four, fiscal years is more than an adequate amount 
of time for project sponsors to obligate the discretionary 
grants, except in the most unusual of circumstances. Transit 
agencies are urged not to seek discretionary funding when the 
work cannot be completed in a 3-year time frame. In addition, 
by October 30, 2006, FTA should submit a report to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations detailing which of 
these projects have not obligated the funds, including an 
explanation of why this could not be achieved.
    The availability of these particular funds is extended for 
1 additional year, absent further congressional direction. The 
Committee directs the FTA not to reallocate funds provided in 
fiscal year 2004 for the following bus and bus facilities 
projects:
    Alaska--Sawmill Creek Intermodal Facility
    Georgia--Macon Multimodal Station
    Idaho--Transit Coalition for Buses and Bus Facilities
    Iowa--UNI Multimodal Project
    Indiana--Indianapolis Downtown Transit Facility
    Massachusetts--Springfield Union Station Intermodal 
facility redevelopment
    Mississippi--Intermodal Facility, JIA
    New York--Nassau County, Hub Enhancements
    Ohio--Central Ohio Transit Authority Facility
    Pennyslvania-- Pittsburgh Water Taxi and
    South Dakota--Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Public Buses and 
Bus Facilities
    Washington--Grant Transit Authority, Bus Facility.
    The Committee directs FTA not to reallocate funds provided 
in fiscal year 2003 or previous acts for the following bus and 
bus facilities projects:
    Georgia--Macon Intermodal Center
    Indiana--Indianapolis Downtown Transit facility
    Massachusetts--Springfield Union Station Intermodal 
facility
    Massachusetts--Springfield Union Station Intermodal 
Redevelopment Project; and
    Washington--Aurora Avenue Bus Rapid Transit.
    Bus Rapid Transit Project Las Vegas Boulvard, Nevada.--
Amounts made available in fiscal year 2003 for Bus Rapid 
Transit Project Las Vegas Boulvard., Nevada shall not be 
reallocated by FTA and shall be available to the Regional 
Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada for Buses and Bus 
Facilities, including Bus Rapid Transit projects, and shall 
remain available until expended.
    Orange County Transportation Authority.--Funds made 
available in fiscal year 2002 for Costa Mesa CNG facility shall 
be available to Orange County Transportation Authority.
    Utah Intermodal Transportation Facilities.--Funds made 
available in the fiscal year 2006 for the Westminster College 
Intermodal Transportation Expansion for small buses in Utah 
shall be made available for Utah Intermodal Transportation 
Facilities.
    Pablo Bus Facility.--Funds made available in fiscal year 
2006 for Pablo Bus Facility and Pablo Buses shall be made 
available for Pablo Bus Facility.
    Illinois Statewide Buses.--The Committee provides 
$6,000,000 to the Illinois Department of Transportation [IDOT] 
for section 5309 Bus and Bus Facilities grants. The Committee 
expects IDOT to provide at least $3,000,000 for Downstate 
Illinois replacement buses in Bloomington, Champaign-Urbana, 
Danville, Decatur, Peoria, Pekin, Quincy, River Valley, 
Rockford, Rock Island, Springfield, Madison County, Rides MTD, 
South Central MTD, and Macomb. Further, the Committee expects 
IDOT to provide appropriate funds for bus facilities in 
Bloomington, Galesburg, River Valley Metro in Kankakee, Macomb, 
Peoria, and Rock Island, including $500,000 for the Macomb 
maintenance facility and $500,000 for the Kankakee's River 
Valley Metro operations facility.
    Springfield Union Station Intermodal Facility, 
Massachusetts.--The Committee continues to be supportive of the 
construction of a new, affordable, intermodal facility in the 
city of Springfield, Massachusetts. However, the Committee 
notes that more than $12,700,000 of funds already appropriated 
for this project from as far back as 2002 remain unobligated. 
Still other funds provided for the project in authorization 
acts also remain unobligated. The Committee directs the 
government and transportation leaders in the region to 
immediately focus on the task of developing a feasible project 
plan that limits the Federal contribution for the project to 
the sums already provided so that these appropriated funds can 
be expended promptly. The Committee further directs the 
Administrator to work with the appropriate city and regional 
leadership toward this goal. The Administrator is requested to 
report back to the Committee regarding progress on this project 
not later than July 1, 2007.
    West Virginia Statewide Bus and Bus Facilities.--Consistent 
with the provisions of section 3044 of SAFETEA-LU, the bill 
includes a total of $5,000,000 for bus and bus facilities 
within the State of West Virginia for fiscal year 2007.
    Hybrid Bus Cost Share.--The Committee has not included a 
provision to allow FTA to provide grants for 100 percent of the 
net capital cost of a factory-installed or retrofitted hybrid 
electric system in a bus as proposed in the budget. The 
Committee has stressed the importance of hybrid technology 
buses in the past and remains committed to seeing hybrid 
technology proliferate throughout the Nation's transit systems. 
However, the Committee believes that waiving the required match 
would result in less hybrid buses being purchased by transit 
properties, not more. The Committee strongly believes that 
local share requirements are the best deal for taxpayers when 
it comes to stretching increasingly scarce Federal resources.
    The Committee directs FTA to distribute funds made 
available to carry out the Bus and Bus Facilities program in 
this fiscal year as directed by SAFETEA-LU. Of the remaining 
funds provided for that program in this fiscal year as well as 
the $24,893,251 remaining in fiscal year 2006, the committee 
directs the funds as follows:

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This appropriation provides financial assistance to support 
activities that are designed to develop solutions that improve 
public transportation. As the Federal agency responsible for 
transit, FTA assumes a leadership role in supporting research 
intended to identify different strategies to increase 
ridership, improve personal mobility, minimize automobile fuel 
consumption and air pollution, and enhance the quality of life 
in all communities.
    FTA may make grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, or 
other agreements for research, development, demonstration, and 
deployment projects, and evaluation of technology of national 
significance to public transportation. FTA provides transit 
agencies with research results to help make them better 
equipped to improve public transportation services and to help 
public transportation services meet national transportation 
needs at a minimum cost. FTA assists transit agencies to employ 
new service methods and technologies that improve their 
operations and capital efficiencies or improve transit safety 
and emergency preparedness.
    The purpose of the university transportation centers [UTC] 
program is to foster a national resource and focal point for 
the support and conduct of research and training concerning the 
transportation of passengers and property. Funds provided under 
the FTA's UTC program are transferred to and managed by the 
Research and Innovation Technology Administration and combined 
with a transfer of funds from the Federal Highway 
Administration. The transit university transportation research 
program funds are statutorily available to designated 
universities in SAFETEA-LU.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $61,000,000 to continue the 
university transportation research program. The Committee 
recommendation is $14,200,000 less than the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level.
    The Committee recommends funds for the following:
  --East Tennessee Hydrogen Initiative, Tennessee, $2,400,000;
  --Staten Island North/West Shore Rail Plan Study, New York, 
        $600,000; and
  --WVU Exhaust Emission Testing Initiative, West Virginia, 
        $1,000,000.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Section 5309 of 49 U.S.C. authorizes discretionary grants 
or loans to States and local public bodies and agencies thereof 
to be used in financing mass transportation investments. 
Investments may include construction of new fixed guideway 
systems and extensions to existing guideway systems; major bus 
fleet expansions and bus facility construction; and fixed 
guideway expenditures for existing systems. Under SAFETEA-LU, 
funding for major bus fleet expansion and bus facility 
construction and fixed guideway expenditures for existing 
systems has been incorporated under Formula and Bus Grants and 
is provided as contract authority supported by funds derived 
from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee action recommends a level of $1,466,000,000. 
The recommended level is $25,318,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level and the same as the budget request. A total of 
$14,660,000 is set aside for oversight activities.
    The Committee recommends the following allocations of new 
starts funds in fiscal year 2007:

    New Jersey Trans-Hudson Midtown Corridor Project.--The 
Committee has fully funded the project allocations articulated 
in section 3037 of SAFETEA-LU including the funding authorized 
for the New Jersey Trans-Hudson Midtown Corridor project. Over 
and above these amounts, the Committee has provided 
discretionary funding from the Capital Investment Grants 
program for this project. The combination of these two 
appropriations will yield a total of $8,400,000 for this 
project for fiscal year 2007.
    Seattle Light Rail Initial Segment and Extensions.--
Consistent with the existing full funding grant agreement, the 
bill includes $80,000,000 for the initial segment of the 
Seattle Link light rail system. The bill also includes 
$15,000,000 for the University Link extension that will shortly 
be entering the final design phase. It has always been the goal 
of regional transportation planners and the locally elected 
leadership that the initial segment of this light rail system 
should directly connect Seattle city center with SeaTac 
International Airport. However, due to rapid changes in 
security and infrastructure planning at the airport after the 
September 11 terrorist attacks, the Full Funding Grant 
Agreement [FFGA] for the initial segment could not include a 
direct connection into the airport. In order to rectify this 
situation and help provide for a seamless transit link directly 
to the airport, the bill includes a general provision (section 
145) intended to allow any Federal funds that may not be 
necessary due to budget ``under runs'' in the performance of 
the initial segment project to be used to assist in the 
construction of the airport link. This provision will, in 
effect, allow Sound Transit to benefit from its careful 
management of the initial segment project, allowing the agency 
to capture the Federal portion of any cost savings and use 
those savings to close a critically important gap in transit 
service in the region.
    Limited Extensions of Discretionary Funds.--There have been 
occasions when the Committee has extended the availability of 
capital investment funds. These extensions are granted on a 
case by case basis and, in nearly all instances, are due to 
circumstances that were unforeseen by the project's sponsor. 
The availability of these particular funds is intended for one 
additional year, absent further congressional direction. The 
Committee directs the FTA not to reallocate funds provided in 
fiscal year 2004 for the following new starts projects:
    Connecticut--Stamford, Connecticut, Urban Transitway and 
Intermodal Transportation Center Improvements.
    Delaware--Wilmington, Delaware, Train Station Improvements
    District of Columbia/Virginia--Dulles Corridor Rapid 
Transit Project
    Pennsylvania--Schuylkill Valley Metro; and
    Wisconsin--Kenosha-Racine-Milwaukee Rail Extension Project.
    The Committee directs FTA not to reallocate funds provided 
in fiscal year 2003 or previous acts for the following new 
starts projects:
    Connecticut--Bridgeport Connecticut, Intermodal 
Transportation Center Project
    District of Columbia/Virginia--Dulles Corridor Rapid 
Transit Project
    Delaware--Wilmington, Delaware, Train Station Improvements
    Delaware--Wilmington, Delaware, Downtown Transit Corridor 
Project; and
    Wisconsin--Kenosha-Racine-Milwaukee Rail Extension Project.
    Appropriations for Full Funding Grant Agreements.--The 
Committee reiterates direction initially agreed to in the 
fiscal year 2002 conference report that FTA should not sign any 
FFGAs that have a maximum Federal share of higher than 60 
percent.

       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION

    Section 160 exempts limitations previously made available 
on obligations for programs of the FTA under 49 U.S.C. 5338.

Administration, Capital investment grants not obligated by 
September 30, 2008 to be made available for other projects 
under 40 U.S.C. 5309.
    Section 162 allows funds appropriated before October 1, 
2005, that remain available for expenditure to be transferred.
    Section 163 allows unobligated funds for new projects under 
Federal Transit Authority to be used during this fiscal year to 
satisfy expenses incurred for such projects.
    Section 164 allows funds appropriated in prior years to the 
City of Albuquerque, New Mexico, to be available for bus and 
bus facilities.
    Section 165 amends the Central Link Initial Segment 
Project, as previously stated in the report.
    Section 166 extends the availability of funds provided for 
the Las Vegas Resort Corridor Fixed Guideway Project and makes 
those funds available to the Regional Transportation Commission 
of Southern Nevada for any bus or bus facilities project 
eligible under section 5307 or 5309 of title 49, United States 
Code.
    Section 167 modifies the eligibility of funds provided in 
fiscal year 2006 for the Miami Streetcar project.
    Section 168 allows funds for the Alaska Hawaii Ferry set-
aside grant program to be used for the Hawaii Port 
Infrastructure Expansion Program.
    Section 169 allows funds under Capital Investments Grants 
to be used for activities under 49 U.S.C. 5339.

             Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation


                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation [SLSDC] 
is a wholly owned Government corporation established by the 
Saint Lawrence Seaway Act of May 13, 1954 (33 U.S.C. 981). The 
SLSDC is a vital transportation corridor for the international 
movement of bulk commodities such as steel, iron, grain, and 
coal, serving the North American region that makes up one-
quarter of the United States population and nearly one-half of 
the Canadian population. The SLSDC is responsible for the 
operation, maintenance, and development of the United States 
portion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway between Montreal and Lake 
Erie.

                       OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

                    (HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND)

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $16,121,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................       8,000,000
House allowance.........................................      17,425,000
Committee recommendation................................      17,425,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund [HMTF] was established by 
the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-
662). Since 1987, the HMTF has supported the operations and 
maintenance of commercial harbor projects maintained by the 
Federal Government. Appropriations from the Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund and revenues from non-Federal sources finance the 
operation and maintenance of the Seaway for which the SLSDC is 
responsible.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommendation includes $17,425,000 to fund 
the operations and maintenance of the SLSDC. This amount is 
$9,425,000 above the President's request and is $1,304,000 
above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The Committee rejects 
the request to establish commercial tolls. The recommended 
level is sufficient to fund all base requirements, including 
concrete replacement at the two United States Seaway locks.

                        Maritime Administration


                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Maritime Administration [MARAD] is responsible for 
programs authorized by the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as 
amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1101 et seq.). MARAD is also 
responsible for programs that strengthen the U.S. maritime 
industry in support of the Nation's security and economic 
needs. MARAD prioritizes DOD's use of ports and intermodal 
facilities during DOD mobilizations to guarantee the smooth 
flow of military cargo through commercial ports. MARAD manages 
the Maritime Security Program, the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift 
Agreement Program and the Ready Reserve Force, which assure DOD 
access to commercial and strategic sealift and associated 
intermodal capacity. MARAD also continues to address the 
disposal of obsolete ships in the National Defense Reserve 
Fleet which are deemed a potential environmental risk. Further, 
MARAD administers education and training programs through the 
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and six State maritime schools 
that assist in providing skilled merchant marine officers who 
are capable of serving defense and commercial transportation 
needs. The Committee continues to fund MARAD in its support of 
the United States as a maritime Nation.

                       MARITIME SECURITY PROGRAM

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $154,440,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     154,440,000
House allowance.........................................     154,440,000
Committee recommendation................................     154,440,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Maritime Security Program provides resources to 
maintain a U.S. flag merchant fleet crewed by U.S. citizens to 
serve both the commercial and national security needs of the 
United States. The program provides direct payments to U.S. 
flag ship operators engaged in U.S. foreign trade. 
Participating operators are required to keep the vessels in 
active commercial service and are required to provide 
intermodal sealift support to the Department of Defense in 
times of war or national emergency.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $154,440,000 for the Maritime 
Security Program, consistent with the budget request.

                        OPERATIONS AND TRAINING

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $128,527,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     115,830,000
House allowance.........................................     116,442,000
Committee recommendation................................     115,830,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Operations and Training appropriation primarily funds 
the salaries and expenses for MARAD headquarters and regional 
staff in the administration and direction for all MARAD 
programs. The account includes funding for the U.S. Merchant 
Marine Academy, six State maritime schools, port and intermodal 
development, cargo preference, international trade relations, 
deep-water port licensing, and administrative support costs.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $115,830,000 for Operations and 
Training for fiscal year 2007. The recommendation is consistent 
with the President's budget request and $12,697,000 below the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The Committee has included 
$14,850,000 for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy to continue 
with the major design and construction projects as identified 
in the 10-year capital improvement plan.
    Funds appropriated for Operations and Training are 
sufficient to maintain the operating costs incurred by 
headquarters and regional staffs in administering and directing 
the Maritime Administration programs. The Committee 
recommendation includes the necessary resources to cover the 
costs of officer training at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy; 
provide Federal financial support to the six State maritime 
academies; support coordination efforts for U.S. maritime 
industry activities under emergency conditions; and to promote 
port and intermodal development activities.
    Funds provided for this account are to be distributed as 
follows: $61,747,000 for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, 
$9,900,000 for the State Maritime schools, and $44,185,000 for 
MARAD operations, for a total of $115,830,000.

                             SHIP DISPOSAL

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $20,790,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      25,740,000
House allowance.........................................      25,740,000
Committee recommendation................................      25,740,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Ship Disposal account provides resources to dispose of 
obsolete merchant-type vessels of 150,000 gross tons or more in 
the National Defense Reserve Fleet [NDRF] which the Maritime 
Administration is required by law to dispose of by the end of 
2006. Currently there is a backlog of more than 115 ships 
awaiting disposal. Many of these vessels are some 50 years old 
or more and pose a significant environmental threat due to the 
presence of hazardous substances such as asbestos and solid and 
liquid polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs].

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $25,740,000 
for ship disposal. This amount is the same as the budget 
request and $4,950,000 above the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level.
    The Committee is pleased that the Maritime Administration 
expects to have completed the removal of all high priority 
ships and many moderate priority ships from its fleet sites by 
the end of fiscal year 2006. The Committee directs the Maritime 
Administration to notify the House and Senate Committee on 
Appropriations of any changes to this projection and the 
reasons for such changes. The Committee is concerned about the 
unexpected rising costs associated with the decommissioning of 
the nuclear ship Savannah and the uncertainty of costs needed 
to fund this project in future years. The Committee expects the 
Maritime Administration to update these cost projections in its 
fiscal year 2008 budget submission.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, commonly referred to 
as, ``Title XI,'' provides for a Federal Government guarantee 
of private-sector debt for ship construction and shipyard 
modernization. This program fosters and sustains a U.S. 
shipbuilding and repair industry which helps ensure that the 
United States remains a maritime Nation.
    As required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 
(Public Law 101-508), this account includes the subsidy costs 
associated with the loan guarantee commitments made in 1992 and 
beyond (including modifications of direct loans or loan 
guarantees that resulted from obligations or commitments in any 
year), as well as the administrative expenses of this program. 
The subsidy amounts are estimated on a present value basis and 
administrative expenses are estimated on a cash basis.
    Funds for administrative expenses for the Title XI program 
are appropriated to this account, and then transferred by 
reimbursement to Operations and Training to be obligated and 
outlayed.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,317,000 for 
the Title XI, Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program. This amount is 
consistent with the administration's 2007 budget request.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Office of Pipeline Safety [OPS] is designed to promote 
the safe, reliable, and reliable sound transportation of 
natural gas and hazardous liquids by pipelines.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommendation provides $75,735,000, of which 
$18,810,000 will be derived from the Oil Spill Liability Trust 
Fund and of which $56,925,000 shall be derived from the 
Pipeline Safety Fund.
    The Committee remains concerned with the significant 
increase included in the budget estimate for funds from the 
oilspill liability trust fund. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 
requires that these trust funds be used exclusively for 
oilspill prevention and response activities, and the Committee 
strongly encourages the OPS to allocate oversight activities 
between the hazardous liquid and gas pipelines and to factor 
the oilspill liability trust fund into the allocation formula 
that determines the hazardous liquid pipeline user fee 
assessment to accurately reflect the amount and type of 
oversight activities being conducted by the office consistent 
with the trust fund.

budgetary savings. The OIG is also directed to withhold from 
public distribution for a period of 15 days any final audit or 
investigative report which was requested by the House or Senate 
Committees on Appropriations.
    The Committee has included a provision in title VII (sec. 
718) that requires all departments and agencies in this act to 
report quarterly to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations on all sole source contracts, including the 
contractor, the amount of the contract, the purpose of the 
contract and the rationale for a sole-source procurement as

$26,500,000, an increase of $3,575,000 above the budget 
request. Included in the recommendation is $1,250,000 in fees, 
which will offset the appropriated funding. At this funding 
level, the Board will be able to accommodate 150 full-time 
equivalent staff.
    The Committee's recommendation funds the following 
increases above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          Departmental Offices

                         salaries and expenses

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $194,626,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     223,874,000
House allowance.........................................     223,786,000
Committee recommendation................................     223,874,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Departmental Offices consists of the Office of the 
Secretary and Deputy Secretary, the Office of International 
Affairs, the Office of Domestic Finance, the Office of 
Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, the Office of Tax Policy, 
the Office of Economic Policy, the Office of the General 
Counsel, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Office of 
Public Affairs, Office of the Treasurer, and the Office of 
Management. The Secretary of the Treasury has the primary role 
in formulating and managing the domestic and international tax 
and financial policies of the Federal Government. The 
Secretary's responsibilities funded by the Salaries and 
Expenses appropriation include: recommending and implementing 
United States domestic and international economic and tax 
policy; fiscal policy; governing the fiscal operations of the 
Government; executing the Nation's financial sanction policies; 
disrupting and dismantling terrorist financial infrastructure; 
protecting the United States and international financial system 
from terrorist financing, money laundering, and other financial 
crimes; managing the public debt; managing international 
development policy; representing the United States on 
international monetary, trade and investment issues; overseeing 
Department of the Treasury overseas operations; and directing 
the administrative operations of the Department of the 
Treasury. The majority of the Salaries and Expenses 
appropriation provides resources for policy formulation and 
implementation in the areas of domestic and international 
finance, terrorist financing and financial crimes, tax, 
economic, trade, financial operations and general fiscal 
policy. This appropriation also provides resources to support 
to the Secretary and policy components, and coordination of 
departmental administrative policies in financial and personnel 
management, procurement operations, and information systems and 
telecommunications.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $223,874,000 for the Salaries and 
Expenses appropriation of the Departmental Offices account of 
the Department of the Treasury for fiscal year 2007. This 
amount is equal to the budget request and $29,248,000 above the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level. Within the funds provided under 
this account, the Committee has provided $3,000,000 for 
information technology modernization; $100,000 for official 
reception and representation expenses; $258,000 for unforeseen 
emergencies; and $5,114,000 for the Treasury-wide financial 
statement audits and other Treasury office and bureau audits. 
Bill language also is included establishing a staffing floor of 
139 FTEs and a funding level of $24,263,000 for the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control [OFAC].
    The Committee has established specific salaries and 
expenses spending limitations for each program activity within 
the Departmental Offices account. The Committee has included 
authority for the Department to request funding transfers 
between each of its program activities. The Department is 
required to submit any such transfer requests to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations and receive approval prior 
to the execution of any such transfer.
    The following table compares the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level to the fiscal year 2007 budget estimate and the 
Committee's recommendation for each office:

    Executive Direction.--The Committee has decided not to 
follow the budget request proposal to consolidate funding for 
the Office of General Counsel under the executive direction 
activity.
    The Committee remains concerned with the significant 
management challenges faced by the Department and believes that 
greater emphasis must be placed on effective management 
leadership. The Treasury Inspector General [IG] continues to 
cite concerns with the corporate management structure of the 
Treasury and believes that the lack of effective management 
leadership has contributed to serious deficiencies at some of 
the bureaus. In addition to concerns with corporate management, 
the IG continues to cite the Department's management of capital 
investments as a major management challenge. The IG 
specifically recommends that the Treasury needs to ensure 
consistency, cohesiveness, and economy among all bureaus by 
establishing clear lines of accountability, providing 
enterprise solutions for core business activities, and 
providing effective oversight of information technology 
investments and security. Given these concerns, the Committee 
directs the Department to provide an action plan, as part of 
its operating plan, on how it will address these issues. The 
action plan should specify the management officials who will be 
responsible for carrying out the plan.
    General Counsel.--As requested in the budget, the Committee 
has included an additional $542,000 to support three FTEs to 
support the growing workload of the Office of Terrorism and 
Financial Intelligence [TFI] and an additional $492,000 for 
three FTEs to provide legal support for OFAC.
    Economic Policies and Programs.--The Committee recommends 
an increase of $9,352,000 for the overseas attache program, as 
requested by the administration. The Committee strongly 
supports the expansion of this program.
    Financial Policies and Programs.--The Committee recommends 
$513,000 for the new Office of Dynamic Analysis as proposed by 
the budget request.
    The Committee urges the Department to create an external, 
independent panel of experts to guide the new Office of Dynamic 
Analysis. Members of the panel should be appointed by the 
Secretary and should embody diverse points of view on pertinent 
economic issues.
    Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.--The Committee has 
included an additional $5,861,000 as requested for TFI to 
support the hiring of additional intelligence analysts, 
training, travel, professional development, and additional 
secure workspace. Further, these additional funds will support 
OFAC's efforts in enforcing economic sanctions against 
terrorist networks. The Committee recognizes the diverse and 
broad operational responsibilities of OFAC and accordingly, the 
Committee has included bill language establishing a staffing 
floor of 139 full-time equivalent positions for this office. 
The Committee also strongly urges the Department and 
administration to budget additional resources to ensure OFAC 
has the capacity to carry out its responsibilities.
    Due to the significant dependence on information technology 
to carry out its activities and responsibilities, the Committee 
also has included an additional $300,000 for TFI to create a 
permanent position of Chief Technology and Information Officer 
[CTIO]. This position will be responsible for managing and 
overseeing all TFI information technology programs and needs, 
including projects under OFAC and FinCEN. The Committee directs 
that the CTIO will report directly to the Under Secretary for 
TFI. Until this position is filled, the Treasury's Chief 
Information Officer will continue to meet the IT needs of TFI.
    TFI has become an increasingly important player in the 
intelligence community and as a result, greater demands have 
been placed on the office. To ensure TFI has the necessary 
support to carryout its growing responsibilities and duties, 
the Committee has provided full funding for additional staffing 
resources, information technology systems, and other necessary 
resources. The Committee strongly urges the Department to 
provide the necessary support to TFI so it can meet its 
demands.
    Treasury-wide Management Policies and Programs.--The 
Committee has provided $20,072,000 for this activity, including 
$1,538,000 for performance management training. The Committee 
supports the additional funds to provide training to managers 
at the Department given the management challenges identified by 
the Treasury Inspector General. The budget justifications, 
however, do not provide adequate detail on the requested 
training funds. Accordingly, the Committee directs the 
Department to provide specific details on these training funds 
in the operating plan.
    Congressional Justifications.--The Committee finds the 
Department's congressional justifications to be lacking in some 
basic areas. For example, the justifications do not provide 
adequate explanation of legislative bill language changes and 
fail to identify the specific activity account for which new 
initiatives are proposed. Accordingly, the Committee directs 
that the Department to address these issues in its fiscal year 
2008 justifications.
    Information Security.--The Treasury Office of Inspector 
General [OIG] continues to cite the Department's information 
security as a management and performance challenge. 
Specifically, the Department faces serious challenges in 
bringing its systems into compliance with information 
technology security policies, procedures, standards, and 
guidelines. Moreover, the OIG cites the need to establish and 
maintain a system inventory as a core issue. This issue is 
particularly critical given the Internal Revenue Service's 
[IRS] recent loss of a laptop containing fingerprints of IRS 
employees. The Committee strongly urges the Department to 
address the OIG's findings and directs the Department to 
provide a status report to the Committee by March 1, 2007.

involve more than one Treasury bureau or Treasury's interface 
with other Government agencies.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $34,032,000 
for Department-wide systems and capital investment program 
[DSCIP]. This amount is equal to the budget request and 
$9,864,000 above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

    TFIN.--The Committee strongly supports the upgrade to the 
Treasury Foreign Intelligence Network [TFIN] and considers this 
project to be one of the Department's top priorities due to its 
growing role in supporting the intelligence community and 
combating terrorist financing. The Committee recognizes that 
the additional funds provided will complete the redesign, 
modernization, and the installation of full back up and 
recovery capability for TFIN. Given the critical importance of 
this system to TFI and the intelligence community, including 
the Director of National Intelligence [DNI], the Committee 
strongly urges TFI to coordinate closely and seek assistance 
from the DNI's Office of Chief Information Officer and other 
intelligence agencies.
    ECM.--The Committee also strongly supports the OFAC 
Enterprise Content Management [ECM] system. The Committee 
believes that ECM is a high priority for OFAC to improve its 
ability to carry out its operations in managing records and 
responding to its customers. While the Committee appreciates 
the recent attention this project has received from the 
Department and the administration, it believes that more 
resources should be devoted to this project. Unfortunately, it 
appears that this project and other information technology 
projects are being penalized in the administration's budget 
process due to the Department's inability to develop an 
enterprise architecture.
    Working Capital Fund.--The Treasury working capital fund 
[WCF] was established in 1970 to provide centrally common 
administrative services across the Department, achieve 
economies of scale, and eliminate duplication of effort and 
redundancies. However, the Treasury's WCF lacks adequate 
transparency as identified by the Treasury Inspector General. 
The Committee, therefore, directs the Department to include in 
its operating plan and its fiscal year 2008 congressional 
justifications the following information: the estimated budget 
of the WCF in total and by program; the projected WCF budgets 
in total and by program for the next 2 budget years; the 
estimated contributions to the WCF by bureau/office, by program 
and how these contributions are determined; and a description 
and amount of any long-term contracts, leases, or commitments 
(those exceeding 1 year) of the WCF. The Committee also directs 
the Department to include a new ``Working Capital Fund'' 
appropriations account in its fiscal year 2008 budget 
submission. Lastly, the Committee directs the Department to 
notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations of any 
new working capital fund program exceeding $5,000,000.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    As a result of the 1988 amendments to the Inspector General 
[IG] Act, the Secretary of the Treasury established the Office 
of Inspector General [OIG] in 1989.
    The OIG conducts and supervises audits, evaluations, and 
investigations designed to: (1) promote economy, efficiency, 
and effectiveness and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in 
departmental programs and operations; and (2) keep the 
Secretary and Congress fully and currently informed of problems 
and deficiencies in the administration of departmental programs 
and operations. The audit function provides program audit, 
contract audit and financial statement audit services. Contract 
audits provide professional advice to agency contracting 
officials on accounting and financial matters relative to 
negotiation, award, administration, repricing, and settlement 
of contracts. Program audits review and audit all facets of 
agency operations. Financial statement audits assess whether 
financial statements fairly present the agency's financial 
condition and results of operations, the adequacy of accounting 
controls, and compliance with laws and regulations. These 
audits contribute significantly to improved financial 
management by helping Treasury managers identify improvements 
needed in their accounting and internal control systems. The 
evaluations function reviews program performance and issues 
critical to the mission of the Department, including assessing 
the Department's implementation of the Government Performance 
and Results Act [GPRA]. The investigative function provides for 
the detection and investigation of improper and illegal 
activities involving programs, personnel, and operations.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $18,352,000 
for salaries and expenses of the Office of Inspector General. 
This amount is $1,000,000 above the budget request and 
$1,522,000 above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The 
Committee has provided additional funds above the budget 
request to support additional audit work on the Department's 
working capital fund and other management issues.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration 
[TIGTA] was established by the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act 
of 1998 (Public Law 105-206). Funding was first appropriated 
for this account in the fiscal year 2000 Treasury and General 
Government Appropriations Act (Public Law 106-58).
    TIGTA conducts audits, investigations, and evaluations to 
assess the operations and programs of the Internal Revenue 
Service [IRS] and related entities, the IRS Oversight Board and 
the Office of Chief Counsel to (1) promote the economic, 
efficient and effective administration of the Nation's tax laws 
and to detect and deter fraud and abuse in IRS programs and 
operations; and (2) recommend actions to resolve fraud and 
other serious problems, abuses, and deficiencies in these 
programs and operations, and keep the Secretary and Congress 
fully and currently informed of these issues and the progress 
made in resolving them. TIGTA reviews existing and proposed 
legislation and regulations relating to the programs and 
operations of the IRS and related entities and makes 
recommendations concerning the impact of such legislation and 
regulations on the economy and efficiency in the administration 
of programs and operations of the IRS and related entities. The 
audit function provides program audit, limited contract audit 
and financial audit services. Program audits review and audit 
all facets of IRS and related entities in an effort to improve 
IRS systems and operations, while ensuring fair and equitable 
treatment of taxpayers. Contract audits focus on invoices/
vouchers submitted to the IRS to determine whether charges are 
valid. The investigative function provides for the detection 
and investigation of improper and illegal activities involving 
IRS programs and operations and protects the IRS and related 
entities against external attempts to corrupt or threaten their 
employees.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $136,469,000 
for the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. This 
amount is an increase of $4,516,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level and the same as the budget request.
    The Committee commends TIGTA for the audit work in 
reviewing the IRS's response to Hurricane Katrina in the gulf 
coast area. The Committee also commends TIGTA for reviewing the 
IRS's business systems modernization program and other 
information technology projects.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee does not provide any appropriation funding, 
as requested, for the Air Transportation Stabilization Program 
for fiscal year 2007. Bill language, as requested, is included 
that allows the ATSB to charge fees to a borrower. The Board 
expects to negotiate repayment or remarketing of its remaining 
loans by the end of fiscal year 2006 and will terminate its 
activities in 2007.

Committee recommendation................................      77,321,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [FinCEN], a bureau 
within the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and 
Financial Intelligence, is the largest overt collector of 
financial intelligence in the United States. FinCEN's mission 
is to safeguard the financial system from the abuses of 
financial crime, including terrorist financing, money 
laundering and other illicit finance. FinCEN accomplishes its 
mission by administering the Bank Secrecy Act, a collection of 
statutes that form the Nation's anti-money laundering/counter-
terrorist financing regulatory regime. As the delegated 
administrator of the Bank Secrecy Act, FinCEN is responsible 
for the development and implementation of regulations, rules 
and guidance issued under the Bank Secrecy Act. FinCEN also 
oversees the work of eight Federal agencies that have been 
delegated responsibility to examine various sectors of the 
financial industry for compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act's 
requirements. FinCEN is responsible for collecting, 
maintaining, and disseminating the information reported by 
financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act through a 
Government-wide access service. In coordination with Treasury's 
Office of Intelligence and Analysis, FinCEN analyzes this 
financial information and other information and intelligence to 
develop both strategic and tactical analytical products that 
support law enforcement, intelligence and regulatory agencies. 
FinCEN is the United States' Financial Intelligence Unit [FIU] 
and a founding member of the Egmont Group of Financial 
Intelligence Units. As the United States FIU, FinCEN routinely 
shares information and cooperates with other FIUs around the 
world to address the global problems of terrorist financing, 
money laundering, and other illicit finance.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $77,321,000 for the Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network [FinCEN]. This amount is $4,427,000 
above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and $12,473,000 below 
the budget request.
    The Committee does not recommend $12,473,000 in additional 
funds for the ``BSA Direct'' system due to the major failures 
of the system as identified by the Government Accountability 
Office [GAO] and the FinCEN Director. The Committee strongly 
believes that based on the GAO's assessment, FinCEN will not be 
in position in fiscal year 2007 to ensure it can spend 
effectively and efficiently the additional funds requested for 
BSA Direct. Further, the Committee understands that the IRS has 
developed a new system that meets the needs of FinCEN and its 
BSA users.
    In the GAO's July 14, 2006 report on FinCEN's management of 
BSA Direct (GAO-06-947R), the GAO found that FinCEN did not 
always apply effective investment management processes to 
oversee the BSA Direct Retrieval and Sharing project. As a 
result, the GAO recommended that the Director of FinCEN direct 
the Chief Information Officer [CIO] to develop a plan with 
specific actions for improving the agency's capabilities for 
overseeing the BSA Direct project. Further, the GAO noted that 
the problems with BSA Direct indicate systemic problems with 
FinCEN's management and oversight of IT projects. Accordingly, 
the Committee directs FinCEN to develop a plan that addresses 
the GAO's concerns in its July 14, 2006 report and to ensure 
FinCEN has an executive level review process for IT projects. 
The Committee directs the Director of FinCEN to submit a report 
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on these 
matters by no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of 
this act.
    The Committee understands that FinCEN will require funds to 
terminate the existing contract for BSA Direct, including costs 
for the audit agency that will negotiate the termination costs. 
Further, the Director of FinCEN will determine additional 
financial requirements to achieve the BSA Direct Retrieval and 
Sharing Component's long-term vision. The Committee supports 
these efforts and looks forward in working with the Director in 
meeting FinCEN's future needs.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    In 1940, the United States Department of the Treasury 
established the Fiscal Service, which consisted of the Bureau 
of Accounts, the Bureau of the Public Debt, and the Office of 
the Treasurer. A 1974 reorganization of the Fiscal Service 
created the Bureau of Government Financial Operations, which 
was formed from a merger of the Bureau of Accounts and most 
functions of the Office of the Treasurer. In 1984, the Bureau 
of Government Financial Operations was renamed the Financial 
Management Service [FMS].
    FMS implements payment policy and procedures for the 
Federal program agencies, issues and distributes payments, 
promotes the use of electronics in the payment process, and 
assists agencies in converting payments from paper checks to 
electronic funds transfer [EFT]. FMS also provides debt 
collection operational services to client agencies and 
implements collections policy, regulations, standards and 
procedures for the Federal Government and assists agencies in 
converting collections from paper to electronic media.
    FMS also provides financial accounting, reporting, and 
financing services to the Federal Government and the 
Government's agents who participate in the payments and 
collections process by generating a series of daily, monthly, 
quarterly and annual Government-wide reports. FMS also works 
directly with agencies to help reconcile reporting differences.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $233,654,000 for salaries and 
expenses for FMS. This amount is the same as the budget request 
and $227,000 below the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

                Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $90,215,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      63,964,000
House allowance.........................................      92,604,000
Committee recommendation................................      92,604,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Homeland Security Act created the Alcohol and Tobacco 
Tax and Trade Bureau [TTB] within the Department of the 
Treasury and charged TTB with collecting revenue and protecting 
the public.
    TTB enforces the Federal laws and regulations relating to 
alcohol and tobacco. Its responsibilities include maintaining a 
sound revenue management and regulatory system that continues 
to reduce the taxpayer burden, improve service, collect the 
revenue due, prevent tax evasion and other criminal conduct, 
and protecting the public and preventing consumer deception in 
regulated commodities.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $92,604,000 for TTB for fiscal 
year 2007. This amount is an increase of $28,640,000 over the 
budget request and an increase of $2,389,000 over the fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level. The increase over the budget request 
is due to the assumption of $28,640,000 in revenues from new 
user fees. The new user fee legislative proposal, however, has 
not been authorized and is not supported by the Committee.

                    Bureau of Engraving and Printing


                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Bureau of Engraving and Printing [BEP] has been the 
sole manufacturer of U.S. paper currency for almost 150 years. 
The origin of the BEP is traced to an Act of Congress passed on 
February 25, 1862, 12 Stat. 345, authorizing the Secretary of 
the Treasury to issue a new currency--United States notes. 
While this law was the cornerstone authority for the operations 
of the engraving and printing division of the Treasury for many 
years, it was not until an Act of June 20, 1874, 18 Stat. 100, 
that the Congress first referred to this division as the 
``Bureau of Engraving and Printing.'' The Bureau's status as a 
distinct bureau within the Department of the Treasury was 
solidified by section 1 of the Act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 
18, which placed all of the business of the BEP under the 
immediate control of a director, subject to the direction of 
the Secretary of the Treasury. The 1897 law is now codified in 
31 U.S.C. 303.
    The BEP designs, manufactures, and supplies Federal Reserve 
notes, and other security documents issued by the Federal 
Government. The BEP executes certain printings for various 
territories administered by the United States, particularly 
postage and revenue stamps.
    The operations of the BEP are currently financed by means 
of a revolving fund established in accordance with the 
provisions of Public Law 656, August 4, 1950 (31 U.S.C. 181), 
which requires the BEP to be reimbursed by customer agencies 
for all costs of manufacturing products and services performed. 
The BEP is also authorized to assess amounts to acquire capital 
equipment and provide for working capital needs.
    No direct appropriation is required to cover the activities 
of the BEP.

                       Bureau of the Public Debt


                     ADMINISTERING THE PUBLIC DEBT

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $175,154,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     177,789,000
House allowance.........................................     177,789,000
Committee recommendation................................     177,789,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Public Debt Service was formed in 1919 with the 
appointment of the first Commissioner of the Public Debt. The 
Public Debt Service took general charge debt operations 
including debt accounting and securities issue and retirement, 
which had been conducted by several independent divisions 
within the Treasury. Acting under the authorization of the 
Reorganization Act of 1939, the President created the Bureau of 
the Public Debt, which was established as part of the Fiscal 
Service in the Department of the Treasury effective June 30, 
1940, (31 U.S.C. 306). In 1993, the Savings Bonds Division, a 
separate organization, was made part of the Bureau.
    This appropriation provides funds for the conduct of all 
public debt operations and the promotion of the sale of U.S. 
savings-type securities.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends the budget request level of 
$177,789,000 for the Bureau of the Public Debt for fiscal year 
2007. This amount is an increase of $2,635,000 above the fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level.

           Community Development Financial Institutions Fund


   COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $54,450,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................       7,821,000
House allowance.........................................      40,000,000
Committee recommendation................................      55,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund makes 
investments in the form of grants, loans, equity investments, 
deposits, and technical assistance grants to new and existing 
community development financial institutions [CDFIs], through 
the CDFI program. CDFIs include community development banks, 
credit unions, venture capital funds, revolving loan funds, and 
microloan funds, among others. Recipient institutions engage in 
lending and investment for affordable housing, small business 
and community development within underserved communities. The 
CDFI Fund administers the Bank Enterprise Award [BEA] Program, 
which provides a financial incentive to insured depository 
institutions to undertake community development finance 
activities. The CDFI Fund also administers the New Markets Tax 
Credit Program, a program that provides an incentive to 
investors in the form of a tax credit, which is expected to 
stimulate private community and economic development 
activities.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $55,000,000 for the CDFI Fund, 
which is $550,000 above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and 
$47,179,000 above the budget request. The Committee recommends 
that the entire program, not just the New Markets Tax Credit 
program, remain at the Department of the Treasury as opposed to 
the administration's proposal of moving the program to the 
Department of Commerce under the Strengthening America's 
Communities Initiative.
    The Committee is again concerned about the proposed 
reductions to CDFI and the respective programs within CDFI, 
such as the Bank Enterprise Award [BEA]. These programs play an 
important role in providing financial services to underserved 
communities in both urban and rural communities across the 
country. The Committee expects the BEA program to be funded at 
no less than $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2007.
    The Committee also recommends a set-aside of $3,000,000 for 
grants, loans, and technical assistance and training programs 
to benefit Native America, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiian 
communities in the coordination of development strategies, 
increased access to equity investments, and loans for 
development activities.

                           United States Mint


               UNITED STATES MINT PUBLIC ENTERPRISE FUND

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The United States Mint manufactures coins, sells numismatic 
and investment products, and provides for security and asset 
protection. Public Law 104-52 established the U.S. Mint Public 
Enterprise Fund (the Fund). The Fund encompasses the previous 
Salaries and Expenses, Coinage Profit Fund, Coinage Metal Fund, 
and the Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund. The Mint submits 
annual audited business-type financial statements to the 
Secretary of the Treasury and to Congress in support of the 
operations of the revolving fund.
    The operations of the Mint are divided into two major 
activities: Manufacturing and Sales (including circulating 
coinage and numismatic and investment products); and 
Protection. The Mint is credited with receipts from its 
circulating coinage operations, equal to the full cost of 
producing and distributing coins that are put into circulation, 
including depreciation of the Mint's plant and equipment on the 
basis of current replacement value. Those receipts pay for the 
costs of the Mint's operations, which include the costs of 
production and distribution. The difference between the face 
value of the coins and these costs are profits, which is 
deposited as seigniorage to the general fund. In fiscal year 
2005, the Mint transferred $775,000,000 to the general fund. 
Any seigniorage used to finance the Mint's capital acquisitions 
is recorded as budget authority in the year that funds are 
obligated for this purpose and as receipts over the life of the 
asset.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a spending level of $30,200,000 
for circulating coinage and protective service capital 
investments for the Mint. This amount is an increase of 
$3,432,000 above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and is 
equal to the budget request.

                        Internal Revenue Service


                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Internal Revenue Service [IRS] history dates back to 
1862. In 1953, following a reorganization of its function, its 
name became the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS administers 
the Nation's tax laws and collects the revenue that funds most 
of the Federal Government's operations and public services. The 
IRS's mission is to provide taxpayers with quality service by 
helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and 
by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all. The 
IRS focuses its enforcement programs toward increasing 
voluntary tax compliance by deterring taxpayers inclined to 
evade their tax obligations while vigorously pursuing those who 
violate the law. It deals directly with more Americans than any 
other institution, public or private. In 2005, the IRS 
collected over $2,000,000,000,000 in revenue and processed more 
than 208 million tax returns. During the 2005 filing season, 
more than half of all individual taxpayers (nearly 68 million) 
filed electronically. Also, in 2005, the IRS provided 
assistance more than 95 million times through toll-free 
telephone lines, correspondence or visits to its more than 400 
offices nationwide. An important focus for the IRS in recent 
years has been to undertake a major modernization of its 
systems, including expanding its Internet services, and 
business operations to serve better taxpayers and enforce the 
law.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $10,655,972,000 for the Internal 
Revenue Service for fiscal year 2007. This is an increase of 
$82,266,000 above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and 
$64,135,000 above the budget request.
    New Appropriations Account Structure.--The Committee has 
created a new appropriations account structure for fiscal year 
2007. Under this structure, the IRS's activities are more 
properly aligned to budget activities by creating new 
``Taxpayer Services'', ``Enforcement'', and ``Operations 
Support'' accounts in place of the old ``Processing, 
Assistance, and Management'', ``Tax Law Enforcement'', and 
``Information Systems'' accounts. The ``Business Systems 
Modernization'' and ``Health Insurance Tax Credit 
Administration'' accounts are maintained. Further, the 
Committee has broken out the ``IRS Oversight Board'' as a new 
separate account.
    The Committee developed the new account structure in 
consultation with the Department of the Treasury, the IRS, and 
the House Committee on Appropriations. The Committee has 
provided the IRS with some administrative flexibility in 
transitioning to the new account structure by allowing the IRS 
to transfer funds among the taxpayer services, enforcement, and 
operations support accounts. This new administrative 
flexibility provided as an administrative provision.
    Tax Gap.--The IRS updated its results of a 3-year study on 
the difference between what taxpayers are supposed to pay and 
what they actually do pay, the so-called ``tax gap.'' The IRS 
found that for tax year 2001, about 84 percent of owed taxes 
were paid voluntarily and timely. However, a significant number 
of taxpayers do not comply with the Tax Code resulting in an 
estimated gross tax gap of $345,000,000,000. The IRS estimates 
that after enforcement and other late payments are factored 
into the gross tax gap, the net tax gap is about 
$290,000,000,000. The most current estimate of the tax gap 
remains largely unchanged from the IRS's initial update 
conducted last year and has remained relatively stable for the 
past three decades based on previous IRS studies. The accuracy 
of the tax gap, however, is uncertain given the use of outdated 
information and questionable methodology. Some experts, 
including the GAO and TIGTA, believe that the tax gap may 
actually be higher than estimated by the IRS. The Committee 
strongly believes that the IRS must and can reduce the tax gap 
if the IRS is given additional resources and is able to improve 
its operational capabilities (most notably through the Business 
Systems Modernization program).
    To reduce the tax gap, the IRS's budget request has set a 
goal of increasing the voluntary compliance rate from a current 
estimate of about 83.7 percent to 85 percent by 2009. However, 
the budget request does not include a strategic plan to achieve 
this goal. To reduce the tax gap, experts recommend a number of 
approaches, such as: improving information reporting, improving 
taxpayer services, increasing research on noncompliance, 
improving the partnership between the IRS and the tax 
administration community, and leveraging technology to improve 
IRS's systems. The Committee supports all of these approaches 
and believes that the administration must develop a detailed 
business plan on how it will reduce the tax gap. Accordingly, 
the Committee has included an administrative provision that 
requires the IRS to develop a detailed, strategic plan that 
demonstrates how it will achieve and how it will measure the 
voluntary compliance goal of 85 percent by 2009.
    Operating Plan and Notification.--In addition to the normal 
operating plan requirements detailed in the introduction in 
this report, the Committee directs the IRS to include details 
on any planned reorganization, job reductions or increases to 
offices or activities within the agency, and modifications to 
any service or enforcement activity. Some past examples that 
would qualify under this directive include: the Modernization 
and Information Technology Systems [MITS] reorganization and 
the proposed closure of taxpayer assistance centers. The 
Committee also directs the IRS to obtain the approval of the 
IRS Oversight Board prior to submitting its operating plan to 
the Committee. Further, the IRS should promptly notify the 
Committee and the IRS Oversight Board if there are any 
substantial changes of these plans.
    The Committee continues to remain concerned about any 
efforts to reduce significantly taxpayer services. Therefore, 
the Committee directs that should the IRS propose further 
reductions in taxpayer service, such reductions must be 
consistent with the budget justification, operating plan, and 
Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint.
    Privacy Regulations.--The Committee notes that the 
authorizing committee has approved legislation (S. 832) that 
addresses the troubling aspects of the use and disclosure of 
taxpayer information by return preparers for non-tax purposes 
and offshore disclosures. The Committee directs the IRS to be 
strictly attentive to this legislation in promulgating the 
final regulation relating to section 7216 of the Internal 
Revenue Code.
    IRS Staffing Plans.--The Committee continues to support 
adequate staffing levels for effective tax administration and 
supports the staffing plans for the Internal Revenue Service 
facilities in the communities of Martinsburg and Beckley, West 
Virginia. Therefore, the Committee urges the IRS, within the 
constraints of the fiscal year 2007 funding levels, to make no 
staffing reductions at the Martinsburg National Computing 
Center and the programmed level at the Finance Center in 
Beckley, West Virginia. Further, the Committee directs the IRS 
to provide an annual report to the Committee on its efforts to 
protect and increase staffing levels at the Martinsburg and 
Beckley IRS facilities.
    Taxpayer Services in Alaska and Hawaii.--Given the remote 
distance of Alaska and Hawaii from the U.S. mainland and the 
difficulty experienced by Alaska and Hawaii taxpayers in 
receiving needed tax assistance by the national toll-free line, 
it is imperative that the Taxpayer Advocate Service Center in 
each of these States is fully staffed and capable of resolving 
taxpayer problems of the most complex nature. The Committee 
directs the Internal Revenue Service to continue to staff each 
Taxpayer Advocate Service Center in each of these States with a 
Collection Technical Advisor and an Examination Technical 
Advisor in addition to the current complement of office staff.

                           TAXPAYER SERVICES

Appropriations, 2006....................................  $2,142,275,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................   2,079,151,000
House allowance.........................................   2,059,151,000
Committee recommendation................................   2,110,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Taxpayer Services appropriation provides for taxpayer 
services, including forms and publications; processing tax 
returns and related documents; filing and account services; 
taxpayer advocacy services; and assisting taxpayers to 
understand their tax obligations, correctly file their returns, 
and pay taxes due in a timely manner.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $2,110,000,000 for Taxpayer 
Services, which is $32,275,000 below the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level and $30,849,000 above the budget request. Bill 
language is included providing not less than $4,500,000 for the 
tax counseling for the elderly program and not less than 
$9,000,000 for low-income taxpayer clinic grants.
    Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint.--In response to the 
Committee's directive in the fiscal year 2006 Treasury 
Appropriations Act, the IRS, in consultation with the IRS 
Oversight Board and the National Taxpayer Advocate, began 
developing a ``Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint'' to develop a 5-
year strategic plan on taxpayer services. As directed by the 
Committee, the IRS is reviewing its current portfolio of 
taxpayer services and exploring other types of services to meet 
the needs of taxpayers. Further, this plan will detail how it 
plans to meet the service needs on a geographic basis (by State 
and major metropolitan area), including any proposals to 
realign existing resources to improve taxpayer access to 
services, and address how the plan will improve taxpayer 
service based on reliable data on taxpayer service needs. The 
plan will also address efforts to expand efforts to partner 
with State and local governments and private entities to 
improve taxpayer services. The Committee commends the IRS, the 
IRS Oversight Board, and the National Taxpayer Advocate for 
their time and efforts on the Blueprint. Further, the Committee 
appreciates the efforts to conduct research on taxpayer needs 
and taxpayer service performance.
    The Committee understands that the Blueprint may not be 
completed in time to be used as part of the development of the 
fiscal year 2008 budget request. However, the Committee 
strongly believes that the Blueprint should be incorporated in 
subsequent budget requests.
    E-Filing.--The Committee is disappointed with the IRS's 
performance in increasing the number of tax filers who submit 
their returns electronically and without additional cost. Most 
experts, including the IRS Oversight Board, believe that the 
IRS will not meet its congressionally mandated goal of having 
80 percent of tax returns filed electronically by 2007. 
Accordingly, the Committee directs the IRS, in consultation 
with stakeholders, such as the National Taxpayer Advocate, to 
develop a detailed strategic plan to meet the 80 percent e-File 
goal. This plan should be submitted to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations by no later than June 4, 2007.
    Research.--The Committee believes that the IRS will provide 
better taxpayer service, resulting in improved compliance, if 
taxpayer behavior is better understood and applied research is 
integrated into the development of taxpayer service and 
enforcement initiatives. Toward that end, the Committee directs 
the National Taxpayer Advocate, in consultation with IRS Office 
of Research, to report to the Appropriations Committees of the 
House and Senate by September 30, 2007, on activities that tax 
administrators in other nations undertake to understand 
taxpayer behavior. The report shall also make recommendations 
for the establishment of a cognitive learning and applied 
research laboratory. In addition, the report should identify 
innovative methods of understanding taxpayer behavior, 
including the use of agent-based computer simulations, and 
recommend whether the establishment of a cognitive learning 
laboratory would improve tax administration.

                              ENFORCEMENT

Appropriations, 2006....................................  $4,701,970,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................   4,797,126,000
House allowance.........................................   4,757,126,000
Committee recommendation................................   4,797,126,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Enforcement appropriation provides for the examination 
of tax returns, both domestic and international; the 
administrative and judicial settlement of taxpayer appeals of 
examination findings; technical rulings; monitoring employee 
pension plans; determining qualifications of organizations 
seeking tax-exempt status; examining tax returns of exempt 
organizations; enforcing statutes relating to detection and 
investigation of criminal violations of the internal revenue 
laws; identifying under reporting of tax obligations; securing 
unfiled tax returns; and collecting unpaid accounts.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends the budget request level of 
$4,797,126,000 for enforcement activities for fiscal year 2007. 
This amount is $95,156,000 above the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level. Bill language is included to transfer not less than 
$55,584,000 to the Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement 
[ICDE] program and to transfer up to $10,000,000 from 
enforcement to the Operations Support account to support the 
ICDE program.
    National Research Program.--The Committee strongly supports 
the work of the National Research Program [NRP] to increase 
understanding on the tax gap. While the IRS's NRP has done a 
commendable job in updating the tax gap estimates, there remain 
significant gaps in the gap. The IRS and others have expressed 
concerns with the certainty of the overall tax gap estimate in 
part because some areas of the estimate rely on old data (from 
the 1970s and 1980s) and it has no estimates for other areas of 
the tax gap. GAO, TIGTA, the National Taxpayer Advocate, and 
the IRS Oversight Board also have all recommended greater and 
more frequent data collection and studies of the tax gap. The 
Committee agrees with this recommendation. Accordingly, the 
Committee directs the IRS to submit a detailed research plan 
that will address the shortfalls in the NRP. The plan should 
include the use of a rolling sample, which was recommended by 
the IRS Oversight Board and GAO that covers all types of tax 
returns. Under this approach, one-fifth of the sample could be 
collected every year. The plan should include cost estimates of 
implementing the plan. The plan should be developed in 
consultation with the National Taxpayer Advocate and approved 
by the IRS Oversight Board prior to its submission to the House 
and Senate Committees on Appropriations by no later than March 
12, 2007. Finally, to cover the costs of implementing the plan, 
the Committee encourages the IRS to request the use of 
unobligated funds as part of the reprogramming authority 
provided under this act.
    The Committee believes that an understanding of the causes 
of inadvertent noncompliance and the role of preparers in 
facilitating both inadvertent and intentional noncompliance 
will improve tax administration and should inform IRS's 
allocation of resources. Thus, in administering its NRP for 
fiscal year 2007, the Committee directs the IRS to collect 
information on the causes of inadvertent noncompliance, the 
type of return preparation method (self, volunteer, or paid 
preparer), and whether the taxpayer was represented during the 
examination. The Committee directs the National Taxpayer 
Advocate to assist with this effort.
    Misclassification of Contractors.--The Committee is 
concerned with the misclassification of workers as independent 
contractors, who are filed under IRS form 1099. Many of these 
workers should be correctly classified as employees and filed 
under W-2 forms. This misclassification leads to the 
underreporting of self-employment taxes, which the IRS 
estimates accounts for $148,000,000,000 per year and 43 percent 
of the gross tax gap. Therefore, the Committee strongly urges 
the IRS to provide increased tax enforcement in industries 
where misclassification of employees is widespread.

planning, communications and liaison, finance, human resources, 
EEO and diversity; research and statistics of income; and 
necessary expenses for information systems and 
telecommunication support, including developmental information 
systems and operational information systems.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $3,487,000,000 for Operations 
Support for fiscal year 2007. This amount is $19,557,000 above 
the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and $1,404,000 below the 
budget request. Bill language is included allowing $75,000,000 
of these funds to remain available until September 30, 2009; up 
to $1,000,000 for research activities; and $50,000 for official 
reception and representation. The Committee has provided 
additional reception and representation funds due to the IRS's 
growing role in international tax administration. These funds 
will be used to host meetings with international tax 
organizations such as the Joint International Tax Shelter 
Information Centre, Inter-American Center for Tax 
Administrators, and others.
    IT Management and Oversight.--The IRS has made significant 
strides in improving the management and oversight of its 
business systems modernization [BSM] program. Unfortunately, 
the IRS has not adequately addressed major systemic problems 
with its non-BSM portfolio of information technology projects 
as demonstrated by recent failures during the past filing 
season. TIGTA has identified problems in several areas of IT 
management and oversight including, but not limited to, such 
areas as: classification of investment projects, oversight and 
governance structure, risk management, contingency planning, 
and contractor performance and accountability. Further, it 
appears that the Department of the Treasury and the Office of 
Management and Budget have not exercised proper oversight for 
the business cases (OMB Circular A-11 Exhibit 300) used to 
justify the funding of the IRS's IT projects.
    To the IRS's credit, it has begun addressing some of its IT 
problems through a reorganization of the Modernization and 
Information Technology Services [MITS] organization that began 
earlier this year. Nevertheless, the Committee remains troubled 
by the IT management and oversight problems at the IRS, as 
demonstrated by the failures with the Electronic Fraud 
Detection System, and it expects better performance to ensure 
it can support its tax administration activities. Accordingly, 
the Committee directs the IRS to review its entire non-BSM IT 
portfolio (regardless of tier classification) and make any 
changes as necessary to ensure that each project has (1) been 
properly classified for investment decision and management 
purposes, (2) the appropriate governance structure in place 
(such as an executive steering committee), (3) a risk 
management plan, (4) a contingency plan in case of breakdowns 
or failures in scheduled deliverables, (5) adequate provisions 
in the contracts to ensure penalties and repayment to the 
agency if performance is not met, (6) adequate contractor 
staffing and management in place to fulfill the contract terms 
and deliverables, and (7) been certified by the head of the 
relevant IRS business unit that the project is deemed necessary 
for its operations and meets its requirements. The Committee 
also directs the Chief Information Officer to certify that this 
review has been completed and submits such certification to the 
IRS Oversight Board, the Department of the Treasury, the Office 
of Management and Budget, the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, the House Ways and Means Committee, and the 
Senate Finance Committee by no later than 90 days after the 
date of enactment of this act. This certification should be 
accompanied by a report on every individual IT project 
reviewed, a list of projects considered to be high risk, and 
any actions being taken to address problems identified by this 
review. Last, the Committee directs the IRS to provide monthly 
briefings to the IRS Oversight Board and TIGTA on the status of 
its IT portfolio and to report immediately on any project that 
has experienced significant cost variances or milestone 
delivery date slippages.
    Modernization Vision and Strategy.--The Committee highly 
commends the IRS for developing a new vision and strategy plan 
for IT modernization. This plan was a joint effort between the 
MITS organization and the IRS business units to develop a 
comprehensive business strategy for the IRS's IT needs. The 
Committee recommends that the plan be further refined to 
include a finer level of detail, and specifically, to include 
milestones and out-year cost estimates.
    BSA Direct.--The Committee appreciates the IRS's assistance 
provided to FinCEN in preventing any disruption in information 
technology service in administering BSA filing data activities 
by allowing FinCEN to use the IRS's WebCBRS system. The 
Committee directs the IRS to continue providing such assistance 
and to coordinate with FinCEN on future BSA filing data needs.

                     BUSINESS SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $242,010,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     212,310,000
House allowance.........................................     197,060,000
Committee recommendation................................     245,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides for revamping business practices and 
acquiring new technology. The agency is using a formal 
methodology to prioritize, approve, fund, and evaluate its 
portfolio of business systems modernization investments. This 
methodology is designed to enforce a documented, repeatable, 
and measurable process for managing investments throughout 
their life cycle. The process is reviewed by the Government 
Accountability Office on a regular basis as part of the 
submission requirements for expenditure plans to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations. The expenditure plan 
approval process prior to the use of appropriated funds 
continues for fiscal year 2007.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $245,000,000 for Business Systems 
Modernization [BSM] for fiscal year 2007. This amount is 
$32,690,000 above the budget request and $2,990,000 above the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level. Bill language is included 
requiring an expenditure plan for these funds. Under the new 
appropriations account structure, the BSM account has been 
modified to include funding for IRS staffing associated with 
direct management of the BSM program.
    The Committee continues to believe that BSM is the IRS's 
highest management and administrative priority that will 
require management's focus and attention for several years. To 
the IRS's credit, the program has made steady progress over the 
past 2 years. Unfortunately, the budget request cuts BSM by 
$29,700,000 or 15.2 percent from the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level. The Committee is troubled by the proposed cut since it 
will slow the momentum of the BSM's progress in modernizing 
IRS's antiquated tax administration and financial systems. GAO 
noted that the proposed funding level would likely affect the 
IRS's ability to deliver the functionality planned for the 
fiscal year and could result in project delays and/or scope 
reductions. Further, this could in turn impact the long-term 
pace and cost of modernizing IRS tax systems and of ultimately 
improving taxpayer service and strengthening enforcement.
    Based on the views of the GAO and the IRS Oversight Board, 
the Committee has included an additional $32,690,000 for the 
BSM program. The Committee directs that these additional funds 
be used for the modernized e-File program based on the 
recommendation of the IRS Oversight Board.

               HEALTH INSURANCE TAX CREDIT ADMINISTRATION

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $20,008,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      14,846,000
House allowance.........................................      14,846,000
Committee recommendation................................      14,846,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This appropriation provides operating funds to administer 
the advance payment feature of a new Trade Adjustment 
Assistance health insurance tax credit program to assist 
dislocated workers with their health insurance premiums. The 
tax credit program was enacted by the Trade Act of 2002 (Public 
Law 107-210) and became effective in August 2003.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommendation provides the budget request 
level of $14,846,000 for the Health Insurance Tax Credit 
Administration in fiscal year 2007. This amount is $5,162,000 
below the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

                          IRS OVERSIGHT BOARD

Appropriations, 2006....................................      $1,500,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................       1,500,000
House allowance.........................................       1,500,000
Committee recommendation................................       2,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The IRS Oversight Board was established by the Congress 
under the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 [RRA]. Its 
legislatively-mandated mission is to oversee the IRS in its 
administration, management, conduct, direction, and supervision 
of the execution and application of the internal revenue laws. 
The Board is composed of nine members, appointed by the 
President and confirmed by the Senate. RRA provided the Board 
with specific responsibilities to review and approve strategic 
and performance plans; review operational functions; review the 
selection, evaluation, and compensation of senior executives; 
and review and approve the budget request of the IRS.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $2,000,000 for the IRS Oversight 
Board for fiscal year 2007. This amount is $500,000 above the 
budget request and the fiscal year 2006 enacted levels. These 
additional funds are provided to increase the Board's oversight 
of IRS operations, primarily in the area of information 
technology.

          ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

    The Committee has included five administrative provisions 
carried in prior appropriations acts and six new administrative 
provisions. The administrative provisions are as follows:
    Section 201 continues a provision allowing the IRS to 
transfer up to 5 percent of any appropriation made available to 
the Agency in fiscal year 2007 to any other IRS account, with 
the exception of the Enforcement account, which is limited to 3 
percent. The IRS is directed to follow the Committee's 
reprogramming procedures outlined earlier in this report.
    Section 202 continues a provision maintaining a training 
program in taxpayers' rights and cross-cultural relations.
    Section 203 continues a provision requiring the IRS to 
institute and enforce policies and procedures, which will 
safeguard the confidentiality of taxpayer information.
    Section 204 continues a provision directing that funds 
shall be available for improved facilities and increased 
manpower to support a 1-800 help line service for taxpayers.
    Section 205 continues a provision designating not less than 
$170,000,000 for the Taxpayer Advocate Service [TAS]. Further, 
this amount does not include the normal overhead expenses that 
IRS provides outside of the TAS account. Accordingly, the 
Committee directs the IRS to continue providing overhead 
support from accounts outside of TAS.
    Section 206 includes a new provision requiring the IRS to 
submit its fiscal year 2008 budget justification in the same 
format provided under this act.
    Section 207 is a new provision that allows the IRS to 
transfer up to $10,000,000 from IRS appropriations accounts to 
manage the Earned Income Tax Credit program.
    Section 208 is a new provision that allows the IRS to 
transfer up to $35,000,000 from the Taxpayer Services or 
Enforcement accounts to the Operations Support account for 
purposes of enhancing information technology systems that 
support taxpayer service and enforcement activities.
    Section 209 is a new provision that establishes new IRS 
appropriations accounts as Taxpayer Services, Enforcement, and 
Operations Support.
    Section 210 is a new provision that allows the IRS to 
transfer funds among its new accounts to implement the new 
account structure in this act.
    Section 211 is a new provision that requires the IRS to 
develop a tax gap strategic plan that details the approaches it 
will use to achieve a voluntary compliance rate of 85 percent 
in 2009. This goal was established by the administration in its 
fiscal year 2007 budget justifications.

         Administrative Provisions--Department of the Treasury


                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

    The Committee includes nine administrative provisions 
carried over from prior appropriations acts and two new 
administrative provisions. The administrative provisions are as 
follows:
    Section 212 authorizes certain basic services within the 
Treasury Department in fiscal year 2007, including purchase of 
uniforms; maintenance, repairs, and cleaning; purchase of 
insurance for official motor vehicles operated in foreign 
countries; and contracts with the Department of State for 
health and medical services to employees and their dependents 
serving in foreign countries.
    Section 213 authorizes transfers, up to 2 percent, between 
Departmental Offices, Office of Inspector General, Financial 
Management Service, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Bureau of the 
Public Debt appropriations under certain circumstances.
    Section 214 authorizes transfer, up to 2 percent, between 
the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Inspector General 
for Tax Administration under certain circumstances.
    Section 215 requires the purchase of law enforcement 
vehicles be consistent with Departmental vehicle management 
principles.
    Section 216 prohibits the Department of the Treasury and 
the Bureau of Engraving and Printing from redesigning the $1 
Federal Reserve Note.
    Section 217 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to 
transfer funds from Salaries and Expenses, Financial Management 
Service, to the Debt Collection Fund as necessary to cover the 
costs of debt collection. Such amounts shall be reimbursed to 
the Salaries and Expenses account from debt collections 
received in the Debt Collection Fund.
    Section 218 amends section 122 of Public Law 105-119 (5 
U.S.C. 3104 note), by striking ``8 years'' and inserting ``9 
years''.
    Section 219 requires prior approval for the construction 
and operation of a museum by the United States Mint.
    Section 220 prohibits the merger of the United States Mint 
and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing without prior approval 
of the committees of jurisdiction.
    Section 221 is a new provision that authorizes the 
Department's intelligence activities. This language was 
included at the request of the Office of the Director of 
National Intelligence.
    Section 222 is a new provision that requires the Department 
to submit quarterly reports to the House and Senate Committees 
on Appropriations regarding all uncommitted, unobligated, 
unexpended, and excess funds in each program and activity and 
requires the Department to submit additional, updated budget 
information to these Committees upon request.

                               TITLE III

              DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT

Appropriations, 2006.................................... $33,593,827,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................  34,118,007,000
House allowance.........................................  35,297,266,000
Committee recommendation................................  36,587,572,000

                          program description

    The Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] was 
established by the Housing and Urban Development Act (Public 
Law 89-174), effective November 9, 1965. This Department is the 
principal Federal agency responsible for programs concerned 
with the Nation's housing needs, fair housing opportunities, 
and improving and developing the Nation's communities.
    In carrying out the mission of serving the needs and 
interests of the Nation's communities and of the people who 
live and work in them, HUD administers mortgage and loan 
insurance programs that help families become homeowners and 
facilitate the construction of rental housing; rental and 
homeownership subsidy programs for low-income families who 
otherwise could not afford decent housing; programs to combat 
discrimination in housing and affirmatively further fair 
housing opportunity; programs aimed at ensuring an adequate 
supply of mortgage credit; and programs that aid neighborhood 
rehabilitation, community development, and the preservation of 
our urban centers from blight and decay.
    HUD administers programs to protect the homebuyer in the 
marketplace and fosters programs and research that stimulate 
and guide the housing industry to provide not only housing, but 
better communities and living environments.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee recommends for fiscal year 2007 an 
appropriation of $36,587,572,000 for the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development. This is $2,993,745,000 above the fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level and $2,469,565,000 above the budget 
request.

                     TENANT-BASED RENTAL ASSISTANCE

             (INCLUDING RESCISSION AND TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006 \1\................................ $15,417,919,000
Budget estimate, 2007 \1\...............................  15,920,000,000
House allowance \1\.....................................  15,846,400,000
Committee recommendation \1\............................  15,920,000,000

\1\ Include an advance appropriation of some $4,200,000,000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides funding for the section 8 tenant-
based (voucher) program. Section 8 tenant-based housing 
assistance is one of the principle appropriations for Federal 
housing assistance and provides rental housing assistance to 
over 2 million families. Further, it funds incremental vouchers 
to assist non-elderly disabled families, to provide vouchers 
for tenants that live in projects where the owner of the 
project has decided to leave the section 8 program, or for 
replacement of units lost from the assisted housing inventory 
(tenant protection vouchers), etc. Under these programs, 
eligible low-income families pay 30 percent of their adjusted 
income for rent, and the Federal Government is responsible for 
the remainder of the rent, up to the fair market rent or some 
other payment standard. This account also provides funding for 
the Contract Administrator program, Family Self-Sufficiency 
[FSS] and the Family Unification program. Under FSS, families 
receive job training and employment that should lead to a 
decrease in their dependency on welfare programs and move 
towards economic self-sufficiency.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of 
$15,920,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, including $4,200,000,000 
as an advance appropriation to be made available on October 1, 
2007. These funds are $502,081,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
level. Of these amounts, the Committee has allocated 
$14,436,200,000 for the renewal of all expiring section 8 
contracts; $149,300,000 for section 8 preservation contracts 
through tenant protections; $47,500,000 for family self-
sufficiency contracts; $1,271,100,000 for administrative fees; 
up to $10,000,000 for the Family Unification program that 
provides vouchers to families for whom the lack of adequate 
housing is a primary factor in the separation, or the threat of 
imminent separation, of children from their families, and also 
provides vouchers to youths 18 to 21 years old who left foster 
care at age 16 or older and lack adequate housing; and 
$5,900,000 for transfer to the Working Capital Fund.
    This account provides funding for section 8 tenant-based 
housing programs based on a budget-based approach that seeks to 
ensure funding for vouchers in use while permitting public 
housing agencies [PHAs] to fund vouchers up to the authorized 
level. This account funds housing for over 2 million families. 
Moreover, this level of funding will ensure that PHAs have 
adequate funds for all vouchers-in-use. The Committee expects 
that many PHAs will be able to pay the cost of all vouchers up 
to the legal authorized level.
    In addition, the account funds incremental vouchers to 
assist non-elderly disabled families, vouchers for tenants that 
live in projects where the owner of the project has decided to 
opt-out of the section 8 project-based program, or for the 
replacement of other units lost from the assisted housing 
inventory. The Committee remains concerned over the increased 
costs of section 8 rents over the last few years and what these 
costs could mean to this program in the future expecially in 
consideration of increasing utility costs. Nevertheless, the 
Committee believes that many PHAs have not taken prudent steps 
in reducing the energy costs associated with public housing. 
High costs of fuel are only one component related to high 
energy bills.
    The Committee believes that the budget-based approach will 
ensure a more rigorous rent policy and fiscally responsible 
approach. As a result, the Committee directs HUD to report 
semi-annually on rent increases for affordable, low-income 
housing throughout the Nation, including the cost to the 
Government for its failure to promote or implement a policy for 
developing low-income housing, especially in tight rental 
housing markets. The Committee also directs HUD to report 
annually, beginning no later than June 30, 2007 on the 
effectiveness of this budget-based approach to vouchers, 
including the extent to which available housing units are lost 
because of new cost adjustments as well as the impact of this 
policy on extremely low-income families (those at or below 30 
percent of median income for an area).
    The Committee has also broadened the base for determining 
the funding for section 8 vouchers for each PHA by eliminating 
the 3 month May through July snapshot of voucher costs and 
replacing it with the most recent 12 month period as a method 
for providing accurate and reliable data. The legislation also 
includes up to $100,000,000 for HUD to award funds to PHAs that 
were unfairly disadvantaged from excessive costs due to 
portability over the last year as well as other anomolies such 
as high utility costs. This funding should eliminate the need 
for any central fund.
    The Committee includes $149,300,000 for tenant protection 
assistance. This is the same as the budget request and 
$28,900,000 less than the fiscal year 2006 level.
    The Committee remains concerned that HUD is not committed 
to maintaining section 8 project-based housing and may be 
encouraging owners to opt out of the program. This would be a 
tremendous mistake since affordable housing needs are growing 
while the stock of affordable low-income housing is shrinking. 
HUD is directed to report no later than June 30, 2007 on the 
status of HUD's efforts to retain section 8 project-based 
housing, including a 5-year analysis of units lost and 
retained, by year, State, and locality. HUD is also directed to 
provide an analysis of all efforts made by HUD to preserve low-
income section 8 units. The Committee also directs GAO to again 
assess HUD's efforts and success in preserving HUD-assisted 
low-income housing, especially section 8 project-based housing, 
including recommendations on how better to preserve this 
housing. The Committee expects an annual report on this issue.
    The Committee directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, in consultation with the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs, to conduct a study of the Rental Vouchers for Veterans 
Affairs Supported Housing Program authorized under title 42 
United States Code section 1437f(o)(19) and provide an overview 
of the program including the total number of vouchers, average 
cost, locations receiving vouchers, selection procedure and the 
cost of maintaining such vouchers. The Secretary shall submit 
such report to the Committees on Appropriation not later than 
120 days after the enactment of this act.
    The Committee recommends $1,271,100,000 for administrative 
fees for PHAs. These funds are to be allocated on a formula 
tied to units under lease. These funds are intended to ensure 
the success of the section 8 voucher program, but can be used 
to provide related low-income housing, including development 
costs.
    The Committee provides $47,500,000 for Family Self-
Sufficiency coordinators. These funds are designed to promote 
self-sufficiency by moving from welfare to work.
    The Committee includes $5,900,000 to transfer to HUD's 
Working Capital Fund which is needed for HUD to complete an 
effective IT system to track HUD funding.

                        HOUSING CERTIFICATE FUND

                              (RESCISSION)

Appropriations, 2006.................................... -$2,050,000,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................  -2,000,000,000
House allowance.........................................  -2,000,000,000
Committee recommendation................................  -2,000,000,000

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a rescission of $2,000,000,000, 
the same as the budget request and $50,000,000 less than the 
fiscal year 2006 rescission level. The administration has been 
unable to demonstrate there are adequate ``excess'' section 8 
funds available for rescission, which has been the source for 
prior year rescissions. Instead, the administration appears 
likely to rescind funds from congressional priority programs 
such as the Homeless Assistance programs, HOME, HOPE VI section 
202 housing for elderly and section 811 Housing for Persons 
with Disabilities. As a result, because both HUD and OMB have 
recommended this rescission from section 8 funds, to the extent 
there are inadequate ``excess'' section 8 funding for the 
rescission, the next source of rescission funding is to be 
obtained, in part, first from an amount equal to 10 percent of 
HUD salaries and expenses and an amount equal to 10 percent of 
OMB funding. Only after this source of funds are exhausted can 
unobligated funds from other HUD programs be used to satisfy 
this rescission.

                    PROJECT-BASED RENTAL ASSISTANCE

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................  $5,037,417,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................   5,675,700,000
House allowance.........................................   5,475,700,000
Committee recommendation................................   5,675,700,000

                          PROJECT DESCRIPTION

    Section 8 project-based rental assistance provides a rental 
subsidy to a private landlord that is tied to a specific 
housing unit as opposed to a voucher which allows a recipient 
to seek a unit, subject primarily to certain rent caps. Amounts 
in this account include funding for the renewal of expiring 8 
project-based contracts, including section 8, moderate 
rehabilitation, and single room occupancy [SRO] housing.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee provides a total of $5,675,700,000 for the 
annual renewal of project-based contracts, of which up to 
$145,500,000 is for the cost of contract administrators, 
$3,960,000 is for the Working Capital Fund. This funding is 
equal to the budget request and $635,937,000 above the fiscal 
year 2006 level. As discussed in the Tenant-Based Rental 
Assistance account, GAO is directed to annually assess the 
status of HUD's efforts to preserve assisted housing.

                      PUBLIC HOUSING CAPITAL FUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................  $2,438,964,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................   2,178,000,000
House allowance.........................................   2,208,000,000
Committee recommendation................................   2,460,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides funding for modernization and capital 
needs of public housing authorities (except Indian housing 
authorities), including management improvements, resident 
relocation and homeownership activities.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $2,460,000,000 
for the public housing capital fund, which is $282,000,000 
above the budget request and $21,036,000 above the fiscal year 
2006 enacted level.
    Of the amount made available under this section, up to 
$30,000,000 is for supportive services for residents of public 
housing. Per the budget request, $7,920,000 is available from 
this account to pay for the costs of administrative and 
judicial receiverships and $14,850,000 shall be transferred to 
the Working Capital Fund.
    HUD is prohibited from using any funds under this account 
as an emergency reserve under section 9(k) of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937, but is provided up to $19,800,000 for 
emergency capital needs.
    The bill includes up to $15,345,000 to support the ongoing 
financial and physical assessment activities at the Real Estate 
Assessment Center [REAC].

                     PUBLIC HOUSING OPERATING FUND

Appropriations, 2006....................................  $3,564,000,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................   3,564,000,000
House allowance.........................................   3,564,000,000
Committee recommendation................................   3,660,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides funding for the payment of operating 
subsidies to some 3,050 public housing authorities (except 
Indian housing authorities) with a total of over 1.2 million 
units under management in order to augment rent payments by 
residents in order to provide sufficient revenues to meet 
reasonable operating costs.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,660,000,000 
for the public housing operating fund, which is $96,000,000 
above the fiscal year 2006 level and $96,000,000 more than the 
budget request. Additional funds have been included in 
anticipation of high utility costs.
    HUD is prohibited from using any funds under this account 
as an emergency reserve under section 9(k) of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937. The bill includes language from the fiscal 
year 2004 appropriations bill that prohibits the use of 
operating funds to pay for the operating expenses for a prior 
fiscal year.

     REVITALIZATION OF SEVERELY DISTRESSED PUBLIC HOUSING [HOPE VI]

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $99,000,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................................
House allowance.........................................................
Committee recommendation................................     100,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The ``Revitalization of severely distressed public 
housing'' [HOPE VI] account makes awards to public housing 
authorities on a competitive basis to demolish obsolete or 
failed developments or to revitalize, where appropriate, sites 
upon which these developments exist. This is a focused effort 
to eliminate public housing which was, in many cases, poorly 
located, ill-designed, and not well constructed. Such 
unsuitable housing has been very expensive to operate, and 
difficult to manage effectively due to multiple deficiencies.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $100,000,000 
for the ``HOPE VI'' account, which is $100,000,000 above the 
budget request and $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2006 level. 
The administration also sought to eliminate this program by 
rescinding $99,000,000 of the fiscal year 2006 funding. The 
Committee urges the Department to reconsider the elimination of 
the HOPE VI program, and consider a restructured HOPE VI 
program that is more efficient, cost effective and still 
capable of leveraging other funds for rebuilding often 
distressed communities in which these ``HOPE VI'' projects are 
located.
    This is an important program that has revitalized many 
distressed properties and has anchored revitalization 
activities for the many communities in which these properties 
are located. The Committee acknowledges that many of the funds 
appropriated for this program have yet to be expended as 
projects are delayed and remain in the pipeline due to the 
complexities related to the funding of these types of projects 
as well as local controversies between interested local 
parties. Nevertheless, the program has proven to be very 
successful in transforming the lives of the assisted families 
and in rebuilding often distressed communities.

                  NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING BLOCK GRANT

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $623,700,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     625,680,000
House allowance.........................................     625,680,000
Committee recommendation................................     625,680,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account funds the native American housing block grants 
program, as authorized under title I of the Native American 
Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 
[NAHASDA]. This program provides an allocation of funds on a 
formula basis to Indian tribes and their tribally designated 
housing entities to help them address the housing needs within 
their communities. Under this block grant, Indian tribes will 
use performance measures and benchmarks that are consistent 
with the national goals of the program, but can base these 
measures on the needs and priorities established in their own 
Indian housing plan.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $625,680,000 for the Native 
American Housing Block Grant, of which $1,980,000 is set aside 
for a credit subsidy for the section 601 Loan Guarantee 
Program. The Committee recommendation is the same as the budget 
request and $1,980,000 above the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level.
    The Committee continues to believe that training and 
technical assistance in support of NAHASDA should be shared, 
with $2,000,000 to be administered by the National American 
Indian Housing Council [NAIHC] and $3,465,000 by HUD in support 
of the inspection of Indian housing units, contract expertise, 
training and technical assistance in the training, oversight, 
and management of Indian housing and tenant-based assistance. 
The Committee is concerned that HUD has attempted to micro 
manage many activities of the NAIHC to the detriment of NAIHC, 
the tribes, and the program. These policies have also led to 
unacceptable levels of carryover. The Committee expects HUD to 
resolve these issues while ensuring NAIHC is able to make 
effective and meaningful contributions to tribal heads.
    The Committee continues to be very concerned with both the 
policy and method by which HUD revised the eligibility 
requirements under which HUD allocates the Native American 
Housing Assistance Block Grant [NAHASDA]. On April 19, 2004, 
HUD issued its NAHASDA funding for fiscal year 2004 by using 
``multi-race'' census data for making funding allocations as 
opposed to funding tribes based on members of a ``single 
race''. While this may be a legitimate approach, HUD's 
allocation is based on census date that relies on self-
certification. Equally troubling is the fact that HUD failed to 
use ``notice and comment'' rulemaking in making such a 
substantial policy change. This concern is reinforced by the 
fact that HUD was unable to reach a consensus among tribal 
groups on this policy change. Consequently, while the Committee 
is not looking to challenge the policy change at this time, the 
Committee does direct HUD to reassess this decision through 
notice and comment rulemaking. The Committee also directs HUD 
to establish oversight procedures to ensure that tribal members 
are qualified for purposes of the NAHASDA tribal funding 
allocations.

Committee recommendation................................       8,815,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act of 2000 created 
the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program to provide 
grants to State of Hawaiian Home Lands for housing and housing 
related assistance to develop, maintain, and operate affordable 
housing for eligible low income Native Hawaiian families.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $8,815,000 for this program which 
is $88,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and 
$2,875,000 more than the budget request. Of the amount 
provided, $299,211 shall be for training and technical 
assistance activities.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This program provides access to private financing for 
native Hawaiians who otherwise could not acquire housing 
finance because of the unique status of the Hawaiians Home 
Lands as trust land. As required by the Federal Credit Reform 
Act of 1990, this account includes the subsidy costs associated 
with the loan guarantees authorized under this program.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $1,010,000 in program subsidies to 
support a loan guarantee level of $43,000,000. The subsidy 
level is $119,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 level and the

          HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONS WITH AIDS [HOPWA]

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $286,110,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     300,100,000
House allowance.........................................     300,100,000
Committee recommendation................................     295,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS [HOPWA] 
Program is designed to provide States and localities with 
resources and incentives to devise long-term comprehensive 
strategies for meeting the housing needs of persons living with 
HIV/AIDS and their families.
    Statutorily, 90 percent of appropriated funds are 
distributed by formula to qualifying States and metropolitan 
areas on the basis of the number and incidence of AIDS cases 
reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by March 
31 of the year preceding the appropriation year. The remaining 
10 percent of funds are distributed through a national 
competition.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $295,000,000 
for this program, which is $8,890,000 more than the fiscal year 
2006 enacted level and $5,100,000 below the budget request. The 
Committee also requires HUD to allocate these funds in a manner 
that preserves existing HOPWA programs to the extent these 
programs are determined to be meeting the needs of persons with 
AIDS.

            OFFICE OF RURAL HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $16,830,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................................
House allowance.........................................................
Committee recommendation................................      20,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development was 
established to ensure that the Department has a comprehensive 
approach to rural housing and rural economic development 
issues. The account includes funding for technical assistance 
and capacity building in rural, underserved areas, and grants 
for Indian tribes, State housing finance agencies, State and 
local economic development agencies, rural nonprofits and rural 
community development corporations to pursue strategies 
designed to meet rural housing and economic development needs.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $20,000,000 for the Office of 
Rural Housing and Economic Development for fiscal year 2007 to 
support housing and economic development in rural communities 
as defined by USDA and HUD. This funding level is $3,170,000 
above the fiscal year 2006 level and $20,000,000 above the 
budget request.
    The Committee does not accept the administration's 
recommendation to eliminate funding for this program. The 
Committee believes that the Office of Rural Housing and 
Economic Development plays an important role in HUD's community 
development activities. Twenty-five percent of nonmetropolitan 
homes are renter-occupied, and the high cost of housing burdens 
those in rural areas, as it does in urban communities. 
Furthermore, the Committee notes that the programs of the 
Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development are 
sufficiently different from the housing programs administered 
by the Department of Agriculture to warrant separate 
appropriations.
    HUD is directed to administer this program according to 
existing regulatory requirements. It is expected that any 
changes to the program shall be made subject to notice and 
comment rulemaking.

                       community development fund


                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................  $4,177,800,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................   3,032,000,000
House allowance.........................................   4,215,000,000
Committee recommendation................................   4,215,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act 
of 1974, as amended, the Department is authorized to award 
block grants to units of general local government and States 
for the funding of local community development programs. A wide 
range of physical, economic, and social development activities 
are eligible with spending priorities determined at the local 
level, but the law enumerates general objectives which the 
block grants are designed to fulfill, including adequate 
housing, a suitable living environment, and expanded economic 
opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate 
income. Grant recipients are required to use at least 70 
percent of their block grant funds for activities that benefit 
low- and moderate-income persons.
    Funds are distributed to eligible recipients for community 
development purposes utilizing the higher of two objective 
formulas, one of which gives somewhat greater weight to the age 
of housing stock. Seventy percent of appropriated funds are 
distributed to entitlement communities and 30 percent are 
distributed to nonentitlement communities after deducting 
designated amounts for special purpose grants and Indian 
tribes.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,215,000,000 
for the Community Development Fund in fiscal year 2007. This is 
an increase of $1,183,000,000 above the budget request for 
fiscal year 2007 and $37,200,000 over the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level.
    The administration has proposed to reform and dramatically 
reduce funding for the Community Development Block Grant [CDBG] 
program in fiscal year 2007 by $1,183,000,000 or 28 percent 
from the fiscal year 2006 level. The Committee recognizes that 
adequately funding the CDBG program is essential for HUD to 
meet its core mission in addressing State and local community 
needs for low and moderate income residents across this Nation. 
While some reforms may be warranted, the reforms presented by 
the administration are very controversial.
    The Committee has not included funding for Youthbuild. The 
fiscal year 2007 budget proposes to transfer Youthbuild from 
HUD to the Department of Labor. The Committee recognizes that 
authorizing language to initiate the transfer is currently 
under consideration by Congress and will continue to work with 
the Department and interested parties to ensure that this 
program will not expire for fiscal year 2007.
    The Committee also funds the Economic Development 
Initiative at $250,000,000 and the Neighborhood Initiatives 
program at $30,000,000.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 
1974, as amended, authorizes the Secretary to issue Federal 
loan guarantees of private market loans used by entitlement and 
non-entitlement communities to cover the costs of acquiring 
real property, rehabilitation of publicly owned real property, 
housing rehabilitation, and other economic development 
activities.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,000,000 for 
program costs associated with the section 108 loan guarantee 
program. This amount is $30,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level and $3,000,000 more than the budget request. The 
administration recommended no funding for this program. While 
the program has had an uneven history, it does afford some 
communities the ability to leverage private capital for large 
projects through a pledge of future CDBG funds.
    Of the funds provided, $3,000,000 is for credit subsidy 
costs to guarantee $137,500,000 in section 108 loan commitments 
in fiscal year 2007, and $750,000 is for administrative 
expenses to be transferred to the salaries and expenses 
account.

                       BROWNFIELDS REDEVELOPMENT

Budget estimate, 2007...................................................
House allowance.........................................................
Committee recommendation................................................

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Section 108(q) of the Housing and Community Development Act 
of 1974, as amended, authorizes the Brownfields Redevelopment 
program. This program provides competitive economic development 
grants in conjunction with section 108 loan guarantees for 
qualified brownfields projects. Grants are made in accordance 
with Section 108(q) selection criteria. The program supports 
the cleanup and economic redevelopment of contaminated sites.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends no funding for this program. This 
amount is $9,900,000 less than the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level and the same as the budget request. The administration 
requested no funding for this program. While this program has 
been instrumental in the redevelopment of many communities, 
funds have been made available for a similar program through 
the Environmental Protection Agency.

                  home investment partnerships program


                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................  $1,757,250,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................   1,916,640,000
House allowance.........................................   1,916,640,000
Committee recommendation................................   1,941,640,000

                          program description

    Title II of the National Affordable Housing Act, as 
amended, authorizes the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. 
This program provides assistance to States and units of local 
government for the purpose of expanding the supply and 
affordability of housing to low- and very low-income people. 
Eligible activities include tenant-based rental assistance, 
acquisition, and rehabilitation of affordable rental and 
ownership housing and, also, construction of housing. To 
participate in the HOME program, State and local governments 
must develop a comprehensive housing affordability strategy. 
There is a 25 percent matching requirement for participating 
jurisdictions which can be reduced or eliminated if they are 
experiencing fiscal distress. Funding for the American Dream 
Downpayment Assistance initiative is also provided through the 
HOME program. This initiative provides downpayment assistance 
to low income families to help them achieve homeownership.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,916,640,000 
for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, including 
$25,000,000 for the American Dream Downpyment Fund. This amount 
is $184,390,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level 
and $25,000,000 more than the budget request.
    The Committee includes $9,000,000 for technical assistance, 
the same amount as provided in fiscal year 2006. Of this 
amount, $2,700,000 is for qualified nonprofit intermediaries to 
provide technical assistance to Community Housing and 
Development Organizations [CHDOs]. The remaining $6,300,000 is 
for intermediaries to provide technical assistance to HOME 
participating jurisdictions. The Committee objects to any 
proposal by the Department that ties the use of HOME funds for 
homeownership to the allocation of funds under the American 
Dream Downpayment Fund.
    The Committee includes $25,000,000 for the administration's 
American Dream Downpayment Fund [ADDF]. The Committee supports 
expanding homeownership opportunities, but is concerned that 
this program may be helping families with excessive credit risk 
and who may not be the best candidates for homeownership. The 
Committee requests that HUD report to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations on the rate of default by those in 
the program as well as the numbers of participants who have 
missed their mortgage payments by 30 days, by 60 days and by 90 
days and/or who have received some form of relief to keep their 
mortgages current. This report is due no later than July 31, 
2006 and shall be repeated annually.
    In addition the Committee notes that GAO-06-677 report 
cites several weakness in the ADDF, including large unexpended 
balances since the programs inception and HUD's inability to 
segregate ADDF funding from non-ADDF funding as required to 
measure performance.
    Of the amount provided for the HOME program, $42,000,000 is 
for housing counseling assistance. The Committee does not fund 
housing assistance counseling in a new account, as proposed by 
the administration. The Committee views homeownership 
counseling, including pre- and post-purchase counseling, as an 
essential part of successful homeownership. The Committee 
expects that this program will remain available to those 
participating in all HUD's homeownership programs. The 
Committee continues to urge HUD to utilize this program as a 
means of educating homebuyers on the dangers of predatory 
lending, in addition to the administration's stated purpose of 
expanding homeownership opportunities.

                  SELF-HELP AND ASSISTED HOMEOWNERSHIP

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $60,390,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      39,700,000
House allowance.........................................      60,390,000
Committee recommendation................................      66,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program [SHOP] funds 
assist low-income homebuyers willing to contribute ``sweat 
equity'' toward the construction of their houses. The funds 
will increase nonprofit organization's ability to leverage 
funds from other sources and produce at least 2,000 new 
homeownership units. In 2006, SHOP became a separate account. 
SHOP was previously funded as a set-aside within the Community 
Development Fund.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $66,000,000 for the Self Help and 
Assisted Homeownership Program which is $5,610,000 more than 
the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and $26,300,000 more than 
the budget request. The budget request did not propose any 
funding in this account beyond the Self-Help Homeownership 
Opportunity Program. The Committee has included funding for 
additional programs to enhance affordable housing though 
capacity building to maximize Federal investments. The 
Committee has provided $35,000,000 for capacity building. Set-
asides include $3,500,000 for the Housing Assistance Council; 
$2,000,000 for the National American Indian Council; $2,500,000 
for the National Council of La Raza; $31,000,000 for LISC and 
Enterprise Foundation; $4,000,000 for Habitat for Humanity 
International.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Homeless Assistance Grants Program provides funding to 
break the cycle of homelessness and to move homeless persons 
and families to permanent housing. This is done by providing 
rental assistance, emergency shelter, transitional and 
permanent housing, and supportive services to homeless persons 
and families. The emergency grant is a formula funded grant 
program, while the supportive housing, section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation single-room occupancy program and the shelter 
plus care programs are competitive grants. Homeless assistance 
grants provide Federal support to one of the Nation's most 
vulnerable populations. These grants assist localities in 
addressing the housing and service needs of a wide variety of 
homeless populations while developing coordinated Continuum of 
Care [CoC] systems that ensure the support necessary to help 
those who are homeless to attain housing and move toward self-
sufficiency.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $1,511,190,000 for homeless 
assistance grants. This amount is $184,590,000 above the fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level and $24,800,000 below the budget 
request. Of the amount provided, $285,000,000 is to fund fully 
Shelter Plus Care renewals on an annual basis, $10,395,000 is 
for technical assistance and data analysis, and $2,475,000 is 
for the Department's working capital fund. Bill language also 
is included that (1) requires not less than 30 percent of the 
funds appropriated, excluding renewal costs, for permanent 
housing; (2) requires the renewal of all expiring Shelter Plus 
Care contracts on an annual basis if the contract meets certain 
requirements; (3) requires a 25 percent match for social 
services; and (4) requires all homeless funding recipients to 
coordinate and integrate their programs with other mainstream 
and targeted social programs. No funding is provided for the 
Prisoner Re-Entry initiative due to budget constraints.
    The Committee continues to be committed to ending chronic 
homelessness over 10 years and supports the President's stated 
goal of achieving this goal by 2012. To that end, the Committee 
supports Federal, State, and local efforts to increase the 
supply of permanent housing until the need of an estimated 
150,000 units is met. Accordingly, the Committee again includes 
bill language that requires the Department to spend a minimum 
of 30 percent of funds appropriated under this account for 
permanent housing. This set-aside has been critical in re-
balancing the homeless assistance account so that more 
permanent housing is being developed. Prior to the 
establishment of this set-aside, a small portion of homeless 
assistance was being used for permanent housing. Research and 
anecdotal results clearly indicate that permanent housing is a 
critical component of ending homelessness among all types of 
homeless people. Cities that have seized the opportunity to 
develop more permanent housing have begun to see concrete 
results in the form of less chronic homelessness, among 
individuals and families with disabilities, veterans and 
others.
    To assist States and localities create more permanent 
housing, the Committee supports the Department's request to use 
technical assistance funding to address capital financing 
issues.
    The Committee appreciates the Department's sustained 
commitment to meeting the needs of homeless families. Although 
one-third of homeless people are members of homeless families, 
about half of the persons served by HUD homeless programs are 
members of homeless families. This demonstrates that, while the 
Department has placed an emphasis on chronic homelessness, it 
has continued to address the needs of homeless families.
    The Committee also continues to support an effort begun in 
2001 that charged the Department with collecting homeless data 
through the implementation of a new Homeless Management 
Information System [HMIS]. The Department has recently begun 
collecting data on the Nation's homeless population and 
developing annual reports through an Annual Homeless Assessment 
Report [AHAR] through the HMIS. Further, the Committee supports 
the Department's efforts to ensure participation of HMIS 
through financing and other incentives. Nevertheless, the 
Committee continues to believe that the Department must ensure 
full participation by all grantees in the HMIS effort and 
ensure that grantees and interested stakeholders fully 
understand the importance of this effort and that adequate 
protections are in place for homeless people. Due to the 
Committee's continued interest in the Department's data 
collection and analysis efforts, the Committee again directs 
HUD to report on its progress by no later than March 23, 2007.
    The Committee also reiterates the directive included in the 
conference report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 
(House Report 108-792) regarding out-year costs of renewing 
HUD's permanent housing programs. Therefore, the Department 
should continue to include 5-year projects, on an annual basis, 
for the cost of renewing the permanent housing component of the 
Supportive Housing program and the Shelter Plus Care program in 
its fiscal year 2008 budget justifications.

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $734,580,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     545,490,000
House allowance.........................................     746,580,000
Committee recommendation................................     750,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides funding for housing for the elderly 
under section 202. Under this program, the Department provides 
capital grants to eligible entities for the acquisition, 
rehabilitation, or construction of housing for seniors.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $750,000,000 
for the section 202 program, an increase of $15,420,000 over 
the fiscal year 2006 level and an increase of $204,510,000 over 
the budget request. Of these funds, $59,400,000 is for service 
coordinators and for the continuation of existing congregate 
service grants; up to $24,750,000 for the conversion of 
projects to assisted living housing for substantial 
rehabilitation an for emergency capital repairs; $20,000,000 
for grants to nonprofits for architectural and engineering 
work, site control and planning activities. The Committee also 
includes $1,980,000 for the Working Capital Fund.
    According to a 2003 GAO report, section 202 has reached 
only 8 percent of very low income elderly households. The 
Committee believes that greater resources should be devoted to 
the section 202 program and continues to encourage the 
Department to make this program more of a priority, including 
better targeting to extremely low-income elderly households. 
Further, the Department needs to facilitate the construction of 
section 202 projects. Finally, many of the existing 202 units 
have serious repair needs that are not being adequately 
addressed by the Department.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides funding for housing for the persons 
with disabilities under section 811. Under this program, the 
Department provides capital grants to eligible entities for the 
acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of housing for 
persons with disabilities. Up to 25 percent of the funding may 
be made available for tenant-based assistance under section 8.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $240,000,000 
for the section 811 program, an increase of $3,390,000 over the 
fiscal year 2006 level and $121,200,000 over the budget 
request. HUD is directed to ensure that all tenant-based 
assistance made available under this account shall remain 
available for persons with disabilities upon turnover. The 
Committee has limited the amount of funds that may be used for 
incremental section 8 vouchers to $5,000,000. In addition, 
section 811 funds may be used for inspections by HUD's Real 
Estate Assessment Center [REAC] and for related inspection 
activities. HUD is directed to submit a budget to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations before funding any REAC 
inspections. The Committee also includes $990,000 for the 
Working Capitol Fund.

                    OTHER ASSISTED HOUSING PROGRAMS

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides amendment funding for housing 
assisted under a variety of HUD housing programs.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $24,750,000 for HUD-assisted, 
State-aided, non-insured rental housing projects.

                         FLEXIBLE SUBSIDY FUND

                          (TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 authorized 
HUD to establish a revolving fund for the collection of rents 
in excess of the established basic rents for section 236 
projects. Subject to appropriations, HUD is authorized to 
transfer excess rent collection received after 1978 to the 
Flexible Subsidy Fund.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends that the account continue to serve 
as the repository for the excess rental charges appropriated 
from the Rental Housing Assistance Fund; these funds will 
continue to offset flexible subsidy outlays and other 
discretionary expenditures to support affordable housing 
projects. The language is designed to allow surplus funds in 
excess of allowable rent levels to be returned to project 
owners only for purposes of the rehabilitation and renovation 
of projects.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety 
Standards Act of 1974, as amended by the Manufactured Housing 
Improvement Act of 2000, authorizes the Secretary to establish 
Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards for 
the construction, design, and performance of manufactured 
homes. All manufactured homes are required to meet the Federal 
standards, and fees are charged to producers to cover the costs 
of administering the act.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $16,000,000 to support the 
manufactured housing standards programs to be derived from fees 
collected and deposited in the Manufactured Housing Fees Trust 
Fund account. The amount recommended is the same as the budget 
request and $3,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level.
    The Committee thanks the Department for submitting line-
item expenses for the manufactured housing program in its 
proposed fiscal year 2007 budget request, and encourages the 
HUD to continue doing so in its future budgets. In addition, 
the Committee encourages HUD to continue to prioritize its 
expenditures for this program in accordance with the 
appropriate sections of the Manufactured Housing Improvement 
Act of 2000.

                          program description

    The Federal Housing Administration [FHA] fund covers the 
mortgage and loan insurance activity of about 40 HUD mortgage/
loan insurance programs which are grouped into the mutual 
mortgage insurance [MMI] fund, cooperative management housing 
insurance [CMHI] fund, general insurance fund [GI] fund, and 
the special risk insurance [SRI] fund. For presentation and 
accounting control purposes, these are divided into two sets of 
accounts based on shared characteristics. The unsubsidized 
insurance programs of the mutual mortgage insurance fund and 
the cooperative management housing insurance fund constitute 
one set; and the general risk insurance and special risk 
insurance funds, which are partially composed of subsidized 
programs, make up the other.
    The amounts for administrative expenses are to be 
transferred from appropriations made in the FHA program 
accounts to the HUD ``Salaries and expenses'' accounts. 
Additionally, funds are also appropriated for administrative 
contract expenses for FHA activities.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee has included the following amounts for the 
``Mutual Mortgage Insurance Program'' account: a limitation on 
guaranteed loans of $185,000,000,000, a limitation on direct 
loans of $50,000,000, and an appropriation of $351,450,000 for 
administrative expenses. For the GI/SRI account, the Committee 
recommends $35,000,000,000 as a limitation on guaranteed loans, 
a limitation on direct loans of $50,000,000, and $229,086,000 
for administrative expenses, of which $347,490,000 shall be 
transferred to HUD ``Salaries and Expenses'', up to $3,960,000 
shall be transferred to the Office of the Inspector General, 
and $23,562,000 shall be transferred to the Working Capital 
Fund.
    In addition, the Committee directs HUD to continue direct 
loan programs in 2007 for multifamily bridge loans and single 
family purchase money mortgages to finance the sale of certain 
properties owned by the Department. Temporary financing shall 
be provided for the acquisition and rehabilitation of 
multifamily projects by purchasers who have obtained 
commitments for permanent financing from another lender. 
Purchase money mortgages will enable governmental and nonprofit 
intermediaries to acquire properties for resale to owner-
occupants in areas undergoing revitalization.
    HUD has submitting a number of initiatives designed to 
reform FHA mortgage insurance and allow HUD to begin to regain 
some market share while also attracting borrowers with positive 
credit ratings. In part, the intent of the legislation is to 
balance the adverse pool of borrowers who have come to 
characterize the FHA MMIF with FHA homeowners with better 
credit ratings and who pose less risk. Unfortunately, it is not 
clear that the legislation includes the necessary reforms that 
will allow HUD to compete in the housing marketplace without 
being subject to increased financial risk to the FHA MMIF as 
well as significant fraud and abuse. For example, HUD still 
intends to pursue products such as the Zero Downpayment program 
which would allow a homebuyer to use FHA mortgage insurance to 
purchase a home without any downpayment.
    As noted last year, the Zero Downpayment program, where all 
fees and costs are rolled into the mortgage, is a major policy 
change that generates receipts but poses substantial financial 
risks to the FHA Single Family program--this is a 100 percent 
loan guarantee where realtors and bankers have no disincentive 
against placing high-risk families in homes. New homeowners 
also would have no stake in these homes in the event of 
financial hardship as they also would have limited or no 
ability to pay for any big ticket costs such as a failed 
furnace or leaky roof. From a historical perspective, a similar 
policy almost bankrupted FHA in the late 1980s and economically 
hurt neighborhoods because large numbers of defaults in 
marginal neighborhoods often result in diminished property 
values for the entire neighborhood. Recent audits of the FHA 
Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund have indicated that these 
policies likely would undermine the long-term financial 
soundness of the fund. For example, the HUD IG audit of FHA's 
financial statements for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 demonstrate 
a substantial increase in the default rate over the last 5 
years from 2.99 percent in fiscal year 2000 to 6.9 percent in 
fiscal year 2004. Moreover, claims have increased from some 
$5,500,000,000 in fiscal year 2000 to some $8,500,000,000 in 
fiscal year 2004, a 54 percent increase while insurance-in-
force decreased 13 percent to $430,000,000 during the same 
period. FHA is clearly becoming a lender of last resort, taking 
on the most risky mortgages, especially those likely to 
default.
    More recently, FHA's share of the market dropped 40 percent 
in fiscal year 2005--FHA's home sales were 4.3 percent for 
fiscal year 2005 compared with 7.6 percent in fiscal year 2004. 
In addition, home sales for the entire market were up 7 percent 
in fiscal year 2005. FHA endorsements dropped 46.7 percent in 
fiscal year 2005 and insurance-in-force dropped 13 percent in 
fiscal year 2005. Default rates increased to 6.36 percent in 
fiscal year 2005, compared to 6.13 percent in fiscal year 2004.
    While the Committee supports reform, it must be handled 
carefully. There must be controls in the law that minimize 
fraud and risk of loss. The Committee supports a balancing of 
the risk based on the creditworthiness of the homebuyer. 
However, there needs to be firm benchmarks and guidelines that 
ensure HUD does not remain the lender of last resort where its 
FHA mortgage pools are primarily made up of the most adverse 
credit risks in the marketplace. As a result, the Committee is 
very concerned that the proposed legislation does not include 
the necessary safeguards. In addition, the Committee is 
concerned that homebuyers with sub-prime loans will seek to 
refinance their debt through FHA. Clearly, these homeowners 
represent the greatest risk for default and loss to the MMIF 
and HUD is directed to develop safeguards to limit exposure of 
financial risk.
    The Committee is disappointed with HUD's endorsement of the 
Nehemiah program whereby certain nonprofits help homebuyers 
with downpayment assistance where the downpayment assistance 
does not meet FHA requirements of being a ``boni-fide gift''. 
In these cases, the nonprofit is being reimbursed by the 
property seller. A recent GAO audit was very critical of this 
practice, concluding that ``Nehemiah'' assistance from a seller 
financed nonprofit raised the claim rate 81 percent relative to 
similar loans with no assistance.
    The Committee again advises that HUD should assist in the 
education of potential homebuyers who plan to use FHA mortgage 
insurance as part of the purchase process. While the 
requirements for an appraisal are clear, HUD needs to educate 
homebuyers regarding the value of requiring a home inspection 
before a purchase is complete. In too many cases, homebuyers 
waive this option, thus exposing them to unforeseen and 
unexpected physical deficiencies in the purchased home. This 
especially is troubling with moderate- and low-income 
homebuyers who barely have enough funds to close on the house. 
Without a home inspection, these purchasers may find themselves 
responsible for such high-cost items as a new roof, furnace or 
other significant structural liabilities. In these cases, the 
cost to repair the home and pay for the mortgage may far exceed 
the financial ability of the homebuyer, thus putting the home 
at risk of foreclosure.
    The Committee is deeply concerned with the proposed 
increase in the annual premium charged for most multifamily 
loan guarantees in the fiscal year 2007 request. The stated 
rationale for this substantial premium increase is to offset 
administrative costs associated with these programs. This 
appears disingenuous since the CBO has scored the net increase 
of revenue at $70,000,000. However no detailed explanation has 
been given for the amount of this premium increase, its likely 
adverse effect on loan volume and affordable rental housing 
production, or the resulting rent increases necessary to cover 
the cost of the higher premium payments. Moreover, the Federal 
Credit Reform Act of 1990 specifically mandates that 
administrative costs associated with loan guarantee programs be 
paid from discretionary appropriations rather than being 
reflected in the credit programs financing.
    The Committee sees no merit in the administration's 
argument that these mortgage insurance premiums should be 
raised because these programs have not clearly demonstrated 
effectiveness in meeting affordable housing goals. Raising 
program costs can only diminish the contribution of these 
programs in expanding lower cost housing opportunities. In the 
face of the growing nationwide shortage of affordable housing, 
imposing further constraints on FHA rental housing development 
makes little sense. Further, the Committee believes that this 
action will drive the better quality projects to other sources 
of financing, thus causing an increase in the loss ratio for 
the FHA program in the long term.
    The proposed mortgage insurance premium increase reverses 
the previous policy of the administration to work toward the 
lowest premium allowable while still enabling FHA to offer this 
rental housing financing at no cost to the taxpayers. For the 
largest moderate income rental housing development program 
offered by FHA, the proposed premium represents more than a 71 
percent increase in annual cost. Very substantial premium 
increases would also be levied against the FHA nursing home and 
hospital financing programs.
    Given the very substantial size of the premium increase and 
the abrupt reversal of the underlying policy of the Department 
in setting these premiums, the Committee believes strongly that 
full notice and comment rulemaking would be the only 
appropriate mechanism to pursue prior to implementing this 
proposal. The failure of the Department to do this represents a 
serious breach with congressional policy. Such administrative 
procedures would accord FHA industry partners, including 
lenders, developers, and builders, an opportunity to comment on 
the proposal. It would also permit a full assessment of the 
likely impact of such a premium increase on the volume of 
multifamily rental housing development, and the consequential 
effects of higher financing costs on rents borne by moderate 
income residents.
    Therefore, the Department is directed to submit to the 
appropriate Committees of Congress a thorough assessment of the 
potential adverse effects of the proposed premiums structure, 
including the evaluation of alternatives such as utilizing 
negative subsidy and program revenues to cover administrative 
costs, before proceeding with implementation of the fee 
increases proposed in the budget. The Committee further directs 
that prior to increasing the mortgage insurance premiums the 
formula used for determining credit subsidy should be reviewed 
and revised to more heavily weight experience since 1990 when 
improvements in underwriting were implemented by FHA. The 
current formula appears to be extremely conservative in the 
context of recent experience, and, we believe the current 
mortgage insurance premium levels would generate significant 
negative credit subsidy without the proposed increase.

                                                         100,000,000,000
    Administrative expenses
                                                              10,700,000

                          program description

    The Government National Mortgage Association [GNMA], 
through the mortgage-backed securities program, guarantees 
privately issued securities backed by pools of mortgages. GNMA 
is a wholly owned corporate instrumentality of the United 
States within the Department. Its powers are prescribed 
generally by title III of the National Housing Act, as amended. 
GNMA is authorized by section 306(g) of the act to guarantee 
the timely payment of principal and interest on securities that 
are based on and backed by a trust, or pool, composed of 
mortgages that are guaranteed and insured by the Federal 
Housing Administration, the Rural Housing Service, or the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. GNMA's guarantee of mortgage-
backed securities is backed by the full faith and credit of the 
United States.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation on new commitments of 
mortgage-backed securities of $100,000,000,000. This amount is 
the same level as proposed by the budget request and 
$100,000,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2006 level. The 
Committee also has included $10,700,000 for administrative 
expenses, the same as the budget request and the fiscal year 
2006 enacted level.

                    Policy Development and Research


                        research and technology

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $55,787,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      68,360,000
House allowance.........................................      55,787,000
Committee recommendation................................      60,000,000

                          program description

    Title V of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970, 
as amended, directs the Secretary of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development to undertake programs of research, 
evaluation, and reports relating to the Department's mission 
and programs. These functions are carried out internally and 
through grants and contracts with industry, nonprofit research 
organizations, educational institutions, and through agreements 
with State and local governments and other Federal agencies. 
The research programs seek ways to improve the efficiency, 
effectiveness, and equity of HUD programs and to identify 
methods to achieve cost reductions. Additionally, this 
appropriation is used to support HUD evaluation and monitoring 
activities and to conduct housing surveys.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee recommends $60,000,000 for research and 
technology activities in fiscal year 2007. This amount is 
$4,213,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and 
$8,360,000 below the budget request. Of this funding, 
$5,000,000 is for the Partnership for Advancing Technologies in 
Housing [PATH] program. Language is included to ensure the 
funding of existing cooperative agreements in fiscal year 2006. 
The Committee expects the PATH program to continue its cold 
climate housing research with the Cold Climate Housing Research 
Center in Fairbanks, Alaska. The Committee also supports the 
continuing research on promising technologies for the 
manufactured housing industry.
    In addition, because in the past HUD has used this office's 
broad authority to administer new and unauthorized programs, 
the Office of Policy Development and Research is denied 
demonstration authority except where approval is provided by 
Congress in response to a reprogramming request.

                   Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity


                        fair housing activities

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $45,540,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      44,550,000
House allowance.........................................      44,550,000
Committee recommendation................................      44,550,000

                          program description

    The fair housing activities appropriation includes funding 
for both the Fair Housing Assistance Program [FHAP] and the 
Fair Housing Initiatives Program [FHIP].
    The Fair Housing Assistance Program helps State and local 
agencies to implement title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1968, as amended, which prohibits discrimination in the sale, 
rental, and financing of housing and in the provision of 
brokerage services. The major objective of the program is to 
assure prompt and effective processing of title VIII complaints 
with appropriate remedies for complaints by State and local 
fair housing agencies.
    The Fair Housing Initiatives Program is authorized by 
section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 
1987, as amended, and by section 905 of the Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1992. This initiative is designed 
to alleviate housing discrimination by increasing support to 
public and private organizations for the purpose of eliminating 
or preventing discrimination in housing, and to enhance fair 
housing opportunities.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee recommendation provides $44,550,000, of which 
$19,800,000 is for the fair housing assistance program [FHAP] 
and no more than $24,759,000 is for the fair housing 
initiatives program [FHIP]. The total is $990,000 more than the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level and the same as the budget 
request.
    The Committee emphasizes that State and local agencies 
under FHAP should have the primary responsibility for 
identifying and addressing discrimination in the sale, rental, 
and financing of housing and in the provision of brokerage 
services. It is critical that consistent fair housing policies 
be identified and implemented to insure continuity and 
fairness, and that States and localities continue to increase 
their understanding, expertise, and implementation of the law.

                     Office of Lead Hazard Control


                         LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $150,480,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     114,840,000
House allowance.........................................     149,840,000
Committee recommendation................................     152,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 
1992 established the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard 
Reduction Act under which HUD is authorized to make grants to 
States, localities and native American tribes to conduct lead-
based paint hazard reduction and abatement activities in 
private low-income housing. This has become a significant 
health hazard, especially for children. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], some 434,000 
children have elevated blood levels, down from 1.7 million in 
the late 1980's. Despite this improvement, lead poisoning 
remains a serious childhood environmental condition, with some 
2.2 percent of all children aged 1 to 5 years having elevated 
blood lead levels. This percentage is much higher for low-
income children living in older housing.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $152,000,000 for lead-based paint 
hazard reduction and abatement activities for fiscal year 2007. 
This amount is $37,160,000 more than the budget request and 
$1,520,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. Of 
this amount, HUD may use up to $9,000,000 for the Healthy Homes 
Initiative under which HUD conducts a number of activities 
designed to identify and address housing-related illnesses.
    The Committee recommends $48,000,000 for the lead hazard 
reduction demonstration program which was established in fiscal 
year 2003 to focus on major urban areas where children are 
disproportionately at risk for lead poisoning.
    As previously discussed, there remains significant lead 
risks in privately owned housing, particularly in unsubsidized 
low-income units. For that reason, approximately 1 million 
children under the age of 6 in the United States suffer from 
lead poisoning. While lead poisoning crosses all socioeconomic, 
geographic, and racial boundaries, the burden of this disease 
falls disproportionately on low-income and minority families. 
In the United States, children from poor families are eight 
times more likely to be poisoned than those from higher income 
families. Nevertheless, the risks associated with lead-based 
paint hazards can be addressed fully over the next decade.
    As noted last year, the urban lead hazard reduction program 
is designed to target funding to major urban areas where the 
lead hazard risk for low-income children under the age of 6 is 
greatest. Qualified applicants are identified by the Secretary 
as having the highest number of pre-1940 units of rental 
housing and a disproportionately high number of documented 
cases of lead-poisoned children. At least 90 percent of funds 
must be used for abatement and interim control of lead-based 
paint hazards. Further, the program targets abatement to units 
that serve low-income families. As a condition of assistance, 
each applicant shall submit a detailed plan for use of funds 
that demonstrates sufficient capacity acceptable to the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The plans should 
identify units with the most significant risk, and should 
include strategies to reduce the risk of lead hazards and to 
mobilize public and private resources. The Committee fully 
expects that this program will be administered in a manner 
consistent with the guidelines and criteria used in the fiscal 
year 2003 and 2004 funding cycles.
    The Committee also encourages HUD to work with grantees on 
its lead-based paint abatement hazards programs so that 
information is disclosed to the public on lead hazard 
abatements, risk assessment data and blood lead levels through 
publications and internet sites such as Lead-SafeHomes.info.

                          program description

    The ``Salaries and expenses'' account finances all salaries 
and related expenses associated with administering the programs 
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These 
include the following activities:
    Housing and Mortgage Credit Programs.--This activity 
includes staff salaries and related expenses associated with 
administering housing programs, the implementation of consumer 
protection activities in the areas of interstate land sales, 
mobile home construction and safety, and real estate settlement 
procedures.
    Community Planning and Development Programs.--Funds in this 
activity are for staff salaries and expenses necessary to 
administer community planning and development programs.
    Equal Opportunity and Research Programs.--This activity 
includes salaries and related expenses associated with 
implementing equal opportunity programs in housing and 
employment as required by law and Executive orders and the 
administration of research programs and demonstrations.
    Departmental Management, Legal, and Audit Services.--This 
activity includes a variety of general functions required for 
the Department's overall administration and management. These 
include the Office of the Secretary, Office of General Counsel, 
Office of Chief Financial Officer, as well as administrative 
support in such areas as accounting, personnel management, 
contracting and procurement, and office services.
    Field Direction and Administration.--This activity includes 
salaries and expenses for the regional administrators, area 
office managers, and their staff who are responsible for the 
direction, supervision, and performance of the Department's 
field offices, as well as administrative support in areas such 
as accounting, personnel management, contracting and 
procurement, and office services.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,156,658,000 
for salaries and expenses. This amount is $9,163,000 more than 
the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and $1,142,000 less than the 
budget request. The appropriation includes the requested amount 
of $550,766,000 transferred from various funds from the Federal 
Housing Administration, $10,700,000 transferred from the 
Government National Mortgage Association, $247,500 from the 
Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Fund Program, $148,500 from the 
Native American Housing Block Grant, and $35,000 from the 
Native Hawaiian Housing Program as well as $750,000 from the 
Community Development Loan Guarantee program, which the 
administration sought to eliminate.
    The Committee remains concerned about HUD's ability to 
administer its programs and place staff where most needed. 
Therefore, the Committee directs HUD to report quarterly to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on all hiring 
within the Department, including justifications for any 
significant increase in FTEs for any particular office or 
activity.
    In addition, the Department is prohibited from employing 
more than 77 schedule C and 20 noncareer senior executive 
service employees. The Committee understands that the 
Department is staffed largely by personnel who are close to 
retirement and at the top of the civil service pay schedule. 
The Committee encourages HUD to implement hiring practices that 
result in the hiring of young professionals who can gain 
experience and advancement.
    The Committee directs the Department to issue quarterly 
reports on HUD travel to the Senate Committee on 
Appropriations. These reports shall include a list of all HUD-
related trips, the names of all staff on each trip, and all 
costs, including the individual costs of lodging, food, 
transportation and any other costs.

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $60,000,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      62,000,000
House allowance.........................................      62,000,000
Committee recommendation................................      67,600,000

                          program description

    This appropriation funds the Office of Federal Housing 
Enterprise Oversight [OFHEO], which was established in 1992 to 
regulate the financial safety and soundness of the two housing 
Government sponsored enterprises [GSE's], the Federal National 
Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation. The Office was authorized in the Federal Housing 
Enterprise Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, which also 
instituted a three-part capital standard for the GSE's, and 
gave the regulator enhanced authority to enforce those 
standards.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee recommends $67,600,000 for the Office of 
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which is $5,600,000 above 
the budget request and $7,600,000 more than the fiscal year 
2006 enacted level.

                       Administrative Provisions

    The Committee recommends administrative provisions. A brief 
description follows.
    Sec. 301. This section promotes the refinancing of certain 
housing bonds.
    Sec. 302. This section clarifies a limitation on use of 
funds under the Fair Housing Act.
    Sec. 303. This section clarifies the allocation of HOPWA 
funding for fiscal year 2006.
    Sec. 304. This section clarifies housing issue in Michigan.
    Sec. 305. This section requires HUD to award funds on a 
competitive basis unless otherwise provided.
    Sec. 306. This section allows funds to be used to reimburse 
GSEs and other Federal entities for various administrative 
expenses.
    Sec. 307. This section limits HUD spending to amounts set 
out in the budget justification.
    Sec. 308. This section clarifies expenditure authority for 
entities subject to the Government Corporation Control Act.
    Sec. 309. This section requires HUD to submit certain 
additional information as part of its annual budget 
justifications.
    Sec. 310. This section requires quarterly reports on all 
uncommitted, unobligated and excess funds associated with HUD 
programs.
    Sec. 311. This section requires HUD to maintain section 8 
assistance on HUD-held or owned multifamily housing.
    Sec. 312. This section makes a number of corrections to the 
award of HOPWA funding.
    Sec. 313. This section requires HUD to submit annual 
reports on the number and cost of HUD-assisted units. The 
Committee is concerned that HUD's property disposition program 
is not adequately committed to preserving the affordability of 
formerly subsidized units, and directs HUD to establish and 
submit to the Committee workable criteria for ensuring the 
maintenance of project-based section 8 wherever possible. The 
Committee also expects HUD to improve its consultation and 
coordination with units of local government and residents. HUD 
is reminded that it should use its discretionary preservation 
authority for the purpose of preserving affordability.
    Sec. 314. This section requires HUD to submit its fiscal 
year 2008 budget justifications according to congressional 
requirements.
    Sec. 315. This section requires vouchers for non-elderly 
disabled families to be renewed, to the extent practicable, to 
non-elderly disabled families.
    Sec. 316. This section exempts Los Angeles County, Alaska, 
Iowa, and Mississippi from the requirement of having a PHA 
resident on the board of directors for fiscal year 2006. 
Instead, the public housing agencies in these States are 
required to establish advisory boards that include public 
housing tenants and section 8 recipients.
    Sec. 317. This section allows HUD to authorize the transfer 
of existing project-based subsidies and liabilities from 
obsolete housing to housing that better meets the needs of the 
assisted tenants.
    Sec. 318. This section provides allocation requirements for 
Native Alaskans under the Native American Indian Housing Block 
Grant program.
    Sec. 319. This section requires vouchers for family 
unification to be renewed, to the extent practicable, for the 
family unification.
    Sec. 320. This section reforms certain section 8 rent 
calculations as to athletic scholarships.
    Sec. 321. This section expands the availability of Reverse 
Equity Mortgage without limit and requires HUD to consider the 
number of HECM mortgages that are already insured in a 
geographic region.
    The Committee is concerned over what appears to be 
excessive fees that are charged to HECM loans. The combined 
fees range from $8,000 to $17,000, and are 2 to 4.5 times 
higher than forward loans. The most troubling fee is the 
origination fee. HUD allows origination fees of 2 percent of 
the loan amount or $2,000, whichever is higher. However, 
origination costs do not rise proportionally with the home's 
value for loans above a certain level. In addition, if there 
were an increase in HECM loan limits, the fees seniors pay may 
be even higher. The Committee also directs HUD and GAO to 
review the HECM program with particular emphasis on the 
financial risk to FHA and the homeowner if Congress were to 
raise the HECM loan limits. This report should include an 
assessment of the Fees that are charged in the HECM program as 
to whether the fees are fair and consistent with requirements 
of the HECM program. The report is due within 6 months of 
enactment.
    Sec. 322. This section extends mark-to-market until 2011.
    Sec. 323. This section prohibits HUD from insuring 
mortgages that are part of a nehemial program.
    Sec. 324. This section allows PHAs to use their capital 
funds for central office costs.
    Sec. 325. This section moves the date for subsidy 
reductions for PHAs to January 1, 2007. This section also 
allows operating subsidies to be reduced by 5 percent during 
calendar year 2007.
    Sec. 326. This section makes reforms to the tax credit 
program as it applies to section 8.
    Sec. 327. This section extends HOPE VI until September 30, 
2007.

                                TITLE IV

                             THE JUDICIARY

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Established under Article III of the Constitution, the 
judicial branch of Government is a separate but equal branch. 
The Federal Judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, United 
States Courts of Appeals, District Courts, Bankruptcy Courts, 
Court of International Trade, Court of Federal Claims and 
several other entities and programs. The organization of the 
judiciary, the district and circuit boundaries, the places of 
holding court, and the number of Federal judges are legislated 
by the Congress and signed into law by the President.
    The Committee's recommended funding levels support the 
Federal judiciary's role of providing equal justice under the 
law and include sufficient funds to support this critical 
mission. The recommended funding level includes the salaries of 
judges and support staff and the operation and security of our 
Nation's courts.
    The judicial branch is reminded that it, too, is subject to 
the same funding constraints facing the executive and 
legislative branches and continues to urge the Federal 
judiciary to devote its resources primarily to the retention of 
staff. Further, the judiciary is encouraged to contain 
controllable costs such as travel, construction, and other non-
essential expenses.
    In addition, the judiciary is reminded that section 705 of 
the accompanying act applies to the judicial as well as the 
executive branch.

         United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit


                         salaries and expenses

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $23,780,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      26,300,000
House allowance.........................................      26,000,000
Committee recommendation................................      25,273,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 
was established under Article III of the Constitution on 
October 1, 1982. The court was formed by the merger of the 
United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the 
appellate division of the United States Court of Claims. The 
court consists of twelve judges who are appointed by the 
President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Judges 
are appointed to the court under Article III of the 
Constitution of the United States.
    The Federal Circuit has nationwide jurisdiction in a 
variety of subject matter, including international trade, 
government contracts, patents, certain claims for money from 
the United States Government, Federal personnel, and veterans' 
benefits. Appeals to the court come from all Federal district 
courts, the United States Court of Federal Claims, the United 
States Court of International Trade, and the United States 
Court of Veterans Appeals. The court also takes appeals of 
certain administrative agencies' decisions, including the Merit 
Systems Protection Board, the Board of Contract Appeals, the 
Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, and the Trademark 
Trial and Appeals Board. Decisions of the United States 
International Trade Commission, the Office of Compliance of the 
United States Congress and the Government Accountability Office 
Personnel Appeals Board are also reviewed by the court.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $25,273,000. 
The recommendation is $1,493,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
funding level and $1,027,000 below the budget request.
    Of the amount provided, the Committee has funded the 
requested increase for disaster recovery of information, but 
denies the program increase requests for information technology 
upgrades and the retrofitting of courtrooms to provide enhanced 
technological capabilities. The Committee notes that the 
Federal Circuit currently has appropriate technology upgrades 
in one of its three courtrooms, which meets existing standards 
enacted by the Judicial Conference.

    Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

Appropriations, 2006....................................  $4,308,345,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................   4,687,244,000
House allowance.........................................   4,556,114,000
Committee recommendation................................   4,583,360,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Salaries and Expenses is one of four accounts that provide 
total funding for the Courts of Appeals, District Courts and 
Other Judicial Services. In addition to funding the salaries of 
judges and support staff, this account also funds the operating 
costs of appellate, district and bankruptcy courts, and 
probation and pretrial services offices.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of 
$4,583,360,000. The recommendation is $275,015,000 above the 
fiscal year 2006 funding level and $103,884,000 below the 
budget request.
    The Committee has adequately funded this account to enable 
the courts to meet their workload demands. As previously 
stated, the Committee urges the Judicial Conference to make the 
retention of personnel its top priority. The Committee supports 
the Federal judiciary sharing its case management electronic 
case filing system at the State level and urges the judiciary 
to undertake a study of whether sharing such technology, 
including electronic billing processes, is a viable option.
    Southwest Border.--The Committee is concerned about the 
impact that increased immigration funding and enforcement 
activities are having on the Federal judiciary's caseload and 
their ability to handle such a dramatic increase in filings. At 
present, the criminal cases filed in the five districts along 
the Southwest border account for nearly one-third of criminal 
cases nationwide. Since 2001, approximately 1,200 border agents 
have been added along the border with Mexico, resulting in a 
significant increase in caseload and workload levels. The 
judiciary plays an integral role in the Nation's homeland 
security efforts, and the Committee commends the numerous 
judges and staff who have ensured the continuing success of 
this vital piece of the Nation's border security strategy. 
Because the border courts remain critically understaffed, the 
Committee has provided $20,371,000, as requested, for 
magistrate judges and critical staff positions for those 
districts located along the Southwest border. The Committee 
directs the Administrative Office to include a plan for the 
hiring of these positions in its fiscal year 2007 financial 
plan and to keep the Committee apprised of the number of 
positions actually brought on board along the Southwest border 
throughout fiscal year 2007.
    Staffing Formulas.--The Committee is aware that the 
Administrative Office utilizes a sophisticated staffing formula 
to determine the staffing needs for the local courts. Due to 
the varied nature of caseload levels throughout the Nation, 
courts maintain different requirements for staffing. While the 
Southwest Border Courts have seen the greatest increase in 
funds allocated over the past several fiscal years, the gap 
between their funding allotment and their actual workload 
growth remains substantially greater when compared to the 
courts throughout the rest of the Nation. For example, during 
several of the past few fiscal years, supplemental funding from 
the administrative office and Congress has been required to 
meet the unique needs of the Southwest Border Courts. This 
consistent need for additional urgently needed funding in this 
one region demonstrates, at a minimum, the need for a thorough 
review of the staffing formulas used to determine local court 
needs. The Committee recognizes that the formulas currently 
employed to determine staffing needs place significant weight 
on the work requirements of the local courts' districts. 
However, due to the increasing gap between workload and 
staffing levels, the Committee is concerned that the current 
formula does not adequately address the differing staffing 
requirements that face courts located along the Southwest 
border. As such, the Administrative Office will report to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than 120 
days after the date of enactment of this act on what steps it 
has taken to ensure that its staffing formulas reflect these 
changing trends in caseload activity. The Committee also 
directs the administrative office to ensure that the staffing 
formula ensures that adequate resources are being directed to 
the Southwest border and particularly to the Probation and 
Pretrial Services program.
    Courthouse Construction.--The Committee is aware that the 
judiciary's self-imposed moratorium on courthouse construction 
projects ends September 30, 2006. The Committee notes that the 
judiciary continues to face rising rent costs that are, in 
part, a result of past courthouse construction projects that 
were not adequately reduced in scope. As such, the Committee 
strongly urges the Judicial Conference to weigh carefully its 
need for more space to adjudicate cases against the Federal 
judiciary's rent needs. The Committee encourages the Judicial 
Conference to ensure adequate checks are in place to guarantee 
that future construction requests and projects are subjected to 
the highest standards of cost-efficiencies. The June, 2006, GAO 
report entitled, ``Federal Courthouses: Rent Increases Due to 
New Space and Growing Energy and Security Costs Require Better 
Tracking and Management'' notes that there are currently no 
incentives for district and circuit courts to make more 
efficient use of their space. The Committee is concerned that 
such a lack of incentives has caused the judicial branch to pay 
rent for more space than is necessary. As such, the 
Administrative Office is directed to report to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than 120 days 
after the date of enactment of this act on steps that have been 
and are being taken to encourage more efficient use of space by 
district and circuit courts. Further, the Committee encourages 
the Administrative Office to continue to work with the General 
Services Administration to ensure fair and accurate rent 
charges and to pursue corrections to any inequities.
    Carryover Funds.--Due to unique circumstances, the 
judiciary reported significant carryover funds for fiscal year 
2005 and projects more carryover in funding for fiscal year 
2006. The Committee is concerned that the administrative office 
has not first used these carryover funds to offset projected 
decreases in fee collections and other projected needs and has, 
instead, used this funding to augment existing programs. This 
has resulted in an increase in the judiciary's uncontrollable 
costs, unnecessary funding requests and greater baseline needs. 
As such, the Administrative Office is directed to ensure that 
current and projected funding needs are met first with 
carryover funds before enhancing any program. The Committee 
directs the Administrative Office to separately include in 
future financial plans, for approval by the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations, all sources of carryover funds 
and their desired application.

                 VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION TRUST FUND

Appropriations, 2006....................................      $3,795,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................       3,952,000
House allowance.........................................       3,952,000
Committee recommendation................................       3,952,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Enacted by The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 
1986 (Public Law 99-660), the Vaccine Injury Compensation 
Program is a Federal no-fault program designed to resolve a 
perceived crisis in vaccine tort liability claims that 
threatened the continued availability of childhood vaccines 
nationwide. The statute's primary intention is the creation of 
a more efficient adjudicatory mechanism that ensures a no-fault 
compensation result for those allegedly injured or killed by 
certain covered vaccines. This program protects the 
availability of vaccines in the United States by diverting a 
substantial number of claims from the tort arena.
    Not only did this act create a special fund to pay 
judgments awarded under the act, but it also created the Office 
of Special Masters [OSM] within the United States Court of 
Federal Claims to hear vaccine injury cases. The act stipulates 
that up to eight special masters may be appointed for this 
purpose. The special masters expenditures are reimbursed to the 
judiciary for vaccine injury cases from a special fund set up 
under the Vaccine Act.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,952,000. 
The recommendation is $157,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
funding level and consistent with the budget request.

                           Defender Services

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $709,830,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     803,879,000
House allowance.........................................     750,033,000
Committee recommendation................................     761,051,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Defender Services program ensures the right to counsel 
guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, the Criminal Justice Act (18 
U.S.C. 3006A(e)) and other congressional mandates for those who 
cannot afford to retain counsel and other necessary defense 
services. The Criminal Justice Act provides that courts appoint 
counsel from Federal public and community defender 
organizations or from a panel of private attorneys established 
by the court. The Defender Services program helps to maintain 
public confidence in the Nation's commitment to equal justice 
under the law and ensures the successful operation of the 
constitutionally based adversary system of justice by which 
Federal criminal laws and federally guaranteed rights are 
enforced.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $761,051,000. 
The recommendation is $51,221,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
funding level and $42,828,000 below the budget request.
    While the Committee has provided sufficient funds to enable 
the Defenders Services program to continue to provide timely 
and quality counsel services, the Committee is concerned about 
recurring projected shortfalls in the Defender Services 
account. To the extent that the other salaries and expense 
accounts within the judiciary title must absorb certain 
mandatory adjustments to base, the Committee directs the 
Defender Services program to treat its Federal Defender 
Organizations in the same manner. The Committee has denied all 
program increase requests for this account and directs the 
Administrative Office to ensure that all resources provided are 
first used to ensure the timely payment of panel attorneys.
    Panel Attorney Pay Rates.--The Committee has included 
funding to annualize the fiscal year 2006 pay adjustment for 
capital and non-capital panel attorneys but denies all requests 
for cost of living adjustments and pay raises for panel 
attorneys for fiscal year 2007. The Committee notes that future 
cost of living adjustment requests should not be presented as 
adjustments to base, but should be requested as a program 
increase.

                    Fees of Jurors and Commissioners

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $60,705,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      63,079,000
House allowance.........................................      63,079,000
Committee recommendation................................      63,079,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides for the statutory fees and allowances 
of grand and petit jurors and for the compensation of jury and 
land commissioners. Budgetary requirements depend primarily 
upon the volume and the length of jury trials demanded by 
parties to both civil and criminal actions and the number of 
grand juries being convened by the courts at the request of the 
United States Attorneys.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $63,079,000. 
The recommendation is $2,374,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
funding level and reflects the judiciary's reestimate of fiscal 
year 2007 requirements.

                             Court Security


                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $368,280,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     410,334,000
House allowance.........................................     400,334,000
Committee recommendation................................     397,737,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Court Security appropriation was established in 1983 
and funds the necessary expenses incident to the provision of 
protective guard services, and the procurement, installation, 
and maintenance of security systems and equipment for United 
States courthouses and other facilities housing Federal court 
operations, including building access control, inspection of 
mail and packages, directed security patrols, perimeter 
security provided by the Federal Protective Service, and other 
similar activities as authorized by section 1010 of the 
Judicial Improvement and Access to Justice Act (Public Law 100-
702).

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $397,737,000. 
The recommendation is $29,457,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
funding level and $12,597,000 below the budget request.
    The Committee is concerned about the security of the United 
States Courthouses and is committed to ensuring the Nation's 
Federal appellate and district courts possess adequate security 
measures. Sufficient funding has been provided to retain and 
hire all requested court security officers for fiscal year 
2007. While the Committee has provided funding for the digital 
video recording initiative, the Committee is concerned about 
the significant costs associated with procuring these systems. 
The Committee notes that the United States Marshall's Service 
has indicated that the vast majority of digital video recorders 
can be purchased for substantially less than expected and urges 
the Administrative Office to work with the United States 
Marshall's Service to ensure optimum cost efficiencies.
    The Committee has limited the judiciary's payments to the 
Federal Protective Service [FPS] to no more than $66,900,000 
and directs the Administrative Office to obtain regular 
notifications from the FPS on any changes in funding 
requirements.
    Judicial Facility Security Program.--As provided in bill 
language, the United States Marshals Service [USMS] is 
responsible for administering the Judicial Facility Security 
Program consistent with standards and guidelines agreed to by 
the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts 
and the Attorney General. However, court security funding is 
appropriated by Congress directly to the judiciary which 
provides an important stewardship role, including financial and 
program oversight. While court security funding is subsequently 
transferred to the USMS, which is responsible for program 
administration, the Committee expects full cooperation from the 
USMS as the judiciary conducts the fiduciary and program 
oversight responsibilities pertaining to this funding.

This recommendation is $4,774,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
funding level and $1,000,000 below the budget request.
    Edwin L. Nelson Local Initiative Program.--As established 
in the fiscal year 2005 appropriations act, the Edwin L. Nelson 
Local Initiative Program made grants available to local courts 
to develop and implement information technology solutions for 
the unique problems they face. Such grants ensure greater 
flexibility, access to funds, information sharing and input 
into the various obstacles that must be overcome to produce a 
more automated and efficient Federal judiciary. The Committee 
urges the AO to continue to work with and provide adequate 
resources to the local courts for this purpose.

                Administrative Provisions--The Judiciary

    The Committee recommends the following administrative 
provisions for the judiciary.
    Section 401 allows the judiciary to expend funds for the 
employment of experts and consultant services.
    Section 402 allows the judiciary, subject to the 
Committee's reprogramming procedures, to transfer up to 5 
percent between appropriations, but limits to 10 percent the 
amount that can be transferred into any one appropriation.
    Section 403 limits official reception and representation 
expenses incurred by the Judicial Conference of the United 
States to no more than $11,000.
    Section 404 requires the Administrative Office to submit an 
annual financial plan for the judiciary.
    Section 405 allows for a salary adjustment for Justices and 
judges.
    Section 406 grants the judicial branch the same tenant 
alteration authorities as the executive branch.
    Section 407 prohibits any judge from being entitled to sole 
use of a courtroom and requires courtrooms to be scheduled 
based on the needs of the circuit and district courts. This is 
intended solely to address circumstances where courtrooms are 
not in full use and where the sharing of a courtroom will help 
reduce an overburdened judicial docket.

    This account provides for the compensation of the 
President, including an expense allowance as authorized by 3 
U.S.C. 102.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $450,000 for 
Compensation of the President, including an expense allowance 
of $50,000. This is the same as the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level and the same as the budget estimate. The expense account 
is for official use as authorized by title 3 of U.S. Code and 
is not considered taxable to the President. The bill specifies 
that any unused amount shall revert to the Treasury consistent 
with 31 U.S.C. 1552.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Salaries and Expenses account of the White House Office 
provides staff assistance and administrative services for the 
direct support of the President. The office also serves as the 
President's representative before the media. In accordance with 
3 U.S.C. 105, the office also supports and assists the 
activities of the First Lady.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $51,952,000 
for White House Office Salaries and Expenses. The 
recommendation is $1,340,000 less than the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level.
    The Committee has rejected the administration's request to 
include many of the offices under the Executive Office of the 
President under a single, consolidated account. The Committee 
objects to the overall proposal since it would undermine the 
ability of the Congress to exercise adequate oversight 
regarding how these funds are expended. Nevertheless, the 
Committee has incorporated the responsibilities of the Office 
of Policy Development [OPD] into the ``Salaries and Expenses'' 
account of the White House Office. This represents some 
$3,385,000 of funding for OPD. The Committee agrees with the 
administration that this consolidation is a logical approach 
that will allow the White House to better manage its resources. 
The Committee includes $1,500,000 for the Privacy and Civil 
Liberties Oversight Board as a separate account.
    The Executive Office of the President submitted its fiscal 
year 2007 budget request later than other agencies. This delay 
made it difficult for the Committee to begin its work. The 
Committee encourages the Executive Office of the President to 
submit its budget justification within a few days of the 
publication of the President's budget. The Committee directs 
the Executive Office of the President to include detailed 
budget information for the Civil Liberties Oversight Board in 
next year's justification.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    These funds provide for the care, maintenance, repair, 
alteration, refurnishing, improvement, air-conditioning, 
heating, and lighting, of the White House and the official and 
ceremonial functions of the President.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $12,041,000 
for the Executive Residence at the White House. The Committee 
recommendation is $271,000 less than the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level and is equal to certain assumptions in the budget 
estimate. In particular, the administration's request includes 
many of the accounts under the Executive Office of the 
President under a single, consolidated account, including this 
account. The Committee objects to the overall proposal since it 
would undermine the ability of the Congress to exercise 
adequate oversight regarding how these funds are expended. The 
accompanying bill also continues certain restrictions on 
reimbursable expenses for use of the Executive Residence that 
were enacted for fiscal year 2004.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account funds the repair, alteration, and improvement 
of the Executive Residence at the White House, a separate 
account was established in fiscal year 1996 to program and 
track expenditures for the capital improvement projects at the 
Executive Residence at the White House.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,600,000 for 
White House Repair and Restoration, the same amount as assumed 
in the overall budget request and a reduction of $83,000 from 
the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Council of Economic Advisers analyzes the national 
economy and its various segments, advises the President on 
economic developments, recommends policies for economic growth 
and stability, appraises economic programs and policies of the 
Federal Government, and assists in the preparation of the 
annual Economic Report of the President to Congress.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,002,000 for 
salaries and expenses of the Council of Economic Advisers. This 
amount is the same as the amount assumed in the overall budget 
request and is $2,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Office of Policy Development supports the National 
Economic Council and the Domestic Policy Council, in carrying 
out their responsibilities to advise and assist the President 
in the formulation, coordination, and implementation of 
economic and domestic policy. The Office of Policy Development 
also provides support for other domestic policy development and 
implementation activities as directed by the President.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee does not recommend funds for the Office of 
Policy Development as an independent office and has merged the 
office and funds into the White House Office. In particular, 
the administration's request includes many of the accounts 
under the Executive Office of the President under a single, 
consolidated account, including this account. While the 
Committee objects to the overall proposal since it would 
undermine the ability of the Congress to exercise adequate 
oversight regarding how these funds are expended, the Committee 
believes this merger will facilitate a better use of these 
funds while preserving adequate oversight of their use.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Office of Administration's mission is to provide high-
quality, cost-effective administrative services to the 
Executive Office of the President. These services, defined by 
Executive Order 12028 of 1977, include financial, personnel, 
library and records services, information management systems 
support, and general office services.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee has provided $91,393,000 to the Office of 
Administration for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $2,964,000 
over the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and a decrease of 
$11,024,000 below the budget request.
    The Committee includes the funding levels for the Office of 
Administration activities at the proposed levels included in 
its budget justifications. In addition to the recommended level 
of funding, the Office of Administration receives 
reimbursements for information management support and general 
office services.

    The Office of Management and Budget [OMB] assists the 
President in the discharge of his budgetary, management, and 
other executive responsibilities.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $76,185,000 
for the Office of Management and Budget which is $24,000 more 
than the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and $7,405,000 above 
the budget request.
    In 2005, the Federal Government failed to meet Executive 
order and statutory energy savings goals for the first time in 
more than a decade. Within 120 days after enactment of this 
act, the Committee directs the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, with assistance from appropriate Federal 
agencies, to issue a report to the Committees on Appropriations 
regarding the administration's and OMB's plans to monitor, 
measure, and increase Federal agency performance and 
participation in energy and environmental management. The 
Committee is particularly interested in products and services 
that guarantee energy and taxpayer savings, that measure 
performance, and that involve public/private partnerships. A 
specific focus of the report should include possible statutory 
obstacles.

                 Office of National Drug Control Policy


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $26,639,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      23,309,000
House allowance.........................................      26,928,000
Committee recommendation................................      11,500,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP], 
established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, and 
reauthorized by Public Law 105-277, is charged with developing 
policies, objectives and priorities for the National Drug 
Control Program. In addition, ONDCP administers the Counterdrug 
Technology Assessment Center, the High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Areas program, the National Youth Anti-Drug Media 
Campaign, the Drug Free Communities Program and several other 
related initiatives.
    This account provides funding for personnel compensation, 
travel, and other basic operations of the Office, and for 
general policy research to support the formulation of the 
National Drug Control Strategy.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $11,500,000 
for ONDCP's salaries and expenses. This amount is $11,809,000 
below the budget request and $15,139,000 below the fiscal year 
2006 enacted level.
    The Committee is extremely displeased with the performance 
of ONDCP staff regarding their communication with the Committee 
and their responsiveness to congressional inquiries. ONDCP's 
lethargy and the inadequate information provided severely 
impacts the ability of the Committee to conduct its oversight 
and make budgetary decisions in a timely manner. This kind of 
unresponsiveness on the part of ONDCP results in an unnecessary 
waste of time and energy; numerous follow up communications are 
required in almost every instance. The Committee is 
particularly concerned that ONDCP has attempted to prevent the 
Committee from meeting with the directors of ONDCP programs. 
Therefore the Committee has reduced the salaries and expenses 
budget to more closely reflect actual performance.
    The principal purpose of the White House Office of National 
Drug Control Policy [ONDCP] is to establish priorities, 
objectives, and policies for the Nation's drug control program. 
The Committee is concerned that the overall organization of 
ONDCP is ineffective and must be improved. In fact, 6 years ago 
an independent review found weaknesses in ONDCP management and 
organization, unfortunately these problems persist today. The 
Committee believes an investigation into funding allocations 
and expenditures, as well as the use of resources is warranted. 
The Committee believes an independent review of the overall 
organization and management of grants and funding systems would 
be beneficial to ONDCP and the Congress. Such an evaluation may 
provide insight into changes and improvements that could make 
ONDCP more effective in the future. Therefore, the Committee 
has allocated funding for a study by the National Academy of 
Public Administration [NAPA] to conduct a review of 
organization and management. In addition, the Committee also 
requests that the Government Accountability Office [GAO] review 
the grant management systems, and other funding systems--
emphasizing the criteria and methodology used to award and 
distribute funds. The Committee is aware and supportive of 
GAO's impending review of the Drug-Free Communities program, 
and recommends that GAO also review the Counterdrug Technology 
Assessment Center and High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas 
Program, among others. The Committee expects NAPA and GAO to 
work together, sharing progress and information during the 
course of their reviews, which should begin within 60 days 
after the enactment of this act.
    The Committee directs the Director to provide to the 
Committees on Appropriations quarterly reports on travel 
expenditures, summarized by office, program, and individual, 
including dates and purpose of travel. The Committee further 
directs the Director to provide to the Committees on 
Appropriations quarterly reports on current staffing levels and 
plans for future hirings. The staffing report shall include 
office, position title, salary, and job classifications of all 
persons employed by ONDCP, including contractors.

                COUNTERDRUG TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT CENTER

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $29,700,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................       9,600,000
House allowance.........................................      19,600,000
Committee recommendation................................      20,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center [CTAC] was 
established by the Counter-Narcotics Technology Act of 1990 
(Public Law 101-510) and reauthorized in 1998 (Public Law 105-
277) to serve as the central counterdrug technology research 
and development organization for the United States Government. 
CTAC encompasses two separate functions: (1) the Research and 
Development program [R&D], which supports improvements to 
counterdrug capabilities that transcend the need of any single 
Federal agency; and (2) the Technology Transfer Program [TTP], 
which provides state-of-the-art, affordable, easily integrated 
and maintainable tools to enhance the capabilities of State and 
local law enforcement agencies for counterdrug missions.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $20,000,000 
for the Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center, a decrease of 
$9,700,000 from the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and 
$10,400,000 above the President's request. Included in the 
appropriation is $10,000,000 for demand reduction and 
$10,000,000 for the Technology Transfer Program. The Committee 
continues to support the mandate that CTAC's authority ``shall 
not extend to contracts, management of individual projects, or 
other operational activities,'' and should continue to transfer 
its appropriated funds to Contracting and Technical Agents at 
other Federal and military departments and agencies.
    Demand Reduction R&D.--The Committee fully supports 
continuing the CTAC demand reduction program and reminds ONDCP 
that the fiscal year 2006 conference report directed the 
``completion of existing imaging system instrumentation 
validation effects at qualified academic institutions.''
    The report further directed that: ``a spending plan be 
included in the ONDCP operating plan for fiscal year 2006.'' 
This plan has not been received by the Committee, therefore the 
Committee directs submission of the fiscal year 2006 plan 30 
days after enactment of this act. The plan shall include an 
accounting of the use of the fiscal year 2006 CTAC R&D 
appropriated funds and an accounting of all fiscal year 2006 
funds that are unobligated and unexpended and the rationale for 
inaction.
    For fiscal year 2007, not more than $1,000,000 of the 
funding provided for counternarcotics research and development 
projects is directed toward supply reduction activities. The 
Committee directs submission of a spending plan for fiscal year 
2007 that reinstates the demand instrumentation infrastructure 
development program. The plan must include demand 
instrumentation and infrastructure systems and technology 
development projects that would provide researchers with the 
tools to conduct more advanced NIH, NIDA, SAMHSA, NIMH drug 
addiction and scientific studies. The Committee further directs 
the fiscal year 2007 funds with expenditure project execution 
authority be completed and transferred to other Federal 
departments and agencies within 45 days of enactment of this 
act.
    Technology Transfer Program.--The Committee believes that 
this program demonstrates the best direct assistance the 
Federal Government has to offer to State and local law 
enforcement. The Committee is encouraged by the positive 
reception this program continues to receive by State and local 
law enforcement agencies. Thus prompting the Committee to 
request that the fiscal year 2008 budget request include a 
specific accounting of the total number of TTP applications 
received and the number awarded in the previous year, so that 
the Committee may have a true understanding of CTAC's ability 
to meet demand.

                  Funds Appropriated to the President


                     FEDERAL DRUG CONTROL PROGRAMS

                 HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $224,730,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................................
House allowance.........................................     235,000,000
Committee recommendation................................     227,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas [HIDTA] program 
was established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, as amended, 
and the Office of National Drug Control Policy's 
reauthorization (Public Law 105-277) to provide assistance to 
Federal, State and local law enforcement entities operating in 
those areas most adversely affected by drug trafficking.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $227,000,000 
for the HIDTA program, an increase of $2,270,000 over the 
fiscal year 2006 level and $227,000,000 over the budget request 
which proposed to transfer the program to the Department of 
Justice. This program is an important function of ONDCP and 
should not be transferred. The Committee directs that funding 
shall be provided for the existing HIDTAs at no less than the 
fiscal year 2006 initial allocation level, unless the Director 
submits to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, 
and the Committees approve, a request for reprogramming of the 
funds based on clearly articulated priorities for the HIDTA 
program, as well as published ONDCP performance measures of 
effectiveness. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Director 
to take appropriate steps to ensure that the HIDTA funds are 
transferred to the appropriate drug control agencies 
expeditiously.
    In allocating HIDTA funds, the Committee expects the 
Director of ONDCP to ensure that the entities receiving these 
limited resources make use of them strictly for implementing 
the strategy for each HIDTA, taking into consideration local 
conditions and resource requirements. In this regard, 
methamphetamine is a primary illicit drug threat across the 
country. Its widespread use and resulting addiction, combined 
with the overwhelming availability of high purity, low cost 
methamphetamine is cause for serious concern. Cocaine and 
heroin also represent significant threats and Ecstasy is an 
increasing danger. Marijuana is readily available and widely 
abused across the United States. Canadian-produced marijuana, 
commonly known as BC Bud, and potent marijuana from the 
Appalachian States are two examples that demonstrate the value 
of marijuana eradication programs.
    The HIDTA funds should not be used to supplant existing 
support for ongoing Federal, State, or local drug control 
operations normally funded out of the operating budgets of each 
agency. ONDCP is directed to hold back all HIDTA funds from a 
State until such time as a State or locality has met its 
financial obligation.
    The Committee is disappointed by ONDCP's delay in the award 
of HIDTA funding, and includes provisions in the bill to 
address this issue.
    Allocation of Additional Funds.--The Committee is 
disappointed in the manner that ONDCP chooses to allocate 
funds. While the Committee supports the areas to which the 
additional funding is now directed, the Committee does not 
believe that these programs are being judiciously funded. ONDCP 
continues to disregard the congressional directive that at 
least $2,000,000 should be spent on new counties. The Committee 
believes new counties to be those that have not previously 
received HIDTA funding, and are an expansion of an existing 
HIDTA. The Committee includes provisions in the bill to address 
this issue.

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $214,500,000 
for Other Federal Drug Control Programs, which is $2,340,000 
more than the requested amount and $21,549,000 more than the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level. Within this amount, the 
Committee provides the following funding levels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Amount
------------------------------------------------------------------------
National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign.................    $120,000,000
Drug Free Communities Support Program...................      80,000,000
U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.................................       9,000,000
National Drug Court Institute...........................       1,000,000
National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws.............       1,000,000
Performance Measure Development.........................       2,000,000
World Anti-Doping Agency [WADA].........................       1,500,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign.--The Committee has 
provided consistent monetary support for the National Youth 
Anti-Drug Media Campaign since it was initially funded by 
Congress in fiscal year 1998. The Committee continues to be 
concerned about the direction and efficacy of the Media 
Campaign as it is currently structured, and notes that 
independent reports have concluded that the Media Campaign has 
not had a demonstrable nationwide effect on reducing drug use 
among the Campaign's target population. The Committee provides 
$120,000,000 for the Media Campaign, of which $15,000,000 shall 
be for the continuation of anti-methamphetamine advertising. 
The Committee is concerned with the priorities of the Media 
Campaign and wants to assure that America's meth problem is 
addressed in a responsible manner by the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy. Of these funds, $20,000,000 may not be 
made available for use unless GAO certifies that the program is 
meeting the benchmarks established by OMB.
    The Committee remains concerned with the large proportion 
of Media Campaign resources devoted to administrative costs. 
The bill, therefore, directs that no more than 10 percent of 
the funding provided for the Media Campaign be used for 
administrative costs.
    Drug-Free Communities Support Program.--ONDCP has directed 
the Drug-Free Communities Support Program [DFCSP] in 
partnership with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention since it was created by the Drug-Free Communities 
Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-20). DFCSP provides matching grants 
of up to 25 percent to local coalitions that mobilize their 
communities to prevent youth alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug, 
and inhalant abuse. Such grants support coalitions of youth; 
parents; media; law enforcement; school officials; faith-based 
organizations; fraternal organizations; State, local, and 
tribal government agencies; healthcare professionals; and other 
community representatives. The DFCSP enables these coalitions 
to strengthen their coordination and prevention efforts, 
encourage citizen participation in substance abuse reduction 
efforts, and disseminate information about effective programs. 
The Committee provides $80,000,000 for the continuation of the 
DFCSP.
    The Committee has also included a provision in the bill 
directing ONDCP to provide $2,000,000 of DFCSP funds as a 
direct grant to the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America 
in order to sustain the National Community Anti-Drug Coalition 
Institute.
    The Committee is displeased with the sudden changes made by 
ONDCP to the DFCSP, therefore the Committee has included a 
provision in the accompanying bill to address this issue.
    United States Anti-Doping Agency.--The United States Anti-
Doping Agency [USADA] is the independent anti-doping agency for 
Olympic sports in the United States, and is responsible for 
managing the testing and adjudication process for U.S. Olympic, 
Pan Am and Paralympic athletes. As a nonprofit corporation 
under the leadership of an independent Board of Directors, 
USADA has the authority to set forth guiding principles in 
anti-doping policy and to enforce any doping violations. In 
addition to managing collection and testing procedures, USADA 
is also responsible for enhancing research efforts and 
promoting educational programs to inform athletes of the rules 
governing the use of performance enhancing substances, the 
ethics of doping and its harmful health effects.
    The Committee provides $9,000,000 for USADA, which is 
$500,000 more than the requested amount. USADA's efforts with 
respect to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative [BALCO] and the 
new threat of human growth hormone provide examples of the 
challenges facing this agency.
    World Anti-Doping Agency.--ONDCP is a full participant in 
the World Anti-Doping Agency [WADA], which promotes and 
coordinates international activities against doping in all 
forms of sports. The Committee provides $1,500,000 for 
membership dues to the WADA, consistent with the commitment the 
United States has WADA. In providing these funds, the Committee 
directs ONDCP to use its voice and vote as the United States' 
representative in this world body to ensure that all countries' 
athletes are subject to fair and equal standards and treatment. 
Thus establishing and maintaining the objectivity and integrity 
of this fledgling international athletic regulatory 
organization.
    National Drug Court Institute.--The National Drug Court 
Institute facilitates the growth of the drug court movement by 
promoting and disseminating education, research, and 
scholarship concerning drug court programs and providing a 
comprehensive drug court training series for practitioners. 
Drug courts provide an effective means to fight drug-related 
crime through the cooperative efforts of State and local law 
enforcement, the judicial system, and the public health 
treatment network. The Committee provides $1,000,000 for the 
National Drug Court Institute.
    National Alliance For Model State Drug Laws.--The National 
Alliance for Model State Drug Laws [NAMSDL] is a national 
organization that drafts, researches, and analyzes model drug 
and alcohol laws and related State statutes, provides access to 
a national network of drug and alcohol experts, and facilitates 
working relationships among State and community leaders and 
drug and alcohol professionals. In doing so, NAMSDL encourages 
States to adopt and implement laws, policies, and regulations 
to reduce drug trafficking, drug use, and their related 
consequences. The Committee provides $1,000,000 to NAMSDL and 
directs ONDCP to provide the entire amount directly to NAMSDL 
within 30 days after enactment of this act.
    Performance Measures Development.--Performance Measures 
Development [PMD] funding is used to conduct evaluation 
research for assessing the effectiveness of the National Drug 
Control Strategy. For this function, the Committee provides 
$2,000,000, which is the same as the requested amount.
    Projects undertaken with these resources are to entail 
efforts to encourage and work with selected programs to develop 
and improve needed data sources.

     FEDERAL BUILDINGS FUND--LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABILITY OF REVENUE

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

Limitation of availability of revenue:
    Limitation on availability, 2006....................  $7,752,745,000
    Limitation on availability, 2007....................   8,046,666,000
House allowance.........................................   7,180,886,000
Committee recommendation................................   8,064,737,000

    The Federal Buildings Fund program consists of the 
following activities financed from rent charges:
    Construction and Acquisition of Facilities.--Space is 
acquired through the construction or purchase of facilities and 
prospectus-level extensions to existing buildings. All costs 
directly attributable to site acquisition, construction, and 
the full range of design and construction services, and 
management and inspection of construction projects are funded 
under this activity.
    Repairs and Alterations.--Repairs and alterations of public 
buildings as well as associated design and construction 
services are funded under this activity. Protection of the 
Government's investment, health and safety of building 
occupants, transfer of agencies from leased space, and cost 
effectiveness are the principal criteria used in establishing 
priorities. Primary consideration is given to repairs to 
prevent deterioration and damage to buildings, their support 
systems, and operating equipment. This activity also provides 
for conversion of existing facilities and non-prospectus 
extensions.
    Installment Acquisition Payments.--Payments are made for 
liabilities incurred under purchase contract authority and 
lease purchase arrangements. The periodic payments cover 
principal, interest on the debt incurred for construction of 
Federal buildings.
    Rental of Space.--Space is acquired through the leasing of 
buildings including space occupied by Federal agencies in U.S. 
Postal Service facilities, 174 million rentable square feet in 
fiscal year 2006, and 180 million rentable square feet in 
fiscal year 2007.
    Building Operations.--Services are provided for Government-
owned and leased facilities, including cleaning, utilities and 
fuel, maintenance, miscellaneous services (such as moving, 
evaluation of new materials and equipment, and field 
supervision), and general management and administration of all 
real property related programs including salaries and benefits 
paid from the Federal Buildings Fund.
    Other Programs.--When requested by Federal agencies, the 
Public Buildings Service provides building services, such as 
tenant alterations, cleaning and other operations, and 
protection services which are in excess of those services 
provided under the commercial rental charge. For presentation 
purposes, the balances of the Unconditional Gifts of Real, 
Personal, or Other Property trust fund have been combined with 
the Federal Buildings Fund.

                      CONSTRUCTION AND ACQUISITION

Limitation on availability, 2007........................   (690,095,000)
House allowance.........................................    374,095,000 
Committee recommendation................................    708,166,000 

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The construction and acquisition fund shall be available 
for site, design, construction, management, and inspection 
costs for the construction of new Federal facilities.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation of $708,166,000 for 
the fund.
    The judicial branch has indicated that it is in a funding 
crisis, in part, precipitated by the deficit concerns facing 
the Federal Government and, from its perspective, an onerous 
financial burden caused by GSA rent bills for Federal courtroom 
space.
    The Committee is concerned by continued efforts by the 
Federal judiciary to circumvent paying rents to the Federal 
Buildings Fund [FBF]. In a recent report by the Government 
Accountability Office on the courthouse construction program, 
GAO stated that any rent exemption for the Federal judiciary 
would seriously hinder the FBF's ability to accumulate 
sufficient funds for capital investment for the 68 executive 
and legislative branch customers that it serves. Because GSA's 
customer agencies contribute their fair share to the FBF, the 
FBF is fulfilling its intended role as a source of both 
operating and capital funds for the Federal Government as a 
whole.
    The Federal judiciary should be aware that the FBF has 
financed the judiciary's request for courthouse repair and 
alteration as well as construction. Over the last 20 years, 
almost $1,700,000,000 in major modernizations for courthouses 
were funded by rent paid by executive, legislative, and 
judicial branch agencies. In addition, the Committee would note 
that $3,400,000,000 in new construction for the Federal 
judiciary has been spent on approximately 50 new Government-
owned and 30 lease-constructed courthouses over the past 10 
years.
    The Committee is disappointed that the judicial branch has 
sought to relieve its overall budget problems by challenging 
the requirement to pay rent and cost of its courthouses. In 
pursuing the $3,400,000,000 in new construction of Federal 
courthouses, the Federal judiciary was well aware that there 
were rents associated with the approval of these courthouses by 
Congress. Terms and rents were agreed to by the Federal 
judiciary, GSA, OMB, and ultimately approved by Congress. The 
rules of the game can not be changed at this time.
    The Committee would also note that the Federal judiciary's 
Space and Facilities Committee will shortly be releasing its 
new courthouse management 5-year plan, following a moratorium 
and time out and review of 2 years. The Committee looks forward 
to reviewing the additional space and facility needs and 
increased rent payments that the Federal judiciary will be 
pursuing.
    The Committee notes the rental adjustments made by GSA in 
favor of the judiciary and urges GSA to continue to monitor and 
calculate rental charges carefully so as to avoid erroneous 
billings in the future.

                        REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS

Limitation on availability, 2006 .......................    $861,376,000
Limitation on availability, 2007........................     866,194,000
House allowance.........................................     435,281,000
Committee recommendation................................     866,194,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Under this activity, the General Services Administration 
[GSA] executes its responsibility for repairs and alterations 
[R&A] of both Government-owned and leased facilities under the 
control of GSA. The primary goal of this activity is to provide 
commercially equivalent space to tenant agencies. Safety, 
quality, and operating efficiency of facilities are given 
primary consideration in carrying out this responsibility.
    R&A workload requirements originate with scheduled onsite 
inspections of buildings by qualified regional engineers and 
building managers. The work identified through these 
inspections is programmed in order of priority into the 
Inventory Reporting Information System [IRIS] and incorporated 
into a 5-year plan for accomplishment, based upon funding 
availability, urgency, and the volume of R&A work that GSA has 
the capability to execute annually. Since fiscal year 1995, 
design and construction services activities associated with 
repair and alteration projects have been funded in this 
account.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends new obligational authority of 
$866,194,000 for repairs and alterations in fiscal year 2007. 
This amount is the same as the President's request.

                    INSTALLMENT ACQUISITION PAYMENTS

Limitation on availability, 2006........................    $168,180,000
Limitation on availability, 2007........................     163,999,000
House allowance.........................................     163,999,000
Committee recommendation................................     163,999,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Public Buildings Amendments of 1972 enables GSA to 
enter into contractual arrangements for the construction of a 
backlog of approved but unfunded projects. This activity 
provides for the payment of interest to the Federal Financing 
Bank related to facilities acquired pursuant to the Public 
Buildings Amendments of 1972 (40 U.S.C. 592).

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation of $163,999,000 for 
installment acquisition payments, the same as the budget 
request and $4,181,000 below the fiscal year 2006 funding 
level.

                            RENTAL OF SPACE

Limitation on availability, 2006........................  $4,046,031,000
Limitation on availability, 2007........................   4,322,548,000

Committee recommendation................................   4,322,548,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    GSA is responsible for leasing general purpose space and 
land incident thereto for Federal agencies, except cases where 
GSA has delegated its leasing authority. GSA's policy is to 
lease privately owned buildings and land only when: (1) Federal 
space needs cannot be otherwise accommodated satisfactorily in 
existing Government-owned or leased space; (2) leasing proves 
to be more efficient than the construction or alteration of a 
Federal building; (3) construction or alteration is not 
warranted because requirements in the community are 
insufficient or are indefinite in scope or duration; or (4) 
completion of a new Federal building within a reasonable time 
cannot be assured.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation of $4,322,548,000 for 
rental of space. The Committee recommendation is the same as 
the President's budget request and $276,517,000 above the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level.

                          BUILDING OPERATIONS

Limitation on availability, 2006........................  $1,885,102,000
Limitation on availability, 2007........................   2,003,830,000
House allowance.........................................   1,885,102,000
Committee recommendation................................   2,003,830,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This activity provides for the operation of all Government-
owned facilities under the jurisdiction of GSA and building 
services in GSA-leased space where the terms of the lease do 
not require the lessor to furnish such services. Services 
included in building operations are cleaning, protection, 
maintenance, payments for utilities and fuel, grounds 
maintenance, and elevator operations. Other related supporting 
services include various real property management and staff 
support activities such as space acquisition and assignment; 
the moving of Federal agencies as a result of space alterations 
in order to provide better space utilization in existing 
buildings; onsite inspection of building services and 
operations accomplished by private contractors; and various 
highly specialized contract administration support functions.
    The space, operations, and services referred to above are 
furnished by GSA to its tenant agencies in return for payment 
of rent. Due to considerations unique to their operation, GSA 
also provides varying levels of above-standard services in 
agency headquarter facilities, including those occupied by the 
Executive Office of the President, such as the east and west 
wings of the White House.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a limitation of $2,003,830,000 for 
building operations. This amount is the same as the President's 
budget request and $118,728,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level.
    The Committee is pleased with the initial actions of GSA to 
promote exercise and good health through the promotion of the 
use of stairs in Federal buildings, and the Committee 
encourages these efforts to be continued.

the most cost-effective solutions for the delivery of 
administrative services and sound workplace practices, while 
reducing regulations and empowering employees.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $52,550,000 
for Government-wide Policy. This amount is the same as the 
President's budget request and is a reduction of $246,000 below 
the fiscal year 2006 level.
    Environmental Training Program.--The Committee is pleased 
with the significant cost savings recently demonstrated in the 
environmental analysis efforts undertaken by GSA in the 
National Capital Region. The Committee recommends that GSA 
extend this environmental training and analysis program 
currently underway to other GSA regions. The Committee urges 
GSA to work with its existing partner to preserve continuity 
when expanding this program to the eight other GSA regions. The 
Committee also encourages the utilization of leased employees 
to implement these cost savings programs in other GSA regions 
whenever possible.

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $83,032,000 
for the Operating Expenses. This amount is the same as the 
administration's request and $16,858,000 below the fiscal year 
2006 enacted level.

                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $43,410,000

    This appropriation provides agency-wide audit and 
investigative functions to identify and correct management and 
administrative deficiencies within the General Services 
Administration [GSA], creating conditions for existing or 
potential instances of fraud, waste and mismanagement. This 
audit function provides internal audit and contract audit 
services. Contract audits provide professional advice to GSA 
contracting officials on accounting and financial matters 
relative to the negotiation, award, administration, repricing, 
and settlement of contracts. Internal audits review and 
evaluate all facets of GSA operations and programs, test 
internal control systems, and develop information to improve 
operating efficiencies and enhance customer services. The 
investigative function provides for the detection and 
investigation of improper and illegal activities involving GSA 
programs, personnel, and operations.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $44,312,000 
for the Office of Inspector General. This amount is the same as 
the President's budget request and $902,000 above the fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level.

                   ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT [E-GOV] FUND

Appropriations, 2006....................................      $3,000,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................       5,000,000
House allowance.........................................       3,000,000
Committee recommendation................................       5,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This program supports interagency ``electronic government'' 
or ``e-gov'' initiatives, i.e., projects that use the Internet 
or other electronic methods to provide individuals, businesses, 
and other government agencies with simpler and more timely 
access to Federal information, benefits, services, and business 
opportunities.
    Proposals for funding must meet capital planning guidelines 
and include adequate documentation to demonstrate a sound 
business case, attention to security and privacy, and a way to 
measure performance against planned results. In addition, a 
small portion of the money could be used for awards to those 
project management teams that delivered the best product to 
meet customer needs.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $5,000,000 for 
the Electronic Government Fund. This amount is the same as the 
President's request. The Committee supports the use of funding 
under this account for the continued development of an eTravel 
System, which is designed to centralize a travel system for the 
Federal Government through a self-service electronic system. 
The eTravel system when completed will eliminate the hardcopy 
travel documentation. This program will ultimately automate the 
entire travel process. Nevertheless, the Committee believes 
that the eTravel system should be designed to ensure the 
participation of small business subcontracting and directs GSA 
to establish benchmarks to ensure the participation and growth 
of small business participation. These benchmarks shall be no 
less than 23 percent of all contracted dollars.

                FEDERAL CITIZEN INFORMATION CENTER FUND

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $15,000,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      16,866,000
House allowance.........................................      16,866,000
Committee recommendation................................      16,866,000

                          program description

    The Federal Citizen Information Center [FCIC] brings 
together an array of U.S. Government information and services 
and makes them accessible to the public. This information is 
made available on the web, via e-mail, in print, or over the 
telephone.
    Originally established within the General Services 
Administration [GSA] by Executive order on October 26, 1970, to 
help Federal departments and agencies promote and distribute 
printed consumer information, FCIC has evolved and consolidated 
a variety of complementary functions to augment the original 
print and media channels through which it informed the public.
    On January 28, 2000, the FCIC assumed responsibility for 
the operations of the Federal Information Center [FIC] program. 
The FIC program was established within the General Services 
Administration in 1966, and was formalized by Public Law 95-491 
in 1980. The program's purpose is to provide the public with 
direct information about all aspects of Federal programs, 
regulations, and services. To accomplish this mission, 
contractual services are used to respond to public inquiries 
via the nationwide toll-free National Contact Center.
    On June 30, 2002, FCIC assumed operational control of the 
FirstGov.gov website, the official portal of the U.S. 
Government, and became a critical part of GSA's newly 
established Office of Citizen Services and Communications. This 
Office brings together all of GSA's citizen-centered programs. 
The new Office serves as a central Federal gateway for 
citizens, businesses, other governments, and the media to 
easily obtain information and services from the Government. On 
March 31, 2003, FCIC began accepting e-mail and fax inquiries 
from the public through the FirstGov.gov website and responds 
to them at its National Contact Center.
    Public Law 98-63, enacted July 30, 1983, established a 
revolving fund for the FCIC. Under this fund, FCIC activities 
are financed from the following: annual appropriations from the 
general funds of the Treasury, reimbursements from agencies for 
distribution of publications and contact center services, user 
fees collected from the public, and any other income incident 
to FCIC activities. All are available as authorized in 
appropriation acts without regard to fiscal year limitations.
    The Committee recognizes the need for the General Services 
Administration [GSA] to work with the Federal Protective 
Service [FPS] of the Department of Homeland Security [DHS] to 
implement the newly developed FSRM methodology. Implementing 
the new methodology will facilitate the performance of risk 
assessments to support new construction, major modernizations 
and/or pre-lease projects. The Committee remains concerned that 
a cooperative effort between FPS and GSA is required to fully 
implement Interagency Security Committee [ISC] Security Design 
Criteria and the ISC Security Criteria for Leased Space. The 
GSA will work with DHS to provide engineering expertise to 
support the structural aspects of the project's specific risk 
assessments. Therefore, the GSA Public Building Service [PBS] 
(Office of the Chief Architect and Office of Real Property 
Asset Management) is directed to continue to work with the 
private sector to implement the new Federal Security Risk 
Management methodology to facilitate the application of the 
process and the software throughout the GSA regions and in 
consultation with the Department of Homeland Security's Federal 
Protective Service.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee recommends $16,866,000 for the Federal 
Citizen Information Center, an increase of $1,866,000 above the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level and equal to the budget request.
    The appropriation will be augmented by reimbursements from 
Federal agencies for distribution of consumer publications, 
user fees from the public, and other income.

       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

    Section 601 authorizes GSA to credit accounts with certain 
funds received from Government corporations.
    Section 602 authorizes GSA to use funds for the hire of 
passenger motor vehicles.
    Section 603 authorizes GSA to transfer funds within the 
Federal buildings fund for meeting program requirements.
    Section 604 limits funding for courthouse construction 
which does not meet certain standards of a capital improvement 
plan.
    Section 605 provides that no funds may be used to increase 
the amount of occupiable square feet, provide cleaning 
services, security enhancements, or any other service usually 
provided, to any agency which does not pay the requested rate.
    Section 606 continues the provision that permits GSA to pay 
small claims (up to $250,000) made against the Government.
    Section 607 prohibits the use of funds by GSA to reorganize 
its organizational structure except through an operating plan 
change.
    Section 608 includes a new provision as proposed by the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to 
merge the General Supply Fund and Information Technology Fund 
into a new Acquisition Services Fund.
    Section 609 includes a new provision naming the future 
Federal courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee.

                     Merit Systems Protection Board


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $35,244,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      36,531,000
House allowance.........................................      36,531,000
Committee recommendation................................      36,550,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Merit System Protection Board [MSPB] was established by 
the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. MSPB is an independent 
quasi-judicial agency manifested to protect Federal merits 
systems against partisan political and other prohibited 
personnel practices and to ensure adequate protection for 
employees against abuses by agency management.
    MSPB assists Federal agencies in running a merit-based 
civil service system. This is accomplished on a case-by-case 
basis through hearing and deciding employee appeals, and on a 
systemic basis by reviewing significant actions and regulations 
of the Office of Personnel Management [OPM] and conducting 
studies of the civil service and other merit systems. The 
intended results of MSPB's efforts are to assure that personnel 
actions taken against employees are processed within the law, 
and that actions taken by OPM and other agencies support and 
enhance Federal merit principles.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $36,550,000 
for the Merit Systems Protection Board, this is an increase of 
$1,326,000 above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and $19,000 
above the President's request. The Committee makes available no 
more than $2,605,000 for adjudicated appeals through an 
appropriation from the trust fund consistent with past 
practice, allowing for appropriate funding for MSPB to continue 
as arbitrator for the additional appeals cases from the

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution is 
a Federal program established by Public Law 105-156 to assist 
parties in resolving environmental, natural resource, and 
public lands conflicts. The Institute is part of the Morris K. 
Udall Foundation, and serves as an impartial, non-partisan 
institution providing professional expertise, services, and 
resources to all parties involved in such disputes. The 
Institute helps parties determine whether collaborative problem 
solving is appropriate for specific environmental conflicts, 
how and when to bring all the parties together for discussion, 
and whether a third-party facilitator or mediator might be 
helpful in assisting the parties in their efforts to each 
consensus or to resolve the conflict. In addition, the 
Institute maintains a roster of qualified facilitators and 
mediators with substantial experience in environmental conflict 
resolution, and can help parties in selecting an appropriate 
neutral.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $2,000,000 for 
the Morris K. Udall Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund. This 
amount is the fiscal year 2006 enacted level and $1,307,000 
above the administration's request.

              National Archives and Records Administration

    The National Archives and Records Administration [NARA] is 
the national recordkeeper. NARA is an independent agency 
created by statute in 1934 to safeguard the records of all 
three branches of the Federal Government. NARA administers the 
Information Security Oversight Office [ISOO], is the publisher 
of the Federal Register and makes grants for historical 
documentation through the National Historical Publications and 
Records Commission [NHPRC].

                           OPERATING EXPENSES

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $280,215,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     289,605,000
House allowance.........................................     281,605,000
Committee recommendation................................     285,915,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides for basic operations dealing with 
management of the Federal Government's archives and records, 
operation of Presidential Libraries, and for the review for 
declassification of classified security information.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $285,915,000 for operating 
expenses of the National Archives and Records Administration 
for fiscal year 2007. This amount is $3,690,000 below the 
budget request and $5,700,000 above the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level.
    The Committee's recommendation includes additional funds to 
maintain current service levels, to support the Public Interest 
Declassification Board, to prepare for the new George W. Bush 
Presidential Library, and to relocate the Southwest and Central 
Plains Regional Archives facilities. The Committee has denied 
additional operating expense funds for the Nixon Presidential 
Library due to other higher priorities and budget constraints.

                      ELECTRONIC RECORDS ARCHIVES

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $37,535,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      45,455,000
House allowance.........................................      45,455,000
Committee recommendation................................      48,810,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    National Archives and Records Administration [NARA] is 
developing an Electronic Records Archives [ERA] that will 
ensure the preservation of and access to Government electronic 
records. With the rapid changes in technology today, the 
formats in which records are stored become obsolete within a 
few years, making records inaccessible even if they are 
preserved intact with the most modern technology. ERA will 
preserve electronic records generated in a manner that enables 
requesters to access them on computer systems now and in the 
future.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $48,810,000 for the Electronics 
Records Archives project. This amount is an increase of 
$3,355,000 above the budget request and $11,275,000 above the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level. Bill language is included 
requiring NARA to submit a spend plan for these funds. The 
Committee has included an additional $3,355,000 to support 
NARA's work with the Naval Oceanographic Office at the National 
Center for Critical Information Processing and Storage at the 
Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.
    The Committee strongly supports the Electronic Record 
Archives [ERA] program at the National Archives Records 
Administration. The Committee is concerned that the amount 
requested in the President's budget may not be adequate to meet 
current program requirements for the development of systems to 
interface with agencies, receive all documents, and conduct all 
necessary training programs, and that some of these activities 
may be delayed. The Committee is committed to working next year 
to ensure that this program is adequately funded on an 
expedited basis so ERA can preserve the nation's important 
records at the earliest feasible date.

                        REPAIRS AND RESTORATION

Appropriations, 2006....................................      $9,585,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      13,020,000
House allowance.........................................      13,020,000
Committee recommendation................................      18,790,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This account provides for the repair, alteration, and 
improvement of Archives facilities and Presidential Libraries 
nationwide, and provides adequate storage for holdings. It will 
better enable NARA to maintain its facilities in proper 
condition for public visitors, researchers, and NARA employees, 
and also maintain the structural integrity of the buildings.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $18,790,000 for the repairs and 
restoration account. This amount is $9,205,000 above the fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level and $5,770,000 above the budget 
request.
    The Committee recommends funds to be distributed as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             Committee
                                                          recommendation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ongoing repairs and restoration.........................      $6,120,000
LBJ Presidential Library................................       3,760,000
Alaska Regional Archives and Records Center.............       2,500,000
JFK Presidential Library................................       6,410,000
                                                         ---------------
      Total.............................................      18,790,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Committee has prioritized funding under this account to 
projects that have already begun construction. The most notable 
project is the Lyndon Baines Johnson [LBJ] Presidential Library 
project that is currently undergoing construction but currently 
needs $3,760,000 to complete the project. Accordingly, the 
Committee has given top priority to the LBJ project by 
providing $3,760,000. Further, the Committee recognizes that 
construction funds have already been provided to the new Alaska 
regional archives and records center. This project has 
completed its planning and design and site selection phases and 
is prepared for construction. Therefore, the Committee also has 
made this a priority and appropriated $2,500,000 for this 
project. Last, since the JFK Presidential Library will complete 
the design phase by the end of fiscal year 2006, the Committee 
also directs NARA to provide $6,410,000 to the JFK Presidential 
Library.

        National Historical Publications and Records Commission


                             GRANTS PROGRAM

Committee recommendation................................       5,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The National Historical Publications and Records Commission 
[NHPRC] provides grants nationwide to preserve and publish 
records that document American history. Administered within the 
National Archives, which preserves Federal records, NHPRC helps 
State, local, and private institutions preserve non-Federal 
records, helps publish the papers of major figures in American 
history, and helps archivists and records managers improve 
their techniques, training, and ability to serve a range of 
information users.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for the National 
Historical Publications and Records Commission [NHPRC]. This 
amount is $2,425,000 below the fiscal year 2006 enacted level 
and $5,000,000 above the budget request.
    The Committee strongly supports the NHPRC program and has 
provided funding to continue this important program. This 
program has played a central role in the preservation and 
dissemination of the Nation's documentary heritage. Further, 
the program has been successful in leveraging private sector 
contributions.

                        ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION

    The Committee has included a new provision requiring NARA 
to develop a comprehensive capital needs assessment [CNA] for 
its entire infrastructure of Presidential libraries and records 
facilities. The provision requires NARA to submit the CNA as 
part of its fiscal year 2008 budget submission. The Committee 
strongly believes that a rationale approach through a CNA is 
needed for NARA due to the uneven funding priorities submitted 
by the administration. The Committee believes that NARA can 
benefit from this approach, which has been used by other 
Federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and 
the National Science Foundation.

                          program description

    The National Credit Union Administration [NCUA] Central 
Liquidity Facility [CLF] was created by the National Credit 
Union Central Liquidity Facility Act (Public Law 95-630). The 
CLF is a mixed-ownership Government corporation managed by the 
National Credit Union Administration Board and owned by its 
member credit unions.
    The purpose of the CLF is to improve the general financial 
stability of credit unions by meeting their seasonal and 
emergency liquidity needs and thereby encourage savings, 
support consumer and mortgage lending, and provide basic 
financial resources to all segments of the economy. To become 
eligible for CLF services, credit unions invest in the capital 
stock of the CLF, and the facility uses the proceeds of such 
investments and the proceeds of borrowed funds to meet the 
liquidity needs of credit unions. The primary sources of funds 
for the CLF are stock subscriptions from credit unions and 
borrowings.
    The CLF may borrow funds from any source, with the amount 
of borrowing limited to 12 times the amount of subscribed 
capital stock and surplus.
    Loans are available to meet short-term requirements for 
funds attributable to emergency outflows from managerial 
difficulties or local economic downturns. Seasonal credit is 
also provided to accommodate fluctuations caused by cyclical 
changes in such areas as agriculture, education, and retail 
business. Loans can also be made to offset protracted credit 
problems caused by factors such as regional economic decline.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee recommends the budget request of limiting 
administrative expenses for the Central Liquidity Fund [CLF] to 
$331,000 in fiscal year 2007. The Committee recommends a 
limitation of $1,500,000,000 for the principal amount of new 
direct loans to member credit unions. These amounts are the 
same as the budget request.
    The Committee directs the National Credit Union 
Administration [NCUA] to continue to provide reports on the 
lending activities under CLF. This information should be 
provided to the Committee on a quarterly basis through 
September 2007.

               COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT REVOLVING LOAN FUND

Appropriations, 2006....................................        $941,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................         941,000
House allowance.........................................         941,000
Committee recommendation................................         941,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Community Development Revolving Loan Fund Program 
[CDRLF] was established in 1979 to assist officially designated 
``low-income'' credit unions in providing basic financial 
services to low-income communities. Low-interest loans and 
deposits are made available to assist these credit unions. 
Loans or deposits are normally repaid in 5 years, although 
shorter repayment periods may be considered. Technical 
assistance grants [TAGs] are also available to low-income 
credit unions. Until fiscal year 2001, only earnings generated 
from the CDRLF were available to fund TAGs. Grants are 
available for improving operations as well as addressing safety 
and soundness issues. In fiscal year 2004, NCUA designated 
funds for specific programs, including taxpayer assistance, 
financial education, home ownership initiatives, remittance 
services, individual development accounts [IDAs], and training 
assistance.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $941,000 for technical assistance 
grants to community development credit unions. This funding 
level is equal to the budget request and is the same as the 
fiscal year 2006 enacted level. The Committee expects the CDRLF 
to continue making loans from their available funds derived 
from repaid loans and interest earned on previous loans to 
designated credit unions.
    The Committee supports NCUA's outreach efforts to 
undeserved rural and urban communities across America through 
technical assistance grants provided within CDRLF. The 
Committee encourages NCUA to continue their efforts in 
providing an alternative to predatory lending services through 
their targeted technical assistance grants and support.

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $75,933,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      79,594,000
House allowance.........................................      81,594,000
Committee recommendation................................      79,594,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Initially established along with the Department of 
Transportation [DOT], the National Transportation Safety Board 
[NTSB] commenced operations on April 1, 1967, as an independent 
Federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every 
civil aviation accident in the United States as well as 
significant accidents in the other modes of transportation--
railroad, highway, marine and pipeline--and issuing safety 
recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents. Although 
it has always operated independently, NTSB relied on DOT for 
funding and administrative support until the Independent Safety 
Board Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-633) severed all ties between 
the two organizations starting in 1975.
    In addition to its investigatory duties, NTSB is 
responsible for maintaining the Government's database of civil 
aviation accidents and also conducts special studies of 
transportation safety issues of national significance. 
Furthermore, in accordance with the provisions of international 
treaties, NTSB supplies investigators to serve as U.S. 
Accredited Representatives for aviation accidents overseas 
involving U.S-registered aircraft, or involving aircraft or 
major components of U.S. manufacture. NTSB also serves as the 
``court of appeals'' for any airman, mechanic or mariner 
whenever certificate action is taken by the Federal Aviation 
Administration [FAA] or the U.S. Coast Guard Commandant, or 
when civil penalties are assessed by FAA.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $79,594,000 for the National 
Transportation Safety Board, which is the same as the budget 
request and is $3,661,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level.
    The Committee notes the NTSB's efforts to return its focus 
on the agency's core mission of investigating and identifying 
the probable causes of transportation crashes and incidents. 
The Committee hopes that the NTSB will continue this trend in 
order to improve its performance on completing accident 
investigations and reports in a timely manner. The Committee 
also notes recent steps the NTSB has taken to manage its 
resources more effectively, such as targeting its Academy on 
training the NTSB's own staff and renting out the Academy's 
building when it is not otherwise being used. The Committee, 
however, believes that more can be done to ensure that revenue 
generated by the Academy will cover its costs instead of 
diverting resources from the core mission of the NTSB.

    The fiscal year 2004 Supplemental Appropriations bill 
(Public Law 106-246) provided NTSB with emergency expenses 
associated with its investigation of the Egypt Air Flight 990 
and Alaska Air Flight 261 accidents. These funds were used for 
wreckage location and recovery facilities, technical support, 
testing, and wreckage mock-up. All of these activities have 
been completed and an unobligated balance of $1,664,000 
remains. The Committee recommends the requested rescission of 
this amount.

Committee recommendation................................     119,790,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation was created by 
the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act (title VI of the 
Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, Public 
Law 95-557, October 31, 1978). Neighborhood Reinvestment 
Corporation now operates under the trade name ``NeighborWorks 
America.'' NeighborWorks America helps local communities 
establish efficient and effective partnerships between 
residents and representatives of the public and private 
sectors. These partnership-based organizations are independent, 
tax-exempt, nonprofit entities and are frequently known as 
Neighborhood Housing Services [NHS] or mutual housing 
associations.
    Collectively, these organizations are known as the 
NeighborWorks network. Nationally, 235 NeighborWorks 
organizations serve nearly 3,000 urban, suburban and rural 
communities in 49 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto 
Rico.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $119,790,000 for the Neighborhood 
Reinvestment Corporation for fiscal year 2007. This amount is 
the same as the budget request and $2,970,000 above the fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level.
    The Committee has included a set-aside of $5,000,000 for 
the multifamily rental housing initiative. This program has 
been successful in developing innovative approaches to 
producing mixed-income affordable housing throughout the 
Nation. The Committee strongly supports this initiative and 
commends Neighborhood Reinvestment for their efforts in 
attracting additional private sector investments for this 
initiative. The Committee directs NRC to provide a status 
report on this initiative in its fiscal year 2007 budget 
justifications.
    The Committee continues its support of Neighborhood 
Reinvestment efforts in building capacity in rural areas. The 
Committee urges the Corporation to continue its efforts in 
addressing the needs of rural communities.

Committee recommendation................................      11,489,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Office of Government Ethics [OGE], a separate agency 
within the executive branch, was established by the Ethics of 
Government Act of 1978. OGE is charged by law to provide 
overall direction of executive branch policies designed to 
prevent conflicts of interest and ensure high ethical 
standards. OGE carries out these responsibilities by developing 
regulations pertaining to conflicts of interest, postemployment 
restrictions, standards of conduct, and public and confidential 
financial disclosure in the executive branch; by monitoring 
compliance with financial disclosure requirements by 
recommending appropriate corrective action when necessary; by 
evaluating the effectiveness of applicable laws; and by 
preparing advisor opinions and policy of memoranda interpreting 
requirements regarding conflicts of interest, post employment, 
standards of conduct, and financial disclosure.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $11,489,000 
for salaries and expenses of the Office of Government Ethics in 
fiscal year 2007. This amount is the same as the President's 
budget request and $452,000 above the fiscal year 2006 level.

                     Office of Personnel Management


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $121,296,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................     111,095,000
House allowance.........................................     111,095,000
Committee recommendation................................     111,095,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Office of Personnel Management [OPM] was established by 
Public Law 95-454, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 
enacted on October 13, 1978. In that act, the Office of 
Personnel Management was established in section 1101 of title 
5, United States Code. Subsequent sections of chapter 11 
provide for the principal officials of the agency and the 
functions of the Director, which are really the functions of 
the Agency, as well as providing for the delegation of 
authority for personnel management from the President and, 
subsequently, by the Director.
    OPM is the Federal Government agency responsible for 
management of Federal human resources policy and oversight of 
the merit civil service system. Although individual agencies 
are increasingly responsible for personnel operations, OPM 
provides a Governmentwide policy framework for personnel 
matters, advises and assists agencies (often on a reimbursable 
basis), and ensures that agency operations are consistent with 
requirements of law on issues such as veterans preference. OPM 
oversees examining of applicants for employment, issues 
regulations and policies on hiring, classification and pay, 
training, investigations, other aspects of personnel 
management, and operates a reimbursable training program for 
the Federal Government's managers and executives. OPM is also 
responsible for administering the retirement, health benefits 
and life insurance programs affecting most Federal employees, 
retired Federal employees, and their survivors.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $111,095,000 
for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Personnel 
Management, which is the same as the budget request and 
$10,201,000 less than the fiscal year 2006 level. Of the amount 
provided no more than $8,349,000 is to be used for e-Government 
projects. This amount is the same as the President's request.
    The Committee is very concerned with the practices of the 
Office of Personnel Management regarding its approach to human 
resources products and services. Federal agencies need to have 
the flexibility to contract as they see fit, including 
contracting with private companies to provide online employment 
applications and processing services, as well as choice in 
selecting service providers and human resource systems. While 
the Committee understands the need for human resource standards 
in public and private contracts, the Committee expects OPM to 
allow Federal agencies to have choices in such decisions. The 
Committee directs OPM to report to the Committee within 120 
days of enactment of this act on their human resources products 
and services, including actions taken in response to these 
concerns.
    Child Care.--OPM and GSA, with technical assistance from 
GAO, are conducting a survey of the child care needs of 
executive, legislative and judicial branch employees. Within 45 
days of the completion and reporting of this survey, GAO should 
provide relevant recommendations for further action to the 
Committee. The Committee directs OPM to report on progress made 
in implementing any recommendations within 6 months after the 
release of the report mentioned above. OPM should include 
further measures that may be taken to address Federal child 
care needs.
    The Committee directs OPM to continue its efforts to 
provide information and education to agencies and employees on 
promotion of the subsidy for child care expenses for lower 
income employees.
    Retirement Systems Modernization.--The Committee supports 
the Retirement Systems Modernization project [RSM], an effort 
initiated in 1997 to automate and streamline the manual paper-
intensive business processes used to administer the Federal 
employee retirement program. Within 10 years, 60 percent of the 
Federal workforce is eligible for retirement, thus it is 
crucial that an efficient and effective system be in place for 
current and future retirees. Knowing the pitfalls that have 
occurred in other IT projects, the Committee is pleased with 
the personal attention and commitment of the Director to the 
success of this project. The Committee recognizes that the RSM 
has benefited from the involvement and expertise of the 
Government Accountability Office, as have other IT projects. 
The Committee continues to be concerned about difficulties OPM 
has encountered in this modernization effort in the past, and 
requests that GAO comprehensively review the progress, costs, 
and risks of the program. The Committee notes the importance of 
the recommendations made by GAO and urges the Director to 
continue to give them careful consideration and to maintain 
close consultation with GAO in the future.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Office of Inspector General is charged with 
establishing policies for conducting and coordinating efforts 
which promote economy, efficiency, and integrity in the Office 
of Personnel Management's activities which prevent and detect 
fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the agency's programs. 
Contract audits provide professional advice to agency 
contracting officials on accounting and financial matters 
regarding the negotiation, award, administration, repricing, 
and settlement of contracts. Internal agency audits review and 
evaluate all facets of agency operations, including financial 
statements. Evaluation and inspection services provide detailed 
technical evaluations of agency operations. Insurance audits 
review the operations of health and life insurance carriers, 
health care providers, and insurance subscribers. The 
investigative function provides for the detection and 
investigation of improper and illegal activities involving 
programs, personnel, and operations. Administrative sanctions 
debar from participation in the health insurance program those 
health care providers whose conduct may pose a threat to the 
financial integrity of the program itself or to the well-being 
of insurance program enrollees.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,598,000 for 
salaries and expenses of the Office of Inspector General in 
fiscal year 2007. This amount is the same as the President's 
request and $452,000 less than the fiscal year 2006 enacted 
level.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This appropriation covers the Government's share of the 
cost of health insurance for annuitants covered by the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Program and the Retired Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Act of 1960, as well as

Committee recommendation................................      39,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    Public Law 96-427, the Federal Employees' Group Life 
Insurance Act of 1980 requires that all employees under the age 
of 65 who separate from the Federal Government for purposes of 
retirement on or after January 1, 1990, continue to make 
contributions toward their basic life insurance coverage after 
retirement until they reach the age of 65. These retirees will 
contribute two-thirds of the cost of the basic life insurance 
premium, identical to the amount contributed by active Federal 
employees for basic life insurance coverage. As with the active 
Federal employees, the Government is required to contribute 
one-third of the cost of the premium for basic coverage. OPM, 
acting as the payroll office on behalf of Federal retirees, has 
requested, and the Committee has provided, the funding 
necessary to make the required Government contribution 
associated with annuitants' postretirement life insurance 
coverage.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $39,000,000 
for the Government payment for annuitants, employee life 
insurance. This amount equals the budget request.

        payment to civil service retirement and disability fund

Appropriations, 2006.................................... $10,072,000,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................  10,532,000,000
House allowance.........................................  10,532,000,000
Committee recommendation................................  10,532,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The civil service retirement and disability fund was 
established in 1920 to administer the financing and payment of 
annuities to retired Federal employees and their survivors. The 
fund covers the operation of the Civil Service Retirement 
System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System.
    This appropriation provides for the Government's share of 
retirement costs, transfers of interest on the unfunded 
liability and annuity disbursements attributable to military 
service, and survivor annuities to eligible former spouses of 
some annuitants who did not elect survivor coverage.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of 
$10,532,000,000 for payment to the civil service retirement and 
disability fund. The Committee recommendation equals the budget 
estimate.

                       Office of Special Counsel


                         salaries and expenses

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $15,172,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      15,937,000
House allowance.........................................      15,937,000
Committee recommendation................................      16,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The U.S. Office of Special Counsel [OSC] was first 
established on January 1, 1979. From 1979 until 1989, it 
operated as an autonomous investigative and prosecutorial arm 
of the Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board). In 1989, 
Congress enacted the Whistleblower Protection Act, which made 
OSC an independent agency within the Executive Branch. In 1994, 
the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act 
became law. It defined employment-related rights of persons in 
connection with military service, prohibited discrimination 
against them because of that service, and gave OSC new 
authority to pursue remedies for violations by Federal 
agencies.
    OSC investigates Federal employee allegations of prohibited 
personnel practices and, when appropriate, prosecutes cases 
before the Merit Systems Protection Board and enforces the 
Hatch Act. OSC also provides a channel for whistleblowing by 
Federal employees, and may transmit whistleblowing allegations 
to the agency head concerned and require an agency 
investigation and a report to Congress and the President when 
appropriate.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $16,000,000 
for the Office of Special Counsel. This amount is $63,000 above 
President's budget request and is $828,000 above the fiscal 
year 2006 enacted level.
    In the past, the Committee has been disappointed with the 
level of communication from OSC. The Committee is encouraged, 
however, by the recent level of communication and 
responsiveness from OSC. The Committee directs the Office of 
Special Counsel to submit its fiscal year 2008 budget 
justification on the first Monday in February, concurrent with 
the official submission of the President's budget to Congress. 
The justification should include highly detailed data and 
explanatory statements to support the appropriations requests, 
including tables that detail OSC's programs, activities and 
staffing levels for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The Committee 
expects that OSC will coordinate with the Committee on 
Appropriations well in advance on its planned budget submission 
in support of the fiscal year 2008 budget request.
    The Committee reiterates the recommendation that the 
Government Accountability Office [GAO] made in its March 2004 
report (GAO-04-36) and directs that OSC submit to Congress a 
comprehensive strategy addressing capital needs and case 
processing in order to prevent any future backlog of cases when 
submitting their fiscal year 2008 budget request. The Committee 
directs OSC to provide quarterly staffing reports from the 
Special Counsel to Congress.
    While the Committee has not included the breakdown of OSC 
funds by field office as contained in the fiscal year 2007 
budget justification, the Committee expects OSC to adhere to 
this structure. The Committee further directs OSC to 
communicate with the Committee 45 days in advance of any 
organizational change, if such a change would cause the 
geographic staffing numbers to vary above or below the 
following levels; Office of Special Counsel headquarters: 70 to 
75 FTEs, the Detroit office: 6 to 8 FTEs, the Dallas office: 9 
to 11 FTEs, the Bay Area office: 8 to 10 FTEs, and the District 
of Columbia field office: 9 to 12 FTEs. Thus the total number 
of FTEs for the Office of Special Counsel should not be below 
102 or above 116.

                        Selective Service System


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

Appropriations, 2006....................................     $24,750,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      24,225,000
House allowance.........................................      24,255,000
Committee recommendation................................      24,255,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Selective Service System [SSS] was reestablished by the 
Selective Service Act of 1948. The basic mission of the System 
is to be prepared to supply manpower to the Armed Forces 
adequate to ensure the security of the United States during a 
time of national emergency. Since 1973, the Armed Forces have 
relied on volunteers to fill military manpower requirements. 
However, the Selective Service System remains the primary 
vehicle by which personnel will be brought into the military if 
Congress and the President should authorize a return to the 
draft.
    In December 1987, Selective Service was tasked by law 
(Public Law 100-180, sec. 715) to develop plans for a 
postmobilization-health-care-personnel-delivery system capable 
of providing the necessary critically skilled health-care 
personnel to the Armed Forces in time of emergency. An 
automated system capable of handling mass registration and 
inductions is now complete, together with necessary draft 
legislation, a draft Presidential proclamation, prototype forms 
and letters, et cetera. These products will be available should 
the need arise. The development of supplemental standby 
products, such as a compliance system for health care 
personnel, continues using very limited existing resources.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $24,255,000 
for the Selective Service System. This amount is the same as 
the budget request and $495,000 below the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level. The Committee also prohibits the use of any 
funds to support the Corporation for National and Community 
Service.

           United States Interagency Council on Homelessness


                           OPERATING EXPENSES

Appropriations, 2006....................................      $1,782,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................       2,000,000
House allowance.........................................       2,000,000
Committee recommendation................................       2,000,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness is an 
independent agency created by the McKinney-Vento Homeless 
Assistance Act of 1987 to coordinate and direct the multiple 
efforts of Federal agencies and other designated groups. The 
Council was authorized to review Federal programs that assist 
homeless persons and to take necessary actions to reduce 
duplication. The Council can recommend improvements in programs 
and activities conducted by Federal, State and local government 
as well as local volunteer organizations. The Council consists 
of the heads of 18 Federal agencies such as the Departments of 
Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, 
Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, 
Labor, and Transportation; and other entities as deemed 
appropriate.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends $2,000,000 for the United States 
Interagency Council on Homelessness [ICH], the same level as 
the budget request and $218,000 more than the fiscal year 2006 
enacted level. These funds are for carrying out the functions 
authorized under section 203 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless 
Assistance Act. Bill language is included that extends the 
reauthorization for the ICH until October 1, 2007.
    The Committee continues to support strongly the mission of 
ICH and its efforts in ending homelessness. The Committee 
continues to believe that a comprehensive and coordinated 
strategy must be made by the Federal, State, and local 
governments to end and prevent homelessness in this Nation. ICH 
has been successful working with State and local officials in 
developing 10-year plans to end homelessness, however, it is 
unclear whether all Federal agencies are fully participating in 
this effort. Accordingly, the Committee directs the ICH to 
submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations on the efforts of every Federal agency member of 
the ICH in ending and preventing homelessness. This report 
should be submitted by no later than 90 days after the date of 
enactment of this act.
    The Committee commends the Council's efforts in engaging 
communities on the issue of homelessness. These efforts have 
led to the establishment of 10-year plans to end homelessness 
throughout the Nation. While the Committee understands that 
engaging local and State communities are a critical part of 
ending homelessness, coordination and commitment among the 
relevant Federal agencies must be made. As required under the 
McKinney-Vento Homelessness Act, the ICH convenes workshops on 
various aspects of homelessness. One of those areas of interest 
to the Committee is homelessness among children, youth, and 
families. Accordingly, the Committee directs the ICH to convene 
one of its workshops on this issue. This workshop should 
include representatives from those Federal agencies and 
programs serving homeless children, youth, and families. The 
workshop should focus on: (1) identifying how such agencies and 
programs may improve coordination; (2) developing promising 
practices in service delivery, program development, and 
leveraging resources in urban, suburban, and rural areas; and 
(3) collecting information on the nature, extent, and impact of 
homelessness on children, youth, and families, and the Federal 
efforts to serve and meet their needs. The Council is further 
directed to report to the Committee on a quarterly basis on 
steps being taken by the agencies and the Council as a result 
of the workshop.

                      United States Postal Service


                   PAYMENT TO THE POSTAL SERVICE FUND

Appropriations, 2006....................................    $115,917,000
Budget estimate, 2007...................................      79,915,000
House allowance.........................................     108,915,000
Committee recommendation................................     108,915,000

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The Post Office dates back to 1775. It became the Postal 
Service in 1971 as an independent establishment of the 
executive branch of the United States Government. The Postal 
Service basic function and obligation is to provide postal 
services to bind the Nation together through the personal, 
educational, literary, and business correspondence of the 
people. It shall provide prompt, reliable and efficient 
services to patrons in all areas and shall render postal 
services to all communities.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends a total of $108,915,000 in fiscal 
year 2007 funding and advanced appropriations for payments to 
the Postal Service Fund. The increase of $29,000,000 above the 
President's request is to provide funds for overseas voting for 
prior years' liability under the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 
1993.
    This amount includes: $60,725,000 requested for free mail 
for the blind and overseas voting; $19,190,000 as a 
reconciliation adjustment for 2004 actual mail volume of free 
mail for the blind and overseas voting; and $29,000,000 for 
prior years' liability under the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 
1993. In addition to these funds, $73,000,000 (an advance 
appropriation from 2005 for the 2005 costs and the 2002 
reconciliation adjustment for free mail for the blind and 
overseas voting) will become available to the U.S. Postal 
Service in fiscal year 2006.
    Revenue forgone on free and reduced-rate mail enables 
postage rates to be set at levels below the unsubsidized rates 
for certain categories of mail as authorized by subsections (c) 
and (d) of section 2401 of title 39, United States Code. Free 
mail for the blind and overseas voters will continue to be 
provided at the funding level recommended by the Committee.
    The Committee includes provisions in the bill that would 
assure that mail for overseas voting and mail for the blind 
shall continue to be free; that 6-day delivery and rural 
delivery of mail shall continue without reduction; and that 
none of the funds provided be used to consolidate or close 
small rural and other small post offices in fiscal year 2007. 
These are services that must be maintained in fiscal year 2007 
and beyond.
    The Committee believes that 6-day mail delivery is one of 
the most important services provided by the Federal Government 
to its citizens. Especially in rural and small town America, 
this critical postal service is the linchpin that serves to 
bind the Nation together.
    Emergency Preparedness.--The Committee remains interested 
and concerned about the progress of the Postal Service's 
biohazardous detection system, particularly the ability to 
detect more than one agent. The Postal Service shall continue 
to update the Committee on the progress of this effort as well 
as the effort to construct the Washington, DC mail irradiation 
facility.
    Consolidation of Mail Processing Facilities.--The Postal 
Service is developing and implementing a major realignment of 
its postal facilities and streamlining its transportation 
networks to achieve greater efficiencies, reduce redundancies, 
and achieve cost savings. To date, the Service has announced 
that it is studying the feasibility of consolidating about 50 
of its over 400 mail processing facilities. The Service expects 
to continue its consolidation feasibility study and review 
processes through 2007 and beyond. Many questions remain about 
how the Service plans to realign its postal networks and 
workforce. These include how many facilities will be needed, 
which facilities will be closed, and what roles various 
facilities will serve. Additionally, it is uncertain how the 
postal workforce, mailers, and communities will be impacted by 
the Service's realignment decisions. Finally, it is unknown how 
long it will take to complete the realignment. These questions 
should be answered prior to the continuation of these efforts.
    In April 2005, GAO issued a report entitled, U.S. Postal 
Service: The Service's Strategy for Realigning Its Mail 
Processing Infrastructure Lacks Clarity, Criteria, and 
Accountability (GAO-05-261). The report concluded that the 
Service's realignment strategy lacked sufficient transparency 
and accountability as well as criteria to ensure that the 
decisions made are clear, consistent, and fair. The decisions 
also excluded stakeholder input and lacked performance measures 
to evaluate the results and provide accountability for 
realignment decisions. GAO's report recommended that the 
Service take actions to address these deficiencies by 
establishing a set of criteria to be used for making 
realignment decisions, developing a mechanism for communicating 
with stakeholders regarding realignment proposals and 
decisions. The report further suggested the development of a 
process for measuring and evaluating the results in areas such 
as cost savings, achieved efficiency, and impact on postal 
services. GAO has received several congressional requests to 
follow up on its recommendations, determining what progress the 
Service has made. A review in this area has recently been 
initiated.
    The Committee directs that consolidation decisions 
pertaining to Sioux City, Iowa, Aberdeen, South Dakota, and 
Yakima, Washington, will not be implemented until the Postal 
Service receives the GAO's follow-up report to its April 2005 
study, which is underway. The Postal Service shall establish 
detailed criteria for the decisionmaking process prior to the 
implementation of any contested consolidations. The Postal 
Service shall keep the Committee informed of its consolidation 
plans and further directs GAO to continue the monitoring these 
efforts.
    Forever Stamp.--The Committee commends the Postal Service 
on its plan to create a ``Forever Stamp,'' which would remain 
valid for letter postage even after future rate changes. This 
innovation would make postal rate changes far easier for 
household mailers, who are the main users of adhesive postage 
stamps. Consumers would avoid both the inconvenience of 
obsolete, leftover stamps and the need for last-minute trips to 
the post office to buy makeup stamps. The Committee commends 
the Postal Service for its efforts to develop innovative 
proposals such as the ``Forever Stamp,'' and trusts that the 
Postal Service will continue to find new ways to make the mail 
a more attractive and user-friendly communications medium for 
the American household.

                          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The U.S. Tax Court is an independent judicial body in the 
legislative branch established under article I of the 
Constitution of the United States. The court is composed of a 
chief judge and 18 judges. Decisions by the court are 
reviewable by the U.S. Courts of Appeals and, if certiorari is 
granted, by the Supreme Court.
    In their judicial duties the judges are assisted by senior 
judges, who participate in the adjudication of regular cases, 
and by special trial judges, who hear small tax cases and 
certain regular cases assigned to them by the chief judge.
    The court conducts trial sessions throughout the United 
States, including Hawaii and Alaska. The matters over which the 
Court has jurisdiction are set forth in various sections of 
title 26 of the United States Code.

                        COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $47,110,000 
for the U.S. Tax Court.

                STATEMENT CONCERNING GENERAL PROVISIONS

    The Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and 
Urban Development, and Related Agencies appropriation bill 
includes general provisions which govern both the activities of 
the agencies covered by the bill, and, in some cases, 
activities of agencies, programs, and general government 
activities that are not covered by the bill. General provisions 
that are governmentwide in scope are contained in title VIII of

                    A housing assistance payment contract 
                pursuant to this paragraph shall establish 
                rents for each unit assisted in an amount that 
                does not exceed 110 percent of the applicable 
                fair market rental (or any exception payment 
                standard approved by the Secretary pursuant to 
                paragraph (1)(D)), except that if a contract 
                covers a dwelling unit that has been allocated 
                low-income housing tax credits pursuant to 
                section 42 of title 26 and is not located in a 
                qualified census tract (as such term is defined 
                in subsection (d) of such section 42), the rent 
                for such unit may be established at any level 
                that does not exceed the rent charged for 
                comparable units in the building that also 
                receive the low-income housing tax credit but 
                do not have additional rental assistance, 
                except that in the case of a contract unit that 
                has been allocated low-income housing tax 
                credits and for which the rent limitation 
                pursuant to such section 42 is less than the 
                amount that would otherwise be permitted under 
                this subparagraph, the rent for such unit may, 
                in the sole discretion of a public housing 
                agency, be established at the higher section 8 
                rent, subject only to paragraph (10)(A). The 
                rents established by housing assistance payment 
                contracts pursuant to this paragraph may vary 
                from the payment standards established by the

                        assisted shall be reasonable in 
                        comparison with rents charged for 
                        comparable dwelling units in the 
                        private, unassisted, local market and 
                        may not exceed the maximum rent 
                        permitted under subparagraph (H), 
                        except that the contract may provide 
                        that the maximum rent permitted for a 
                        dwelling unit shall not be less than

                        under the initial housing assistance
