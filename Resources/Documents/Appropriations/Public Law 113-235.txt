 TITLE <<NOTE: Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 
 2014.>>  VII--REVITALIZE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND INNOVATION ACT OF 
2014
SEC. 701. <<NOTE: 15 USC 271 note.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Revitalize American Manufacturing 
and Innovation Act of 2014''.
SEC. 702. <<NOTE: 15 USC 2785.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2012, manufacturers contributed $2.03 trillion to the 
        economy, or \1/8\ of United States Gross Domestic Product.
            (2) For every $1.00 spent in manufacturing, another $1.32 is 
        added to the economy, the highest multiplier effect of any 
        economic sector.
            (3) Manufacturing supports an estimated 17,400,000 jobs in 
        the United States--about 1 in 6 private-sector jobs. More than 
        12,000,000 Americans (or 9 percent of the workforce) are 
        employed directly in manufacturing.
            (4) In 2012, the average manufacturing worker in the United 
        States earned $77,505 annually, including pay and benefits. The 
        average worker in all industries earned $62,063.
            (5) Taken alone, manufacturing in the United States would be 
        the 8th largest economy in the world.

[[Page 128 STAT. 2221]]

            (6) Manufacturers in the United States perform two-thirds of 
        all private-sector research and development in the United 
        States, driving more innovation than any other sector.

271 et seq.) is amended--
            (1) <<NOTE: 15 USC 271 note.>>  by redesignating section 34 
        as section 35; and

document is to be used. Such form or agreement shall, at a minimum, 
require that the person will not disclose any classified information

                providing substantial reimbursement of such taxes; or
                    (B) the foreign policy interests of the United 
                States outweigh the purpose of this section to ensure

                taxation.
            (2) The Secretary of State shall consult with the Committees

        States foreign assistance for such country generally, or an 
        individual agreement between the Government of the United States 
        and such government that describes, among other things, the

        States assistance provided under that agreement;
            (2) the term ``taxes and taxation'' shall include value

such designated funds can be obligated during the original period of 
availability:  Provided, That such designated funds that continue to be 
available for an additional fiscal year shall be obligated only for the 
purpose of such designation.

        referred to in the previous two provisos throughout the calendar 
        year to prevent the termination of rental assistance for

        the Secretary, and to avoid or reduce the proration of renewal 
        funding allocations:  Provided further, That up to $120,000,000

        allocation, and for additional leasing of vouchers that were 
        issued but not leased prior to the end of such calendar year; 
        and (5) for public housing agencies that despite taking 
        reasonable cost savings measures, as determined by the 
        Secretary, would otherwise be required to terminate rental

                Secretary and provided there is no increase in the 
                project-based assistance budget authority.
            (2) The transferring project shall, as determined by the 
        Secretary, be either physically obsolete or economically

        projects.

determines, in consultation with the tenants and the local government, 
that such a multifamily property owned or held by the Secretary is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, 
State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 524

(``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be remedied in 
a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in consultation with the 
tenants of that property, contract for project-based rental assistance 
payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties, 
or provide other rental assistance. The Secretary shall also take 
appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts remain in 
effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual 
abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major 
threats to health and safety after written notice to and informed 
consent of the affected tenants and use of other available remedies,

requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.

U.S.C. 1437g(d) and (e)), the Secretary shall not impose any requirement 
or guideline relating to asset management that restricts or limits

[[Page 128 STAT. 2754]]

in any way the use of capital funds for central office costs pursuant to 
section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 
U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)):  Provided, That a public housing agency may 
not use capital funds authorized under section 9(d) for activities that 
are eligible under section 9(e) for assistance with amounts from the 
operating fund in excess of the amounts permitted under section 9(g)(1) 
or 9(g)(2).

    Sec. 220.  No official or employee of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development shall be designated as an allotment holder unless the 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer has determined that such allotment 
holder has implemented an adequate system of funds control and has

Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a trained allotment holder 
for each HUD sub-office under the accounts ``Executive Offices'' and

    Sec. 226. (a) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall 
take the required actions under subsection (b) when a multifamily 
housing project with a section 8 contract or contract for similar 
project-based assistance:
            (1) receives a Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) score of

                    (B) receives consecutive scores of less than 60 on 
                REAC inspections.

Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured projects with 
assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but do not apply to such units 
assisted under section 8(o)(13) (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public

    (b) The Secretary shall take the following required actions as 
authorized under subsection (a)--
            (1) The Secretary shall notify the owner and provide an 
        opportunity for response within 30 days. If the violations 
        remain, the Secretary shall develop a Compliance, Disposition

        for correcting all deficiencies. The Secretary shall provide 
        notice of the Plan to the owner, tenants, the local government, 
        any mortgagees, and any contract administrator.
            (2) At the end of the term of the Compliance, Disposition

                repairs and to accept renewal of the assistance contract 
                as long as such renewal is offered; or
                    (D) seek judicial appointment of a receiver to 
                manage the property and cure all project deficiencies or

project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the exercise of 
contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for 
imminent major threats to health and safety after written notice to and 
informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other remedies set 
forth above. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation 
with the tenants and the local government, that the property is not

Provided, That in addition, $50,000,000 shall be made available until 
expended to the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for mortgage 
foreclosure mitigation activities, under the following terms and 
conditions:
            (1) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (``NRC'') 
        shall make grants to counseling intermediaries approved by the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (with match to 
        be determined by the NRC based on affordability and the economic 
        conditions of an area; a match also may be waived by the NRC 
        based on the aforementioned conditions) to provide mortgage 
        foreclosure mitigation assistance primarily to States and areas 
        with high rates of defaults and foreclosures to help eliminate 
        the default and foreclosure of mortgages of owner-occupied 
        single-family homes that are at risk of such foreclosure. Other 
        than areas with high rates of defaults and foreclosures, grants 
        may also be provided to approved counseling intermediaries based 
        on a geographic analysis of the Nation by the NRC which 
        determines where there is a prevalence of mortgages that are 
        risky and likely to fail, including any trends for mortgages 
        that are likely to default and face foreclosure. A State Housing 
        Finance Agency may also be eligible where the State Housing 
        Finance Agency meets all the requirements under this paragraph. 
        A HUD-approved counseling intermediary shall meet certain 
        mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance counseling 
        requirements, as determined by the NRC, and shall be approved by 
        HUD or the NRC as meeting these requirements.
            (2) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance shall only be 
        made available to homeowners of owner-occupied homes with 
        mortgages in default or in danger of default. These mortgages 
        shall likely be subject to a foreclosure action and homeowners 
        will be provided such assistance that shall consist of 
        activities that are likely to prevent foreclosures and result in 
        the long-term affordability of the mortgage retained pursuant to 
        such activity or another positive outcome for the homeowner.

[[Page 128 STAT. 2762]]

        No funds made available under this paragraph may be provided 
        directly to lenders or homeowners to discharge outstanding 
        mortgage balances or for any other direct debt reduction 
        payments.
            (3) The use of mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance by 
        approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing Finance 
        Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the borrower's 
        financial situation, an evaluation of the current value of the 
        property that is subject to the mortgage, counseling regarding 
        the assumption of the mortgage by another non-Federal party, 
        counseling regarding the possible purchase of the mortgage by a 
        non-Federal third party, counseling and advice of all likely 
        restructuring and refinancing strategies or the approval of a 
        work-out strategy by all interested parties.
            (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds 
        under this paragraph to its own charter members with expertise 
        in foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a certification 
        by the NRC that the procedures for selection do not consist of 
        any procedures or activities that could be construed as a 
        conflict of interest or have the appearance of impropriety.
            (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing 
        Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall have 
        demonstrated experience in successfully working with financial 
        institutions as well as borrowers facing default, delinquency 
        and foreclosure as well as documented counseling capacity, 
        outreach capacity, past successful performance and positive 
        outcomes with documented counseling plans (including post 
        mortgage foreclosure mitigation counseling), loan workout 
        agreements and loan modification agreements. NRC may use other 
        criteria to demonstrate capacity in underserved areas.
            (6) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to $2,500,000 may be made available to build the mortgage 
        foreclosure and default mitigation counseling capacity of 
        counseling intermediaries through NRC training courses with HUD-
        approved counseling intermediaries and their partners, except 
        that private financial institutions that participate in NRC 
        training shall pay market rates for such training.
            (7) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to 5 percent may be used for associated administrative 
        expenses for the NRC to carry out activities provided under this 
        section.
            (8) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to $4,000,000 may be used for wind-down and closeout of the 
        mortgage foreclosure mitigation activities program.
            (9) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance grants may 
        include a budget for outreach and advertising, and training, as 
        determined by the NRC.
            (10) The NRC shall continue to report bi-annually to the 
        House and Senate Committees on Appropriations as well as the 
        Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee 
        on its efforts to mitigate mortgage default.

[[Page 128 STAT. 2768]]

        be encouraged; and
            (3) in implementing the health insurance provider fee under 
        section 9010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
        (Public Law 111-148; 26 U.S.C. 4001 note prec.) and other

        Law 111-152), the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Health 
        and Human Services, and Secretary of Labor should continue to

        plans and the competitive pressures of such plans and companies.

            (1) expatriate health plans;
            (2) employers with respect to such plans, solely in their 
        capacity as plan sponsors for such plans; or

        coverage offered by such issuers under such plans.

    (b) Minimum Essential Coverage and Reporting Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--For the purpose of section 5000A(f) of the

        of minimum essential coverage under such section 5000A(f) by 
        reference:
                    (A) An expatriate health plan offered to primary 
                enrollees who are described in subsections (d)(3)(A) and 
                (d)(3)(B) of this section shall be treated as an 
                eligible employer sponsored plan under 5000A(f)(2) of 
                such Code.
                    (B) An expatriate health plan offered to primary 
                enrollees who are described in subsection (d)(3)(C) of 
                this section shall be treated as a plan in the

                such section with respect to such issuer for each such 
                year, less the amount of premiums for expatriate health 
                plans taken into account under such section with respect

                    (A) Substantially all of the primary enrollees in 
                such plan or coverage are qualified expatriates with 
                respect to such plan or coverage. In applying the 
                previous sentence, an individual shall not be considered 
                a primary enrollee if the individual is not a national

                5, United States Code for plan year 2009)--

                      paragraph (3)(A), both in the United States and in 
                      the country or countries from which the individual

                      flexibility needed with existing coverage), and 
                      such other country or countries as the Secretary 
                      of Health and Human Services, in consultation with

                      paragraph (3)(B), in the country or countries in 
                      which the individual is present in connection with 
                      the individual's employment, and such other 
                      country or countries as the Secretary of Health 
                      and Human Services, in consultation with the

                dependent coverage available for adult children until 
                the adult child turns 26 years of age, unless such 
                individual is the child of a child receiving dependent 
                coverage.

SEC. 122. PARTITIONS OF ELIGIBLE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) In general.--Section 4233 of the Employee Retirement 
        Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1413) is amended to read 
        as follows:
``SEC. 4233. PARTITIONS OF ELIGIBLE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS.

    ``(a)(1) Upon the application by the plan sponsor of an eligible 
multiemployer plan for a partition of the plan, the corporation may 
order a partition of the plan in accordance with this section. The 
corporation shall make a determination regarding the application not 
later than 270 days after the date such application was filed (or, if 
later, the date such application was completed) in accordance with 
regulations promulgated by the corporation.
    ``(2) Not later than 30 days after submitting an application for 
partition of a plan under paragraph (1), the plan sponsor of the plan 
shall notify the participants and beneficiaries of such application, in 
the form and manner prescribed by regulations issued by the corporation.
    ``(b) For purposes of this section, a multiemployer plan is an 
eligible multiemployer plan if--
            ``(1) the plan is in critical and declining status (as 
        defined in section 305(b)(4));
            ``(2) the corporation determines, after consultation with 
        the Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate selected under section 
        4004, that the plan sponsor has taken (or is taking concurrently 
        with an application for partition) all reasonable measures to 
        avoid insolvency, including the maximum benefit suspensions 
        under section 305(e)(9), if applicable;
            ``(3) the corporation reasonably expects that--
                    ``(A) a partition of the plan will reduce the 
                corporation's expected long-term loss with respect to 
                the plan; and
                    ``(B) a partition of the plan is necessary for the 
                plan to remain solvent;
            ``(4) the corporation certifies to Congress that its ability 
        to meet existing financial assistance obligations to other plans 
        (including any liabilities associated with multiemployer plans 
        that are insolvent or that are projected to become insolvent 
        within 10 years) will not be impaired by such partition; and
            ``(5) the cost to the corporation arising from such 
        partition is paid exclusively from the fund for basic benefits 
        guaranteed for multiemployer plans.

    ``(c) The corporation's partition order shall provide for a transfer 
to the plan referenced in subsection (d)(1) of the minimum amount of the 
plan's liabilities necessary for the plan to remain solvent.
    ``(d)(1) The plan created by the partition order is a successor plan 
to which section 4022A applies.
    ``(2) The plan sponsor of an eligible multiemployer plan prior to 
the partition and the administrator of such plan shall be the plan 
sponsor and the administrator, respectively, of the plan created by the 
partition order.
    ``(3) In the event an employer withdraws from the plan that was 
partitioned within ten years following the date of the partition order, 
withdrawal liability shall be computed under section 4201 with respect 
to both the plan that was partitioned and the plan created by the 
partition order. If the withdrawal occurs more than ten years after the 
date of the partition order, withdrawal liability

[[Page 128 STAT. 2796]]

shall be computed under section 4201 only with respect to the plan that 
was partitioned (and not with respect to the plan created by the 
partition order).
    ``(e)(1) For each participant or beneficiary of the plan whose 
benefit was transferred to the plan created by the partition order 
pursuant to a partition, the plan that was partitioned shall pay a 
monthly benefit to such participant or beneficiary for each month in 
which such benefit is in pay status following the effective date of such 
partition in an amount equal to the excess of--
            ``(A) the monthly benefit that would be paid to such 
        participant or beneficiary for such month under the terms of the 
        plan (taking into account benefit suspensions under section 
        305(e)(9) and any plan amendments following the effective date 
        of such partition) if the partition had not occurred, over
            ``(B) the monthly benefit for such participant or 
        beneficiary which is guaranteed under section 4022A.

    ``(2) In any case in which a plan provides a benefit improvement (as 
defined in section 305(e)(9)(E)(vi)) that takes effect after the 
effective date of the partition, the plan shall pay to the corporation 
for each year during the 10-year period following the partition 
effective date, an annual amount equal to the lesser of--
            ``(A) the total value of the increase in benefit payments 
        for such year that is attributable to the benefit improvement, 
        or
            ``(B) the total benefit payments from the plan created by 
        the partition for such year.

Such payment shall be made at the time of, and in addition to, any other 
premium imposed by the corporation under this title.
    ``(3) The plan that was partitioned shall pay the premiums imposed 
by the corporation under this title with respect to participants whose 
benefits were transferred to the plan created by the partition order for 
each year during the 10-year period following the partition effective 
date.
    ``(f) Not later than 14 days after the partition order, the 
corporation shall provide notice of such order to the Committee on 
Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, and any affected participants or

        applicable plan shall not be treated as failing to meet any 
        requirement of this title, or as failing to have a uniform 
        normal retirement age for purposes of this title, solely because 
        the plan provides for a normal retirement age described in 
        paragraph (2).
            ``(2) Applicable plan.--For purposes of this subsection--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `applicable plan' means

                A plan shall not fail to be treated as an applicable 
                plan solely because the normal retirement age described 
                in the

                preceding sentence only applied to certain participants

                employers in the case of a plan maintained by more than
