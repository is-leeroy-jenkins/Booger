contain a sense of the Senate provision urging the President 
to provide in the annual budget requests of the President 
for a fiscal year under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States 
Code, an estimate of the cost of ongoing military operations 
in Iraq and Afghanistan in such fiscal year.

by the President on February 7, 2005, requests no funds for 
fiscal year 2006 for ongoing military operations in Iraq or

exists historical precedent for including the cost of ongoing 
military operations in the annual budget requests of the President 
following initial funding for such operations by emergency 
or supplemental appropriations Acts, including— 

119 STAT. 2726 PUBLIC LAW 109–148—DEC. 30, 2005

that the President submit to Congress, not later than September 
1, 2005, an amendment to the budget of the President 
for fiscal year 2006 setting forth detailed cost estimates for 
ongoing military operations overseas during such fiscal year. 
(5) The President has yet to submit such an amendment. 
(6) In February 2005, the Congressional Budget Office estimated 
that fiscal year 2006 cost of ongoing military operations 
in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $85,000,000,000. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense of the Senate that—

(2) IN GENERAL.— 
(A) SUPPORT FOR YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS.— 
(i) SUPPORT.—No Federal law (including any rule, 
regulation, directive, instruction, or order) shall be construed 
to limit any Federal agency from providing any 
form of support for a youth organization (including 
the Boy Scouts of America or any group officially affiliated 
with the Boy Scouts of America) that would result 
in that Federal agency providing less support to that 
youth organization (or any similar organization chartered 
under the chapter of title 36, United States Code, 
relating to that youth organization) than was provided 
during the preceding fiscal year. This clause shall be 
subject to the availability of appropriations. 
(ii) YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS THAT CEASE TO EXIST.— 
Clause (i) shall not apply to any youth organization 
that ceases to exist. 
(iii) WAIVERS.—The head of a Federal agency may 
waive the application of clause (i) to any youth 

PUBLIC LAW 109–148—DEC. 30, 2005 119 STAT. 2729 

organization with respect to each conviction or investigation 
described under subclause (I) or (II) for a 
period of not more than 2 fiscal years if— 

(I) any senior officer (including any member 
of the board of directors) of the youth organization 
is convicted of a criminal offense relating to the 
official duties of that officer or the youth organization 
is convicted of a criminal offense; or 
(II) the youth organization is the subject of 
a criminal investigation relating to fraudulent use 
or waste of Federal funds. 
(B) TYPES OF SUPPORT.—Support described under this 
paragraph shall include— 
(i) holding meetings, camping events, or other 
activities on Federal property; 
(ii) hosting any official event of such organization; 
(iii) loaning equipment; and 
(iv) providing personnel services and logistical support. 
(c) SUPPORT FOR SCOUT JAMBOREES.— 10 USC 2554 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings: note. 
(A) Section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the 
United States commits exclusively to Congress the powers 
to raise and support armies, provide and maintain a Navy, 
and make rules for the government and regulation of the 
land and naval forces. 
(B) Under those powers conferred by section 8 of article 
I of the Constitution of the United States to provide, support, 
and maintain the Armed Forces, it lies within the 
discretion of Congress to provide opportunities to train 
the Armed Forces. 
(C) The primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to 
defend our national security and prepare for combat should 
the need arise. 
(D) One of the most critical elements in defending 
the Nation and preparing for combat is training in conditions 
that simulate the preparation, logistics, and leadership 
required for defense and combat. 
(E) Support for youth organization events simulates 
the preparation, logistics, and leadership required for 
defending our national security and preparing for combat. 
(F) For example, Boy Scouts of America’s National 
Scout Jamboree is a unique training event for the Armed 
Forces, as it requires the construction, maintenance, and 
disassembly of a ‘‘tent city’’ capable of supporting tens 
of thousands of people for a week or longer. Camporees 
at the United States Military Academy for Girl Scouts 
and Boy Scouts provide similar training opportunities on 
a smaller scale. 
(2) SUPPORT.—Section 2554 of title 10, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(i)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide at least the same 
level of support under this section for a national or world Boy 
Scout Jamboree as was provided under this section for the preceding 
national or world Boy Scout Jamboree. 

‘‘(2) The Secretary of Defense may waive paragraph (1), if 
the Secretary— 


119 STAT. 2730 PUBLIC LAW 109–148—DEC. 30, 2005 

‘‘(A) determines that providing the support subject to para


graph (1) would be detrimental to the national security of 

the United States; and 

‘‘(B) reports such a determination to the Congress in a 
timely manner, and before such support is not provided.’’. 

(d) EQUAL ACCESS FOR YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS.—Section 109 
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 
5309) is amended— 
(1) in the first sentence of subsection (b) by inserting ‘‘or 
(e)’’ after ‘‘subsection (a)’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(e) EQUAL ACCESS.— 
‘‘(1) DEFINITION.—In this subsection, the term ‘youth 
organization’ means any organization described under part B 
of subtitle II of title 36, United States Code, that is intended 
to serve individuals under the age of 21 years. 

‘‘(2) IN GENERAL.—No State or unit of general local government 
that has a designated open forum, limited public forum, 
or nonpublic forum and that is a recipient of assistance under 
this chapter shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to 
meet to, or discriminate against, any youth organization, 
including the Boy Scouts of America or any group officially 
affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, that wishes to conduct 
a meeting or otherwise participate in that designated 
open forum, limited public forum, or nonpublic forum.’’.

(2) in an operation or area designated as a combat operation

TITLE IV—HURRICANE EDUCATION 
RECOVERY ACT 

Subtitle A—Elementary and Secondary 
Education Hurricane Relief 

SEC. 101. FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS. 

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita have had a 
devastating and unprecedented impact on students who 
attended schools in the disaster areas. 
(2) Due to the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina 
and Hurricane Rita, a significant number of students have 
enrolled in schools outside of the area in which they resided, 
including a significant number of students who enrolled in 
non-public schools because their parents chose to enroll them 
in such schools. 
(3) 372,000 students were displaced by Hurricane Katrina. 
Approximately 700 schools have been damaged or destroyed. 
Nine States each have more than 1,000 of such displaced students 
enrolled in their schools. In Texas alone, over 45,000 
displaced students have enrolled in schools. 
(4) In response to these extraordinary conditions, this subtitle 
creates a one-time only emergency grant for the 2005– 
2006 school year tailored to the needs and particular circumstances 
of students displaced by Hurricane Katrina and 
Hurricane Rita. 
(5) The level and type of assistance provided under this 
subtitle, both for students attending public schools and students 
attending non-public schools, is made available solely because 
of the unprecedented nature of the crisis, the massive dislocation 
of students, and the short duration of the services or 
assistance.

EPIDEMIC PRODUCTS AND SECURITY COUNTERMEASURES. 


‘‘(a) LIABILITY PROTECTIONS.— 

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to the other provisions of this 
section, a covered person shall be immune from suit and 
liability under Federal and State law with respect to all claims 
for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting 
from the administration to or the use by an individual of 
a covered countermeasure if a declaration under subsection 

(b) has been issued with respect to such countermeasure. 
‘‘(2) SCOPE OF CLAIMS FOR LOSS.— 
‘‘(A) LOSS.—For purposes of this section, the term ‘loss’ 
means any type of loss, including— 
‘‘(i) death; 
‘‘(ii) physical, mental, or emotional injury, illness, 

disability, or condition; 

‘‘(iii) fear of physical, mental, or emotional injury, 
illness, disability, or condition, including any need for 
medical monitoring; and 

‘‘(iv) loss of or damage to property, including busi


ness interruption loss. 
Each of clauses (i) through (iv) applies without regard 
to the date of the occurrence, presentation, or discovery 
of the loss described in the clause. 

‘‘(B) SCOPE.—The immunity under paragraph (1) 
applies to any claim for loss that has a causal relationship 
with the administration to or use by an individual of a 
covered countermeasure, including a causal relationship 
with the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, 
manufacture, labeling, distribution, formulation, packaging, 
marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, 
prescribing, administration, licensing, or use of 
such countermeasure. 
‘‘(3) CERTAIN CONDITIONS.—Subject to the other provisions 

of this section, immunity under paragraph (1) with respect 
to a covered countermeasure applies only if— 


PUBLIC LAW 109–148—DEC. 30, 2005 119 STAT. 2819 

‘‘(A) the countermeasure was administered or used 
during the effective period of the declaration that was 
issued under subsection (b) with respect to the countermeasure; 


‘‘(B) the countermeasure was administered or used for 
the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, 
or threats to health specified in the declaration; and 

‘‘(C) in addition, in the case of a covered person who 
is a program planner or qualified person with respect to 
the administration or use of the countermeasure, the 
countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual 
who— 

‘‘(i) was in a population specified by the declaration; 
and 

‘‘(ii) was at the time of administration physically 
present in a geographic area specified by the declaration 
or had a connection to such area specified in 
the declaration. 

‘‘(4) APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS.—With respect 
to immunity under paragraph (1) and subject to the other 
provisions of this section: 

‘‘(A) In the case of a covered person who is a manufacturer 
or distributor of the covered countermeasure involved, 
the immunity applies without regard to whether such 
countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual 
in accordance with the conditions described in paragraph 
(3)(C). 

‘‘(B) In the case of a covered person who is a program 
planner or qualified person with respect to the administration 
or use of the covered countermeasure, the scope of 
immunity includes circumstances in which the countermeasure 
was administered to or used by an individual 
in circumstances in which the covered person reasonably 
could have believed that the countermeasure was administered 
or used in accordance with the conditions described 
in paragraph (3)(C). 
‘‘(5) EFFECT OF DISTRIBUTION METHOD.—The provisions of 

this section apply to a covered countermeasure regardless of 
whether such countermeasure is obtained by donation, commercial 
sale, or any other means of distribution, except to the 
extent that, under paragraph (2)(E) of subsection (b), the declaration 
under such subsection provides that subsection (a) 
applies only to covered countermeasures obtained through a 
particular means of distribution. 

‘‘(6) REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION.—For purposes of paragraph 
(1), there shall be a rebuttable presumption that any 
administration or use, during the effective period of the emergency 
declaration by the Secretary under subsection (b), of 
a covered countermeasure shall have been for the category 
or categories of diseases, health conditions, or threats to health 
with respect to which such declaration was issued. 
‘‘(b) DECLARATION BY SECRETARY.— 

‘‘(1) AUTHORITY TO ISSUE DECLARATION.—Subject to paragraph 
(2), if the Secretary makes a determination that a disease 
or other health condition or other threat to health constitutes 
a public health emergency, or that there is a credible risk 


119 STAT. 2820 

PUBLIC LAW 109–148—DEC. 30, 2005 

that the disease, condition, or threat may in the future constitute 
such an emergency, the Secretary may make a declaration, 
through publication in the Federal Register, recommending, 
under conditions as the Secretary may specify, the 
manufacture, testing, development, distribution, administration, 
or use of one or more covered countermeasures, and stating 
that subsection (a) is in effect with respect to the activities 
so recommended. 

‘‘(2) CONTENTS.—In issuing a declaration under paragraph 
(1), the Secretary shall identify, for each covered countermeasure 
specified in the declaration— 

‘‘(A) the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, 
or threats to health for which the Secretary recommends 
the administration or use of the countermeasure; 

‘‘(B) the period or periods during which, including as 
modified by paragraph (3), subsection (a) is in effect, which 
period or periods may be designated by dates, or by milestones 
or other description of events, including factors 
specified in paragraph (6); 

‘‘(C) the population or populations of individuals for 
which subsection (a) is in effect with respect to the administration 
or use of the countermeasure (which may be a 
specification that such subsection applies without 
geographic limitation to all individuals); 

‘‘(D) the geographic area or areas for which subsection 

(a) is in effect with respect to the administration or use 
of the countermeasure (which may be a specification that 
such subsection applies without geographic limitation), 
including, with respect to individuals in the populations 
identified under subparagraph (C), a specification, as determined 
appropriate by the Secretary, of whether the declaration 
applies only to individuals physically present in such 
areas or whether in addition the declaration applies to 
individuals who have a connection to such areas, which 
connection is described in the declaration; and 
‘‘(E) whether subsection (a) is effective only to a particular 
means of distribution as provided in subsection 
(a)(5) for obtaining the countermeasure, and if so, the particular 
means to which such subsection is effective. 
‘‘(3) EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF DECLARATION.— 

‘‘(A) FLEXIBILITY OF PERIOD.—The Secretary may, in 
describing periods under paragraph (2)(B), have different 
periods for different covered persons to address different 
logistical, practical or other differences in responsibilities. 

‘‘(B) ADDITIONAL TIME TO BE SPECIFIED.—In each declaration 
under paragraph (1), the Secretary, after consulting, 
to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate, 
with the manufacturer of the covered countermeasure, shall 
also specify a date that is after the ending date specified 
under paragraph (2)(B) and that allows what the Secretary 
determines is— 

‘‘(i) a reasonable period for the manufacturer to 
arrange for disposition of the covered countermeasure, 
including the return of such product to the manufacturer; 
and 


PUBLIC LAW 109–148—DEC. 30, 2005 119 STAT. 2821 

‘‘(ii) a reasonable period for covered persons to 
take such other actions as may be appropriate to limit 
administration or use of the covered countermeasure. 
‘‘(C) ADDITIONAL PERIOD FOR CERTAIN STRATEGIC 

NATIONAL STOCKPILE COUNTERMEASURES.—With respect to 
a covered countermeasure that is in the stockpile under 
section 319F-2, if such countermeasure was the subject 
of a declaration under paragraph (1) at the time that 
it was obtained for the stockpile, the effective period of 
such declaration shall include a period when the countermeasure 
is administered or used pursuant to a distribution 
or release from the stockpile. 
‘‘(4) AMENDMENTS TO DECLARATION.—The Secretary may 

through publication in the Federal Register amend any portion 
of a declaration under paragraph (1). Such an amendment 
shall not retroactively limit the applicability of subsection (a) 
with respect to the administration or use of the covered countermeasure 
involved. 

‘‘(5) CERTAIN DISCLOSURES.—In publishing a declaration 
under paragraph (1) in the Federal Register, the Secretary 
is not required to disclose any matter described in section 
552(b) of title 5, United States Code. 

‘‘(6) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.—In deciding whether and 
under what circumstances or conditions to issue a declaration 
under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered countermeasure, 
the Secretary shall consider the desirability of encouraging 
the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, manufacture, 
labeling, distribution, formulation, packaging, marketing, 
promotion, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, prescribing, 
administration, licensing, and use of such countermeasure. 


‘‘(7) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—No court of the United States, or 
of any State, shall have subject matter jurisdiction to review, 
whether by mandamus or otherwise, any action by the Secretary 
under this subsection. 

‘‘(8) PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.—During the effective 
period of a declaration under subsection (b), or at any time 
with respect to conduct undertaken in accordance with such 
declaration, no State or political subdivision of a State may 
establish, enforce, or continue in effect with respect to a covered 
countermeasure any provision of law or legal requirement 
that— 

‘‘(A) is different from, or is in conflict with, any requirement 
applicable under this section; and 

‘‘(B) relates to the design, development, clinical testing 
or investigation, formulation, manufacture, distribution, 
sale, donation, purchase, marketing, promotion, packaging, 
labeling, licensing, use, any other aspect of safety or efficacy, 
or the prescribing, dispensing, or administration by 
qualified persons of the covered countermeasure, or to any 
matter included in a requirement applicable to the covered 
countermeasure under this section or any other provision 
of this Act, or under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act. 
‘‘(9) REPORT TO CONGRESS.—Within 30 days after making 

a declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit 
to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report that 


119 STAT. 2822 

Deadline. 

PUBLIC LAW 109–148—DEC. 30, 2005 

provides an explanation of the reasons for issuing the declaration 
and the reasons underlying the determinations of the 
Secretary with respect to paragraph (2). Within 30 days after 
making an amendment under paragraph (4), the Secretary 
shall submit to such committees a report that provides the 
reasons underlying the determination of the Secretary to make 
the amendment. 
‘‘(c) DEFINITION OF WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.— 

‘‘(1) DEFINITION.— 

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as the meaning of such term 
is further restricted pursuant to paragraph (2), the term 
‘willful misconduct’ shall, for purposes of subsection (d), 
denote an act or omission that is taken— 

‘‘(i) intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose; 
‘‘(ii) knowingly without legal or factual justification; 
and 

‘‘(iii) in disregard of a known or obvious risk that 
is so great as to make it highly probable that the 
harm will outweigh the benefit. 
‘‘(B) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—The criterion stated in 

subparagraph (A) shall be construed as establishing a 
standard for liability that is more stringent than a standard 
of negligence in any form or recklessness. 
‘‘(2) AUTHORITY TO PROMULGATE REGULATORY DEFINITION.— 

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary, in consultation with 
the Attorney General, shall promulgate regulations, which 
may be promulgated through interim final rules, that further 
restrict the scope of actions or omissions by a covered 
person that may qualify as ‘willful misconduct’ for purposes 
of subsection (d). 

‘‘(B) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.—In promulgating the 
regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary, in consultation 
with the Attorney General, shall consider the 
need to define the scope of permissible civil actions under

public health. 

‘‘(C) TEMPORAL SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.—The regulations 
under this paragraph may specify the temporal effect 
that they shall be given for purposes of subsection (d).

Attorney General, shall commence and complete an initial

subsection (d), the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving 
by clear and convincing evidence willful misconduct by each 
covered person sued and that such willful misconduct caused 
death or serious physical injury. 

‘‘(4) DEFENSE FOR ACTS OR OMISSIONS TAKEN PURSUANT 
TO SECRETARY’S DECLARATION.—Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, a program planner or qualified person shall 
not have engaged in ‘willful misconduct’ as a matter of law 
where such program planner or qualified person acted consistent 
with applicable directions, guidelines, or recommendations 
by the Secretary regarding the administration or use 
of a covered countermeasure that is specified in the declaration 


PUBLIC LAW 109–148—DEC. 30, 2005 119 STAT. 2823 

under subsection (b), provided either the Secretary, or a State 

or local health authority, was provided with notice of informa


tion regarding serious physical injury or death from the 

administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is mate


rial to the plaintiff’s alleged loss within 7 days of the actual 

discovery of such information by such program planner or quali


fied person. 
‘‘(5) EXCLUSION FOR REGULATED ACTIVITY OF MANUFAC


TURER OR DISTRIBUTOR.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If an act or omission by a manufacturer 
or distributor with respect to a covered countermeasure, 
which act or omission is alleged under subsection 
(e)(3)(A) to constitute willful misconduct, is subject to regulation 
by this Act or by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, such act or omission shall not constitute ‘willful 
misconduct’ for purposes of subsection (d) if— 
‘‘(i) neither the Secretary nor the Attorney General 
has initiated an enforcement action with respect to 
such act or omission; or 
‘‘(ii) such an enforcement action has been initiated

physical injury proximately caused by willful misconduct, as 
defined pursuant to subsection (c), by such covered person. 
For purposes of section 2679(b)(2)(B) of title 28, United States

of this section.

does not substantially comply with subparagraphs (B) and 

(C) shall not be accepted for filing and shall not stop 
the running of the statute of limitations. 
‘‘(B) VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The complaint shall include a 
verification, made by affidavit of the plaintiff under 
oath, stating that the pleading is true to the knowledge

that as to those matters the plaintiff believes it to 
be true. 

‘‘(ii) IDENTIFICATION OF MATTERS ALLEGED UPON 
INFORMATION AND BELIEF.—Any matter that is not

section (d), the plaintiff shall file with the complaint— 

‘‘(i) an affidavit, by a physician who did not treat 
the person on whose behalf the complaint was filed,

injury or death was proximately caused by the administration 
or use of a covered countermeasure; and 

‘‘(ii) certified medical records documenting such 
injury or death and such proximate causal connection. 

‘‘(5) THREE-JUDGE COURT.—Any action under subsection (d) 
shall be assigned initially to a panel of three judges. Such 
panel shall have jurisdiction over such action for purposes 
of considering motions to dismiss, motions for summary judgment, 
and matters related thereto. If such panel has denied 
such motions, or if the time for filing such motions has expired, 
such panel shall refer the action to the chief judge for assignment 
for further proceedings, including any trial. Section 1253 
of title 28, United States Code, and paragraph (3) of subsection 


119 STAT. 2826

(b) of section 2284 of title 28, United States Code, shall not 
apply to actions under subsection (d). 
‘‘(6) CIVIL DISCOVERY.—

reasonable opportunity to file a motion to dismiss; 
‘‘(ii) in the event such a motion is filed, before 
the court has ruled on such motion; and 
‘‘(iii) in the event a covered person files an interlocutory 
appeal from the denial of such a motion, before 
the court of appeals has ruled on such appeal. 
‘‘(B) STANDARD.—Notwithstanding any other provision 

of law, the court in an action under subsection (d) shall 
permit discovery only with respect to matters directly 
related to material issues contested in such action, and 
the court shall compel a response to a discovery request 
(including a request for admission, an interrogatory, a 
request for production of documents, or any other form 
of discovery request) under Rule 37, Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, only if the court finds that the requesting party 
needs the information sought to prove or defend as to 
a material issue contested in such action and that the 
likely benefits of a response to such request equal or exceed 
the burden or cost for the responding party of providing 
such response. 
‘‘(7) REDUCTION IN AWARD OF DAMAGES FOR COLLATERAL 

SOURCE BENEFITS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—In an action under subsection (d), 
the amount of an award of damages that would otherwise 
be made to a plaintiff shall be reduced by the amount

‘‘(8) NONECONOMIC DAMAGES.—In an action under subsection 
(d), any noneconomic damages may be awarded only 
in an amount directly proportional to the percentage of responsibility 
of a defendant for the harm to the plaintiff. For purposes

for losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, 
inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, 
loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and companionship, 
loss of consortium, hedonic damages, injury to reputation, 
and any other nonpecuniary losses. 

‘‘(9) RULE 11 SANCTIONS.—Whenever a district court of the

for the violation, an appropriate sanction, which may 
include an order to pay the other party or parties for the 
reasonable expenses incurred as a direct result of the filing 
of the pleading, motion, or other paper that is the subject 
of the violation, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. Such 
sanction shall be sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct 
or comparable conduct by others similarly situated, and to 
compensate the party or parties injured by such conduct. 

‘‘(10) INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL.—The United States Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall have jurisdiction 
of an interlocutory appeal by a covered person taken 
within 30 days of an order denying a motion to dismiss or 
a motion for summary judgment based on an assertion of the 
immunity from suit conferred by subsection (a) or based on 
an assertion of the exclusion under subsection (c)(5). 
‘‘(f) ACTIONS BY AND AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.—Nothing 

in this section shall be construed to abrogate or limit any right, 
remedy, or authority that the United States or any agency thereof 
may possess under any other provision of law or to waive sovereign 
immunity or to abrogate or limit any defense or protection available 
to the United States or its agencies, instrumentalities, officers, 
or employees under any other law, including any provision of 
chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code (relating to tort claims 
procedure). 

‘‘(g) SEVERABILITY.—If any provision of this section, or the 
application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is 
held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this section and the 
application of such remainder to any person or circumstance shall 
not be affected thereby. 

‘‘(h) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION CONCERNING NATIONAL VACCINE
