    Sec. 8039. (a) None of the funds appropriated by this Act shall be 
available to convert to contractor performance an activity or function 
of the Department of Defense that, on or after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, is performed by Department of Defense civilian employees 
unless--
            (1) the conversion is based on the result of a public-
        private competition that includes a most efficient and cost 
        effective organization plan developed by such activity or 
        function;
            (2) the Competitive Sourcing Official determines that, over 
        all performance periods stated in the solicitation of offers for 
        performance of the activity or function, the cost of performance 
        of the activity or function by a contractor would be less costly 
        to the Department of Defense by an amount that equals or exceeds 
        the lesser of--
                    (A) 10 percent of the most efficient organization's 
                personnel-related costs for performance of that activity 
                or function by Federal employees; or

            (3) the contractor does not receive an advantage for a 
        proposal that would reduce costs for the Department of Defense 
        by--
                    (A) not making an employer-sponsored health 
                insurance plan available to the workers who are to be 
                employed in the performance of that activity or function 
                under the contract; or
                    (B) offering to such workers an employer-sponsored 
                health benefits plan that requires the employer to 
                contribute less towards the premium or subscription 
                share than the amount that is paid by the Department of 
                Defense for health benefits for civilian employees under 
                chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.

                    (B) is planned to be converted to performance by a 
                qualified nonprofit agency for the blind or by a 
                qualified nonprofit agency for other severely 
                handicapped individuals in accordance with that Act; or
                    (C) is planned to be converted to performance by a

                Indian tribe, as defined in section 4(e) of the Indian

                       domestic livestock grazing

    Sec. 431. (a) Prohibition Regarding Potential Domestic Sheep and 
Bighorn Sheep Contact on National Forest System Land.--Notwithstanding 
any other provision of law or regulation (other than the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973 and regulations issued under such Act), none of the 
funds made available by this Act or made available by any other Act for 
fiscal year 2012 only may be used to carry out--
            (1) any new management restrictions on domestic sheep on 
        parcels of National Forest System land (as defined in the Forest 
        and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 
        U.S.C. 1609(a))) with potential domestic sheep and bighorn sheep 
        (whether native or nonnative) contact in excess of the 
        management restrictions that existed on July 1, 2011; or
            (2) any other agency regulation for managing bighorn sheep 
        populations on any allotment of such National Forest System land 
        if the management action will result in a reduction in the 
        number of domestic livestock permitted to graze on the allotment 
        or in the distribution of livestock on the allotment.

[[Page 125 STAT. 1048]]

    (b) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Secretary of 
Agriculture may make such management changes as the Secretary determines 
to be necessary to manage bighorn sheep if the management changes--
            (1) are consistent with the wildlife plans of the relevant 
        State fish and game agency and determined in consultation with 
        that agency; and
            (2) are developed in consultation with the affected 
        permittees.

    (c) Bureau of Land Management Lands.--In circumstances involving 
conflicts between bighorn sheep and domestic sheep grazing on public 
lands (as defined in section 103 of the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702)), the Bureau of Land Management 
may only modify or cancel domestic sheep grazing permits after 
consulting with the appropriate State fish and game agency. However, if 
the State in question has an approved State Wildlife Management Plan 
that addresses, with specificity, bighorn sheep management, then the 
Bureau of Land Management modification or cancellation of permits in 
that State shall conform to the bighorn sheep management objectives in 
the State Wildlife Management Plan, unless conformance would be 
inconsistent with Federal statute or regulation. <<NOTE: Termination 
date.>> The Bureau of Land Management shall be bound by the requirements 
of this subsection until September 30, 2012.

    (d) Voluntary Closure of Allotments.--Nothing in this section shall 
be construed as limiting the voluntary closure of existing domestic 
sheep allotments when the closure is agreed to in writing between the 
permittee and the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of 
Agriculture and is carried out for the purpose of reducing conflicts 
between domestic sheep and bighorn sheep.
    (e) Waiver of Grazing Permits and Leases.--The Secretary of the 
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture may accept the voluntary 
waiver of any valid existing lease or permit authorizing grazing on 
National Forest System land described in subsection (a) or public lands 
described in subsection (c). If the grazing permit or lease for a 
grazing allotment is only partially within the area of potential 
domestic sheep and bighorn sheep contact, the affected permittee may 
elect to waive only the portion of the grazing permit or lease that is 
within that area. The Secretary concerned shall--
            (1) terminate each permit or lease waived or portion of a 
        permit or lease waived under this subsection;
            (2) ensure a permanent end to domestic sheep grazing on the 
        land covered by the waived permit or lease or waived portion of 
        the permit or lease unless or until there is no conflict with 
        bighorn sheep management; and
            (3) provide for the reimbursement of range improvements in 
        compliance with section 4 of the Act of June 28, 1934 (commonly 
        known as the Taylor Grazing Act; 43 U.S.C. 315c).
