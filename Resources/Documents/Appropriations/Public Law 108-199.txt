        limitation for television stations in paragraph (1)(B) through 
        grant, transfer, or assignment of an additional license for a

[[Page 118 STAT. 100]]

            ``(4) Forbearance.--Section 10 of the Communications Act of 
        1934 (47 U.S.C. 160) shall not apply to any person or entity 
        that exceeds the 39 percent national audience reach limitation

    Sec. 630. (a) Tracing studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives are released without adequate 
disclaimers regarding the limitations of the data.
    (b) The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives shall 
include in all such data releases, language similar to the following 
that would make clear that trace data cannot be used to draw broad 
conclusions about firearms-related crime:
            (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement 
        authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale 
        and possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies 
        may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons 
        are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not all 
        firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced 
        are used in crime.
            (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for 
        purposes of determining which types, makes or models of firearms 
        are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected do not 
        constitute a random sample and should not be considered 
        representative of the larger universe of all firearms used by 
        criminals, or any subset of that universe. Firearms are normally 
        traced to the first retail seller, and sources reported for 
        firearms traced do not necessarily represent the sources or 
        methods by which firearms in general are acquired for use in 
        crime.

Public Law 105-135 shall be available until expended for the cost of 
general business loans under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act.
    Sec. 633. (a) <<NOTE: 22 USC 2078.>> There is established in the

International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue Trust Fund. The 
income from the fund shall be used for operations of the International 
Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue to promote dialogue and 
scholarship in the Middle East. The fund may accept contributions and 
gifts from public and private sources.

    (b) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest 
in full amounts made available to the fund. Such investments may be made 
only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in 
obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United 
States. The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption 
of, any obligations held in the fund shall be credited to and form a 
part of the fund and shall remain available without fiscal year 
limitation.
    (c) For each fiscal year, there is authorized to be appropriated 
from the fund for the operations of the International Center for

[[Page 118 STAT. 101]]

Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue the total amount of the interest and 
earnings credited to the fund under subsection (b).
    (d) There are authorized to be appropriated to the International

year limitation, such sums as may be necessary to carry out the 
provisions of this section and to provide for the permanent endowment

established under this section.

State, shall retain ownership of the Palazzo Corpi building in Istanbul, 
Turkey, and the Secretary of State shall be responsible for maintaining 
the International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue at such 
location.

    (f) Section 1321(a) of title 31, United States Code, is amended by 
inserting after ``(58) Inmates' fund, workhouse and reformatory, 
District of Columbia.'' the following new paragraph:
            ``(59) International Center for Middle Eastern-Western

encompassing a human organism.
    Sec. 635. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used 
to pay expenses for any United States delegation to the United Nations 
Human Rights Commission if such commission is chaired or presided over 
by a country, the government of which the Secretary of State has 
determined, for purposes of section 6(j)(1) of the Export Administration 
Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)), has repeatedly provided support 
for acts of international terrorism.
    Sec. 636. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used 
in violation of section 212(a)(10)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act.
    Sec. 637. (a) <<NOTE: HELP Commission Act. 22 USC 2394b.>> This 
section may be cited as the ``HELP Commission Act''.

    (b)(1) The Congress finds that, despite the long-standing efforts 
and resources of the United States dedicated to helping needy people 
around the world, despair remains and in many areas is growing.
    (2) Therefore, a commission should be established to bring together 
the best minds associated with development and humanitarian assistance 
to make a comprehensive review of--
            (A) policy decisions, including why certain development 
        projects are funded and others are not, successes, and best 
        practices, including their applicability to other existing 
        programs and projects;
            (B) delivery obstacles, including the roles of United States 
        agencies and other governmental and nongovernmental 
        organizations;
            (C) methodology, including whether the delivery of United 
        States development assistance always represents best practices 
        and whether it can be improved; and
            (D) results, including measuring improvements in human 
        capacity instead of in purely economic terms.

    (3) An examination of these issues should present new approaches and 
ideas to ensure that United States development assistance reaches and 
benefits its intended recipients.

[[Page 118 STAT. 102]]

    (c)(1) <<NOTE: Establishment.>> There is established the Helping to 
Enhance the Livelihood of People (HELP) Around the Globe Commission (in 
this section referred to as the ``Commission'').

    (2) The Commission shall--
            (A) identify the past and present objectives of United 
        States development assistance, identify cases in which those 
        objectives have been met, identify the beneficiaries of such 
        assistance, and what percentage of the funds provided actually 
        reached the intended beneficiaries;
            (B) identify cases in which United States development 
        assistance has been most successful, and analyze how such 
        successes may be transferable to other countries or areas;
            (C) study ways to expand educational opportunities and 
        investments in people, and assess infrastructure needs;
            (D) analyze how the United States could place conditions on 
        governments in countries receiving United States development 
        assistance, in light of and notwithstanding the objectives of 
        the Millennium Challenge Account;
            (E) analyze ways in which the United States can coordinate 
        its development assistance programs with those of other donor 
        countries and international organizations;
            (F) analyze ways in which the safety of development 
        assistance workers can be ensured, particularly in the midst of 
        conflicts;
            (G) compare the effectiveness of increased and open trade 
        with development assistance, and analyze the advantages and 
        disadvantages of such trade and whether such trade could be a 
        more effective alternative to United States development 
        assistance;
            (H) analyze ways in which the United States can strengthen 
        the capacity of indigenous nongovernmental organizations to be 
        more effective in grassroots development;
            (I) analyze ways in which decisions on providing development 
        assistance can involve more of the people of the recipient 
        countries;
            (J) analyze ways in which results can be measured if United 
        States development assistance is targeted to the least developed 
        countries;
            (K) recommend standards that should be set for 
        ``graduating'' recipient countries from United States 
        development assistance;
            (L) analyze whether United States development assistance 
        should be used as a means to achieve United States foreign 
        policy objectives;
            (M) analyze how the United States can evaluate the 
        performance of its development assistance programs not only 
        against economic indicators, but in other ways, including how to 
        measure the success of United States development assistance in 
        democratization efforts; and evaluate the existing foreign 
        assistance framework to ascertain the degree of coordination, or 
        lack thereof, of the disparate foreign development programs as 
        administered by the various Federal agencies, to identify and 
        assess the redundancies of programs and organizational 
        structures engaged in foreign assistance, and to recommend 
        revisions to authorizing legislation for foreign assistance that 
        would seek to reconcile competing foreign policy and foreign aid 
        goals; and

[[Page 118 STAT. 103]]

        necessary relating to United States development assistance.

        North Pacific Fishery Management Council between June 2002 and 
        April 2003, and all trailing amendments including those reported

        Secretary from approving by January 1, 2005, and implementing 
        any subsequent program amendments approved by the Council.
            ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, in 
        carrying out paragraph (1) the Secretary shall approve all parts 
        of the Program referred to in such paragraph. Further, no part 
        of such Program may be implemented if, as approved by the North 
        Pacific Fishery Management Council, individual fishing quotas,

        leveraged its Individual Processor Quota shares to acquire a 
        harvesters open-delivery ``B shares'', the processor's 
        Individual Processor Quota shares shall be forfeited.
            ``(3) Subsequent to implementation pursuant to paragraph

not eligible to participate in the pilot program; and (2) establish 
catch limits for non-rockfish species and non-target rockfish species 
currently harvested with pacific ocean perch, northern rockfish, and 
pelagic shelf rockfish, which shall be based on historical harvesting of 
such bycatch species. The pilot program will sunset when a Gulf of 
Alaska Groundfish comprehensive rationalization plan is authorized by 
the Council and implemented by the Secretary, or 2 years from date of

 TITLE III--DC <<NOTE: DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003.>> SCHOOL 
CHOICE INCENTIVE ACT OF 2003

SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``DC School Choice Incentive Act of 
2003''.

SEC. 302. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their 
        children, including the educational setting that will best serve 
        the interests and educational needs of their child.
            (2) For many parents in the District of Columbia, public 
        school choice provided for under the No Child Left Behind Act of 
        2001 as well as under other public school choice programs, is 
        inadequate due to capacity constraints. Available

[[Page 118 STAT. 127]]

        educational alternatives to the public schools are insufficient 
        and more educational options are needed. In particular, funds 
        are needed to assist low-income parents to exercise choice among 
        enhanced public opportunities and private educational 
        environments, whether religious or nonreligious. Therefore, in 
        keeping with the spirit of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 
        school choice options, in addition to those already available to 
        parents in the District of Columbia (such as magnet and charter 
        schools and open enrollment schools) should be made available to 
        those parents.
            (3) In the most recent mathematics assessment on the 
        National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), administered 
        in 2000, a lower percentage of 4th-grade students in the 
        District of Columbia demonstrated proficiency than was the case 
        for any State. Seventy-six percent of the District of Columbia 
        fourth-graders scored at the ``below basic'' level and of the 
        8th-grade students in the District of Columbia, only 6 percent 
        of the students tested at the proficient or advanced levels, and 
        77 percent were below basic. In the most recent NAEP reading 
        assessment, in 1998, only 10 percent of the District of Columbia 
        fourth-graders could read proficiently, while 72 percent were 
        below basic. At the 8th-grade level, 12 percent were proficient 
        or advanced and 56 percent were below basic.
            (4) A program enacted for the valid secular purpose of 
        providing educational assistance to low-income children in a 
        demonstrably failing public school system is constitutional 
        under Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002), if it is 
        neutral with respect to religion and provides assistance to a 
        broad class of citizens who direct government aid to religious 
        and secular schools solely as a result of their genuine and 
        independent private choices.
            (5) The Mayor of the District of Columbia, the Chairman of 
        the Education Committee of the City Council of the District of 
        Columbia, and the President of the District of Columbia Board of 
        Education support this title.
            (6) This title provides additional money for the District of 
        Columbia public schools and therefore money for scholarships is 
        not being taken out of money that would otherwise go to the 
        District of Columbia public schools.
            (7) This title creates a 5-year program tailored to the 
        current needs and particular circumstances of low-income 
        children in District of Columbia schools. This title does not 
        establish parameters or requirements for other school choice 
        programs.

SEC. 303. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this title is to provide low-income parents residing 
in the District of Columbia, particularly parents of students who attend 
elementary schools or secondary schools identified for improvement, 
corrective action, or restructuring under section 1116 of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316), with expanded 
opportunities for enrolling their children in higher-performing schools

appropriated by this Act may be made available to provide assistance for 
a foreign country under a new bilateral agreement governing the terms 
and conditions under which such assistance is to be provided unless such 
agreement includes a provision stating that assistance provided by the

                commanders and financial backers, especially in regions

    Sec. <<NOTE: 20 USC 1087kk note.>> 305. Special Study of 
Simplification of Need Analysis and Application for title IV Aid. (a) 
Study Required.--The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance 
established by section 491 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 1098), hereafter in this section referred to as ``the Advisory 
Committee'', shall conduct a thorough study of the feasibility of 
simplifying the need analysis methodology for all Federal student 
financial assistance programs and the process of applying for such 
assistance.

    (b) Required Subjects of Study.--In performing the study, the 
Advisory Committee shall, at a minimum, examine the following:

[[Page 118 STAT. 264]]

            (1) whether the methodology used to calculate the expected 
        family contribution can be simplified without significant 
        adverse effects on program intent, costs, integrity, delivery, 
        and distribution of awards;
            (2) whether the number of data elements, and, accordingly, 
        the number and complexity of questions asked of students and 
        families, used to calculate the expected family contribution can 
        be reduced without such adverse effects;
            (3) whether the procedures for determining such data 
        elements, including determining and updating offsets and 
        allowances, is the most efficient, effective, and fair means to 
        determine a family's available income and assets;
            (4) whether the methodology used to calculate the expected 
        family contribution, specifically the consideration of income 
        earned by a dependent student and its effect on Pell grant 
        eligibility, is an effective and fair means to determine a 
        family's available income and a student's need;
            (5) whether the nature and timing of the application 
        required in section 483 (a)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 
        1965 (20 U.S.C. 1090(a)(1)), eligibility and award 
        determination, financial aid processing, and funds delivery can 
        be streamlined further for students and families, institutions, 
        and States;
            (6) whether it is feasible to allow students to complete 
        only those limited sections of the financial aid application 
        that apply to their specific circumstances and the State in 
        which they reside;
            (7) whether a widely disseminated printed form, or the use 
        of an Internet or other electronic means, can be developed to 
        notify individuals of an estimation of their approximate 
        eligibility for grant, work-study, and loan assistance upon 
        completion and verification of the simplified application form;
            (8) whether information provided on other Federal forms 
        (such as the form applying for supplemental security income 
        under title XVI of the Social Security Act, the form for 
        applying for food stamps under the Food Stamp Act of 1977, and 
        the schedule for applying for the earned income tax credit under 
        section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) that are 
        designed to determine eligibility for various Federal need-based 
        assistance programs could be used to qualify potential students 
        for the simplified needs test; and
            (9) whether any proposed changes to data elements collected, 
        in addition to those used to calculate expected family 
        contribution, or any proposed changes to the form's design or 
        the process of applying for aid, may have adverse effects on 
        program costs, integrity, delivery, or distribution of awards, 
        as well as, application development or application processing.

    (c) Additional Considerations.--In conducting the feasibility study, 
the Advisory Committee's primary objective under this subsection shall 
be simplifying the financial aid application forms and process and 
obtaining a substantial reduction in the number of required data items. 
In carrying out that objective, the Advisory Committee shall pay special 
attention to the needs of low-income and moderate-income students and 
families.
    (d) Consultation.--
            (1) In general.--The Advisory Committee shall consult with a 
        broad range of interested parties in higher education,

        administrators, administrators of intervention and outreach 
        programs, and appropriate officials from the Department of 
        Education.
            (2) Forms design expert.--With the goal of making 
        significant changes to the form to make the questions more 
        easily understandable, the Advisory Committee shall consult a 
        forms design expert to ensure that its recommendations for 
        revision of the application form would assist in making the form 
        easily readable and understood by parents, students, and other 
        members of the public.
            (3) Congressional consultation.--The Advisory Committee 
        shall consult on a regular basis with the Committee on Education 
        and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the 
        Senate in carrying out the feasibility study required by this 
        subsection.
            (4) Departmental consultation.--The Secretary of Education 
        shall provide such assistance to the Advisory Committee as is 
        requested and practicable in conducting the study required by 
        this subsection.

        fiscal year under section 105 of title 23, United States Code 
        (relating to minimum guarantee) so that the amount of obligation 
        authority available for each of such sections is equal to the 
        amount determined by multiplying the ratio determined under 
        paragraph (3) by the sums authorized to be appropriated for such 
        section (except in the case of section 105, $2,000,000,000) for

of general local government and the population of all eligible units of 
general local government in the nonentitlement areas of the State; (2)

the previous sentence, the ratio described in clause (2) shall be 
counted twice and the ratios described in clauses (1) and (3) shall be 
counted once. Notwithstanding any other provision, grants made under 
this section shall be subject to the program requirements of section 104 
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 in the same manner 
as such requirements are made applicable to grants made under section 
106(b) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.

        Pesticide Programs of the Environmental Protection Agency, as 
        identified in key programs and projects of the final operating 
        plan for the Environmental Protection Agency submitted as part 
        of the budget process for fiscal year 2002, regardless of any 
        subsequent transfer of 1 or more of the functions to another

        decisionmaking for the review of pesticide registration 
        applications and associated tolerances (including increases in 
        the number of full-time equivalent positions in the 
        Environmental Protection Agency engaged in those activities)

        Office of Pesticide Programs of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency for the fiscal year (excluding the amount of any fees

review periods in effect on the effective date of the Pesticide

                watershed and its inclusion in Cumberland Gap National

                city of Middlesboro, Kentucky, and environs.
