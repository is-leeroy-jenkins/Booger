REQUESTS FOR FUTURE FUNDING FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN 
AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ 

SEC. 1024. (a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the following 
findings: 

(1) The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004 
(Public Law 108–87) and the Department of Defense Appropriations 
Act, 2005 (Public Law 108–287) each contain a sense 
of the Senate provision urging the President to provide in 
the annual budget requests of the President for a fiscal year 
under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, an estimate 
of the cost of ongoing military operations in Iraq and 
Afghanistan in such fiscal year. 
(2) The budget for fiscal year 2006 submitted to Congress 
by the President on February 7, 2005, requests no funds for 
fiscal year 2006 for ongoing military operations in Iraq or 
Afghanistan. 
(3) According to the Congressional Research Service, there 
exists historical precedent for including the cost of ongoing 
military operations in the annual budget requests of the President 
following initial funding for such operations by emergency 
or supplemental appropriations Acts, including— 
(A) funds for Operation Noble Eagle, beginning in the 
budget request of President George W. Bush for fiscal 
year 2005; 
(B) funds for operations in Kosovo, beginning in the 
budget request of President George W. Bush for fiscal 
year 2001; 
(C) funds for operations in Bosnia, beginning in budget 
request of President Clinton for fiscal year 1997; 
(D) funds for operations in Southwest Asia, beginning 
in the budget request of President Clinton for fiscal year 
1997; 
(E) funds for operations in Vietnam, beginning in the 
budget request of President Johnson for fiscal year 1966; 
and 
(F) funds for World War II, beginning in the budget 
request of President Roosevelt for fiscal year 1943. 
(4) The Senate has included in its version of the fiscal 
year 2006 budget resolution, which was adopted by the Senate 
on March 17, 2005, a reserve fund of $50,000,000,000 for overseas 
contingency operations, but the determination of that 
amount could not take into account any Administration estimate 
on the projected cost of such operations in fiscal year 
2006. 
(5) In February 2005, the Congressional Budget Office estimated 
that fiscal year 2006 costs for ongoing military operations 
in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $65,000,000,000. 
(b) SENSE OF SENATE.—It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) any request for funds for a fiscal year after fiscal year 
2006 for an ongoing military operation overseas, including operations 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, should be included in the 
annual budget of the President for such fiscal year as submitted 

PUBLIC LAW 109–13—MAY 11, 2005 119 STAT. 253 

to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States 
Code; 

(2) the President should submit to Congress, not later 
than September 1, 2005, an amendment to the budget of the 
President for fiscal year 2006 that was submitted to Congress 
under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, setting 
forth detailed cost estimates for ongoing military operations 
overseas during such fiscal year; and 
(3) any funds provided for a fiscal year for ongoing military 
operations overseas should be provided in appropriations Acts 
for such fiscal year through appropriations to specific accounts 
set forth in such appropriations Acts. 
(c) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN REPORTS.—(1) 
Each semiannual report to Congress required under a provision 
of law referred to in paragraph (2) shall include, in addition to 
the matters specified in the applicable provision of law, the following: 
(A) A statement of the cumulative total of all amounts 
obligated, and of all amounts expended, as of the date of such 
report for Operation Enduring Freedom. 
(B) A statement of the cumulative total of all amounts 
obligated, and of all amounts expended, as of the date of such 
report for Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
(C) An estimate of the reasonably foreseeable costs for 
ongoing military operations to be incurred during the 12-month 
period beginning on the date of such report. 
(2) The provisions of law referred to in this paragraph are 
as follows: 
(A) Section 1120 of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations 
Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq 
and Afghanistan, 2004 (Public Law 108–106; 117 Stat. 1219;

amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘The Attorney General’’ the first place such 
term appears and inserting the following:

‘‘(B) BURDEN OF PROOF.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The burden of proof is on the 
applicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee, 
within the meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A). To establish 
that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning 
of such section, the applicant must establish that race, 
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social 
group, or political opinion was or will be at least one 
central reason for persecuting the applicant. 

‘‘(ii) SUSTAINING BURDEN.—The testimony of the 
applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant’s 
burden without corroboration, but only if the applicant 
satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant’s testimony 
is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts 
sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee. 
In determining whether the applicant has met 
the applicant’s burden, the trier of fact may weigh 
the credible testimony along with other evidence of 
record. Where the trier of fact determines that the 
applicant should provide evidence that corroborates 
otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be 
provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence 
and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence. 

‘‘(iii) CREDIBILITY DETERMINATION.—Considering 
the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, 
a trier of fact may base a credibility determination 
on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the 
applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the 
applicant’s or witness’s account, the consistency 
between the applicant’s or witness’s written and oral 
statements (whenever made and whether or not under 
oath, and considering the circumstances under which 
the statements were made), the internal consistency 
of each such statement, the consistency of such statements 
with other evidence of record (including the 
reports of the Department of State on country conditions), 
and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, 
without regard to whether an inconsistency, 
inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the 
applicant’s claim, or any other relevant factor. There 
is no presumption of credibility, however, if no adverse 
credibility determination is explicitly made, the 
applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption 
of credibility on appeal.’’. 

(b) EXCEPTIONS TO ELIGIBILITY FOR ASYLUM.—Section 
208(b)(2)(A)(v) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1158(b)(2)(A)(v)) is amended—

119 STAT. 304 PUBLIC LAW 109–13—MAY 11, 2005 

‘‘(C) SUSTAINING BURDEN OF PROOF; CREDIBILITY DETER-
MINATIONS.—In determining whether an alien has demonstrated 
that the alien’s life or freedom would be threatened 
for a reason described in subparagraph (A), the trier 
of fact shall determine whether the alien has sustained 
the alien’s burden of proof, and shall make credibility determinations, 
in the manner described in clauses (ii) and 

(iii) of section 208(b)(1)(B).’’. 
(d) OTHER REQUESTS FOR RELIEF FROM REMOVAL.—Section 
8 USC 1229a. 240(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1230(c)) 
is amended— 

(1) by redesignating paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) as paragraphs 
(5), (6), and (7), respectively; and 
(2) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following:

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—An alien applying for relief or 

protection from removal has the burden of proof to establish 

that the alien— 

‘‘(i) satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements; 
and 

‘‘(ii) with respect to any form of relief that is 
granted in the exercise of discretion, that the alien 
merits a favorable exercise of discretion. 
‘‘(B) SUSTAINING BURDEN.—The applicant must comply 

with the applicable requirements to submit information 
or documentation in support of the applicant’s application 
for relief or protection as provided by law or by regulation 
or in the instructions for the application form. In evaluating 
the testimony of the applicant or other witness in support 
of the application, the immigration judge will determine 
whether or not the testimony is credible, is persuasive, 
and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that 
the applicant has satisfied the applicant’s burden of proof. 
In determining whether the applicant has met such burden, 
the immigration judge shall weigh the credible testimony 
along with other evidence of record. Where the immigration 
judge determines that the applicant should provide evidence 
which corroborates otherwise credible testimony, 
such evidence must be provided unless the applicant demonstrates 
that the applicant does not have the evidence 
and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence. 

‘‘(C) CREDIBILITY DETERMINATION.—Considering the 
totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, the 
immigration judge may base a credibility determination 
on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant 
or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant’s or 
witness’s account, the consistency between the applicant’s 
or witness’s written and oral statements (whenever made 
and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances 
under which the statements were made), the 
internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency 
of such statements with other evidence of record (including 
the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), 
and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, 
without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, 
or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s claim, 
or any other relevant factor. There is no presumption of 


PUBLIC LAW 109–13—MAY 11, 2005 119 STAT. 305 

credibility, however, if no adverse credibility determination 
is explicitly made, the applicant or witness shall have 
a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.’’. 

(e) STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR ORDERS OF REMOVAL.—Section 
242(b)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1252(b)(4)) is amended by adding at the end, after subparagraph

by a trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating 
evidence, as described in section 208(b)(1)(B), 240(c)(4)(B), or 
241(b)(3)(C), unless the court finds, pursuant to section 242(b)(4)(B), 
that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such 
corroborating evidence is unavailable.’’.

Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(B)) is 
amended—
