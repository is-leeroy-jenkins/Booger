CIRCULAR NO. A-136 

Revised 

 

Overview 

 

1. Purpose: This Circular establishes a central point of reference for all Federal financial 
reporting guidance for Executive Branch departments, agencies, and entities required to 
submit audited financial statements, interim financial statements, and Performance and 
Accountability Reports (PAR) under the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (“CFO 
Act”) (Pub. L. No. 101 – 576), the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 (“ATDA”) 
(Pub. L. No. 107 – 289), and Annual Management Reports under the Government 
Corporations Control Act (31 U.S.C. § 9101 et seq.). This Circular is available on the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) home page on the Internet, which is currently 
located at http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/. 


The Overview of this Circular consists of Sections 2 through 5. Section 2 provides 
background information on Federal Financial Reporting; Section 3 discusses entities to 
which this Circular applies; Section 4 states the effective date of this Circular; Section 5 
provides Federal Financial Reporting policy and references the relevant bulletin and 
memoranda for which this specific guidance supersedes; and Section 6 provides contact 
information for inquiries. Part A of this Circular incorporates and updates Bulletin 01-09 
Form and Content of Agency Financial Statements, which provides guidance and 
instruction to those covered departments, agencies, and other entities on preparing PARs. 
Guidance on preparing the Financial Report of the United States Government (FR) is 
located in Part B of this Circular. 




 

2. Background: Executive Branch agencies must generally prepare and submit audited 
financial statements to the OMB. The CFO Act, as amended by the Government 
Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA) (Pub. L. No. 103 – 356), requires the major 
24 agencies of the Federal Government to prepare and submit audited financial 
statements. For those Federal entities not covered by the CFO Act, the ATDA requires 
those Federal agencies and entities to also prepare and submit audited financial 
statements to OMB and the Congress, and the Government Corporations Control Act 
requires Government Corporations to submit Annual Management Reports to OMB and 
the Congress. 


Under the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 (Pub. L. No. 106-531), agencies are 
permitted to submit combined reports in implementing statutory requirements for 
financial and performance management reporting to improve the efficiency of executive 
branch performance. These reports are combined in the PAR, which consists of the 
Annual Performance Report required by the Government Performance and Results Act 
(GPRA) (Pub. L. No. 103 – 62) with annual financial statements and other reports, such 
as agencies’ assurances on internal control, accountability reports by agency heads and 
Inspector Generals’ assessments of the agencies’ most serious management and 
performance challenges. PARs provide financial and performance information that 
enables the President, the Congress, and the public to assess the performance of an 





agency relative to its mission and to demonstrate accountability. 

 

The Department of the Treasury, in coordination with OMB, prepares and submits the 
FR, as required by GMRA. The FR presents and discusses the Government’s financial 
condition and operations for the fiscal year and includes consolidated financial statements 
and related disclosures, as well as reports on stewardship responsibilities. Important 
financial management issues are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis section of the FR. 




 

3. Coverage: The provisions of this Circular apply to each Executive Branch department, 
agency, and other entity (“entity”) that is required to prepare audited financial statements 
under the CFO Act, GMRA, the ATDA and the Government Corporations Control Act, 
except any corporation that is required to register a class of its equity securities with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 


 

4. Effective: The provisions of this Circular are effective in their entirety for the preparation 
of financial statements for the end of fiscal year (FY) 2005, unless otherwise specified. 
Earlier implementation is permitted, unless otherwise specified. 


 

5. Policy for Federal Financial Statements and PARs: 


 

a. General. 
The purpose of accelerated reporting is to better ensure that timely and accurate 
financial and performance information is made available to Federal agency 
managers as soon as possible after the end of the fiscal year and throughout the 
year. 




 

b. Preparation. 
Agencies shall prepare PARs in accordance with Form and Content of the 
Performance and Accountability Report, located in Part A of this Circular, which 
supersedes all other bulletins and memoranda (see Section 4e) providing guidance 
on preparation of PARs, except for OMB Circular No. A-11 Preparation, 
Submission, and Execution of the Budget, as amended, located at 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/index.html. 




 

c. Submission Date. 



i. PARs. Agencies shall submit their PARs to OMB and the Congress1 no 
later than 45 days after the end of the fiscal year. (For those agencies with 
a September 30 fiscal year end, the due date is November 15.) This 




1Copies of the reports must be provided to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President and the 
President pro tempore of the Senate, the Chairmen and ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on 
Homeland Security and Government Affairs and the House Committee on Government Reform, and the chairmen 
and ranking minority member of the budget committees, relevant authorization and oversight committees, and 
appropriation subcommittees. 


Circular makes this 45-day deadline a permanent annual requirement for 
all executive agencies regardless of fiscal year. Agencies shall submit a 
draft of the PAR to OMB’s Office of Federal Financial Management 
(OFFM) and the appropriate Resource Management Office (RMO) ten 
working days before agencies issue the final PAR and should include all 
sections of the PAR. 




 

ii. Annual Management Reports. Effective FY 2006, Government 
Corporations shall submit their Annual Management Reports, as described 
in Government Corporations Control Act to OMB and the Congress¹ no 
later than 45 days after the end of the fiscal year. (For those corporations 
with a September 30 fiscal year end, the due date is November 15.) This 
Circular makes this 45-day deadline a permanent annual requirement for 
all government corporations regardless of fiscal year. Government 
Corporations shall submit a draft of the Annual Management Report to 
OMB’s OFFM and the appropriate RMO ten working days before 
government corporations issue the final Annual Management Report and 
should include all sections of the Management Report. Government 
Corporations that present their financial statements in accordance with the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) are also required to report 
information to the Department of the Treasury to support government 
wide financial statements as specified in Part B of this Circular. 


 

Any corporation that is required to register a class of its equity securities 
with the SEC is excluded from the OMB accelerated due dates. 

 

iii. Financial Report of the United States Government. The U.S. Treasury is 
required to issue the Financial Report of the United States Government no 
later than one month after the 45-day deadline as noted in (i) and (ii) 
above. (For a September 30 fiscal year end, this due date is December 
15.) This Circular makes this deadline a permanent annual requirement. 


 

iv. Interim Financial Statements. Agencies shall submit unaudited interim 
financial statements to OMB 21 days after the end of each of the first three 
quarters of the fiscal year. Agencies should include management’s 
explanation of significant variances in types or amounts of assets, 
liabilities, costs, revenues, obligations and outlays along with the 
submitted statements. This Circular makes this deadline a permanent 
quarterly requirement. 


 

d. Submission Format and Contact Information. The draft and final reports (i.e., 
PARs, Annual Management Reports, etc.) shall be submitted electronically in a 
PDF format or specified website location (preferred). Offices of the Chief 
Financial Officer should submit the final PARs (and Annual Management Reports 
for Government Corporations) to OMB’s OFFM and appropriate RMO, 
Department of the Treasury (Main), Financial Management Service (FMS), and 



the Government Accountability Office (GAO) using the electronic addresses 
provided in Attachment 1. To be considered final, the electronic files must 
include all required signatures. In addition, four (4) hard copies of the PAR 
should be provided to OMB as soon as they are available.

1.11 In Management's Discussion and Analysis, may agencies reference the 
performance section of the report rather than incorporating key performance 
measures into the MD&A when an agency issues a performance and 
accountability report? 


 

1.1 What is the purpose of Part A Form and Content of the PAR? 

 

Part A is issued under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3515 (d). Part A defines the form and content 
for Federal agency financial statements that are required to be submitted to the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congress pursuant to the requirements of the 
Chief Financial Officers Act, as amended by the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 
(P.L.106-531). These statements are in addition to the reports submitted to OMB for purposes of 
monitoring budget execution. 

 

Federal financial statements are prepared in accordance with policies prescribed by OMB in Part 
A of this Circular. These formats and instructions provide a framework within which individual 
agencies have flexibility to provide information useful to the Congress, agency managers, and 
the public. 

 

1.2 What is the relationship between Part A and the hierarchy of accounting principles for 
Federal entities? 

 


In April 2000, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) through 
Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 69, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity 
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the Independent Auditor’s Report, as 
amended by SAS No. 91, Federal GAAP Hierarchy, established the following hierarchy of 
accounting principles for Federal governmental entities: 

 

A. Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) Statements and 
Interpretations plus AICPA and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) 
pronouncements if made applicable to Federal governmental entities by a FASAB 
Statement or Interpretation; 


 

B. FASAB Technical Bulletins and the following pronouncements if specifically made 
applicable to Federal governmental entities by the AICPA and cleared by the FASAB: 
AICPA Industry Audit and Accounting Guides and AICPA Statements of Position; 


 

C. AICPA Accounting Standards Executive Committee (ACSEC) Practice Bulletins if 
specifically made applicable to Federal governmental entities and cleared by the 
FASAB and Technical Releases of the Accounting and Auditing Policy Committee of 
the FASAB; and 


 

D. Implementation guides published by the FASAB staff and practices that are widely 
recognized and prevalent in the Federal government. 


 

In the absence of a pronouncement covered by Federal GAAP or another source of established 
accounting principles, the auditor of a Federal governmental entity may consider other 
accounting literature, depending on its relevance in the circumstances. Other accounting 
literature includes, for example, FASAB Concept Statements; pronouncements in (A)-(D) of the 
hierarchy when not specifically made applicable to Federal governmental entities; FASB 
Concept Statements; Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statements, 
Interpretations, Technical Bulletins, and Concept Statements; AICPA Issue Papers; International 
Accounting Standards of the International Accounting Standards Committee; pronouncements of 
other professional associations or regulatory agencies; AICPA Technical Practice Aids; and 
accounting textbooks, handbooks, and articles. 

 

Guidance prescribed in Part A that is specified by a FASAB, AAPC, AICPA, or FASB 
pronouncement as described in paragraphs (A)-(C) above, are considered to be A, B, or C-level 
GAAP as appropriate. Requirements in Part A that are not specified by a pronouncement 
described in paragraphs (A)-(C) above are considered to be level (D) of the Federal GAAP 
hierarchy because they constitute "practices that are widely recognized and prevalent in the 
Federal government." The Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts (SFFACs), the 
Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFASs), Interpretations, Technical 
Bulletins, and Technical Releases addressed in Part A are listed in Appendix A of this Circular. 

 


SFFACs and SFFASs are set and promulgated by FASAB following procedures adopted by the 
three FASAB principals from OMB, the Department of the Treasury, and the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO). The principal members, however, retain their authorities, 
separately and jointly, to establish and adopt accounting standards for the Federal Government, 
as evidenced by this Circular issued by OMB. When directed by the OMB, through this 
Circular, GAAP serves as authoritative guidance for Federal agencies in preparing the reports 
addressed in this Circular. 

 

 1.3 When is Part A effective? 

 

The provisions of Part A are effective in their entirety for the preparation of financial statements 
for the end of fiscal year (FY) 2005, unless otherwise specified. Earlier implementation is 
permitted, unless otherwise specified. 

 

Note: Changes related to SFFAS 27, Identifying and Reporting Earmarked Funds, are 
effective for FY 2006. Earlier implementation of SFFAS 27 is not permitted. 

 

 

1.4 To which entity does Part A apply? 

 

Part A applies to the Executive Branch Agencies specified Section 3 of the overview of this 
Circular. 

 

Components of Executive Branch Agencies required by law to issue financial statements 
prepared in accordance with accounting standards other than those promulgated by FASAB shall 
continue to comply with applicable standards. When the reporting entities, of which these 
components are a part, issue consolidated or consolidating statements that include such 
components, GAAP for Federal entities shall be applied to these components. (See Section 1.2 
for guidance on determining GAAP for Federal entities.) 

 

The Executive Branch Agencies covered by this Circular are reporting entities and, as such, are 
required to prepare organization-wide financial statements. SFFAC No. 2, Entity and Display, 
includes two types of criteria for determining which components of executive departments and 
agencies shall be included in their organization-wide financial statements. The first is the 
conclusive criterion, i.e., there is an inherent conclusion that for financial reporting purposes, any 
organization meeting this criterion is part of a specified larger entity. Appearance in the Budget 
of the United States Government Analytical Perspectives section currently entitled Federal 
Programs by Agency and Account is a conclusive criterion. Any organization, program or 
budget account, including off-budget accounts and government corporations, included in that 
section shall be considered part of the Federal Government, as well as part of the executive 
department or agency with which it appears. OMB approval shall be obtained for exemptions to 
the conclusive criterion. 

 


The second type of criteria is indicative criteria. The indicative criteria described in SFFAC No. 
2 should be considered in the aggregate when determining what components to include in an 
executive department or agency’s organization-wide financial statement. 

 

1.5 What should the annual financial statements include? 

 

The "Annual Financial Statements" of a reporting entity shall consist of: 

 

(1) Management’s discussion and analysis (part of RSI). 

(2) Basic statements and related notes. 

(3) Required supplementary stewardship information (RSSI). 

(4) Required supplementary information (RSI). 

 

In addition, the annual financial statements may include "other accompanying information" 
(OAI). OAI should provide users of the financial statement with a better understanding of the 
entity’s programs and the extent to which the programs objectives are achieved. 

 

Preparation of the annual financial statement is the responsibility of agency management. In 
carrying out that responsibility, each agency CFO should prepare a policy bulletin or guidance 
memorandum that guides agency fiscal and management personnel in the preparation of the 
annual financial statement. 

 

The basic statements shall include: 

 

(1) Balance Sheet. 

(2) Statement of Net Cost. 

(3) Statement of Changes in Net Position. 

(4) Statement of Budgetary Resources. 

(5) Statement of Financing. 

(6) Statement of Custodial Activity, when applicable. 

 

Basic statements prepared in accordance with this Circular should present summary or detailed 
information necessary to make the statements most useful to users. Care should be taken to 
avoid placing so much detail in the body of the statements that they cannot be easily understood. 
Where substantial detail is necessary to properly convey the information, the body of the 
statement should contain summary information and the detail should be reported in notes to the 
statements. The instructions provided in the Circular for each of the basic statements describe 
how information should be presented. 

 

1.6 What elements of the Annual Financial Statements are required to be presented on a 
comparative basis? 

 


The six basic statements identified above, and the related footnotes, should present balances and 
amounts for the current year and the prior year. The MD&A should include comparisons of the 
current year to the prior year and should provide an analysis of the agency's overall financial 
position and results of operations to assist users in assessing whether that financial position has 
improved or deteriorated as a result of the year's activities. Information presented in the RSSI 
and RSI should also be presented on a comparative basis when the information would be 
meaningful to the user of the financial report. (See Section 2.1, General Instructions, for the 
implementation dates for the requirement to prepare comparative financial statements.) 

 

Note: For FY 2006, the initial year of implementation for earmarked funds, do not restate 
prior periods per the provisions of SFFAS 27. 

 

 

1.7 What steps should agencies take to ensure consistency between information presented 
in the Statement of Budgetary Resources and the Budget of the United States Government? 

 

Better linkage between budgetary information presented in the financial statements and the 
Budget of the United States Government is critical to ensuring the integrity of the numbers 
presented. Both reports contain actual information. Agencies should follow the steps identified 
below to avoid inconsistencies between the two documents: 

 

• Agencies should ensure that the budgetary information used to prepare the Statement of 
Budgetary Resources (SBR) is consistent with the budgetary information reported to the 
Federal Agencies' Centralized Trial-balance System II (FACTS II) during the 4th quarter 
window. The information submitted through the FACTS II system will be used to 
produce the 4th quarter SF 133, Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources; 
the FMS 2108, Year-end Closing Statement; and much of the initial data that will appear 
in the prior year column of the Program and Financing Schedule of the Budget. The 
budgetary information reported should be coordinated with the agency's budget office. 


 

• Due to timing differences, subsequent changes may be made to budgetary information 
included in the Budget but after the SBR has been published. Agencies should post all 
subsequent changes, whether material or non-material, to OMB's MAX A-11 budget 
preparation system during the timeframes provided by OMB. Agencies should also post 
all subsequent changes made to OMB’s MAX A-11 budget preparation system, whether 
material or non-material, to FACTS II during its revision window (November/December 
timeframe). These efforts should also be coordinated with the agency's budget office. 


 

• Agencies should discuss any material changes to budgetary information subsequent to 
the publication of the audited Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) with their 
auditors to determine if restatement or note disclosure is necessary. At a minimum, any 
material differences between comparable information contained in the SBR and the 



actual information presented in the Budget of the United States Government must be 
disclosed in the footnotes to the SBR. 


 

 

1.8 Why does the Consolidated Statement of Financing present amounts and balances on a 
consolidated and a combined basis? 

 

The Statement of Financing demonstrates the relationship between budgetary amounts reported 
on the Statement of Budgetary Resources (which is prepared on a combined basis) to the 
proprietary amounts reported on the Statement of Net Cost (which is prepared on a consolidated 
basis). The focus of this presentation is to reconcile net obligations to the net cost of operations. 

Lines number 1, 2, and 4 of the Statement of Financing are reported on a combined basis as 
presented in the Statement of Budgetary Resources. This allows the user to follow the flow of 
reported amounts through the financial statements. Line 5 (Net Obligations) of the Statement of 
Financing, while reported on what appears to be a combined basis, is in fact a consolidated 
number. This is because the intra-entity obligations reported on Line 1 are reduced by the 
corresponding intra-entity offsetting collections and recoveries reported on Line 2 and the 
offsetting receipts reported on Line 4. 

 

1.9 Should all of the lines illustrated in the Statement of Budgetary Resources and the 
Statement of Financing be presented in the agency's statements? 

 

No. The illustrative statements have been provided as a guide to assist agencies in identifying 
the proper placement of information on the statements, thus ensuring greater consistency 
between agency financial statements and the budget execution reports. Lines may be combined, 
using discretion, where balances are related in nature. Material components, however, should 
continue to be displayed separately on the face of the statement or in a footnote. 

 

 

1.10 What is required in the Performance and Accountability Reports (PAR)? 

 

The Reports Consolidation Act (RCA) of 2000 (P.L.106-531) provides permanent authority for 
agencies to integrate financial and performance information into a single, consolidated 
accountability report beginning with the FY 2000 reports. It also allows consolidation of other 
reports with OMB approval and after consultation with the appropriate Congressional 
committees. See Section 2.2 Format of the PAR for reporting requirements and layout of a final 
PAR. 

 

 

1.11 In Management's Discussion and Analysis, may agencies reference the performance 
section of the report rather than incorporating key performance measures into the 
MD&A? 

 


No. The Reports Consolidation Act was intended to provide the Congress and the public with 
one report that presents a comprehensive and integrated picture of each agency's performance. 
The performance and accountability report will provide a large amount of detail about the 
agency's financial and program performance but an overall summary of the report should be 
included in the beginning of the document. The MD&A is an excellent means of providing this 
summary. Redundancy may be reduced by providing key performance information in the 
MD&A with the other performance measures displayed in the performance section of the report. 

 


Analysis of Significant Changes 

 

The following table summarizes the significant changes reflected in this Circular based on

Section 2 – General 

Table of Contents 

 

2.1 Instructions for Agency Financial Statements 

2.2 Format of the PAR 

 

Section 2.1 -- Instructions for Agency Financial Statements 

 

A. Reporting entities should ensure that information in the financial statements is presented 
in accordance with Federal GAAP and the requirements of this Circular. Preparers of 
financial statements seeking additional guidance on matters involving the recognition, 
measurement, and disclosure requirements should refer to the specific FASAB standards 
governing those requirements. These standards are available at http://www.fasab.gov. 
Where the FASAB standards and interpretations or the instructions in this Circular do not 
provide guidance, agencies shall follow the hierarchy of accounting principles described 
in Section 1.2. 

 

 

B. Comparative financial statements are required. Information for the current and preceding 
years should be presented regardless of the type of audit opinion rendered by the auditor. 
Footnotes should contain the information necessary for full disclosure of both years. 

 

 

C. When agencies present disaggregated information for component organizations, the total 
column for the entity as a whole shall reflect consolidated totals net of intra-entity 
transactions, except for the Statement of Budgetary Resources which is presented on a 
combined basis. With the exception of the Statement of Budgetary Resources, financial 
statements that use a multi-column format to present information on an entity’s major 
components or lines of business as well as the consolidated amounts are referred to as 
consolidating statements. Eliminations for intra-entity transactions needed to arrive at 
the consolidated amounts should also be presented in a column on the face of the 
consolidating statements. 

 

 Currently the Statement of Net Cost requires certain disaggregated statements to be 
presented in the Notes to the Financial Statements. Entities may elect to include 
disaggregated statements for other primary financial statements, such as the Balance 
Sheet, Statement of Changes in Net Position and/or Statement of Custodial Activity. To 
enhance usefulness of the information, entities may include any disaggregated statements 
not presented in the Notes to the Financial Statements as Required Supplementary 
Information. 

 

 

D. The format displays in this Circular are generally for illustrative guidance only. Agencies 


may modify the displays to best present the information for their programs. In doing so, 
they may add or remove lines and may use different words than those provided in the 
displays. However, agencies must report their assets, liabilities, and net position by the 
lines displayed in the illustrative Balance Sheet and in the illustrative Statement of 
Changes in Net Position to support the compilation and audit of the FR. To enhance 
reporting at the entity-level, agencies may combine these illustrated lines in their 
statements but the composition of these lines must be provided, i.e., either as 
subcategories on the face of the statements or in a footnote. Conversely, to ensure that 
reporting at the entity-level is meaningful, agencies may also disaggregate the illustrated 
lines in their statements but the total of these lines must be provided, i.e., either a total on 
the face of the statement or in a footnote. 

 

E. Combine lines using discretion, where balances are related in nature and are not material 
enough to warrant separate disclosures. Designate discrete balances of an immaterial 
amount as "other." The "other" category should not aggregate to an amount which is 
material. 

 

F. Exclude statement line items, footnotes, and lines or columns in footnotes that do not 
apply or, except as described in D above, are not informative for the reporting entity. 

 

G. Schedule totals presented in the footnotes, in support of amounts presented in financial 
statements, must agree with the amounts presented in the body of the financial 
statements. 

 

H. Round dollar amounts to the nearest whole dollar, thousand, or million based upon 
informative value to the reporting entity. Maintain the chosen rounding level throughout 
the principal statements and footnotes. Ensure that individual line items add up to the 
totals by adjusting the line items for differences created by the rounding process rather 
than adjusting column totals. 

 

I. Do not use line numbers on illustrative statement formats. They are for reference 
purposes only. 

 

J. Sequentially number footnotes without regard to the numbers in this document. 

 

K. Interim unaudited financial statements, without footnotes, are required on a quarterly 
basis. The interim statements must be submitted to OMB 21 days after the end of each 
quarter. Interim statements may be limited to a Balance Sheet, Statement of Net Cost, 
and Statement of Budgetary Resources. Management Discussion and Analysis, RSSI, 
and RSI are not required for quarterly reporting. OMB Bulletin 01-02, “Audits of Federal 
Financial Statements," Appendix B (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/), lists major agency 
components that are required to prepare financial statements and subject them to annual 
audits. 


2 Agencies are also encouraged to develop a brief highlights version of the annual PAR. The PAR Highlights should 
exist as a standalone document, presenting key findings and relevant financial and performance data. Agencies 
should prepare the highlights document in a manner and writing style appropriate for the general public. Agencies 
may find it useful to prepare a PAR highlights with a CD of the entire PAR document included as an alternative to 
distributing numerous printed copies of the entire PAR document. 

 

Section 2.2 – Format of the PAR 

 

The purpose of this section is to provide reporting requirements and layout for a complete and 
final Performance and Accountability Report (PAR)2. 

 

2.2A Agency Head (Secretary) Message: 

A dated transmittal letter signed by the agency head should be located at the beginning of the 
report. It must include: 

A brief message from the agency head highlighting: 

 

(1) The Agency’s mission, goals and accomplishments upholding the mission. 
(2) An assessment of whether financial and performance data in the report is reliable and 
complete, identifying material internal control weaknesses and actions the agency is 
taking to resolve them, (the letter may reference a more detailed discussion of this topic 
elsewhere in the report); and 
(3) A Federal Manager’s Financial Integrity Act (Integrity Act) statement of assurance 
indicating whether (a) management controls are in place and (b) financial systems 
conform with government-wide standards. The statement must take one of the following 
forms: statement of assurance; qualified statement of assurance, with exceptions 
explicitly noted; or statement of no assurance. (Effective through FY 2005) 


 

2.2B Part 1: Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

 

A PAR must contain a section entitled Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The 
MD&A is Section 1 of the PAR and should follow the Agency Head (Secretary) Message. To be 
useful, it must be concise and readable to a non-technical audience. The MD&A is an overview 
of the Financial and Performance results. See Section 11 of this document for an outline of the 
required information to be included in the MD&A. Beginning with FY 2006, Management 
Assurances required under the Integrity Act and OMB Circular A-123, Management’s 
Responsibility for Internal Control must be separately identified within the MD&A as part of the 
information provided in accordance with Section 11.1G Analysis of the Entity’s Systems, 
Controls and Legal Compliance. 

 

 

 


 

2.2C Part 2: Performance Section 

 

The annual program performance information submitted per the Government Performance and 
Results Act (GPRA) should contain all of the required elements for the Annual Performance

3.1 General 

 

The balance sheet presents, as of a specific time, amounts of future economic benefits owned or 
managed by the reporting entity exclusive of items subject to stewardship reporting (assets), 
amounts owed by the entity (liabilities), and amounts which comprise the difference (net 
position). 

 

The balance sheet displayed in Section 3.2A and B illustrates a consolidated two-column format 
to allow the user to make appropriate comparisons with prior periods. Reporting entities 
preparing financial statements in accordance with this Circular may present similar information 
or may present information in separate columns for their primary components, e.g., bureaus or 
major lines of business. 

 

Combine entity and non-entity assets on the face of the balance sheet and disclose non-entity 
assets in the footnotes. Combine liabilities covered by budgetary resources and liabilities not 
covered by budgetary resources on the face of the balance sheet. Disclose liabilities not covered 
by budgetary resources in the footnotes. 

 

SFFAS 27, Identifying and Reporting Earmarked Funds, is effective for periods beginning 
after September 30, 2005. See Note 9.20 and SFFAS 27 for more details on earmarked 
funds. The Illustrative Statement (3.2.B) - Consolidated Balance Sheet (Beginning FY2006) 
shows the portion of cumulative results of operations and unexpended appropriations for 
earmarked funds separately from all other funds on the face of the balance sheet. Based on 
SFFAS 27 requirements, prior periods shall not be restated in the initial year of implementation 
(FY 2006). For the purposes of earmarked funds, FY 2005 should not be restated. Also, the 
provisions of SFFAS 27 need not be applied to immaterial items.

3.3 Assets 

 

General Categories. Assets are tangible or intangible items owned by the Federal Government 
which have probable economic benefits that can be obtained or controlled by a Federal 
Government entity. The intragovernmental assets of an agency are separately reported on the 
face of the balance sheet. Non-entity assets, which may be intragovernmental or governmental 
(i.e., non-Federal), are separately disclosed in the footnotes. Entity, non-entity, and 
intragovernmental assets are defined below in accordance with SFFAS No. 1. 

 

Entity Assets. These are assets that the reporting entity has authority to use in its operations. 
The authority to use funds in an entity's operations means that entity management has the 
authority to decide how funds are used, or management is legally obligated to use funds to 
meet entity obligations, e.g., repay loans from Treasury. 

 

Non-Entity Assets. These are assets that are held by an entity but are not available to the 
entity. An example of non-entity assets is income tax receivables, which the Internal 
Revenue Service collects for the U.S. Government but has no authority to spend. 

 

Combine entity and non-entity assets on the face of the balance sheet, e.g., entity 
intragovernmental accounts receivable and non-entity intragovernmental accounts receivable 
shall be combined and reported as a single intragovernmental accounts receivable line item 
on the face of the balance sheet. Disclose non-entity assets in a note to the financial 
statements (Note 2; Section 9.2). 

 

Intragovernmental Assets. These assets arise from transactions among Federal entities. 
These assets are claims of a Federal entity against other Federal entities. Report 
intragovernmental assets separately from transactions with non-Federal entities, the Federal 
Reserve, and government-sponsored enterprises (i.e., Federally chartered but privately owned 
and operated entities). The term "non-Federal entity" encompasses domestic and foreign 
persons and organizations outside the U. S. Government. 

 

Fund Balance with Treasury. This is the aggregate amount of the entity's accounts with 
Treasury for which the entity is authorized to make expenditures and pay liabilities. This 
account includes clearing account balances and the dollar equivalent of foreign currency account 
balances. 

 

Foreign currency account balances reported on the balance sheet shall be translated into U.S. 
dollars at exchange rates determined by the Treasury and effective on the financial reporting 
date. 

To the extent that the reporting entity maintains fund balances in deposit, suspense, and clearing 
accounts that are not available to finance the entity's activities, those balances should be 
disclosed as non-entity assets. The fund balance which the entity is authorized to use shall be 


disclosed by fund type in the notes to the financial statement; e.g., trust fund, revolving fund, etc. 
(Note 3; Section 9.3) 

 

Cash and Other Monetary Assets. Cash consists of: (i) coins, paper currency and readily 
negotiable instruments, such as money orders, checks, and bank drafts on hand or in transit for 
deposit; (ii) amounts on demand deposit with banks or other financial institutions; (iii) cash held 
in imprest funds; and, (iv) foreign currencies which, for accounting purposes, shall be translated 
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the financial statement date. Other monetary assets 
include gold, special drawing rights, and U.S. Reserves in the International Monetary Fund. This 
category is principally for use by the Department of the Treasury. The amount of cash and other 
monetary assets that the reporting entity holds and is authorized to spend is entity cash. The cash 
and other monetary assets that a Federal entity collects and holds on behalf of the U.S. 
Government or other entities are non-entity cash and other monetary assets. The components of 
cash and other monetary assets shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statement. (Note 4; 
Section 9.4) 

 

Investments. Investments in Federal securities shall be reported separately from investments in 
non-Federal securities. Investments in Federal securities include non-marketable par value 
Treasury securities, market-based Treasury securities, marketable Treasury securities, and 
securities issued by other Federal entities. Non-Federal securities include those issued by State 
and local governments, Government-Sponsored Enterprises, and other private corporations. 
Investments are normally reported at acquisition cost or amortized acquisition cost (less an 
allowance for losses, if any). The components of investments, including the market value of 
market-based and marketable Treasury securities, shall be disclosed (Note 5; Section 9.5). (See 
SFFAS No. 1 for further information on investments in par value Treasury securities and in 
marketable and market-based Treasury securities expected to be held to maturity.) Effective FY 
2006, reporting entities with material investments in Treasury securities attributable to 
earmarked funds must include in the required Note (Note 5; Section 9.5) on Investments as 
described in SFFAS 27, paragraphs 27 and 28. 

 

Accounts Receivable, Net. Federal entity claims for payment from other entities. Gross 
receivables shall be reduced to net realizable value by an allowance for doubtful accounts. 
Disclose the method(s) of calculating the allowance for doubtful accounts and the dollar amount 
of the allowance (Note 6; Section 9.6). 

 

Taxes Receivable, Net. Federal entity claims for taxes owed by the public. Gross receivables 
shall be reduced to net realizable value by an allowance for uncollectible taxes receivable. 
Disclose the method(s) of calculating the allowance for uncollectible taxes and the dollar amount 
of the allowance (Note 7; Section 9.7). 

 

Interest Receivable, Net. Interest income earned but not received as of the reporting date. 
Report interest receivable as a component of the appropriate asset accounts. No interest shall be 
recognized as revenue on accounts receivable and investments that are determined to be 


uncollectible, until the interest is actually collected. Accrued interest on uncollectible accounts 
receivable, however, shall be disclosed until the requirement to pay interest is waived by the 
Federal Government or the related bad debt is written off. 

 

Interest receivable related to pre-1992 and post-1991 direct loans and acquired defaulted 
guaranteed loans shall be reported as a component of loans receivable and related foreclosed 
property. 

 

Loans Receivable and Related Foreclosed Property, Net. The net value of credit program 
receivables and related foreclosed property are considered an entity asset if, as provided by law 
or OMB Circulars, the entity has the authority to determine the use of the funds collected, or if 
the entity is legally obligated to use the funds to meet entity obligations, e. g., loans payable to 
Treasury. Disclose the components of this line in the notes to the financial statement (Note 8; 
Section 9.8). 

 

Receivable from Borrowings. When a loan guarantee program, which is generating negative 
subsidy, guarantees a loan and the lender has not disbursed the loan as of the balance sheet date, 
a proprietary receivable from borrowings shall not be reported. It is sufficient to report the 
undelivered order, which is recorded to obligate the funds, and the borrowing authority or 
unobligated balances to support the undelivered order. 

 

Negative Subsidies and Downward Reestimates of Subsidy. Special fund receipt accounts for 
negative subsidies and downward subsidy reestimates are to be included in the credit reporting 
entity’s financial statements. Any assets in the accounts are non-entity assets and are offset by 
intragovernmental liabilities covered by budgetary resources. 

 

Inventory and related property, Net. Disclose additional information about each category 
below in the notes to the financial statement (Note 9; Section 9.9). 

 

CATEGORY DESCRIPTION 

 

Inventory Tangible personal property that is (i) held for sale, including raw 
materials and work in process, (ii) in the process of production for 
sale, or (iii) to be consumed in the production of goods for sale or 
in the provision of services for a fee. 

 

Operating materials Tangible personal property to be consumed in normal 

and supplies operations. 

 

Stockpile materials Strategic and critical materials held due to statutory requirements 
for use in national defense, conservation or national emergencies. 
They are not held with the intent of selling in the ordinary course 
of business. 


 

Seized property Monetary instruments, real property, and tangible personal 
property of others, including illegal drugs, contraband, and 
counterfeit items seized by authorized law enforcement agencies as 
a consequence of various laws, in the actual or constructive 
possession of a custodial agency. 

 

 Only seized monetary instruments shall be recognized as seized 
assets when seized (and a liability shall be reported in Other 
Liabilities in an amount equal to the seized asset value). Seized 
property other than monetary instruments and additional 
information regarding seized property shall be disclosed. 

 

Forfeited property (i) Monetary instruments, intangible property, real property, and 
tangible personal property acquired through forfeiture proceedings; 
(ii) property acquired by the government to satisfy a taxpayer's 
liability; and (iii) unclaimed and abandoned merchandise. 

 

Goods held under These goods are referred to as commodities. Commodities 

price support and are items of commerce or trade having an exchange value. 

 stabilization programs 

 

General Property, Plant and Equipment, Net. SFFAS No. 6, as amended by SFFAS 11, 16 
and 23, defines general property, plant and equipment (PP&E) as any PP&E used in providing 
goods and services. SFFAS No. 6 also provides guidance for determining the cost of general 
PP&E acquired by purchase, capital lease, donation, devise, judicial process, exchange, 
forfeiture, or transfer from other Federal entities. Minimum disclosure requirements for general 
PP&E can be found in section 9.10. 

 

General PP&E has one or more of the following characteristics: 

 

• It is primarily used to produce goods or services, or to support the mission of the entity. 
But, it may be used for alternative purposes (e.g., by other Federal programs, State or 
local governments, or non-governmental entities). or 


 

• It is used in a significantly self-sustaining activity which finances its continuing cycle 
of operations through the collection of revenue (business-type activities), or 


 

• It is used by entities in activities whose costs can be compared to other entities 
performing similar activities. 


 

For entities operating as business-type activities, all PP&E shall be categorized as general PP&E 
whether or not it meets the definition of other PP&E categories (e.g., heritage assets). 


Land and land rights acquired for or in connection with general PP&E shall be included in 
general PP&E. 

 

Internal use software, whether commercial off-the-shelf, internally developed or contractor 
developed, shall be capitalized and depreciated if it meets the criteria of general PP&E. Refer to 
SFFAS No. 10 for further guidance on internal use software. 

 

Depreciation shall be recognized on all general PP&E, except land and land rights of unlimited 
duration. The depreciation expense associated with the use of general PP&E is calculated 
through the systematic and rational allocation of the cost, less its estimated salvage/residual 
value, over the estimated useful life of the general PP&E. 

 

Heritage assets, and stewardship land are categories of PP&E not reported on the balance sheet 
with one exception. Multi-use heritage assets are heritage assets that are predominantly used in 
general government operations (e.g., buildings, such as the main Treasury building which is used 
as an office building). The cost of acquisition, betterment, or reconstruction of multi-use 
heritage assets shall be capitalized as general PP&E and depreciated, with an appropriate 
footnote disclosure explaining that physical quantity information for the multi-use heritage assets 
is included in Required Supplemental Stewardship Information reporting for heritage assets 
(Section 10.2). 

 

Other Assets. The "Other" assets category shall include assets that are not reported in a separate 
category on the face of the balance sheet. Reporting entities should disclose in the notes the 
amount and nature of categories of "Other" assets (Note 11; Section 9.11). 

 

Examples of “Other” Assets may include, but are not limited to, advances and prepayments. 
Advances are cash outlays made by a Federal entity to its employees, contractors, grantees or 
others to cover a part or all of the recipients' anticipated expenses or as advance payments for the 
costs of goods and services the entity receives. Prepayments are payments made by a Federal 
entity to cover certain periodic expenses before those expenses are incurred. Progress payments 
on work in process are not to be included in advances and prepayments. 

 

3.4 Liabilities 

 

General Categories. A liability is a probable future outflow or other sacrifice of resources as a 
result of past transactions or events. Financial statements shall recognize probable and 
measurable future outflows or other sacrifices of resources arising from (1) past exchange 
transactions, (2) government-related events, (3) government-acknowledged events, or (4) 
nonexchange transactions that, according to current law and applicable policy, are unpaid 
amounts due as of the reporting date. SFFAS No. 5 describes the general principles governing 
the recognition of a liability. 

 

Liabilities shall be recognized when they are incurred regardless of whether they are covered by 


available budgetary resources. This includes liabilities related to appropriations canceled under 
"M" account legislation (P.L. 101-510, Sec.1405). 

 

Liabilities of Federal agencies are classified as liabilities covered or not covered by budgetary 
resources. The intragovernmental liabilities of an agency are separately classified on the face of 
the balance sheet. These terms are defined below in accordance with SFFAS No. 1. 

 

Liabilities Covered by Budgetary Resources. Liabilities incurred which are covered by 
realized budgetary resources as of the balance sheet date. Budgetary resources encompass 
not only new budget authority but also other resources available to cover liabilities for 
specified purposes in a given year. Available budgetary resources include: (1) new budget 
authority, (2) unobligated balances of budgetary resources at the beginning of the year or net 
transfers of prior year balances during the year, (3) spending authority from offsetting 
collections (credited to an appropriation or fund account), and (4) recoveries of unexpired 
budget authority through downward adjustments of prior year obligations. Liabilities are 
considered covered by budgetary resources if they are to be funded by permanent indefinite 
appropriations, which have been enacted and signed into law and are available for use as of 
the balance sheet date, provided that the resources may be apportioned by OMB without 
further action by the Congress and without a contingency having to be met first. 

 

Liabilities Not Covered by Budgetary Resources. This category is for liabilities which are 
not considered to be covered by budgetary resources, as provided in the previous paragraph. 

 

Combine liabilities covered by budgetary resources with liabilities not covered by budgetary 
resources on the face of the balance sheet, e.g., intragovernmental accounts payable covered by 
budgetary resources and intragovernmental accounts payable not covered by budgetary resources 
shall be combined and reported as a single intragovernmental accounts payable line item on the 
face of the balance sheet. Disclose liabilities not covered by budgetary resources in a note to the 
financial statements (Note 12; Section 9.12). 

 

Intragovernmental Liabilities. These liabilities are claims against the entity by other Federal 
entities. Report intragovernmental liabilities separately from claims against the reporting 
entity by non-Federal entities, including government-sponsored enterprises, and the Federal 
Reserve System. 

 

Accounts Payable. The amounts owed by the reporting entity for goods and services received 
from other entities, progress in contract performance made by other entities, and rents due to 
other entities. 

 

Interest Payable. Interest incurred but unpaid on liabilities of the reporting entity. Report 
interest payable as a component of the appropriate liability accounts. 

 

Liabilities for Loan Guarantees. For post-1991 loan guarantees, the present value of the 


estimated net cash flows to be paid as a result of loan guarantees. For pre-1992 loan guarantees, 
the amount of known and estimated losses to be payable. Disclose the components of the line in 
the notes to the financial statement (Note 8; Section 9.8). 

 

Negative Loan Guarantee Liability. When the total loan guarantee liability for all credit 
programs of a reporting entity is negative, it should be reported as an asset. If a loan guarantee 
liability is the result of both positive and negative amounts for the various components, the total 
will be shown as a liability, and negative components disclosed. 

 

Debt. Amounts borrowed from the Treasury, the Federal Financing Bank, other Federal 
agencies, or the public under general or special financing authority (e.g., Treasury bills, notes, 
bonds and Federal Housing Administration debentures). The components of debt shall be 
disclosed in the notes to the financial statement (Note 13; Section 9.13). 

 

Federal Employee and Veteran Benefits. Entities that are responsible for administering 
pensions, other retirement benefits (e.g., health benefits for retirees), and other post-employment 
benefits should calculate and report these liabilities and related expenses in accordance with 
SFFAS No. 5. Liabilities for Federal employee and veteran benefits include the actuarial portion 
of these benefits. They do not include liabilities related to ongoing continuous expenses such as 
employees’ accrued salary and accrued annual leave, which are reported in the Other liabilities 
line item. Disclose in the notes to the financial statements the actuarial liabilities, assumptions 
used to compute the actuarial liabilities, and the components of expense for the period for 
pensions, other retirement benefits, and other post-employment benefits (Note 14; Section 9.14). 

 

Environmental and Disposal Liabilities. SFFAS No. 5 provides criteria for recognizing a 
contingent liability, which shall be applied to determine if cleanup costs should be recognized as 
liabilities and/or disclosed in the notes. SFFAS No. 6 supplements the liability standard by 
providing guidance for recording cleanup costs related to general PP&E and stewardship assets 
used in Federal operations. The guidance applies to cleanup costs from Federal operations 
known to result in hazardous waste which the Federal Government is required by Federal, State 
and/or local statutes and/or regulations to cleanup. Depending on the materiality of the amount, 
the liability for cleanup costs may be displayed separately or included with Other liabilities. The 
footnote disclosures required for liabilities (Note 15; Section 9.15) associated with cleanup costs 
are described in SFFAS No. 6. 

 

Benefits Due and Payable. These are amounts owed to program recipients or medical service 
providers as of the balance sheet date that have not yet been paid. These amounts include 
payables by the Federal entity for benefits, goods, or services provided under the terms of a 
benefits program (other than Federal employee and veteran benefits programs), whether or not 
such amounts have been reported to the Federal entity (e.g., estimated payments due to health 
providers for services that have been rendered and that will be financed by the Federal entity but 
have not yet been reported to the Federal entity). Benefit programs reported on this line item 
include, but are not limited to, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Federal Hospital 


Insurance (Medicare Part A), Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance (Medicare Part B), 
Grants to States for Medicaid, Federal Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, 
Railroad Retirement, Unemployment Insurance, and Black Lung. 

 

Other Liabilities. This line item covers liabilities that are not recognized in specific categories. 
It includes (but is not limited to) liabilities related to: capital leases, insurance, advances and 
prepayments, deposit fund amounts held in escrow, and accrued liabilities related to ongoing 
continuous expenses such as Federal employee salaries and accrued employee annual leave. 
This item also covers estimated losses for claims or other contingencies if (1) a past event or 
exchange transaction has occurred (e.g., a Federal entity has breached a contract with a non-
Federal entity) as of the date of the statements, (2) a future outflow or other sacrifice of resources 
is probable, and (3) the future outflow or sacrifice of resources is measurable (e.g., the amount 
can be reasonably estimated). Do not include cleanup costs, if material, which shall be reported 
as environmental and disposal costs. Examples of claims or other contingencies include: (1) 
indemnity agreements -- reimbursements due to licensees or contractors for losses incurred in 
support of Federal activities; (2) adjudicated claims -- claims against the Federal Government 
that are in the process of judicial proceedings; and (3) commitments to international institutions -
- payments due to international financial institutions. Separate reporting of items within other 
liabilities is appropriate if the amounts are significant to the balance sheet. Disclose the items 
within this line and any additional information necessary to understand the liabilities in the notes 
to the financial statement (Note 16; Section 9.16). 

 

Lease Liabilities. This item is the liability for capital leases. Report the lease liability as a 
component of the Other Liabilities line item on the balance sheet and disclose the components of 
and other information about the capital lease liability in a separate footnote (Note 17; Section 
9.17). According to OMB Circular No. A-11 Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates, 
capital leases entered into during FY 1992 and thereafter are required to be fully funded in the 
first year of the lease. 

 

Insurance Liabilities. Report insurance liabilities as a component of the Other Liabilities line 
item on the balance sheet and disclose insurance liabilities in a separate footnote (Note 18; 
Section 9.18). Entities with Federal insurance and guarantee programs, except social insurance 
and loan guarantee programs, shall recognize a liability for unpaid claims incurred, resulting 
from insured events that have occurred as of the reporting date. The amount recognized is the 
liability known with certainty plus an accrual for a contingent liability recognized when an 
existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss 
exists and the uncertainty shall ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or 
fail to occur, a future outflow or other sacrifice of resources is probable, and the future outflow 
or sacrifice of resources is measurable. Life insurance programs shall recognize a liability for 
future policy benefits in addition to the liability for unpaid claims incurred. 

 

Commitments and Contingencies. A loss contingency is an existing condition, situation, or 
set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity. The uncertainty 


should ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The 
likelihood that the future event or events will confirm the loss or the incurrence of a liability can 
range from probable to remote. SFFAS No. 5, as amended by SFFAS No. 12, contains the 
criteria for recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities. In addition to the contingent 
liabilities required by SFFAS No. 5, the following shall also be disclosed: (1) an estimate of 
obligations related to canceled appropriations for which the reporting entity has a contractual 
commitment for payment, and (2) amounts for contractual arrangements which may require 
future financial obligations (Note 19; Section 9.19). 

 

3.5 Net Position 

 

The components of net position are classified as follows: 

 

Unexpended Appropriations. This amount includes the portion of the entity's appropriations 
represented by undelivered orders and unobligated balances. Unexpended appropriations 
attributable to earmarked funds, if material, should be shown separately on the face of the 
balance sheet upon implementation of SFFAS 27 in FY 2006. (Note 20; Section 9.20) 

 

 

Cumulative Results of Operations. The net results of operations since inception plus the 
cumulative amount of prior period adjustments. This includes the cumulative amount of 
donations and transfers of assets in and out without reimbursement. Beginning in FY 2006, 
cumulative results of operations attributable to earmarked funds, if material, should be 
shown separately on the face of the balance sheet, in accordance with the provisions of 
SFFAS 27. (Note 20; Section 9.20)

4.1 General 

 

The Statement of Net Cost is designed to show separately the components of the net cost of the 
reporting entity's operations for the period. However, the organizational structure and operations 
of some entities are so complex that to fully display their suborganizations’ major programs and 
activities may require supporting schedules to supplement the information in the Statement of 
Net Cost. The supporting schedules shall be included in the notes to the financial statements. 

 

Net cost of operations is the gross cost incurred by the reporting entity less any exchange 
revenue earned from its activities. The gross cost of a program consists of the full cost of the 
outputs produced by that program plus any non-production costs that can be assigned to the 
program (non-production costs are costs linked to events other than the production of goods and 
services). The net cost of a program consists of gross cost less related exchange revenues. By 
disclosing the gross and net cost of the entity's programs, the Statement of Net Cost provides 
information that can be related to the outputs and outcomes of the programs and activities. 

 

The Statement of Net Cost and related supporting schedules classify revenue and cost 
information by suborganization or responsibility segment and, to the extent practicable, within 
each classification by major program. (Suborganizations are considered to be generally 
equivalent to responsibility segments.) Preparers of the Statement of Net Cost should present 
responsibility segments that align directly with the major goals and outputs described in the 
entity's strategic and performance plans, required by the Government Performance and Results 
Act (GPRA). 

 

The Statement of Net Cost and related supporting schedules should show the net cost of 
operations for the reporting entity as a whole and its programs and suborganizations. This can be 
accomplished by reporting by program: (1) Expense costs, (2) related exchange revenues, (3) the 
excess of costs over exchange revenues (net program costs), (4) the costs that cannot be assigned 


to specific programs or outputs, and (5) the exchange revenues that cannot be attributed to 
specific programs and outputs. 

 

 Intragovernmental gross costs and earned revenues shall be disclosed in Note 21. 

 

The changes in Illustrative Statement 4.2 Consolidated Statement for Net Cost is effective for 
FY 2006, however, early implementation is permitted. For agencies not implementing in 
FY 2005, refer to OMB Bulletin 01-09, Section 4 for illustrative guidance. 

 

Preparers are encouraged to consult the Implementation Guide to SFFAS No. 7, Accounting for 
Revenue and Other Financing Sources, for illustrations and explanations designed to assist in 
understanding and applying the standards for classifying, recognizing, and measuring inflows of 
resources to the Federal Government and its component reporting entities.

4.3 Program Costs 

 

The reporting entity should report the full cost of each program’s output, which consists of (a) 
both direct and indirect costs of the output, and (b) the costs of identifiable supporting services 
provided by other segments within the reporting entity and by other reporting entities. The 
reporting entity should accumulate and assign costs in accordance with the costing methodology 
in SFFAS No. 4. Program costs also include any non-production costs that can be assigned to 
the program but not to its outputs. The costs of program outputs shall include the costs of 
services provided by other entities whether or not the providing entity is fully reimbursed. 

The costs of program outputs shall include specific imputed costs that are incurred by the 
reporting entity but paid in total or in part by other entities to the extent that accounting standards 


require them to be recognized in financial statements (See FASAB Interpretation No. 6 
Accounting for Imputed Intra-departmental Costs: An Interpretation of SFFAS 4). In the case of 
employee benefits, the imputed amount is the difference between employer/employee 
contributions and the total cost of the benefit. 

 

Reporting entities are required to recognize the following costs, including the portions that are 
funded through the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Department of Defense, the 
Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, or other agencies: (1) employees’ pension, 
post-retirement health and life insurance benefits, (2) other post-employment benefits for retired, 
terminated, and inactive employees, which includes unemployment and workers compensation 
under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, and (3) losses in litigation proceedings (see 
FASAB Interpretation No. 2, Accounting for Treasury Judgment Fund Transactions). To ensure 
consistency, agencies should not recognize costs other than those listed until OMB provides 
further guidance. 

 

In accounting for the listed costs, reporting entities should refer to relevant SFFAS and 
Interpretations, such as SFFAS Nos. 4 and 5 and Interpretation No. 2, the Standard General 
Ledger, and the Department of Treasury Financial Management Service Intragovernmental 
Fiduciary Transactions Accounting Guide for guidance. Reporting entities should also consult 
with the funding and administering agencies, such as OPM, for information needed to properly 
record inter-entity costs. For further guidance on the recognition of inter-entity costs that are not 
fully reimbursed or are not reimbursed at all, the reporting entity should consult the inter-entity 
cost standard in SFFAS No. 4. 

 

 

Costs related to the production of outputs shall be reported separately from costs that are not 
related to the production of outputs (e.g., non-production costs). In addition, the costs of 
stewardship PP&E, listed below, shall be reported separately from other non-production costs: 

 

• The cost of acquiring, constructing, improving, reconstructing, or renovating heritage 
assets, other than multi-use heritage assets; and 
• The cost of acquiring stewardship land. 


 

Agencies should consider differentiating other significant costs if by doing so the usefulness of 
the statements would be improved either because the amount of a particular cost is large or 
because of its special nature. For example, when reporting on a program that makes transfer 
payments, it may be useful to differentiate between the transfer payments and administrative 
costs. 

 

4.4 Earned Revenues 

 

Earned revenues are exchange revenues, which arise when a Federal entity provides goods and 
services to the public or to another government entity for a price. The full amount of exchange 


revenue is to be reported on the Statement of Net Cost or a supplementary schedule, regardless 
of whether the entity is permitted to retain the revenues in whole or in part. Any portion of 
exchange revenue that cannot be retained by the entity is reported as a transfer-out on the 
Statement of Changes in Net Position. (See SFFAS No. 7 for information on exchange 
revenues.) 

 

Earned revenues should be deducted from the full cost of outputs or outcomes to determine their 
net cost unless it is not practical or reasonably possible to do so. However, there are no precise 
guidelines to determine the degree to which earned revenue can reasonably be attributed to 
outputs, outcomes, programs, or suborganizations. The attribution of earned revenues requires 
the exercise of managerial judgment. In exercising this judgment, it is important to provide users 
of the Statement of Net Cost with the ability to ascertain whether exchange revenues are 
sufficient to cover the costs incurred to produce the goods or services involved. Earned revenue 
shall be deducted from the gross cost of programs to determine the net program costs 

 

4.5 Net Program Costs 

 

This is the difference between a program's gross costs and its related exchange revenues. If a 
program does not earn any exchange revenue, there is no netting and the term used might be total 
program costs. 

 

4.6 Costs Not Assigned to Programs 

 

A reporting entity and its suborganizations may incur: (a) high level general management and 
administrative support costs that cannot be directly traced, assigned on a cause-and-effect basis, 
or reasonably allocated to segments and their outputs and (b) non-production costs that cannot be 
assigned to a particular program. These costs are part of the entity and suborganization costs and 
should be reported on the Statement of Net Cost as "costs not assigned to programs." 

 

4.7 Earned Revenues Not Attributed to Programs 

 

Earned revenue that is insignificant or cannot be attributed to particular outputs or programs 
should be reported separately as a deduction in arriving at net cost of operations of the 
suborganization or reporting entity as a whole. 

 

4.8 Net Cost of Operations 

 

This is the gross cost incurred by the reporting entity less any exchange revenue earned from its 
activities. This amount represents the net cost of a suborganization or entity that is funded by 
sources other than exchange revenues. The financing sources for net cost of operations are 
reported on the Statement of Changes in Net Position.

5.1 General 

 

The Statement of Changes in Net Position reports the change in net position during the reporting 
period. Net position is affected by changes to its two components: Cumulative Results of 
Operations and Unexpended Appropriations. The statement format is designed to display both 
components of net position separately to enable the user to better understand the nature of 
changes to net position as a whole.

5.3 Earmarked Funds 

Effective FY 2006, report earmarked non-exchange revenue and other financing sources, 
including appropriations, and net cost of operations separately on the face of the Statement of 
Changes in Net Position to implement SFFAS 27, Identifying and Reporting Earmarked Funds. 
Report the portions of cumulative results of operations and unexpended appropriations 
attributable to earmarked funds separately on the face of the Statement of Changes in Net 
Position as illustrated in 5.2B. See Note 9.20 and SFFAS 27 for more detailed information. 
SFFAS 27 contains certain categories of funds that are excluded from the reporting requirements 
and specific guidance if more than one component entity is responsible for carrying out a 
program financed with earmarked revenues and other financing sources. 

 

Based on SFFAS 27 requirements, prior periods shall not be restated in the initial year of 
implementation (FY 2006). Therefore, for FY 2005, do not restate. The provisions of SFFAS 27 
need not be applied to immaterial items. Eliminations between earmarked funds and other 
funds within the reporting entity, where applicable, should be disclosed in Note 20, Earmarked 
Funds. 

 

5.4 Net Position - Beginning Balances 

 

Effective FY 2006: If material, the net position balances attributable to earmarked funds are 
reported separately from all other funds. Beginning balances shall agree with the amounts 


3 Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, par. 13. 

reported as net position on the prior year's balance sheet. Adjustments for corrections of errors 
and changes in accounting principles should be reported in accordance with SFFAS 21, 
Reporting Corrections of Errors and Changes in Accounting Principles. 

 

Corrections of Errors 

“Errors in financial statements result from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of 
accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the financial 
statements were prepared.”3 Once it has been determined that an error has occurred and 
restatement is required, the following provides guidance from SFFAS 21 on how management 
should correct an error in the financial statements. 

Paragraph 10: When errors are discovered after the issuance of financial statements, and if the 
financial statements would be materially misstated absent correction of the errors, 
corrections should be made as follows: 

(a) If only the current period statements are presented, then the cumulative effect 
of correcting the error should be reported as a prior period adjustment. The 
adjustment should be made to the beginning balance of cumulative results of 
operations, in the statement of changes in net position. 
(b) If comparative financial statements are presented, then the error should be 
corrected in the earliest affected period presented by correcting any individual 
amounts on the financial statements. If the earliest period presented is not the 
period in which the error occurred and the cumulative effect is attributable to 
prior periods, then the cumulative effect should be reported as a prior period 
adjustment. The adjustment should be made to the beginning balance of 
cumulative results of operations, in the statement of changes in net position 
for the earliest period presented. 
(c) The nature of an error in previously issued financial statements and the effect 
of its correction on relevant balances should be disclosed. Financial 
statements of subsequent periods need not repeat the disclosures. 


Paragraph 11: Prior period financial statements should only be restated for corrections of errors 
that would have caused any statements presented to be materially misstated. 


Management Actions Related to Correction of Errors 

The following policy relates to actions required by management concerning material errors that 
escaped detection until after they were included in the published audited financial statements. 
Management shall assume responsibility for any false or misleading information in the financial 
statements, or omissions that render information made in the financial statements misleading. As 
such, as soon as possible after errors are detected, management shall notify their auditors and 
inform their primary users of their financial statements of the error and plans for correcting it in 
the financial statements. 

Auditors are bound by the requirements of the AICPA audit standards, AU 561, Subsequent 
Discovery of Facts Existing at the Date of the Auditor's Report. Based on this guidance, the 
auditor determines whether action should be taken to prevent future reliance on the published 
audit report. If the auditor decides that the effect on the financial statements or auditor’s report of 
the subsequently discovered information can promptly be determined, the auditor may determine 
that disclosure should consist of issuing, as soon as practicable, revised financial statements and 
auditor’s report. However, if it is determined by the auditor that subsequently discovered 
information is not reliable; the auditor may decide to change the audit opinion. Therefore, it is 
imperative that management work with their auditor as soon as the error is detected to assist the 
auditor in any actions that need to be taken. 

See Note 9.41 Restatements for specific information to be included in the financial statement 
notes. 

Changes in Accounting Principles 

A change in accounting principle is a change from one generally accepted accounting principle 
to another one that can be justified as preferable. For the purposes of this standard, changes in 
accounting principles also include those occasioned by the adoption of new federal financial 
accounting standards. 

Unless otherwise specified in transitioning instructions of a new FASAB standard, for all 
changes in accounting principles that would have resulted in a change to prior period financial 
statements: 

(a) The cumulative effect of the change on prior periods should be reported as a 
“change in accounting principle.” The adjustment should be made to the beginning 
balance of cumulative results of operations in the statement of changes in net 
position for the period that the change is made. 

(b) Prior period financial statements presented for comparative purposes should be 
presented as previously reported; and 

(c) The nature of the changes in accounting principle and its effect on relevant balances 
should be disclosed in the current period. Financial statements of subsequent 
periods need not repeat the disclosure. 


 

Beginning balances, as adjusted, are the sum of the beginning balances of net position as 
reported on the prior year’s Balance Sheet and prior period adjustments. 

 

5.5 Budgetary Financing Sources 

 

This section displays financing sources and nonexchange revenue that are also budgetary 
resources, or adjustments to those resources, as reported on the Statement of Budgetary 
Resources and defined as such by OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and 
Execution of the Budget, as amended. 

 

Appropriations received. This amount includes “appropriations received” during the current 
reporting period. These are amounts appropriated from Treasury General Fund receipts, such as 
income taxes, that are not earmarked by law for a specific purpose. This amount will not 
necessarily agree with the “appropriations received” amount reported on the Statement of 
Budgetary Resources (SBR) because of differences between proprietary and budgetary 
accounting concepts and reporting requirements. For example, certain dedicated and earmarked 
receipts are recorded as “appropriations received” on the SBR, but are recognized as exchange or 
non-exchange revenue (i.e., typically in special and non-revolving trust funds) and reported on 
the SCNP in accordance with SFFAS No.7. Another example is with certain parent/child 
reporting described in Section 9.36 of this document: Note 36, Descriptions of Transfers that 
Appear as a Reconciling Item on the Statement of Financing. The above examples are not all 
inclusive. 

 

Appropriations transferred-in/out. This is the amount of appropriations received in the 
current or prior year(s) that have been transferred in or out during the current reporting year. 

 

Other adjustments. This amount includes adjustments to either cumulative results of 
operations or unexpended appropriations. Some examples of adjustments include rescissions of 
appropriations and cancellations of expired appropriation/expenditure accounts, which would 
also be included in Line 6, Permanently not available, on the Statement of Budgetary Resources. 

In addition, the appropriations used by collecting entities to provide refunds of monies deposited 
to Treasury and trust funds shall be reported on this line item rather than as an Appropriations 
Used. 

 

Appropriations Used. Appropriations are considered used as a financing source when goods 
and services are received or benefits are provided. This is true whether the goods, services, and 
benefits are payable or paid as of the reporting date and whether the appropriations are used for 
items that are expensed or capitalized. Appropriations Used does not include undelivered orders 
or unobligated appropriations. Appropriations Used does not increase net position; it is 
subtracted from Unexpended Appropriations but added to Cumulative Results of Operations for 
a net zero effect on net position as a whole. 

 


Nonexchange Revenue. This amount includes revenues the Federal Government is able to 
demand or receive due to its sovereign powers. See SFFAS No. 7 for a discussion of the 
recognition and measurement criteria for taxes and other nonexchange revenues. 

 

Donations and forfeitures of cash and cash equivalents. This amount includes voluntary gifts 
and involuntary forfeitures of resources to the Federal Government by non-Federal entities. 
Donations of financial resources may be in the form of cash or securities. This amount also 
includes the forfeiture of seized cash and cash equivalents. 

 

Transfers-in/out without reimbursement. This amount includes intragovernmental non-
appropriated balance transfers in or out during the current reporting year. Non-appropriated 
balances include financing sources and revenue not reported as unexpended appropriations. 
Exchange revenue (included in calculating an entity's net cost of operations) required to be 
transferred to the Treasury or another Federal entity shall be recognized as a transfer-out. 

 

Other budgetary financing sources. This amount includes other financing sources that affect 
budgetary resources and are not otherwise classified above. 

 

5.6 Other Financing Sources 

 

This section displays financing sources and nonexchange revenue that do not represent budgetary 
resources as reported on the Statement of Budgetary Resources and defined as such by OMB 
Circular No. A-11. The items within this section shall directly tie to the Statement of Financing 
section Other Resources. 

 

Donations and forfeitures of property. This amount includes voluntary gifts and involuntary 
forfeitures of resources to the Federal Government by non-Federal entities. These resources may 
be in the form of land or buildings. The amount of revenue arising from donations/involuntary 
forfeitures of non-financial resources shall be recognized in accordance with criteria in SFFAS 
No. 6. 

 

Transfers-in/out without reimbursement. This amount includes intragovernmental transfers in 
or out of capitalized assets during the current reporting year. The amount of the transfer shall be 
recorded at the book value of the transferring entity. If the book value is not known, the amount 
recognized should be the asset's estimated fair value at the date of the transfer. 

 

Imputed financing from costs absorbed by others. This amount includes financing of certain 
costs by one Federal entity on behalf of another Federal entity (e.g., the payment of certain 
employee benefit costs by OPM for employees of other Federal agencies). Imputed financing 
shall equal the amount of imputed costs as reported on the Statement of Net Cost. 

 

Other. This amount includes other financing sources that do not represent budgetary resources 
and are not otherwise classified above. 


 

5.7 Net Cost of Operations 

 

This amount shall agree with the net cost of operations as reported on the Statement of Net Cost. 
The Net Cost of Operations is subtracted from the total financing sources and beginning balance, 
as adjusted, to yield the ending balance of net position as it relates to the Cumulative Results of 
Operations. 

 

5.8 Net Change 

 

Report the net change from beginning balances, as adjusted, to ending balances (subtotal of lines 
4 though 17 in Illustrative statement 5.2A). Report the net change from beginning balances, as 
adjusted, to ending balances (subtotal of lines 16 and 17 in Illustrative statement 5.2B). 

 

 

5.9 Net Position - Ending Balances 

 

Ending balances shall agree with the amounts reported as net position on the current year's 
balance sheet.

6.1 General 

 

The Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) and related disclosures provide information about 
how budgetary resources were made available as well as their status at the end of the period. It is 
the only financial statement predominantly derived from an entity’s budgetary general ledger in 
accordance with budgetary accounting rules, which are incorporated into GAAP for the Federal 
Government. 

 

Information on the SBR should be consistent with and reconciled to the budget execution 
information reported on the Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (SF 133) and 
with information reported in the Budget of the United States Government to ensure the integrity 
of the numbers presented. The SBR is an agency-wide report, which aggregates account-level 
information reported in the SF 133. 

 

Consistency between budgetary information presented in the financial statements and the Budget 
of the United States Government is critical to ensure the integrity of the numbers presented. The 
Federal Agencies' Centralized Trial-balance System II (FACTS II) helps to ensure the 
consistency of data. The FACTS II data submitted by agencies are USSGL-based trial balances, 
which are used to populate the SF 133 and the actual column of the Program and Financing 
Schedule of the Budget. The USSGL-based trial balance is also used to prepare the Statement of 
Budgetary Resources. 

 

FACTS II revision period The primary purpose of the FACTS II revision period is to make 
FACTS II consistent with the amounts in the prior-year column of the Budget. Due to timing 
differences, subsequent changes whether material or non-material may be made to the budgetary 
information included in the Budget after the SBR has been published. All subsequent changes 
whether material or non-material must be made in FACTS II during the revision period. 

 


Any changes to budgetary information subsequent to the publication of the audited SBR, that are 
material to the SBR, should be discussed between the agencies and their auditors to determine if 
restatement or note disclosure is necessary. Any material differences between comparable 
information contained in the SBR and the Budget, at a minimum must be disclosed in the 
footnotes to this statement (Note 33; Section 9.33). 

 

Budget information for the entity's major budget accounts will be presented as required 
supplementary information (Section 11.3). 

 

Recognition and measurement of budgetary information reported on this statement should be 
based on budget terminology, definitions, and guidance in OMB Circular No A-11, Preparation, 
Submission, and Execution of the Budget (as amended). OMB Circular No. A-11 (as amended) 
provides definitions and instructions for each line item reported in this statement 
(www.whitehouse.gov/omb). 

 

6.2 Combined vs. Consolidated Statement 

 

The budgetary information presented in this statement shall be presented on a combined basis 
and not a consolidated basis. Preparation of consolidated financial statements involves line-by-
line elimination of inter-entity balances. In order to remain consistent with the aggregate of the 
account-level information presented on the SF 133, consolidation of this statement is not 
appropriate. Accordingly, line-by-line consolidation of this statement is not permitted. 

 

6.3 Format of the Statement of Budgetary Resources 

 

The format of the SBR is based on the SF 133. The format outlined in this document for FY 
2005 remains effective through the end of FY 2005. Beginning with fiscal year 2006, OMB 
revised its format of the SF 133. To align with this change, the illustrative format of the 
Statement of Budgetary Resources will also change. The new format of the SBR planned to be 
included in OMB Circular A-11 as amended, should be used beginning with the first quarter of 
fiscal year 2006 as agencies submit interim financial statements to OMB. The comparative fiscal 
year 2006 SBR should include fiscal year 2005 data prepared in the fiscal year 2006 format. 

 

Two enhancements are included to the SBR to facilitate the reconciliation of information 
between the SBR, and actual information reported in the Budget of the United States 
Government. These two enhancements are: 

 

Separate Column for Non-budgetary Credit Reform (Financing Accounts) These are non-
budgetary accounts that record all the cash flows activity resulting from post-1991 direct loans 
and loan guarantees. This activity in the financing account is reported separately in the Budget of 
the United States Government and is excluded from the budget surplus/ deficit totals. The 
separate presentation in the SBR allows for a clear distinction between budgetary accounts and 
non-budgetary credit reform accounts. 

 


Offsetting Receipts Line. Distributed offsetting receipts were introduced as a new line item in 
the SBR. Offsetting receipts offset the outlays of an agency as a whole and are therefore not 
reflected in budget execution reports (SF 133) at the account level. Since the SBR is an agency-
wide report, offsetting receipts must be included to reconcile to information in the Budget of the 
United States Government. A more extensive discussion on offsetting receipts can be found in 
Section 6.7.

4 There are however rare exceptions in which outlays reported in the Budget do not correspond to disbursements 
reported on the Statement of Transactions. 

 

6.5 Budgetary Resources 

 

This section of the statement is designed to present the total budgetary resources available to the 
reporting entity. Budgetary resources include new budget authority, unobligated balances at the 
beginning of the period and transferred in and out during the period, spending authority from 
offsetting collections, recoveries of prior year unpaid obligations, and any adjustments to these 
resources. The resources reported on this statement shall agree with, and be reconciled to, the 
total budgetary resources reported for the aggregate of all budget accounts on the SF 133. 

 

Expired obligated and unobligated balances that cancel at the end of the fiscal year must be 
reported as canceled on the year-end SBR. Authority canceled in previous years should not be 
included on the current SBR. 

 

 

6.6 Status of Budgetary Resources 

 

This section of the statement is designed to display information about the status of budgetary 
resources at the end of the period. It consists of the obligations incurred, the unobligated 
balances at the end of the period that remain available, and unobligated balances at the end of the 
period that are unavailable except to adjust or liquidate prior year obligations. The total amount 
displayed for the status of budgetary resources shall equal the total budgetary resources available 
to the reporting entity as of the reporting date. The status of budgetary resources reported on this 
statement shall agree with, and be reconciled to, the total status reported for the aggregate of all 
budget accounts on the SF 133. 

 

 

6.7. A. Relationship of Obligations to Outlays FY 2005 

 

This section of the statement displays the obligated balances and outlays during the reporting 
period. 

 

Outlays. Outlays consist of disbursements net of offsetting collections4. The outlays shall agree 
with, and be reconciled to, the agency outlay totals reported in the Budget of the United States 
Government (i.e., with the aggregate of the outlays for accounts within the budget). The outlays 
shall also agree with, and be reconciled to, the aggregate of outlays reported on the SF 133 for 
the aggregate of all budget accounts, including non-budgetary financing accounts and the 
disbursements and collections reported to Treasury on a monthly basis (SF 224, Statement of 
Transactions; SF 1219, Statement of Accountability; and SF 1220 Statement of Transactions) per 
OMB Circular No. A-11 (as amended). 

 


Offsetting receipts. Offsetting receipts are collections that are credited to general fund, special 
fund or trust fund receipt accounts and that offset gross outlays. Unlike offsetting collections, 
which are credited to expenditure accounts and offset outlays at the account level, offsetting 
receipts are credited to receipt accounts and offset outlays at the agency or government-wide 
level. 

 

Offsetting receipts may be distributed to agencies or undistributed. Distributed offsetting 
receipts offset the outlays of the agency, while undistributed offsetting receipts offset 
government-wide outlays. Distributed offsetting receipts typically offset the outlays of the 
agency that conducts the activity generating the receipts and the subfunction to which the activity 
is assigned. Offsetting receipts are composed of: proprietary receipts from the public, receipts 
from intragovernmental transactions, and offsetting governmental receipts. 

 

This line item on the Statement of Budgetary Resources should include all distributed offsetting 
receipts for the agency. A listing of distributed offsetting receipt accounts can be found at the 
following website www.fms.treas.gov. Go to Financial Management Service, Combined 
Statement, Part Four Other Information. This is an unpublished part of the Combined Statement 
of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances of the United States Government, issued by the Department 
of the Treasury. Agencies should include in the SBR, the receipt accounts in Part 4 classified as: 

 

 Proprietary Receipts from the Public 

 Intrabudgetary Receipts Deducted by Agencies 

 Offsetting Governmental Receipts 

 

The amount of distributed offsetting receipts reported in this statement should be the aggregate 
of cash collected in these receipt accounts and reported to Treasury on a monthly basis (SF 224, 
Statement of Transactions; SF 1219, Statement of Accountability; and SF 1220, Statement of 
Transactions). The amount of offsetting receipts that are distributed to agencies and reported in 
this statement shall also agree with, and be reconciled to the deductions for offsetting receipts as 
reported in the Budget of the United States Government. 

 

Undistributed offsetting receipts credited to government-wide outlay totals should not be 
included in the SBR. 

 

Net outlays. For FY 2005, the amount on this line shall equal line 15C Outlays, Subtotal less 
line 16 Less: Offsetting receipts. This amount shall agree with, and be reconciled to the net 
outlays (gross outlays less offsetting collections and receipts) for the agency as reported in the 
Budget of the United States Government. 

 

6.7.B Change in Obligated Balances: FY 2006 

 

This section of the statement displays the change in obligated balances during the reporting 
period. 

 


5 There are however rare exceptions in which outlays reported in the Budget do not correspond to disbursements 
reported on the Statement of Transactions. 

6.7.C Net Outlays: FY 2006 

 

Outlays. Outlays consist of disbursements net of offsetting collections5. The outlays shall agree 
with, and be reconciled to, the agency outlay totals reported in the Budget of the United States 
Government (i.e., with the aggregate of the outlays for accounts within the budget). The outlays 
shall also agree with, and be reconciled to, the aggregate of outlays reported on the SF 133 for 
the aggregate of all budget accounts, including non-budgetary financing accounts and the 
disbursements and collections reported to Treasury on a monthly basis (SF 224, Statement of 
Transactions; SF 1219, Statement of Accountability; and SF 1220 Statement of Transactions) per 
OMB Circular No. A-11 (as amended). 

 

Offsetting receipts. Offsetting receipts are collections that are credited to general fund, special 
fund or trust fund receipt accounts and that offset gross outlays. Unlike offsetting collections, 
which are credited to expenditure accounts and offset outlays at the account level, offsetting 
receipts are credited to receipt accounts and offset outlays at the agency or government-wide 
level. 

 

Offsetting receipts may be distributed to agencies or undistributed. Distributed offsetting 
receipts offset the outlays of the agency, while undistributed offsetting receipts offset 
government-wide outlays. Distributed offsetting receipts typically offset the outlays of the 
agency that conducts the activity generating the receipts and the subfunction to which the activity 
is assigned. Offsetting receipts are composed of: proprietary receipts from the public, receipts 
from intragovernmental transactions, and offsetting governmental receipts. 

 

This line item on the Statement of Budgetary Resources should include all distributed offsetting 
receipts for the agency. A listing of distributed offsetting receipt accounts can be found at the 
following website www.fms.treas.gov. Go to Financial Management Service, Combined 
Statement, Part Four Other Information. This is an unpublished part of the Combined Statement 
of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances of the United States Government, issued by the Department 
of the Treasury. Agencies should include in the SBR, the receipt accounts in Part 4 classified as: 

 

 Proprietary Receipts from the Public 

 Intrabudgetary Receipts Deducted by Agencies 

 Offsetting Governmental Receipts 

 

The amount of distributed offsetting receipts reported in this statement should be the aggregate 
of cash collected in these receipt accounts and reported to Treasury on a monthly basis (SF 224, 
Statement of Transactions; SF 1219, Statement of Accountability; and SF 1220, Statement of 
Transactions). The amount of offsetting receipts that are distributed to agencies and reported in 
this statement shall also agree with, and be reconciled to the deductions for offsetting receipts as 
reported in the Budget of the United States Government. 


 

Undistributed offsetting receipts credited to government-wide outlay totals should not be 
included in the SBR. 

 

Net outlays. Line 19D is calculated. It is computed as Line 19A less Line 19B less Line 19C. 
This amount shall agree with, and be reconciled to the net outlays (gross outlays less offsetting 
collections and receipts) as reported in the Budget of the United States Government.

7.1 General 

 

The Statement of Financing is the bridge between an entity’s budgetary and financial (i.e., 
proprietary) accounting. The Statement of Financing articulates the relationship between net 
obligations derived from an entity’s budgetary accounts and net cost of operations derived from 
the entity’s proprietary accounts by identifying and explaining key differences between the two 
numbers. 

 

Most entity transactions are recorded in both budgetary and proprietary accounts. However, 
because different accounting bases are used for budgetary and proprietary accounting, some 
transactions may appear in only one set of accounts (e.g., accrual of environmental and disposal 
liabilities which is recorded only in the proprietary records). Furthermore, not all obligations or 
offsetting collections may result in expenses or exchange revenue (e.g., purchase of a building is 
capitalized on the balance sheet in the proprietary accounts but obligated and outlayed in the 
budgetary accounts). 

 

The statement is structured to first identify total resources used by an entity during the period 
(budgetary and other) and then makes adjustments to the resources based upon how they were 
used to finance net obligations or net cost. Budgetary resources reported in this statement are 
those resources as defined in OMB Circular No. A-11 and also reported on the Statement of 
Budgetary Resources. Other resources reported in this statement are also reflected in the 
Statement of Changes in Net Position. 

 

Preparers of financial statements should refer to FASAB’s Implementation Guide to SFFAS No. 7 
for more detailed guidance useful in preparing the Statement of Financing. Preparers of financial 
statements have flexibility as to the level of detail presented, e.g., the information should be 
presented for the reporting entity as a whole and, if the preparer elects, for the major 
suborganizations or responsibility segments or for the major budget accounts. 

 


The budgetary information used to calculate net obligations (i.e., lines 1-4) must be presented on 
a combined basis in the Statement of Financing to enable a direct tie to the Statement of 
Budgetary Resources.

 7.3 Resources Used to Finance Activities 

 

This section reflects the budgetary resources obligated and other resources that are used to 
finance the activities of the agency. The obligations of budgetary resources are net of offsetting 
collections, recoveries and offsetting receipts. The other resources are financing sources that 
increase net position but are not budgetary resources. 

 

Budgetary Resources Obligated 

Obligations incurred. This line item will agree with the obligations incurred (line 8) as 
reported on the Statement of Budgetary Resources. This line item will include all budget 
accounts, including non-budgetary financing accounts. 

 

Less: Spending authority from offsetting collections and recoveries. This line item will agree 
with the spending authority from offsetting collections (line 3 for FY 2005 and line 3D for FY 
2006) and recoveries (line 4 for FY 2005 and line 2 for FY 2006) as reported on the Statement of 


Budgetary Resources. This line item will include all budget accounts, including non-budgetary 
financing accounts. 

Obligations net of offsetting collections and recoveries. This line item is the difference 
between the two preceding lines. 

 

Less: Offsetting receipts. This line item will agree with the offsetting receipts (line 16 in FY 
2005 and line 19C in FY 2006) as reported on the Statement of Budgetary Resources. 

 

Net obligations. This line item is the difference between the two preceding lines. Net 
obligations reflect obligations incurred net of offsetting collections, recoveries, and offsetting 
receipts. 

 

Other Resources. The line items in this section will agree with the corresponding line items as 
reported on the Statement of Changes in Net Position: Donations and forfeitures of property (line 
12), Transfers in/out without reimbursement (line 13 only), Imputed financing from costs 
absorbed by others (line 14) and Other (line 15). These resources increase net position but are 
not budgetary resources as reported on the Statement of Budgetary Resources or defined as such 
in the OMB Circular No. A-11. 

 

7.4 Resources Used to Finance Items Not Part of the Net Cost of Operations 

 

This section adjusts total resources used to finance the activities of the entity to account for items 
that were included in net obligations and other resources but were not part of the net cost of 
operations. This section would include items in which the expense was recognized in a prior 
period but the budgetary resource and obligation are recognized in the current period (e.g., 
upward/downward reestimates of subsidy expense accrued in the prior period but obligated in the 
current period). It would also include budgetary resources and obligations recognized in the 
current period that do not affect the net cost of operations (e.g., the acquisition of assets reflected 
in net obligations but not in net cost of operations for the period). 

 

Change in budgetary resources obligated for goods, services and benefits ordered but not 
yet provided. This amount reflects undelivered orders or adjustments thereof, reflected in net 
obligations but not part of net cost of operations. This line item is typically a reduction to Total 
resources used to finance activities. 

 

Resources that fund expenses recognized in prior periods. This line item reflects the 
obligation of resources that were part of the net cost of operations in a prior period. The expense 
would have been reported on this statement in a prior period as a Component Requiring or 
Generating Resources in Future Periods (Section 7.5). An example includes the liquidation of a 
liability with budgetary resources provided in the current period. Such activities include 
decreases in annual leave and environmental clean-up liabilities. 

 


Budgetary offsetting collections and receipts that do not affect net cost of operations. This 
line item reflects offsetting collections and receipts that are not reported as exchange revenue on 
the Statement of Net Cost. Gross offsetting collections and receipts are offset against obligations 
incurred to determine net obligations in the Resources Used to Finance Activities section of this 
statement. Since not all of offsetting collections and receipts are exchange revenue, an 
adjustment is needed on this line. The adjustment reflects the portion of offsetting collections 
and receipts that are not reported on the Statement of Net Cost. 

 

Credit program collections which increase liabilities for loan guarantees or allowances 
for subsidy. Certain collections in the financing account represent budgetary resources 
but do not affect net cost. These collections do, however, adjust amounts on the balance 
sheet. For example, the accounting for subsidy expense illustrates this reconciling item. 
In determining net obligations, in the Resources Used to Finance Activities section, 
subsidy expense is reflected as both a component of obligations incurred and offsetting 
collections. The program account obligates the subsidy expense and the financing 
account collects and retains the subsidy until disbursement of a loan or default claim. 
The subsidy expense is reflected as both an obligation on the Statement of Budgetary 
Resources and an expense on the Statement of Net Cost. The collection, however, is 
reflected as an offsetting collection on the Statement of Budgetary Resources but 
reflected as a contra-asset or liability on the Balance Sheet. 

 

Other. Other transactions generating differences between net obligations and net cost of 
operations that are reflected on this line include the collection of exchange revenue 
receivable from the public and advances received for work not yet performed. 

 

Resources that finance the acquisition of assets. This line item reflects budgetary resources 
obligated that are not expenses as reported on the Statement of Net Cost. An example of this 
activity includes purchases of capitalized assets. 

 

Other resources or adjustments to net obligated resources that do not affect net cost of 
operations. This line item includes activities not otherwise classified above. This activity may 
include non-cash recoveries of prior year obligations. Recoveries are budgetary resources that 
offset obligations on the Statement of Budgetary Resources, but are not a proprietary financing 
source used to offset costs on the Statement of Net Cost. 

 

Other examples include donations of property, forfeitures of property and transfers of property. 
These examples are reported as Other resources in the first section of this statement but are not 
reported on the Statements of Net Cost or Budgetary Resources. 

 

7.5 Components Requiring or Generating Resources in Future Periods 

 

The costs of the Federal Government are not always funded in the period the costs are incurred. 
This section identifies items that are recognized as a component of the net cost of operations for 


the period but the budgetary resources (and related obligation) will not be provided (or incurred) 
until a subsequent period. 

 

Increase in annual leave liability. This line item includes the expense related to the increase in 
annual leave liability for which the budgetary resources will be provided in a subsequent period. 

 

Increase in environmental and disposal liability. This line item includes the expense related 
to the increase in environmental and disposal liability for which the budgetary resources will be 
provided in a subsequent period. 

 

Upward/downward reestimates of credit subsidy expense. This line item includes the 
expense recognized as a result of an upward/downward reestimate of credit program subsidy 
cost, for which the budgetary resources (or obligation) will be provided (or incurred) in a 
subsequent period. While budgetary resources are not provided in the current period, credit 
subsidy reestimates should be reflected as liabilities covered by budgetary resources since the 
budget authority to fund the reestimates is permanent and indefinite and no further Congressional 
action is needed to provide the resources. 

 

Increase in exchange revenue receivable from the public. Exchange revenue from the public 
is reflected as it is earned as a component of the net cost of operations for the period, but will 
normally not be reflected in net obligations until it is received. Budgetary resources are normally 
not recognized from the public until collected in accordance with the OMB Circular No. A-11.

8.1 General 

 

The Statement of Custodial Activity is required for entities that collect nonexchange revenue for 
the General Fund of the Treasury, a trust fund, or other recipient entities. In addition, the 
Statement of Custodial Activity is required for selected exchange revenues specified in SFFAS 7, 
including oil and gas revenues. The collecting entities do not recognize as revenue those 
collections that have been or should be transferred to others as revenues. Rather, they shall 
account for sources and disposition of the collections as custodial activities on the Statement of 
Custodial Activity. 

 

An exception to requiring preparation of the Statement of Custodial Activity is made when 
collecting entities have custodial collections that are immaterial and incidental to their primary 
mission. In these cases, the sources and disposition of the collections may be disclosed in 
accompanying footnotes. 

 

Custodial collections are normally nonexchange revenues, such as taxes and duties collected by 
the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Exchange revenue is 
normally reported on the Statement of Net Cost. However, SFFAS 7 identified certain 
exceptional circumstances in which the entity recognizes virtually no costs in connection with 
earning the revenue that it collects (see paragraph 45 of SFFAS No. 7). In these identified 
situations, the exchange revenue is reported in the Statement of Custodial Activity rather than on 
the Statement of Net Cost. Information on the sections of the Statement of Custodial Activity is 
presented below. Also see SFFAS No. 7 and the related implementation guide.

 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements. 

 


Report in this section of the statement the components of collections, such as by type of tax and 
duty, collection of past-due receivables for others, or other appropriate identifier to describe the 
source and nature of the collections. If refunds of taxes or other non-exchange revenues are 
material in relation to the gross collections made, consider reporting them by component 
separately in a footnote. 

 

This section of the report also includes the nonexchange revenue accrual adjustment, which shall 
be shown separately and added or subtracted from the net collections to determine the total 
custodial nonexchange revenue. Guidance for calculating the accrual adjustment can be found in 
SFFAS No. 7 and the related implementation guide. If the accrual adjustments are material in 
relation to the gross collections, consider reporting them separately in a footnote. The accrual 
adjustment is not applicable to exchange revenue. 

 

Exchange revenues are reported on an accrual basis. 

 

8.4 Disposition of Collections 

 

This section of the statement accounts for the disposition of the revenue reported in the 
preceding section. 

 

Amounts Transferred to Others. Identify the specific agencies to which collections 
were transferred and the amounts transferred. 

 

Amounts Yet to be Transferred. Report the change in liability for revenue yet to be 
transferred. The liability may exist because the revenue has been accrued--and is 
receivable--but has not yet been collected, or because collections already made have not 
yet been transferred to the entity for which collected as of the end of the reporting period. 

 

Amounts of Refunds and Other Payments. Report the amounts of refunds and other 
payments made. This line is normally not applicable to exchange revenue. 

 

Amounts Retained by the Collecting Entity. In some cases, collecting entities are 
permitted to retain a portion of amounts collected. Amounts retained shall be separately 
reported by the collecting entity as a disposition of collections. 

 

8.5 Net Custodial Activity. The total of the Sources of Collections section (total revenue) shall 
equal the total of the Disposition of Collections section (total disposition of revenue). The net 
custodial activity shall always equal zero.

9.1 Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies 

 

Describe the reporting entity and identify its major components. Summarize the accounting 
principles and methods of applying those principles that management has concluded are 
appropriate for presenting fairly the entity's assets, liabilities, net cost of operations, changes in 
net position, and budgetary resources. Disclosure of accounting policies should identify and 
describe the accounting principles followed by the reporting entity and the methods of applying 
those principles. In general, the disclosure should encompass important judgments as to the 
valuation, recognition, and allocation of assets, liabilities, expenses, revenues and other financing 
sources. Disclosures of accounting policies should not duplicate details presented elsewhere as 
part of the notes to the financial statements. The summary of significant accounting policies 
should include a description of changes in generally accepted accounting principles that impact 
the financial statements, and an explanation of concepts, such as Fund Balance with Treasury 
and Earmarked Funds that are unique to Federal financial statements. 

 

 


In addition, the summary of significant accounting policies should disclose any significant 
changes in the composition of the reporting entity or significant changes in the manner in which 
the reporting entity aggregates information for financial reporting purposes. These changes, in 
effect, result in a new reporting entity, and their impact should be reported by restating the 
financial statements for all prior periods presented in order to show the new reporting entity for 
all periods presented, except for certain portions of earmarked funds, as described in paragraphs 
20 and 26 of SFFAS 27.

Instructions. Columns 1 through 4 are for disclosing amounts to be recognized on the balance 
sheet. Column 4 equals column 1 plus or minus column 3, column 5 includes any reduction in 
value that is more than temporary and other adjustments, and column 6 equals column 4 minus 
column 5. Securities are normally recognized at cost or amortized cost on the Balance Sheet. 
However, market value is used for Balance Sheet purposes (except for pension and other 
retirement plans) when (a) there is intent to sell the securities prior to maturity and (b) there is a 
reduction in value that is more than temporary. Column 6 is to be used to disclose the market 
value of all marketable securities and all non-marketable market-based securities. 

 

A. Intragovernmental Securities. Marketable Federal securities can be bought and sold on 
the open market. Non-marketable par value Treasury securities are issued by the Bureau 
of the Public Debt to Federal accounts and are purchased and redeemed at par exclusively 
through Treasury's Federal Investment Branch. Non-marketable market-based Treasury 
securities are also issued by the Bureau of Public Debt to Federal accounts. They are not 
traded on any securities exchange but mirror the prices of particular Treasury securities 
trading in the Government securities market. 

 

B. Note on Investments for Earmarked Funds (Effective FY 2006) 

In accordance with SFFAS 27, Investments in Treasury securities for earmarked funds 
should be accompanied by a note. Paragraph 27 of the standard explains issues to be 
addressed in the note. SFFAS 27, paragraph 28, Intra-governmental Investments in 
Treasury Securities, provides an example of a note that addresses the requirements stated 
in paragraph 27. 

 

C. Other Information. Disclose any other information relative to understanding the nature 
of reported investments, such as permanent impairments. 

 

 

9.6 Note 6 Accounts Receivable, Net

Instructions. 

 

A. Direct Loan and Loan Guarantee Programs. Identify the names of the direct loan and 
loan guarantee programs operated by the reporting entity. The Federal Credit Reform 
Act of 1990 divides direct loans and loan guarantees into two groups: (a) Pre-1992 refers 
to the direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments made prior to FY 1992 and 
the resulting direct loans or loan guarantees, and (b) Post-1991 refers to the direct loan 
obligations or loan guarantee commitments made after FY 1991 and the resulting direct 
loans or loan guarantees. The definitions and explanations of terms and concepts in these 
instructions can be supplemented by referring to OMB Circular No. A-11, Section 185, 
and subsequent issuances of the corresponding Circulars. Additional guidance on 
accounting and reporting requirements can be found in SFFAS Nos. 2, 18 and 19. 

 

Section 506(a)(1) of the Federal Credit Reform Act exempts the credit activities of 
certain agencies, such as FDIC and TVA. These agencies can report in accordance with 
other requirements. 

 

Agencies should disclose that direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments 
made after FY 1991, and the resulting direct loans or loan guarantees, are governed by 
the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, as amended. SFFAS No. 2 provides that the 
present value of the subsidy costs (which arises from interest rate differentials, interest 
supplements, defaults (net of recoveries), fee offsets, and other cash flows) associated 
with direct loans and loan guarantees be recognized as a cost in the year the direct or 
guaranteed loan is disbursed. Direct loans are reported net of an allowance for subsidy at 
present value, and loan guarantee liabilities are reported at present value. 

 

Agencies should also disclose whether pre-1992 direct loans and loan guarantees are 
reported on a present value basis or are reported under the allowance for loss method. 
(Under the allowance for loss method, the nominal amount of the direct loans is reduced 
by an allowance for uncollectible amounts, and the liability for loan guarantees is the 
amount the agency estimates will more likely than not require a future cash outflow to 
pay default claims. Under the present value method, the nominal amount of direct loans is 
reduced by an allowance equal to the difference between the nominal amount and the 
present value of the expected net cash flows from the loans, and the liability for loan 
guarantees is the present value of expected net cash outflows due to the loan guarantees.) 
Depending on the reporting method selected by management for pre-1992 direct loans 
and loan guarantees, agencies should choose the appropriate format from the alternatives 
shown in sections B, H and K above. (Note: Agencies should follow either the net 
present value method or the allowance for loss method, but not both. They may not 
change from one method to the other without the advance approval of OMB.) 

 


Agencies should disclose that their loans receivable, net, or their value of assets related to 
direct loans, is not the same as the proceeds that they would expect to receive from 
selling their loans. 

 

When the reporting entity has made payments on behalf of borrowers which should be 
collected from the borrowers, the resulting receivables shall be reported in the same 
column as loans receivable for either direct loans or defaulted guaranteed loans. 
Receivables related to administrative costs of operating these programs shall be reported 
as accounts receivable in Note 6 and not as credit program receivables in this note. 

 

Narrative and Discussion. Provide other information related to direct loan and loan 
guarantee programs, as appropriate, including a description of the characteristics of the 
loan programs, any commitments to guarantee, management's method for accruing 
interest revenue and recording interest receivable, and management's policy for accruing 
interest on non-performing loans. 

 

Disclose a discussion and explanation of events and changes in economic conditions, 
other risk factors, legislation, credit policies, and subsidy estimation methodologies and 
assumptions that have had a significant and measurable effect on subsidy rates, subsidy 
expense, and subsidy reestimates. The discussion should also include events and changes 
that have occurred and are more likely than not to have a significant impact but the 
effects of which are not measurable at the reporting date. Changes in legislation or credit 
policies include, for example, changes in borrowers’ eligibility, the levels of fees or 
interest rates charged to borrowers, the maturity terms of loans, and the percentage of a 
private loan that is guaranteed. 

 

If modifications were made, explain the nature of the modifications, the discount rate 
used in calculating the expense, and the basis for recognizing a gain or loss related to the 
modification. Also, if appropriate, disclose that the subsidy expense resulting from 
reestimates, that is included in the financial statements, but not reported in the budget 
until the following year. 

 

With respect to the foreclosed property reported in sections B, C, H and I the following 
information should be disclosed: 

 


• Changes from prior year's accounting methods, if any. 

 


• Restrictions on the use/disposal of the property. 

 


• Number of properties held and average holding period by type or category. 

 


• Number of properties for which foreclosure proceedings were in process at the end of the 
period. 

 


B. Direct Loans Obligated Prior to FY 1992. For each program with pre-1992 Direct 
Loans, report Loans Receivable Gross and Interest Receivable in columns 2 and 3 
respectively. If the present value method is used, report in column 4 the estimated net 
realizable value of related foreclosed property and report in column 5 the present value 
allowance. The sum of columns 2 through 4 less column 5 is reported as Value of Assets 
Related to Direct Loans (column 6). If the allowance for loss method is used, report in 
column 4 the allowance for loan losses and in column 5 the estimated net realizable 
value of related foreclosed property. The sum of columns 2, 3, and 5 less column 4 is 
reported as Value of Assets Related to Direct Loans (column 6). 

 

C. Direct Loans Obligated After FY 1991. For each program with post-1991 Direct 
Loans, report Loans Receivable, Gross, Interest Receivable and the estimated value of 
related foreclosed property in columns 2, 3, and 4, respectively. 

 

Foreclosed property associated with post-1991 direct and acquired defaulted guaranteed 
loans shall be valued at the net present value of the projected cash flows associated with 
the property. To practicably accomplish this requirement, foreclosed property may be 
recorded at the estimated net realizable value at the time of foreclosure if the differences 
are not material. A portion of the related allowance for subsidy account should apply to 
the foreclosed property, but that amount need not be separately determined. Rather, the 
allowance account is subtracted from the sum of the credit program assets to determine 
the net present value of the assets. For additional guidance related to foreclosures, refer 
to SFFAS No. 2 & 57-60 and SFFAS No. 3 & 79-91. 

 

Report the related allowance for subsidy cost in column 5. Report the sum of columns 2 
through 4 less column 5 as the Value of Assets Related to Direct Loans (column 6). 

 


D. Total Amount of Direct Loans Disbursed. Report the total amount of direct loans 
disbursed for the current reporting year and the prior reporting year for each program. 

 
E. Subsidy Expense for Direct Loans by Program and Component. Disclose for each 
program the total subsidy expense and its components, the subsidy expense for 
modifications, and the total subsidy expense and its components for reestimates during 
the current and prior reporting years. 

 

E1. Subsidy Expense for New Direct Loans Disbursed: Disclose for each program the 
total subsidy expense for new direct loans disbursed and its components: interest rate 
differential costs, default costs (net of recoveries), fees and other collections, and other 
costs. In column 2, disclose the present value of the amount of the subsidy expense 
attributable to the interest rate differential between the interest rate charged to the 
borrowers and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the direct loans and 
the subsidy costs; in column 3, the present value of the estimated defaults (net of 
recoveries); in column 4, the present value of the estimated fees collected (offsetting 





expense); in column 5, the present value of other cash flows, including prepayments; and 
in column 6, the total of columns 2 through 5. 

 




E2. Direct Loan Modifications and Reestimates: In column 2, disclose the subsidy 
expense for modifications of direct loans previously disbursed (whether pre-1992 or post-
1991). In columns 3 and 4, disclose reestimates of the subsidy expense for direct loans, 
previously disbursed, by component (interest rate and technical/default); and in Column 
5, the total of columns 3 and 4. 

 

E3. Total Direct Loan Subsidy Expense: The total subsidy expense for the current and 
prior year's direct loans, modifications, and reestimates. 

 

F. Subsidy Rates for Direct Loans by Program and Component: Disclose for each 
program the budget subsidy rates estimated for the cohorts of the current reporting year. 
Also disclose the subsidy rate for the following components: interest rate differential 
costs, default costs (net of recoveries), fees and other collections, and other costs, 
estimated for direct loans in the current year’s budget for the current year’s cohorts. 
These rates should be consistent with the rates published in the Federal Credit 
Supplement to the Budget of the U.S. Government. Each subsidy rate is the dollar 
amount of the total subsidy or a subsidy component as a percentage of the direct loans 
obligated in the cohort. Entities are encouraged to use trend data to display significant 
fluctuations in subsidy rates. Such trend data, if used, should be accompanied with 
analysis to explain the underlying causes for the fluctuations. 

 

The reporting entity should state the following in its disclosure: 

The subsidy rates disclosed pertain only to the current year’s cohorts. 
These rates cannot be applied to the direct loans disbursed during the 
current reporting year to yield the subsidy expense. The subsidy expense 
for new loans reported in the current year could result from disbursements 
of loans from both current year cohorts and prior year(s) cohorts. The 
subsidy expense reported in the current year also includes modifications 
and re-estimates. 

 

G. Schedule for Reconciling Subsidy Cost Allowance Balances for Post-1991 Direct 
Loans. Display a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balances of the 
subsidy cost allowance for outstanding direct loans reported in the entity's balance sheet. 
The reconciliation is required for direct loans obligated on or after October 1, 1991, the 
effective date of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Reporting entities are 
encouraged but not required to display reconciliations for direct loans obligated prior to 
October 1, 1991, in schedules separate from the direct loans obligated after September 
30, 1991. Schedules for pre-1992 direct loans would not have all the same reconciling 
items as for post-1991 direct loans. 

 


H. Defaulted Guaranteed Loans from Pre-1992 Guarantees. For each program with pre-
1992 Loan Guarantees, report gross receivables from defaulted guaranteed loans assumed 
for direct collection in column 2 and the related interest receivable in column 3. If the 
present value method is used, report the estimated net realizable value of related 
foreclosed property in column 4, and the present value allowance in column 5. The sum 
of columns 2 through 4 less column 5 is reported as Value of Assets Related to Defaulted 
Guaranteed Loans Receivable, Net (column 6). If the allowance for loss method is used, 
report the allowance for loan losses in column 4 and the estimated net realizable value of 
related foreclosed property in column 5. The sum of columns 2, 3 and 5 less column 4 is 
reported as Value of Assets Related to Defaulted Guaranteed Loans Receivable, Net 
(column 6). 

 


I. Defaulted Guaranteed Loans for Post-1991 Guarantees. For each program with post-
1991 Loan Guarantees, report gross receivables from defaulted guaranteed loans assumed 
for direct collection, related interest receivable, and the estimated value of related 
foreclosed property in columns 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Report the related allowance for 
subsidy cost in column 5. Report the sum of columns 2 through 4 less column 5 as the 
Value of Assets Related to Defaulted Guaranteed Loans Receivable, Net (column 6). For 
foreclosed property, see the instructions for section C. 

 

 The sum of the amounts reported in column 6 of sections B, C, H and I shall equal the 
amount reported on the Balance Sheet as loans receivables and related foreclosed 
property, net. 

 

J. Guaranteed Loans Outstanding. For each loan guarantee program, report in column 2 
the face value of outstanding principal of guaranteed loans disbursed by a third party. In 
column 3, report the amount of this outstanding principal that is guaranteed. Also report 
the amount of new guaranteed loans disbursed for the current and prior reporting years. 

 


K. Liability for Loan Guarantees. For each program with pre-1992 loan guarantees, report 
in column 2 the liability for losses. If the present value method is used to calculate the 
liability, report in column 2 the present value of liabilities for losses on pre-1992 loan 
guarantees. If the estimated future default claims method is used, report in column 2 the 
estimated future default claims. For each program with post-1991 loan guarantees, report 
in column 3 the present value of the estimated net cash flows (outflows less inflows) to 
be paid by the entity as a result of the loan guarantees. Report the total of columns 2 and 
3 as total liabilities for loan guarantees (column 4). 

 


L. Subsidy Expense for Loan Guarantees by Program and Component. Disclose for 
each program the total subsidy expense and its components, the subsidy expense for 
modifications, and the subsidy expense for reestimates during the current and prior 
reporting years. 

 


L1. Subsidy Expense for New Loan Guarantees : Disclose for each program the total 
subsidy expense for new loan guarantees (i.e., the loan guarantees on new guaranteed 
loans) and its components: interest supplement costs, default costs (net of recoveries), 
fees and other collections, and other costs. Disclose in column 2, the present value of the 
amount of the interest supplements; in column 3, the present value of the estimated 
payments for defaults on loan guarantees (net of recoveries); in column 4, the present 
value of the estimated fees collected (offsetting expense); in column 5, the present value 
of other cash flows; and in column 6, the total of columns 2 through 5. 

 

L2. Loan Guarantee Modifications and Reestimates: Disclose in column 2, the 
subsidy expense for modifications of loan guarantees in guaranteed loans previously 
disbursed by a third party (whether pre-1992 or post-1991). Disclose in columns 3 and 4, 
reestimates of the subsidy expense for loan guarantees, previously committed, by 
component (interest rate and technical/default); and in Column 5, the total of columns 3 
and 4. 

 

L3. Total Loan Guarantee Subsidy Expense: The total subsidy expense for the current 
and prior year's loan guarantees, modifications, and reestimates. 

 

M. Subsidy Rates for Loan Guarantees by Program and Component: Disclose for each 
program the subsidy rates for the following components: interest supplement costs, 
default costs (net of recoveries), fees and other collections, and other costs, estimated for 
loan guarantees in the current year’s budget for the current year’s cohorts. These rates 
should be consistent with the rates published in the Budget of the U.S. Government. 
Each subsidy rate is the dollar amount of the total subsidy or a subsidy component as a 
percentage of the guaranteed loans obligated in the cohort. Entities may use trend data to 
display significant fluctuations in subsidy rates. Such trend data, if used, should be 
accompanied with analysis to explain the underlying causes for the fluctuations. 

 

The reporting entity should state the following in its disclosure: 

The subsidy rates disclosed pertain only to the current year’s cohorts. 
These rates cannot be applied to the guarantees of loans disbursed during 
the current reporting year to yield the subsidy expense. The subsidy 
expense for new loan guarantees reported in the current year could result 
from disbursements of loans from both current year cohorts and prior 
year(s) cohorts. The subsidy expense reported in the current year also 
includes modifications and reestimates. 

 

N. Schedule for Reconciling Loan Guarantee Liability Balances for Post-1991 
Loan Guarantees. Display a reconciliation between the beginning and ending 
balances of the liability for outstanding loan guarantees reported in the entity's 
balance sheet. The reconciliation is required for loan guarantees committed on or 
after October 1, 1991, the effective date of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 
1990. Reporting entities are encouraged but not required to display reconciliations 


for loan guarantees committed prior to October 1, 1991, in schedules separate 
from the loan guarantees committed after September 30, 1991. Schedules for pre-
1992 loan guarantees would not have all the same reconciling items as for post-
1991 loan guarantees. 

 

O. Administrative Expense. Report the portions of salaries and other administrative 
expenses that have been accounted for in support of the direct loan programs and loan 
guarantee programs. Report the expenses for the individual programs, if material.

Instructions. All debt is classified as not covered by budgetary resources, except for (a) 
direct loan and guaranteed loan financing account debt to Treasury and (b) that portion of 
other debt which is covered by budgetary resources at the balance sheet date. Lines A (1) and 
(2), Treasury Debt, should be reported by the Treasury Department only and should 
distinguish between debt held by government agencies and debt held by the public. On line 


B, enter the amounts of agency debt issued under special financing authorities (e.g., Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA) debentures and Tennessee Valley Authority bonds). Report 
separately agency debt held by government agencies and agency debt held by the public. On 
line C, enter the amounts of debt owed to Federal agencies as follows: on line C(1), debt 
owed to the Treasury, which includes direct loan and guaranteed loan financing account debt 
to Treasury as well as other debt owed to Treasury; on line C(2), debt owed to the Federal 
Financing Bank; and on line C(3), debt owed to other Federal agencies. Net borrowing and 
repayment is not to include amounts that result from refinancing. 

 

Classification of Debt. Report as intragovernmental debt all debt owed to Treasury, the 
Federal Financing Bank or other Federal agencies or accounts (line A(1), B(1), and C(4) ). 
This amount shall equal the intragovernmental debt amount reported on the balance sheet. 
Report all debt held by the public on lines A(2) and B(2). This amount shall equal debt held 
by the public on the balance sheet. 

 

Other Information. Provide the names of the agencies, other than Treasury or the Federal 
Financing Bank, to which intragovernmental debt is owed and the amounts. Provide other 
information relative to debt (for example, redemption or call of debts owed to the public 
before maturity dates, write-offs of debts owed Treasury or the Federal Financing Bank, etc.). 

 

9.14 Note 14 Federal Employee and Veteran Benefits 

 

Entities that are responsible for administering pensions, other retirement benefits, and other 
post-employment benefits should calculate and report these liabilities and related expenses in 
accordance with SFFAS No. 5. 

 

For entities that are responsible for administering pensions, other retirement benefits, and 
other post-employment benefits, the following are the minimum disclosures required for 
pensions and other retirement benefits: 

 


• The assumptions used to calculate the liability. (In the case of a pension plan that uses 
assumptions that differ from those used by the primary plans, the Civil Service 
Retirement System (CSRS), the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), and 
the Military Retirement System (MRS), the pension plan using the different 
assumptions should disclose how and why the assumptions used differ from those of 
the primary plans.) 

 


• Separate disclosure of the individual components of expense for the period (the normal 
cost, interest on the liability for the period, prior and past service cost from plan 
amendments during the period, if any, any gains/losses due to a change in the medical 
inflation rate assumption, and other actuarial gains or losses during the period, if any). 


9.15 Note 15 Environmental and Disposal Liabilities 

 

Disclose environmental and disposal liabilities in accordance with SFFAS No. 5 and SFFAS 
No. 6. For environmental hazards resulting from ongoing operations, include the: (1) sources 
of cleanup requirements, (2) method for assigning estimated total cleanup costs to current 
operating periods, (3) unrecognized portion of estimated total cleanup cost associated with

Instructions. SFFAS Nos. 5 and 6 provide the criteria for liability and asset recognition with 
respect to capital leases. 

 
A. Entity as Lessee. 




Summary of Assets Under Capital Lease: Enter the gross assets under capital lease, 
by major asset category, and the related total accumulated amortization. 

 

Description of Lease Arrangements: Provide information that discloses the agency's 
funding commitments including, but not limited to, the major asset categories and 
associated lease terms, including renewal options, escalation clauses, contingent 
rentals restrictions imposed by lease agreements, and the amortization period. 

 


Future Payments Due: Enter future lease payments, by major asset category, for all 
noncancellable leases with terms longer than one year. 

 

For capital leases, show deductions for imputed interest and executory costs. Separately 
disclose the portions of the capital lease liability covered by budgetary resources and not 
covered by budgetary resources (see Appendix B of OMB Circular No. A-11 for 
additional guidance but observe a difference in terminology: that the term capital leases 
as used in this note includes capital leases and lease purchases as the terms are used in 
OMB Circular No. A-11). According to the OMB Circular No. A-11, capital leases 
entered into during FY 1992 and thereafter are required to be fully funded in the first year 
of the lease. 

 

B. Entity as Lessor. 

Description of Lease Arrangements: Provide the information necessary to disclose the 
commitment of the entity's assets including but not limited to the major asset category 
and lease terms. 

 

Future Projected Receipts: Enter future lease revenues, by major asset category, for all 
noncancellable leases with terms longer than one year. 

 

C. Other Information. Provide other information necessary for understanding leases that is 
not disclosed in the above categories. 

 

9.18 Note 18 Life Insurance Liabilities 

 

Federal entities providing whole life insurance should provide all disclosures required by private 
sector standards. They should also separately disclose all components of the liability for future 
policy benefits with a description of each amount and an explanation of its projected use and any 
other potential uses (e.g., reducing premiums, determining and declaring dividends available, 
and/or reducing Federal support in the form of appropriations related to administrative costs or 
subsidies). See SFFAS No. 5 for further guidance. 

 

9.19 Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies 

 

A loss contingency is an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving 
uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity. The uncertainty should ultimately be resolved when 
one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The likelihood that the future event or events 
will confirm the loss or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote. SFFAS 
No. 5, as amended by SFFAS No.12, contains the criteria for recognition and disclosure of 
contingent liabilities. In addition to the contingent liabilities required by SFFAS No. 5, the 
following shall also be disclosed: (1) an estimate of obligations related to canceled 
appropriations for which the reporting entity has a contractual commitment for payment and (2) 
amounts for contractual arrangements which may require future financial obligations. 

 



9.20 Note 20 Earmarked Funds (Effective FY 2006) 

Earmarked funds are financed by specifically identified revenues and are required by statute to 
be used for designated activities or purposes, and must be accounted for separately from the 
Government’s general revenues. See SFFAS 27, Identifying and Reporting Earmarked Funds 
for the required criteria for an earmarked fund. 

 

SFFAS 27 requires disclosure of all earmarked funds for which the reporting entity has program 
management responsibility. See the standard for information and details on disclosing 
information on selected individual earmarked funds and for all remaining earmarked funds 
shown in aggregate. Also, see SFFAS 27 for guidance on selecting earmarked funds to be 
presented individually or in aggregate. 

 

The following information should be disclosed for each individually reported earmarked fund, or 
portion thereof, for which a component entity has program management responsibility. 
• A description of each fund's purpose, how the entity accounts for and reports the fund, 
and its authority to use those revenues and other financing sources. 
• The sources of revenue or other financing for the period and an explanation of the extent 
to which they are inflows of resources to the Government or the result of 
intragovernmental flows. 


• Any change in legislation during or subsequent to the reporting period and before the 
issuance of the financial statements that significantly changes the purpose of the fund or 
that redirects a material portion of the accumulated balance. 

 

The total cumulative results of operations of all earmarked funds shown in the note disclosure 
should agree with the cumulative results of operations of earmarked funds shown on the face of 
the component entity’s Balance Sheet and the Statement of Changes in Net Position. SFFAS 27 
contains specific guidance if more than one component entity is responsible for carrying out a 
program financed with earmarked revenues and other financing sources. Also see SFFAS 27 for 
restatement rules on an entity reporting a different portion of an earmarked fund than it reported 
in prior years, or does not report an earmarked fund that it reported in the previous year, or does 
report an earmarked fund that it did not report in the previous year. Refer to SFFAS 27 for 
additional disclosure requirements.

Instructions. 

 

Disclose intragovernmental costs (exchange transactions made between two reporting entities 
within the Federal government) separately from costs with the public (exchange transactions 
made between the reporting entity and a non-Federal entity). Disclose intragovernmental 
exchanges revenue (exchange transactions made between two reporting entities within the 
Federal government) separately from exchange revenue with the public (exchange transactions 
made between the reporting entity and a non-Federal entity). 

 

Describe the definition criteria used for this classification, and include an explanation that makes 
it clear to the reader that the intragovernmental expenses relate to the source of goods and 
services purchased by the reporting entity, and not to the classification of related revenue. If 
necessary, provide an example: “For ‘exchange revenue with the public,’ the buyer of the goods 
or services is a non-Federal entity. For ‘intragovernmental costs,’ the buyer and seller are both 
Federal entities. If a Federal entity purchases goods or services from another Federal entity and 
sells them to the public, the exchange revenue would be classified as ‘with the public,’ but the 
related costs would be classified as ‘intragovernmental.’ The purpose of this classification is to 
enable the Federal government to provide consolidated financial statements, and not to match 
public and intragovernmental revenue with costs that are incurred to produce public and 
intragovernmental revenue.” 

 




9.22 Note 22 Suborganization Program Costs/Program Costs by Segment 

 

For some entities, the organizational structure and operations are so complex that supporting 
schedules should be used to fully display their suborganizations’ major programs and activities. 



In addition, an agency's Statement of Net Cost may display highly aggregated program 
information, and the programs may have clearly distinguishable segments. Information on the 
net cost of the segments should be disclosed in the footnotes. Supporting schedules similar to the 
illustration in Exhibit 9F should be included in the notes to the financial statements and present 
detailed cost and revenue information supporting the summary information presented in the 
Statement of Net Cost.

Note 9.23 Note 23 Cost of Stewardship PP&E 

 

The cost of acquiring, constructing, improving, reconstructing, or renovating heritage assets 
(other than multi-use heritage assets), and the cost of acquiring stewardship land and any costs to 
prepare stewardship land for its intended use, shall be recognized as a cost in the Statement of 
Net Cost in the period when it is incurred. These costs shall be separately reported on the face of 
the Statement of Net Cost or disclosed in the footnotes, depending on the materiality of the 
amounts and the need to distinguish such amounts from other costs relating to measures of 
outputs or outcomes of the reporting entity (see SFFAS No. 8). 

 

9.24 Note 24 Stewardship Assets Acquired Through Transfer, Donation or Devise 

 

If the cost of heritage assets and stewardship land transferred from other Federal entities is not 
known, then the receiving entity shall disclose their fair value. Heritage assets and stewardship 
land acquired through donation or devise shall not be recognized as a cost in calculating net cost, 
but the fair value of the property shall be disclosed. If the fair value is not known or reasonably 
estimable, information related to the type and quantity of assets received shall be disclosed (see 
SFFAS Nos. 6 and 8). 

 

9.25 Note 25 Exchange Revenues 

 

Reporting entities that provide goods and services to the public or another government entity 
should disclose specific information related to their pricing policies and any expected losses 
under goods made to order. These disclosures are described in SFFAS No. 7. 

 

Note Disclosure Related to the Statement of Changes in Net Position 

9.26 Note 26 Cleanup Cost Adjustments 

 

The cost for any cleanup cost liability recognized upon implementation of the standard requiring 
such recognition shall be shown on the Statement of Changes in Net Position as a prior period 
adjustment. The amounts involved shall be disclosed in a note, and to the extent possible, 
amounts associated with current and prior periods should be identified. See SFFAS No. 6. 

 

Note Disclosures Related to the Statement of Budgetary Resources 

9.27 Note 27 Apportionment Categories of Obligations Incurred 

 

Disclose the amount of direct and reimbursable obligations incurred against amounts apportioned 
under Category A, B and Exempt from apportionment. This disclosure shall agree with the 
aggregate of the related information as reported on the agency’s year-end SF 133s, Report on 
Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, and lines 8A and 8B in the Statement of Budgetary 
Resources. Apportionment categories shall be determined in accordance with the guidance 
provided in OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget (as 
amended).. 


 

9.28 Note 28 Available Borrowing/Contract Authority, End of Period 

 


Disclose the amount of available borrowing and contract authority at the end of the period. 

 


9.29 Note 29 Terms of Borrowing Authority Used 

 


Disclose the repayment requirements, financing sources for repayment, and other terms of 
borrowing authority used. 

 


9.30 Note 30 Adjustments to Beginning Balance of Budgetary Resources 

 


Disclose and explain the amounts adjusted, during the reporting period, of the budgetary 
resources available at the beginning of the year. 

 

9.31 Note 31 Permanent Indefinite Appropriations 

 

Disclose the existence, purpose, and availability of permanent indefinite appropriations. 

 

9.32 Note 32 Legal Arrangements Affecting Use of Unobligated Balances 

 

Disclose the information about legal arrangements affecting the use of unobligated balances of 
budget authority, such as time limits, purpose, and obligation limitations. For example, the 
portion of trust fund receipts collected in the current fiscal year that (1) exceed the amount 
needed to pay benefits or other valid obligations and (2) the excess of receipts temporarily 
precluded from obligation by law due to a benefit formula or other limitation. The receipts; 
however, are assets of the trust fund and available for obligation as needed in the future. 

 

9.33 Note 33 Explanation of Differences Between the Statement of Budgetary Resources 
and the Budget of the United States Government 

 

Identify and explain material differences between amounts reported in the Statement of 
Budgetary Resources and the actual amounts reported in the Budget of the United States 
Government as required by SFFAS No. 7. Agencies can find comparable information reported 
in the SBR to the President’s Budget (i.e., net outlays) in a Table entitled “Federal Program by 
Agency and Account” on the CD-ROM located in the pocket of the Analytical Perspective 
Volume of the Budget of the United States Government. Differences, in and of themselves, may 
or may not indicate a reporting error. Legitimate reasons for differences could exist. For 
example, expired unobligated balances are reported in the Statement of Budgetary Resources and 
SF 133 but not in the Budget of the United States Government. This disclosure should be 
provided when comparable line items differ between the President’s Budget and the Statement of 
Budgetary Resources. 

 




The reporting entity should disclose that the President’s Budget with actual numbers for the 
fiscal year has not yet been published, explain when it is expected to be published, and indicate 
where it will be available. 

 

9.34 Note 34 Undelivered orders at the end of the period (Effective FY 2006) 

 

Disclose the amount of budgetary resources obligated for undelivered orders at the end of the 
period. 

 

Beginning with FY 2006, the format of the SBR will change and the amount of undelivered 
orders at the end of the period will no longer be reported on the face of the statement. Due to the 
change in the statement format, this note disclosure will be required to comply with SFFAS 7 
paragraph 79 (a). 

 

9.35 Note 35 Contributed Capital 



 

The amount of any contributed capital received during the reporting period. 

 

Note Disclosures Related to the Statement of Financing 

 

9.36 Note 36 Explanation of Differences Between Liabilities Not Covered by Budgetary 
Resources and Components Requiring or Generating Resources in Future Periods 

 

Identify and explain the relationship between amounts reported as Liabilities not covered by 
budgetary resources on the Balance Sheet and amounts reported as Components requiring or 
generating resources in future periods on the Statement of Financing. 

 

9.37 Note 37 Description of Transfers that Appear as a Reconciling Item on the Statement 
of Financing 

 
When budget authority and other resources are allocated to another agency or bureau (allocation 
transfer of appropriation - see OMB Circular A-11, sections 20.4 (l) and 71.5), the following 
guidance applies. 


The parent (transferor of the appropriation) should report the activity in its financial statements, 
unless the allocation transfer is material to the child's (recipient of the transfer) financial 
statements. If the allocation transfer is material to the child's financial statements, the child 
should report the activity relating to the allocation in all of its financial statements, except the 
Statement of Budgetary Resources. In this case, the parent should continue to report the 
appropriation and the related budgetary activity in its Statement of Budgetary Resources. It is 
the responsibility of the parent to ensure that the reporting to Treasury, through FACTS I, is 
consistent with the presentation in the financial statements. 

 


When the child reports material allocation transfers in its Statement of Net Cost, both the parent 
and the child should report a reconciling item on their respective Statements of Financing. In 
their footnotes, the parent and child should provide a general description of the funds transferred 
to or the funds received from another entity, including the nature and purpose of the transfer. 
Agencies are encouraged to add more detail (e.g., their trading partner/agency, bureau, and 
account title for each parent appropriation) as they deem necessary. 

 

Note Disclosures Related to the Statement of Custodial Activity 

9.38 Note 38 Incidental Custodial Collections 

 

Organizations that collect immaterial custodial revenues that are incidental to their primary 
mission may disclose the sources and amounts of the collections and the amounts distributed to 
others in accompanying footnotes rather than on the face of the statement. 

 

9.39 Note 39 Nonexchange Revenues 


 

Entities preparing a statement of custodial activity for nonexchange revenue should disclose the: 
(1) basis of accounting, (2) factors affecting the collectability and timing of taxes and other 
nonexchange revenues, and (3) cash collections and refunds by tax year and type of tax for the 
reporting period. These disclosures are described in SFFAS No. 7. 

 


Note Disclosures Not Related to a Specific Statement 

9.40 Note 40 Dedicated Collections 

 

Effective FY 2006, for funds meeting the definition of earmarked funds (see SFFAS 27, 
paragraphs 11-18), follow the instructions for new Note 20 instead of this note. 

 

Effective FY 2006, the following instructions apply only to dedicated collections that do not 
meet the definition of earmarked funds. 

 

A reporting entity may be responsible for funds financed with dedicated collections that are held 
for later use to accomplish the fund's purpose. Such funds include all funds within the Budget 
classified as "trust funds," those funds within the budget that are classified as "special funds" but 
that are similar in nature to trust funds, and those funds within and outside the budget that are 
fiduciary in nature. 

 

Financial information about dedicated collections (i.e., collections material to the reporting 
entity, beneficiaries, or contributors) should be separately presented on the face of the principal 
statements or disclosed in the notes to those statements. Immaterial amounts may be presented 
separately in special reports to the beneficiaries and contributors. Most dedicated collections are 
included in the financial statements of the entity carrying out the program and responsible for 
administration of the fund. The minimum requirements to be reported or disclosed include the 
following: 


 

• A description of each fund’s purpose, how the administrative entity accounts for and 
reports the fund, and its authority to use those collections. 

 

• The sources of revenue or other financing for the period and an explanation of the extent 
to which they are inflows of resources to the government or the result of 
intragovernmental flows. 

 

• Condensed information about assets and liabilities showing investments in Treasury 
securities, other assets, liabilities due and payable to beneficiaries, other liabilities, and 
fund balance. 

 

• Condensed information on net cost and changes to fund balance showing revenues by 
type (exchange/nonexchange), program expenses, other expenses, other financing 
sources, and other changes in fund balance. 

 

• Any revenues, other financing sources, or costs attributable to the fund under accounting 
standards, but not legally allowable as credits or charges to the fund. Preparers are 
encouraged to refer to SFFAS No. 7 paragraphs 83-87 for further guidance on the 
reporting and disclosure requirements for dedicated collections. Effective FY 2006, 
preparers should refer to SFFAS 27 for reporting and disclosure requirements for 
funds meeting the definition of earmarked funds. 

 

9.41 Note 41 Restatements 

 

Agencies shall provide information to address the restatement of financial statements due to 
material errors in a separate note entitled “Restatements”. The following information should be 
addressed in the note: the nature of the error and the reason for the restatement, the year (s) being 
restated, which financial statements are impacted, the amounts being restated, and the effect of 
the restatement on the financial statements as a whole (i.e., change in overall net position, change 
in audit opinion, etc.). In addition, agencies should further discuss the actions management took 
after discovering the error. 

 

 



 


6 The Board eliminated the use of RSSI to report information about weapons systems when it issued SFFAS 23, 
“Eliminating the Category National Defense Property, Plant, and Equipment.” Additionally, SFFAS 25, 
Reclassification of Stewardship Responsibilities and Eliminating the Current Services Assessment, eliminated the 
use of RSSI for reporting stewardship responsibilities. Classification of other items of information currently 
designated RSSI may be dealt with in one or more future standards.

10.1 General6

 

The stewardship objective of Federal financial reporting requires the Federal Government to 
report on its stewardship over certain resources entrusted to it and certain responsibilities 
assumed by it that cannot be measured in traditional financial reports. These resources and 
responsibilities do not meet the criteria for assets and liabilities that are required to be reported in 
the financial statements but are important to understanding the operations and financial condition 
of the Federal Government at the date of the financial statements and in subsequent periods. 

 

Stewardship resources involve substantial investment by the Federal Government for the benefit 
of the Nation. Costs of stewardship-type resources are treated as expenses in the financial 
statements in the year the costs are incurred. However, these costs and resultant resources are 
intended to provide long-term benefits to the public and are included as required supplementary 
stewardship reporting to highlight for the user their long-term-benefit nature and to demonstrate 
accountability over them. Depending on the nature of the resources, stewardship reporting could 
consist of financial or non-financial data. 

 

To achieve the objectives of required supplementary stewardship information (RSSI) reporting, 
resources and responsibilities for which the Federal Government is accountable have been 



Table of Contents 

10.3 Stewardship Investments 


categorized into three distinct groups and measures of accountability established for each. The 
three major groups are as follows: 

• Stewardship Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) 

• Stewardship Investments 

• Stewardship Responsibilities 

 

Reporting requirements for financial and non-financial data have been defined so that the unique 
characteristics of stewardship can be displayed. Entities should make the determination of how 
best to apply the stewardship standards based on a thorough analysis of their individual entity, 
including its mission, financial practices, and the impact of its mission and operations on 
financial report users and on the Nation. All entity determinations of the applicability of 
stewardship standards should be thoroughly documented. 

 

 

10.2 Stewardship Property, Plant and Equipment 

 

Stewardship PP&E consists of assets whose physical properties resemble those of general PP&E 
that are traditionally capitalized in financial statements. However, due to the nature of these 
assets, (1) valuation would be difficult and (2) matching costs with specific periods would not be 
meaningful. Yet, the Federal Government should be able to demonstrate accountability over 
these assets by reporting on their existence and condition. Stewardship PP&E includes: 

 

• Heritage assets, such as Federal monuments and memorials and historically or culturally 
significant property. 

 

• Stewardship land, e.g., land not acquired for or in connection with general PP&E. 

 

10.2A Heritage Assets 

 

Heritage assets are unique and are generally expected to be preserved indefinitely. Heritage 
assets may be unique because they have historical or natural significance, are of cultural, 
educational or artistic importance, or have significant architectural characteristics. These assets 
shall be reported in terms of physical units rather than cost, fair value, or other monetary values. 
No amount shall be shown on the balance sheet of Federal financial statements for heritage 
assets, except for multi-use heritage assets in which the predominant use of the asset is in general 
government operations. The costs of acquisition, betterment, or reconstruction of multi-use 
heritage assets shall be capitalized as general PP&E and depreciated, with required 
supplementary stewardship information providing the physical quantity information for the 
multi-use heritage assets. The costs of acquiring, constructing, improving, reconstructing, or 



 

Information on stewardship definitions, measurement, minimum reporting and implementation 
guidance can be found in SFFAS Nos. 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, 16, and 17. 

 


7 See SFFAS 6, paragraph 78 (footnote 58) for guidance on Management’s authority in determining the level of 
condition. 

8 Condition information may be reported with the deferred maintenance information in RSI. Entities should 
reference the condition and deferred maintenance information if reported elsewhere in the report. 

renovating heritage assets, other than multi-use, shall be considered an expense in the period 
incurred when determining the net cost of operations. 

 



 

10.2B Stewardship Land 

 

Stewardship land is land [and land rights] not acquired for or in connection with items of general 
PP&E. Land is defined as the solid surface of the earth, excluding natural resources. These 
assets shall be reported in terms of physical units rather than cost, fair value, or other monetary 
values. No asset amount shall be shown on the balance sheet of Federal financial statements for 
stewardship land. The acquisition cost of stewardship land shall be considered an expense in the 
period acquired when determining the net cost of operations.

10.3 Stewardship Investments 
Stewardship investments are substantial investments made by the Federal Government for the 
benefit of the nation but are not physical assets owned by the Federal Government. When 
incurred, they are treated as expenses in determining the net cost of operations. However, these 
items merit special treatment so that users of Federal financial reports know the extent of 
investments that are made for long-term benefit. Such investments should be measured in terms 
of expenses incurred for: (1) federally-financed but not federally-owned physical property (Non-
federal Physical Property); (2) certain education and training programs (Human Capital); and (3) 
federally-financed research and development (Research and Development). 


 

10.3A Non-Federal Physical Property 

 

Non-Federal physical property investments are expenses included in the calculation of net cost 
incurred by the reporting entity for the purchase, construction or major renovation of physical 
property owned by state and local governments. Reporting will include data, in nominal dollars, 
on investment for the year being reported upon and the preceding four years. Additional years’ 
data may also be reported if such data would provide a better indication of the nature of the 
investment. 


 

10.3B Human Capital 


 

Human capital investments are expenses included in net cost for education and training programs 
that are intended to: (1) increase or maintain national economic productive capacity, and that (2) 
produce outputs and outcomes that provide evidence of maintaining or increasing national 
productive capacity. The definition excludes education and training expenses for Federal 
civilian and military personnel. Reporting will include data, in nominal dollars, on investment 
for the year being reported upon and the preceding four years. Additional years’ data may also 
be reported if such data would provide a better indication of the investment. 


 


Continued categorization of human capital expenses as investment for stewardship purposes is 
predicated on demonstrated outputs and outcomes consistent with the intent of the program. 
SFFAS No. 8 describes the criteria which shall be met for these expenses to continue to be 
categorized as stewardship investments. Outcome and output measures that are used to justify 
continued treatment of expenses as stewardship investments should be clearly identified in the 
agency's financial statement, and the relationship of the outcomes and outputs to the stewardship 
investments should be readily apparent. 


 

10.3C Research and Development 


 

Research and development investments are expenses included in the calculation of net costs to 
support the search for new or refined knowledge and ideas and for the application or use of such 
knowledge and ideas for the development of new or improved products and processes, with the 
expectation of maintaining or increasing national economic productive capacity or yielding other 
future benefits. Reporting will include data, in nominal dollars, on investment for the year being 
reported upon and the preceding four years. Additional years’ data may also be reported if such 
data would provide a better indication of the investment. 

 

Continued categorization of research and development expenses as investment for stewardship 
purposes is predicated on demonstrated outputs and outcomes consistent with the intent of the 
program. SFFAS No. 8 describes the criteria which shall be met for these expenses to continue 
to be categorized as stewardship investments. Outcome and output measures that are used to 
justify continued treatment of expenses as stewardship investments should be clearly identified 
in the agency's financial statement, and the relationship of the outcomes and outputs to the 
stewardship investments should be readily apparent.

 * In some cases, the information is not available because entities have maintained records on the 
basis of outlays rather than expenses. Agencies in this situation should continue to report 
historical data on an outlay basis for any years in which reporting is required and for which 
expense data is not available. If neither historical expense nor outlay data are available for each 
of the five years, entities need report expense data for only the current reporting year and such 
other years as available. At the end of five years, however, the agency will be able to report the 
expenses, to be categorized as investments, for each of the preceding five years. 

 


9 Under SFFAS 25 Reclassification of Stewardship Responsibilities and Eliminating the Current Services 
Assessment, as amended by SFFAS 26, Presentation of Significant Assumptions for the Statement of Social 
Insurance, the Statement of Social Insurance (SOSI), including accompanying notes and significant assumptions will 
become basic information, while the remaining information about Social Insurance required by SFFAS 17 will be 
reported as RSI. SFFAS 28 defers for one year the effective dates of SSFAS 25 and SFFAS 26. The provisions of 
this standard will be effective for periods beginning after September 30, 2005. 

 

10.4 Stewardship Responsibilities9

 

Reporting on stewardship responsibilities aids in assessing the Federal Government’s financial 
condition and the sufficiency of future budgetary resources to sustain public services and meet 
obligations as they become due. Stewardship responsibilities at the entity-level have been 
identified, and reporting requirements are addressed below, for Social insurance. 
Supplementary stewardship information for social insurance programs is to be reported to 
address fundamental questions about the current and future financial condition of these 
programs. These fundamental questions include whether the programs are sustainable as 
currently constructed and what effect these programs have on the overall financial condition of 
the government. Information required to be disclosed for social insurance programs is intended 
to facilitate an assessment of the long-term sustainability of the program as well as the ability of 
the program to raise resources from future program participants to pay for benefits to present 
participants. 
Disclosure requirements for social insurance programs are discussed in summary below. 
Financial statement preparers and auditors should refer to SFFAS No. 17 for a more detailed 
discussion. 

 




Programs defined as social insurance consist of: 

 

• Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI or Social Security); 

• Hospital Insurance (HI) and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), collectively 
known as Medicare; 

• Railroad Retirement benefits; 

• Black Lung benefits; and 

• Unemployment Insurance (UI). 


 

The RSSI information provided for each of these programs should include the following 
financial and actuarial disclosures: 
• Long-range cashflow projections 
• Long-range projections of the ratio of contributors to beneficiaries (dependency ratio) 


 



• Actuarial present value of future benefits, and future contributions and tax income 
for/from current and future beneficiaries 


 

• Sensitivity analysis illustrating the effect of the changes in the most significant 
assumptions on the projections and present values 

 

• State-by-state solvency analysis for the UI program 

 
The actuarial present value of future benefit payments, contributions and tax income for current 
and future participants should be summarized in a Statement of Social Insurance. The Statement 
of Social Insurance should cover a five-year period beginning with the current period covered in 
the financial statements. Financial and actuarial disclosures should be accompanied by a 
narrative describing the program, how it is financed, how benefits are calculated, and an 
interpretive analysis of trends revealed by the data. Management may provide any additional 
information pertaining to the financial conditions of its program that it believes may be useful 
and appropriate. Additional information on definitions, measurement, minimum reporting and 
implementation guidance, as well as illustrative disclosure formats, can be found in SFFAS No. 
17.

11.1 Managements Discussion & Analysis 

Annual Performance and Accountability Reports (PAR) must contain a section entitled 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The MD&A is Section 1 of the PAR and 
should follow the entity head letter (Secretary’s message). To be useful, the MD&A must be 
concise and readable to a non-technical audience. Not all material items in the basic statements, 
notes and other sections of the annual financial report need to be discussed in MD&A. 

11.1A Purpose 

 

The MD&A should serve as a brief overview of the entire PAR. It includes most important 
matters that could: 

 

• lead to significant actions or proposals by top management of the reporting unit; 

• be significant to the managing, budgeting, and oversight functions of Congress and the 
Administration; or 


• significantly affect the judgment of citizens about the efficiency and effectiveness of their 
Federal Government. 

 


Furthermore, conformance to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for Federal entities 


requires the inclusion of an MD&A of the financial statements and related information. 

 

11.1B Responsibility 

 

The content of MD&A is the responsibility of management. Its preparation should be a joint 
effort of both the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) office and program offices. The MD&A should 
provide a balanced analytical assessment of performance that includes both positive and negative 
information. 

11.1C Scope 

The MD&A is an integral part of the annual financial statement and should be regarded as 
required supplementary information (RSI). The following summarizes the requirements for the 
MD&A as stated in SFFAC No. 3 and SFFAS No. 15. 

 

Pursuant to SFFAS No. 15, the MD&A may reference information in other discrete sections of 
the financial statement or it may be based on information contained in reports 

separate from the financial statement. At a minimum, the MD&A should address the entity’s: 

• mission and organizational structure; 

• performance goals, objectives, and results; 

• financial statements; 

• systems, controls, and legal compliance; and 

 

 

The MD&A should also include forward-looking information about the possible effects of 
anticipated future demands, events, conditions, and trends. Management should discuss 
important problems that need to be addressed, and actions that have been planned or taken to 
address those problems. Actions needed, planned, and taken may be discussed within the 
sections listed above or in a separate section of the MD&A. 

11.1D Mission and Organizational Structure 

The MD&A should contain a brief description of the mission(s) of the entity and describe its 
related organizational structure, consistent with the entity's strategic plan. 

11.1E Performance Goals, Objectives, and Results 

This section should summarize the more detailed performance information reported in the 
Performance Section of the PAR. The MD&A should include (in no specific order): 

 


• Highlights of “most important” performance goals and results (positive and negative) for 
the applicable year related to and consistent with major goals and objectives in the 
entity’s strategic and performance plans, including trend data where available (this 
applies to goals being evaluated by quantitative and descriptive criteria). These 
highlights should: 

 

o Provide a clear, objective picture of the entity’s program results compared to its 
goals and objectives. 

o Indicate the extent to which its programs are achieving their intended goals and 
objectives, and explain performance trends. 

o Discuss the strategies and resources the entity uses to achieve its performance 
goals. 

o Evaluate the significance of underlying factors that may have affected the 
reported performance. These may include information about factors that are 
substantially outside the entity’s control as well as information about factors over 
which the entity has significant control; and 

o Include an explanation of plans and timelines to improve performance where 
targets were not met. 

• A summary of the procedures management has designed and followed to provide 
reasonable assurance that reported performance information is relevant and reliable; 

• A discussion of important limitations and difficulties associated with performance 
measurement and reporting should be noted to the extent relevant. 

 

Entities are encouraged to describe in the PAR how they are currently integrating performance 
and financial information to help the reader assess the relative efficiency and effectiveness of 
entity programs/operations. Efficiency is measured by relating outputs (the quantity of services 
provided) to inputs (the costs incurred to provide the services). Effectiveness is measured by the 
outcome or the degree to which a predetermined objective is met, and is commonly combined 
with cost information to show “cost effectiveness.” Entities should strive to articulate efficiency 
and effectiveness by developing and reporting objective measures that, to the extent possible, 
address efficiency and effectiveness, and by relating major goals and objectives in their strategic 
plan to cost categories (i.e., responsibility segments) presented in the Statement of Net Cost. 
Further, entities should include a strategic vision for enhancing the integration of financial and 
performance information in future PARs. 

11.1F Analysis of the Entity’s Financial Statements and Stewardship Information 

The MD&A should help users understand the entity’s financial results, position and condition 
conveyed in the principal financial statements. The MD&A should include comparisons of the 


10 The annual assurance statements consist of: (1) management’s overall statement of assurance (as required by 
Section 2 and Section 4 of the FMFIA) and (2) management’s assurance over the effectiveness of the internal 
controls over financial reporting, as a subset of the overall statement of assurance. 

current year to the prior year and should provide an analysis of the agency's overall financial 
position and results of operations to assist users in assessing whether that financial position has 
improved or deteriorated as a result of the year's activities. It should give users the benefit of 
management’s understanding of: 

• major changes in types or amounts of assets, liabilities, costs, 
revenues, obligations, and outlays; 

• the relevance of particular balances and amounts shown in the principal financial 
statements, particularly if relevant to important financial management issues; 
and 

• the entity’s stewardship information. 

 

This section should also include a discussion of key financial-related measures that 
emphasize financial trends and assess financial operations. 

 

11.1G Analysis of the Entity’s Systems, Controls, and Legal Compliance 

 

In reporting on the status of systems and internal controls that support preparation of the 
financial statements, performance information, and compliance with applicable laws, 
management should provide a brief summary of material weaknesses revealed by management or 
through audits or otherwise known to management in accordance with the Federal Managers’ 
Financial Integrity Act (Integrity Act). 

 

Beginning with FY 2006, the assurance statement that was previously included as part of the 
Agency Head message will now be separately identified in this section and combined with the 
new separate assurance statement on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
required by OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control. 
Management Assurances shall include the annual assurance statements10 (signed by the head of 
the agency), summary of material weaknesses and non-conformances, and summary of 
corrective action plans. This assurance statement shall also include an annual statement on 
whether the agency's financial management systems conform to government-wide requirements 
(as required by Section 4 of the FMFIA). 

 

The financial systems requirements are mandated by the Federal Financial Management 
Improvement Act (FFMIA) and OMB Circular No. A-127, Financial Management Systems, 
section 7. OMB A-11, Section 52 Information on Financial Management outlines requirements 
for agency's plans for bringing its systems into substantial compliance. Financial management 
systems include both financial and financially-related (or mixed) systems. 


To satisfy the reporting requirements of the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) for fiscal 
year 2005, a brief summary of what agencies have accomplished, and plan to accomplish, must 
be included in the MD&A All other required information, should be included as an item in OAI 
of the report. 

 11.1H Possible Future Effects of Existing Events and Conditions 

The discussion of current demands, risks, uncertainties, events, conditions and trends goes 
beyond a mere description of existing conditions. Management should address the possible 
future effect of those factors that may include, but not necessarily be limited to, demographic 
characteristics, claims, contingencies, deferred maintenance, commitments, or major unfunded 
liabilities. 

Information about the possible effects of anticipated future demands, events, conditions and 
trends should be labeled ”projected” or ”projection” and the key underlying assumptions 
explained. Forward-looking information may comprise a separate section of MD&A or may be 
incorporated with the sections listed in Section 11.1C. 

11.1I Other Management Information, Initiatives, and Issues 

Management has the discretion to include a summary in the MD&A of other information, 
initiatives, and issues it identifies. This could include summarizing entity progress in 
implementing key administration management initiatives. 

11.1J Limitations of the Financial Statements 

The MD&A should include a section articulating the limitations of the principal financial 
statements. This section should state the following: 

1. The principal financial statements have been prepared to report the financial position 
and results of operations of the entity, pursuant to the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 
3515 (b). 

2. While the statements have been prepared from the books and records of the entity in 
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for Federal 
entities and the formats prescribed by OMB, the statements are in addition to the 


financial reports used to monitor and control budgetary resources which are prepared 
from the same books and records. 

 

3. The statements should be read with the realization that they are for a component of 
the U.S. Government, a sovereign entity. 

 

11.2 Deferred Maintenance 

 

Deferred maintenance is maintenance that was not performed when it should have been or was 
scheduled to be and which, therefore, is put off or delayed for a future period. SFFAS 6 as 
amended by SFFAS No. 14 requires that deferred maintenance information be included as RSI. It 
is important to note that footnote 58 cited in par. 78 of SFFAS 6 provides that “Acceptable 
services and condition may vary both between entities and among sites within the same entity. 
Management shall determine what level of service and condition is acceptable.” Determination 
of acceptable condition, therefore, affects the amount of deferred maintenance. In some cases, 
such as heritage assets and stewardship land, management may determine that maintenance is not 
needed. In that case, deferred maintenance would not exist. 

 


For general property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), heritage assets, and stewardship land, the 
following information related to deferred maintenance shall be reported as RSI: 

 


• The identification of each major class of asset for which maintenance was deferred. 

 


• The method of measuring deferred maintenance for each major class of asset. See 
SFFAS Nos. 6 and 14 for detailed guidance on the extent of the disclosures for the 
condition assessment survey or the total life-cycle cost method. Either method may 
be used for measuring deferred maintenance. 

 


Management may elect to present stratification of critical and non critical amounts of 
maintenance needed to return each major class of asset to its acceptable operating condition. If 
management elects to make this disclosure, the disclosure should include management's 
definition of critical and non critical maintenance. Financial statement preparers are encouraged 
to refer to SFFASs No. 6 and 14 for additional information. 

 

11.3 Intragovernmental Amounts 

 

Intragovernmental amounts include transactions between Federal entities included in the 
Financial Report of the United States Government. These transactions include activities with 
Federal CFO Act and non-CFO Act entities as identified in the Treasury Financial Manual. 

 

Report, as required supplementary information, intragovernmental amounts for: (1) assets, (2) 
liabilities, (3) non-exchange revenue, and, (4) for certain reporting entities, earned revenue from 
trade (buy/sell) transactions along with the gross cost to generate such revenue. Report these 


amounts by trading partner (reciprocal Federal entity). Report intragovernmental gross cost to 
generate earned revenue from trade transactions by budget functional classification. 
Intragovernmental asset and liability categories reported as RSI should agree with the 
intragovernmental asset and liability line items reported on the balance sheet. 

 


The intragovernmental RSI may be limited to the consolidated agency-wide financial statements. 
That is, only the 24 executive departments and agencies covered by this Circular are required to 
report intragovernmental RSI in their annual financial statement. The intragovernmental RSI 
reporting requirement does not extend to Federal components that are required to prepare 
financial statements. All amounts should be net of intra-entity transactions (consolidated). 

 

Transactions with components of Federal departments or agencies should not be reported 
separately but should be included in the activity reported for the Federal department or agency. 
For example, Food and Nutrition Service, Forest Service, and Rural Development Mission Area 
are not separate Federal departments or agencies but are components of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), which is a Federal department. Transactions with Food and Nutrition 
Service, Forest Service, and Rural Development Mission Areas would be included in the RSI 
reported for USDA. 

 


 

Intragovernmental Assets: Intragovernmental assets reported as RSI should agree with the 
intragovernmental asset line items and totals on the reporting entity’s consolidated agency-wide 
balance sheet. For each intragovernmental asset line item on the consolidated agency-wide 
balance sheet, a corresponding column heading should be reported in the intragovernmental 
assets supplementary information that identifies the trading partner balances that make up the 
line item. Reporting entities may aggregate trading partners whose individual totals for a 
particular asset category collectively comprise less than 20 percent of the total asset line item 
category. If intragovernmental transactions with a trading partner are material in one asset line 
item category but immaterial in another asset line item category, report transactions with the 
trading partner for each asset line item category. 


 

For example, assume a reporting agency has the following intragovernmental assets: Fund 
Balance with the U.S. Treasury-$200; Accounts Receivable-$100 (Agency A-$82, Agency B-$9, 
Agency C-$4, Agency D - $5); Loans receivable-$100 (Agency A - $5, Agency B-$90, Agency 
C-$5); Investments-$100 (Agency A-$32, Agency B-$50, Agency C-$18); and Other-$20 
(Agency A-$2, Agency B-$15, Agency C-$2, Agency D - $1). In this case, the reporting entity’s 
intragovernmental assets may be presented in the supplementary information as follows (this 
example is for illustrative purposes only): 

 


Intragovernmental assets: 

Trading Fund balance Accounts Loans 

Partner with Treasury receivable receivable Investments Other 

U.S. Treasury $ 200 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ --

Agency B -- 9 90 50 15 

Other -- 9 5 18 3 

Total $ 200 $ 100 $ 100 $ 100 $ 20 

 

Intragovernmental Liabilities: Intragovernmental liabilities reported as RSI should agree with 
the intragovernmental liability line items and totals on the reporting entity’s consolidated 
agency-wide balance sheet. For each intragovernmental liability line item on the consolidated 
agency-wide balance sheet, a corresponding column heading should be reported in the 
intragovernmental liabilities supplementary information that identifies the trading partner 
balances that make up the line item. If intragovernmental transactions with a trading partner are 
material in one liability line item category but immaterial in another liability line item category, 
report transactions with the trading partner for each liability line item category.

11.4 Statement of Budgetary Resources 

 


It is important to monitor budget execution at the individual account level. Accordingly, 
budgetary information aggregated for purposes of the Statement of Budgetary Resources should 
be disaggregated for each of the reporting entity's major budget accounts and presented as RSI. 
For purposes of this presentation, small budget accounts may be aggregated. The major accounts 
and the aggregate of small budget accounts should, in total, agree with the amounts reported on 
the face of the Statement of Budgetary Resources. 

 

11.5 Statement of Custodial Activity 

 


Entities that collect taxes and duties should provide the following required supplementary 
information relating to their potential collections and custodial responsibilities (see SFFAS No. 
7): 

 

• A discussion of the factors affecting the collectibility of compliance assessments 
recognized as taxes receivable, 


 

• If reasonably estimable, claims for refunds that are not yet accrued but are likely 
to be paid when administrative action is complete, 

 


• The amount of assessments that the entity still has statutory authority to collect at 
the end of the period, but has no future collection potential and are therefore 
defined as write-offs, and 

 

• If reasonably estimable, the amounts by which trust funds may be over or under-
funded in comparison with requirements of law. This information should also be 
presented by recipient entities that are trust funds. 


These disclosures are not applicable to exchange revenue presented on the Statement of 
Custodial Activity. 


 


11.6 Segment Information 

 


Each franchise fund and other intragovernmental support revolving fund that is not separately 
reported on the entity's principal statements shall report the following required supplementary 
information: 

 

• Condensed information about assets, liabilities, and net position, as of the reporting date: 
(1) fund balance, (2) accounts receivable, (3) PP&E, (4) other assets, (5) liabilities due 
and payable for goods and services received, (6) deferred revenues, (7) other liabilities, 
and (8) cumulative results of operations. 

 

All franchise funds and other intragovernmental support revolving funds shall report the 
following required supplementary information: 

 

• A brief description of the services provided by the fund and the identity of the fund's 
major customers (major customers are organizations that account for more than 15 
percent of the funds revenues), and 

 

• A summary, for the reporting period, by product or line of business of: (1) the full cost of 
goods and services provided, (2) the related exchange revenues, and (3) the excess of full 
costs over exchange revenues. 

 

 
11.7 Risk Assumed Information 

 

All Federal insurance and guarantee programs, other than social insurance, life insurance, and 
loan guarantee programs, shall report risk- assumed information. These disclosures are in 
addition to the liability for unpaid claims from insured events that have already occurred and any 
contingent liability that meets criteria for recognition. 

 

Risk assumed is generally measured by the present value of unpaid expected losses net of 
associated premiums, based on the risk inherent in the insurance or guarantee coverage in force. 
The specific requirements for risk assumed information are presented in SFFAS No. 5, 
Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government, as part of the discussion of insurance and 
guarantee liabilities (see paragraphs 105 to 114). Note: amendments to SFFAS No. 5 have 
moved these disclosures from RSSI to RSI.

12.1 Performance Measures 

 

 Additional performance measures, beyond key measures included in the MD&A, may be 
presented as Other Accompanying Information. Management has broad discretion in the manner 
in which performance information is displayed. Among the options available to management is 
a statement format similar to the Statement of Program Performance Measures illustrated in 
SFFAC No. 2. Management’s display of performance information should include sufficient 
explanatory information that would help users understand the significance of the measures, the 
results, and any deviations from goals or plans. 

 

12.2 Revenue Foregone 

 

 

12.3 Tax Burden/Tax Gap 

 

Preparers of statements of entities that collect taxes may consider presenting the information 
described below, if the information is readily available and the preparers believe the information 
will enhance the usefulness of the statements. Refer to SFFAS No. 7 for further guidance. 

 

• A perspective on the income tax burden. This could take the form of a summary of 
the latest available information on the income tax and on related income, deductions, 
exemptions, and credits for individuals by income level and for corporations by value 
of assets. 

 

• Available information on the size of the tax gap. Collecting entities should provide 
any relevant estimates of the annual tax gap that become available as a result of 
Federal surveys or studies. 



If the entity discloses differences between the prices it charges in exchange transactions and full 
cost or market price, it should consider providing an estimate of the amount of revenue foregone 
and should explain whether, and to what extent, the quantity demanded was assumed to change 
as a result of a difference in price. 


 

12.4 Tax Expenditures with Directed Flows of Resources 

 

Preparers of statements may consider presenting the information described below, if the 
information is readily available and the preparers believe that the information will enhance the 
usefulness of the statements. See SFFAS No. 7 for further guidance. 


 

• Tax expenditures related to entity programs. Information on tax expenditures 
relevant to entity performance may be presented but it should be appropriately 
described, explained and qualified. 

 

• Directed flows of resources related to entity programs. Information on directed 
flows of resources related to an entity’s programs may be presented but it should be 
appropriately described, explained, and qualified. 

12.5 Management Challenges 

 

The PAR shall include a statement prepared by the agency’s Inspector General (IG) that 
summarizes what the IG considers to be the most serious management and performance 
challenges facing the agency and briefly assesses the agency’s progress in addressing those 
challenges. This statement must be provided to the agency head at least 30 days before the PAR 
due date. Comments by the agency head may be appended to the IG’s statement. The agency 
head may comment on, but not modify the IG statement. The IG’s management challenges 
statement and the agency head’s response should be included as an OAI item in the agency PAR. 


 

12.6 IPIA Reporting Details 

 

 

I. Describe your agency’s risk assessment(s), performed subsequent to compiling your full 
program inventory. List the risk-susceptible programs (i.e., programs that have a 
significant risk of improper payments based on OMB guidance thresholds) identified 
through your risk assessments. Be sure to include the programs previously identified in 
the former Section 57 of OMB Circular A-11. 

 


 

II. Describe the statistical sampling process conducted to estimate the improper payment 
rate for each program identified. 

 


 

III. Describe the Corrective Action Plans for: 

A. Reducing the estimated rate of improper payments. Include in this discussion what is 
seen as the cause(s) of errors and the corresponding steps necessary to prevent future 
occurrences. If efforts are already underway, and/or have been ongoing for some 




 


length of time, it is appropriate to include that information in this section. 


 B. Grant-making agencies with risk susceptible grant programs, discuss what your 
agency has accomplished in the area of funds stewardship past the primary recipient. 
Include the status on projects and results of any reviews. 

 

IV. The table below is required for each reporting agency. Please note the following changes 
from prior year reporting: (1) all risk susceptible programs must be listed in this chart 
whether or not an error measurement is being reported; (2) where no measurement is 
provided, agency should indicate the date by which a measurement is expected; (3) if the 
Current Year (CY) is the baseline measurement year, indicate by either footnote or by “n/a” 
in the Prior Year (PY) column; (4) if any of the dollar amount(s) included in the estimate 
correspond to newly established measurement components in addition to previously 
established measurement components, separate the two amounts to the extent possible; (5) 
include outlay estimates for CY +1, +2, and +3; and (5) agencies are expected to report on 
CY activity, and if not feasible, then PY activity is acceptable. 

 


* Future year outlay estimates (CY+1, +2 and +3) should match the outlay estimates for those years as 
reported in the most recent President’s Budget.

12.7 Other Agency-specific Statutorily Required Reports 

 

Other agency-specific statutorily required reports pertaining to an agency's financial or 
performance management may be included in the performance and Accountability Report after 
consultation with OMB and Congress. The head of the agency must determine if inclusion of an 
agency-specific report will make the reported information more useful to decision makers. 
Consultation with Congress includes the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the 
Committee on Government reform of the House of Representatives, and any other committee of 
Congress having jurisdiction with respect to the report being proposed for consolidation.

1. Scope and Background 

 

As required under the Government Management Reform Act, the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) annually prepares and submits to the President and the Congress, an audited 
financial statement for the preceding fiscal year. The Comptroller General of the United 
States audits these financial statements. As required by this circular, the Financial 
Report of the United States Government (Financial Report) is due no later than December 
15, following the end of the fiscal year. 

 

The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) prepares the Financial Report from data 
provided by Federal entities. Entities that have some activity that is material to at least 
one financial statement line or footnote disclosure must provide their data to Treasury by 
preparing a Closing Package, including special-purpose financial statements, and 
submitting it through the Government-wide Financial Report System (GFRS). In 
addition, these entities must also submit intragovernmental balance information by 
trading partner. The reporting requirements for these processes are provided in the 
Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), Volume 1, Part 2, Chapter 4700. A list of applicable 
entities is also provided in the TFM and Appendix A below, respectively. The TFM is 
available on the web at www.fms.treas.gov. 

 

The special-purpose financial statements directly link the entities’ audited consolidated 
department-level financial statements to the Financial Report. The agencies’ auditors 
will opine on the special-purpose financial statements, including the reclassified balance 
sheets, the statements of net cost, the statements of changes in net position, and the 
accompanying notes. (See OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, as amended, for additional guidance 
on auditing the special-purpose financial statements. See Treasury’s TFM for a listing of 
documents that must accompany the audit opinion on the special-purpose financial 
statements.) The intragovernmental balance information by trading partner, which is 
required to be reconciled quarterly, is subject to agreed upon procedures as defined by 
Treasury in the TFM. In addition, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and the 
Office of Inspector General must provide a copy of the management representation letters 
and the legal representation letter, respectively. (See below for additional guidance on 
preparing and submitting these letters.) 

 

All other executive agencies must submit their pre-closing adjusted trial balances (ATBs) 
through the Federal Agencies’ Centralized Trial Balance System (FACTS I) to be used in 
the compilation of the Financial Report. Reporting entities from the legislative and 
judicial branches of the United States Government are also encouraged to submit their 
ATBs. The reporting requirements for these processes are provided in the TFM. 

 

The Financial Report is prepared from Federal entities audited financial statements and 
trial balances in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles promulgated 
by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB). Entities that are 
required by law or policy to prepare and issue financial statements in accordance with 


accounting standards other than those recommended by FASAB should continue to do so. 
These reporting entities must identify, to Treasury, differences resulting from applying 
different accounting standards that could be material to the users of the reporting entity’s 
financial statements. If these differences are material to the Financial Report, the 
standards promulgated by FASAB should be applied to those material items and 
subsequently sent to Treasury for consolidation into the Financial Report. The reporting 
entities also need to provide, to Treasury, any additional disclosures required by FASAB, 
and Treasury’s TFM, that would not be required by other standards. 

 

2. Legal Representation Letter 

 

When preparing the legal representation letters, the General Counsel should reference the 
guidance found in OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial 
Statements, Appendix H-2 (see www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins). Cases and claims 
should be reported using the format found at www.usdoj.gov/civil/forms/forms.htm. In 
addition to reporting the status of pending contingent liabilities, the interim legal 
representation letters should also include the cases reported in the previous year’s legal 
representation letters that are no longer pending. The final representation letter should be 
limited to new information (i.e., cases that arise subsequent to the interim letter or 
changes in the status of cases that were reported in the interim letter). The final letter 
should not repeat information from the interim letter that has not changed. Any 
subsequent changes in cases that arise after the final representation letter but before the 
end of the audit fieldwork on the Financial Report, must be emailed to Treasury FMS 
(see Appendix C for email address). 

 

When preparing the management schedule which shows how the information contained 
in the legal counsel’s response was considered in preparing the financial statements, the 
Chief Financial Officer should follow the format provided in OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, 
Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, Appendix H-3. The schedule 
should be consistent with information presented in the legal representation letters and the 
footnotes to the financial statements. An assessment as to whether pending, threatened 
litigation or unasserted claims should be reported or disclosed in the financial statements 
must be made by management. This determination extends to cases in which legal 
counsel has classified the likelihood of loss as “unknown.” The name and telephone 
number of the individual who is able to answer questions regarding the presentation of 
legal claims and assessments in the financial statements should also be provided. 

 

The Office of Inspector General should submit the interim and final (updates only) 
legal representation letters and management schedule no later than August 29, and 
November 15, respectively. The documents should be submitted electronically in 
PDF format, including signatures, to the Department of Justice, FMS, and GAO at 
their electronic addresses provided in Appendix C. 

 

The Office of Inspector General should inform FMS, via email, of any subsequent 
changes in cases after the final legal representation letter but prior to November 30. 
On November 30, the email update should be sent to FMS indicating “changes” or 


In accordance with the Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 85, Management 
Representations, management’s representations may be limited to matters that are 
considered either individually or collectively material to the financial statements, 
provided management and the auditor have reached an understanding on materiality for 
this purpose. Materiality may be different for different representations. A discussion of 
materiality may be included explicitly in the representation letter, in either qualitative or 
quantitative terms. Materiality considerations would not apply to those representations 
that are not directly related to amounts included in the financial statements. In addition, 
because of the possible effects of fraud on other aspects of the audit, materiality would 
not apply to management or those employees who have significant roles in internal 
control. 

 

Also in accordance with SAS No. 85, the management representation letter should be 
signed by those members of management with overall responsibility for financial and 
operating matters that the auditor believes are responsible for and knowledgeable about, 
directly or through others in the organization, the matters covered by the representations. 
Such members of management normally include the agency head and the Chief Financial 
Officer. 

 

As required by SAS No. 89, Audit Adjustments, the management letter should include a 
representation regarding the materiality of unrecorded financial statement adjustments 
aggregated by the auditors. A list of any uncorrected misstatements, including those 
audit adjustments waived by the component-level, should be attached to the management 
representation letter. 

 

Management is required to include a representation that addresses the consistency of 
budgetary data reported on the Statement of Budgetary Resources and the budgetary data 
submitted through FACTS II to prepare the year-end SF 133s, Reports on Budget 
Execution and Budgetary Resources. OMB plans to amend OMB Bulletin No. 01-02 to 
include this representation in the future. Management may consider using the following 
sample representation: 

 

The information presented on the Department’s Statement of Budgetary 
Resources agrees with the information submitted on the Department’s 
year-end Reports on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (SF 



“no changes” at their electronic address provided in Appendix C. 

 

3. Management Representation Letter 

 

OMB and the Department of the Treasury rely on the written representations obtained 
from agency management as part of their financial statement audit. Therefore, it is 
important that management representations include all representations that are required 
by generally accepted auditing standards and OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, Appendix E. 
General representations must, however, be modified to be consistent with findings 
reported by the auditor. 

 


133s). This information will be used as input for the fiscal year 20xx 
actual column of the Program and Financing Schedules reported in the 
fiscal year 20xz Budget of the U.S. Government. Such information is 
supported by the related financial records and related data. 

 

Similar to legal representation letters, an email must be sent to OMB/OFFM and the 
Department of the Treasury (Main) (see Appendix C for email address) whether there are 
“no changes” or “changes” due to subsequent changes to the management representation 
letter or agency financial statements that have arisen after the management representation 
letter and financial statements have been submitted but before the end of the audit 
fieldwork on the Financial Report. Management may consider using the following 
sample email: 

 

The purpose of this email is to inform you that nothing has come to our 
attention that would require modification to the management 
representation letter furnished to our auditors, and sent to you, dated 
[insert date]. 

 

Additionally, nothing has come to our attention that would materially 
affect amounts reported in [insert agency’s name]’s financial statements 
for the fiscal years ended September 30, 20xy and 20xx or require 
additional disclosures to these financial statements. 

 

We understand that these representations will be relied upon by the 
Government Accountability Office as part of their efforts in auditing the 
United States Government consolidated financial statements for the fiscal 
years ended September 30, 20xy and 20xx. 

 

Additional representations are required in relation to the audit of the special-purpose 
financial statements (closing package) and can be found in OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, as 
amended, Appendix K. These representations may be combined with the representations 
required for the audit of the general-purpose financial statements (financial statements 
included in Part A of A-136) in one management representation letter rather than two 
separate letters. 

 

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer should submit the management representation 
letters electronically in PDF format, including signatures, to OMB/OFFM, the 
Department of the Treasury (Main), and GAO at the addresses provided in Appendix C. 
The management representation letters should be submitted as soon as they are 
available but no later than November 15 (general-purpose financial statements) and 
November 18 (special-purpose financial statements) following the end of the fiscal 
year. 

 



The Office of the Chief Financial Officer should inform OMB/OFFM and the 
Department of the Treasury (Main), via email, of any updates to the management 
representation letters and updates to financial statements due to subsequent events, 


up through November 30. On November 30, the email update should be sent to 
OMB/OFFM and the Department of the Treasury (Main) indicating “changes” or 
“no changes” at their electronic addresses provided in Appendix C. 

 

4. Adherence to Due Dates 



 

 

The Financial Report is issued 30 days after agencies submit their Performance and 
Accountability Reports to OMB and the Congress. Therefore, it is essential that agencies 
adhere to the dates published in the TFM, Chapter 4700 and Appendix B of Part B of 
Circular A-136. These are “no later than dates;” earlier submissions are encouraged.
