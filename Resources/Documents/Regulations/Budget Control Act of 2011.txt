CAPS WITH SEQUESTER 

SEC. 101. ENFORCING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS. 

Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
Control Act of 1985 is amended to read as follows: 

‘‘SEC. 251. ENFORCING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS. 

‘‘(a) ENFORCEMENT.— 

‘‘(1) SEQUESTRATION.—Within 15 calendar days after Congress 
adjourns to end a session there shall be a sequestration 
to eliminate a budget-year breach, if any, within any category. 

‘‘(2) ELIMINATING A BREACH.—Each non-exempt account 
within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated 
by multiplying the enacted level of sequestrable budgetary 
resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage 
necessary to eliminate a breach within that category. 

‘‘(3) MILITARY PERSONNEL.—If the President uses the 
authority to exempt any personnel account from sequestration 
under section 255(f), each account within subfunctional category 
051 (other than those military personnel accounts for which 
the authority provided under section 255(f) has been exercised) 
shall be further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by 
multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt budgetary 
resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage 
necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which outlays 
are not reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of 
the use of such authority. 

‘‘(4) PART-YEAR APPROPRIATIONS.—If, on the date specified 
in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing 
appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any budget account, 
then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under 
paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from— 

‘‘(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law 
in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; 
and 

‘‘(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account 
is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the 
full-year appropriation for that account. 
‘‘(5) LOOK-BACK.—If, after June 30, an appropriation for 

the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach 
within a category for that year (after taking into account any 
sequestration of amounts within that category), the discretionary 
spending limits for that category for the next fiscal 
year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach. 

‘‘(6) WITHIN-SESSION SEQUESTRATION.—If an appropriation 
for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns 
to end the session for that budget year and before July 1 
of that fiscal year) that causes a breach within a category 
for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration 
of amounts within that category), 15 days later there shall 
be a sequestration to eliminate that breach within that category 
following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) through 
(4). 

‘‘(7) ESTIMATES.—

Reports. 

Consultation. 

PUBLIC LAW 112–25—AUG. 2, 2011 

‘‘(A) CBO ESTIMATES.—As soon as practicable after 
Congress completes action on any discretionary appropriation, 
CBO, after consultation with the Committees on the 
Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, 
shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of 
discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the 
current year, if any, and the budget year provided by 
that legislation. 

‘‘(B) OMB ESTIMATES AND EXPLANATION OF DIF-
FERENCES.—Not later than 7 calendar days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date 
of enactment of any discretionary appropriation, OMB shall 
transmit a report to the House of Representatives and 
to the Senate containing the CBO estimate of that legislation, 
an OMB estimate of the amount of discretionary new 
budget authority and outlays for the current year, if any, 
and the budget year provided by that legislation, and an 
explanation of any difference between the 2 estimates. 
If during the preparation of the report OMB determines 
that there is a significant difference between OMB and 
CBO, OMB shall consult with the Committees on the 
Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate 
regarding that difference and that consultation shall 
include, to the extent practicable, written communication 
to those committees that affords such committees the opportunity 
to comment before the issuance of the report. 

‘‘(C) ASSUMPTIONS AND GUIDELINES.—OMB estimates 
under this paragraph shall be made using current economic 
and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB estimates 
transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph. 
OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph 
in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined 
after consultation among the Committees on the 
Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, 
CBO, and OMB. 

‘‘(D) ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS.—For purposes of this 
paragraph, amounts provided by annual appropriations 
shall include any discretionary appropriations for the current 
year, if any, and the budget year in accounts for 
which funding is provided in that legislation that result 
from previously enacted legislation. 

‘‘(b) ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.— 
‘‘(1) CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS.—When the President sub


mits the budget under section 1105 of title 31, United States 

Code, OMB shall calculate and the budget shall include adjust


ments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as 

cumulatively adjusted) for the budget year and each outyear 

to reflect changes in concepts and definitions. Such changes 

shall equal the baseline levels of new budget authority and 

outlays using up-to-date concepts and definitions, minus those 

levels using the concepts and definitions in effect before such 

changes. Such changes may only be made after consultation 

with the Committees on Appropriations and the Budget of 

the House of Representatives and the Senate, and that consulta


tion shall include written communication to such committees 

that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before 

official action is taken with respect to such changes. 


PUBLIC LAW 112–25—AUG. 2, 2011 125 STAT. 243 

‘‘(2) SEQUESTRATION REPORTS.—When OMB submits a 
sequestration report under section 254(e), (f), or (g) for a fiscal 
year, OMB shall calculate, and the sequestration report and 
subsequent budgets submitted by the President under section 
1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, shall include adjustments 
to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as 
adjusted) for the fiscal year and each succeeding year, as follows:

OPERATIONS/GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.—If, for any 
fiscal year, appropriations for discretionary accounts are

Operations/Global War on Terrorism in statute

subsequently so designates, 

the adjustment shall be the total of such appropriations 
in discretionary accounts designated as emergency requirements 
or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War 
on Terrorism, as applicable.

title XVI of the Social Security Act, then the adjustments 
for that fiscal year shall be the additional new budget

fiscal year, but shall not exceed— 

‘‘(I) for fiscal year 2012, $623,000,000 in additional
