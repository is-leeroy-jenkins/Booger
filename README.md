- A quick & dirty C# application that interacts with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API
- Based on WPF and Net6. Can also be used with Net8.

## Setup
Create an Open AI account to obtain an API key (free):
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

You can use the key as a command line parameter (without compiling the project):
1. Click Booger.exe under Releases on the right side of this page
2. Download Booger.zip
3. Unzip the file and run Booger.exe /the key obtained above (Booger.exe /sk-Ih...WPd)

Or in App.xaml.cs, modify this:
"<Your Open AI API Key is something like \"sk-Ih...WPd\">";

Build Booger.sln with Visual Studio 2022 (Community version okay).  This app is targeted for .NET 6 and 8. 
If you don't have .NET 8 installed, remove net8.0-windows in Booger.csproj.
