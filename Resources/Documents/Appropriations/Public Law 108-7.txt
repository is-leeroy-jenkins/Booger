206 and 16 U.S.C. 1861a (b)-(e); except that the program may apply to 
multiple fisheries; except that within 90 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish a public notice in 
the Federal Register and issue an invitation to bid for reduction 
payments that specifies the contractual terms and conditions under which 
bids shall he made and accepted under this section; except that section 
144(d)(1)(K)(3) of title I, division B of Public Law 106-554 shall apply 
to the program implemented by this section.

    (b) A reduction fishery is eligible for capacity reduction under the 
program implemented under this section; except that no vessel harvesting 
and processing whiting in the catcher-processors sector (section 19 
660.323(a)(4)(A) of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations) may 
participate in any capacity reduction referendum or industry fee 
established under this section.
    (c) A referendum on the industry fee system shall occur after bids 
have been submitted, and such bids have been accepted by the Secretary, 
as follows: members of the reduction fishery, and persons who have been 
issued Washington, Oregon, or California Dungeness crab and Pink shrimp 
permits, shall be eligible to vote in the referendum to approve an 
industry fee system; referendum votes cast in each fishery shall be 
weighted in proportion to the debt obligation of each fishery, as 
calculated in subsection (f) of this section; the industry fee system 
shall be approved if the referendum votes cast in favor of the proposed 
system constitute a simple majority of the participants voting; except 
that notwithstanding 5 U.S.C. 553 and 16 U.S.C. 1861a(e), the Secretary 
shall not prepare or publish proposed or final regulations for the 
implementation of the program under this section before the referendum

    (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the 
Pacific Fishery Management Council from recommending, or the Secretary 
from approving, changes to any fishery management plan, in accordance 
with applicable law; or the Secretary from promulgating regulations 
(including regulations governing this program), after an industry fee 
system has been approved by the reduction fishery.

[Page 117 STAT. 81]

    (e) The Secretary shall determine, and state in the public notice 
published under paragraph (a), all program implementation aspects the 
Secretary deems relevant.
    (f) Any bid submitted in response to the invitation to bid issued by 
the Secretary under this section shall be irrevocable; the Secretary 
shall use a bid acceptance procedure that ranks each bid in accordance 
with this paragraph and with additional criteria, if any, established by 
the Secretary: for each bid from a qualified bidder that meets the 
bidding requirements in the public notice or the invitation to bid, the 
Secretary shall determine a bid score by dividing the bid's dollar 
amount by the average annual total ex-vessel dollar value of landings of 
Pacific groundfish, Dungeness crab, and Pink shrimp based on the 3 
highest total annual revenues earned from such stocks that the bidder's 
reduction vessel landed during 1998, 1999, 2000, or 2001. For purposes 
of this paragraph, the term ``total annual revenue'' means the revenue 
earned in a single year from such stocks. The Secretary shall accept 
each qualified bid in rank order of bid score from the lowest to the 
highest until acceptance of the next qualified bid with the next lowest 
bid score would cause the reduction cost to exceed the reduction loan's 
maximum amount. Acceptance of a bid by the Secretary shall create a 
binding reduction contract between the United States and the person 
whose bid is accepted, the performance of which shall be subject only to 
the conclusion of a successful referendum, except that a person whose 
bid is accepted by the Secretary under this section shall relinquish all 
permits in the reduction fishery and any Dungeness crab and Pink shrimp 
permits issued by Washington, Oregon, or California; except that the 
Secretary shall revoke the Pacific groundfish permit, as well as all 
Federal fishery licenses, fishery permits, area, and species 
endorsements, and any other fishery privileges issued to a vessel or 
vessels (or to persons on the basis of their operation or ownership of 
that vessel or vessels) removed under the program.
    (g) The Secretary shall establish separate reduction loan sub-
amounts and repayment fees for fish sellers in the reduction fishery and 
for fish sellers in each of the fee-share fisheries by dividing the 
total ex-vessel dollar value during the bid scoring period of all 
reduction vessel landings from the reduction fishery and from each of 
the fee-share fisheries by the total such value of all such landings for 
all such fisheries; and multiplying the reduction loan amount by each of 
the quotients resulting from each of the divisions above. Each of the 
resulting products shall be the reduction loan sub-amount for the 
reduction fishery and for each of the fee-share fisheries to which each 
of such products pertains; except that, each fish seller in the 
reduction fishery and in each of the fee-share fisheries shall pay the 
fees required by the reduction loan sub-amounts allocated to it under 
this paragraph; except that, the Secretary may enter into agreements 
with Washington, Oregon, and California to collect any fees established 
under this paragraph.
    (h) Notwithstanding 46 U.S.C. App. 1279(b)(4), the reduction loan's 
term shall not be less than 30 years.
    (i) It is the sense of the Congress that the States of Washington, 
Oregon, and California should revoke all relinquishment permits in each 
of the fee-share fisheries immediately after reduction payment, and 
otherwise to implement appropriate State fisheries management and 
conservation provisions in each of the fee-share fisheries that 
establishes a program that meets the requirements

[Page 117 STAT. 82]

of 16 U.S.C. 141861a(b)(1)(B) as if it were applicable to fee-share 
fisheries.
    (j) The term ``fee-share fishery'' means a fishery, other than the 
reduction fishery, whose members are eligible to vote in a referendum 
for an industry fee system under paragraph (c). The term ``reduction 
fishery'' means that portion of a fishery holding limited entry fishing 
permits endorsed for the operation of trawl gear and issued under the 
Federal Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan.
    Sec. 213. (a) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is 
authorized to enter into a lease arrangement whereby the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will relocate the National 
Weather Service Forecasting Office in Galveston County, League City, 
Texas to a Galveston County facility and, in exchange, Galveston County 
may use the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
National Weather Service Forecasting Office.
    (b) Neither the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
National Weather Service nor Galveston County will charge the other rent 
for use of the space and each will be responsible for the operation, 
maintenance and renovation costs it incurs.

conservation activities, enforcement and surveillance--cooperative 
enforcement and vessel monitoring, stock assessments--data collection, 
and highly migratory shark fishery research under the heading, 
``National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Operations, Research 
and Facilities'', shall be considered to be within the ``Coastal 
Assistance sub-category'' in section 250(c)(4)(K) of the Balanced Budget

Grant (except for the fellowship program) under the heading, ``National

            (1) There is a lack of transparency in the revenues and

            (2) In such countries, official revenues--particularly from 
        natural resource extraction--are often unreported, under-
        reported, or inaccurately recorded by foreign government 
        agencies.
            (3) Such inefficiencies--which in some instances mask 
        outright theft--result in the failure of such governments to 
        adequately provide their citizens with social, political, 
        economic, and legal benefits and opportunities, and undermine 
        the effectiveness of assistance provided to such countries by 
        the United States and other international donors.

        governing the public disclosure of revenues and expenditures in 
        national budgets;

        extent to which they are implemented and enforced;

        laws or regulations exist, and the extent to which such revenues 
        and expenditures are publicly disclosed; and

[Page 117 STAT. 272]

assistance for projects, productions, workshops, or programs that serve 
underserved populations.
    (b) In this section:
            (1) The term ``underserved population'' means a population 
        of individuals, including urban minorities, who have 
        historically been outside the purview of arts and humanities 
        programs due to factors such as a high incidence of income below 
        the poverty line or to geographic isolation.
            (2) The term ``poverty line'' means the poverty line (as 
        defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised 
        annually in accordance with section 673(2) of the Community 
        Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)) applicable to a 
        family of the size involved.

    (c) In providing services and awarding financial assistance under

of 1965--
            (1) the Chairperson shall establish a grant category for

        national impact or availability or are able to tour several 
        States;
            (2) the Chairperson shall not make grants exceeding 15

            (3) <<NOTE: Reports.>> the Chairperson shall report to the 
        Congress annually and by State, on grants awarded by the 
        Chairperson in each grant category under section 5 of such Act; 
        and
            (4) the Chairperson shall encourage the use of grants to 
        improve and support community-based music performance and 
        education.

    Sec. 312. No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall 
be expended or obligated to complete and issue the 5-year program under 
the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act.
    Sec. 313. None of the funds in this Act may be used to support 
Government-wide administrative functions unless such functions are 
justified in the budget process and funding is approved by the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations.
    Sec. 314. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the 
funds in this Act may be used for GSA Telecommunication Centers.
    Sec. 315. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for fiscal 
year 2003 the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior are authorized 
to limit competition for watershed restoration project contracts as part 
of the ``Jobs in the Woods'' Program established in Region 10 of the 
Forest Service to individuals and entities in historically timber-
dependent areas in the States of Washington, Oregon, northern 
California, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska that have been affected by 
reduced timber harvesting on Federal lands. The Secretaries shall 
consider the benefits to the local economy in evaluating

[Page 117 STAT. 273]

bids and designing procurements which create economic opportunities for 
local contractors.
    Sec. 316. Amounts deposited during fiscal year 2002 in the roads and 
trails fund provided for in the 14th paragraph under the heading 
``FOREST SERVICE'' of the Act of March 4, 1913 (37 Stat. 843; 16 U.S.C. 
501), shall be used by the Secretary of Agriculture, without regard to 
the State in which the amounts were derived, to repair or reconstruct 
roads, bridges, and trails on National Forest System lands or to carry 
out and administer projects to improve forest health conditions, which 
may include the repair or reconstruction of roads, bridges, and trails 
on National Forest System lands in the wildland-community interface 
where there is an abnormally high risk of fire. The projects shall 
emphasize reducing risks to human safety and public health and property 
and enhancing ecological functions, long-term forest productivity, and 
biological integrity. The projects may be completed in a subsequent 
fiscal year. Funds shall not be expended under this section to replace 
funds which would otherwise appropriately be expended from the timber 
salvage sale fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt 
any project from any environmental law.
    Sec. 317. Other than in emergency situations, none of the funds in 
this Act may be used to operate telephone answering machines during core 
business hours unless such answering machines include an option that 
enables callers to reach promptly an individual on-duty with the agency 
being contacted.
    Sec. 318. No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised if the 
indicated rate is deficit when appraised using a residual value approach 
that assigns domestic Alaska values for western redcedar. Program 
accomplishments shall be based on volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in 
fiscal year 2003, the annual average portion of the decadal allowable 
sale quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan in 
sales which are not deficit when appraised using a residual value 
approach that assigns domestic Alaska values for western redcedar, all 
of the western redcedar timber from those sales which is surplus to the 
needs of domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made available to 
domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States at prevailing 
domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, less than 
the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity called 
for in the Tongass Land Management Plan in sales which are not deficit 
when appraised using a residual value approach that assigns domestic 
Alaska values for western redcedar, the volume of western redcedar 
timber available to domestic processors at prevailing domestic prices in 
the contiguous 48 United States shall be that volume: (i) which is 
surplus to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska, and (ii) is that 
percent of the surplus western redcedar volume determined by calculating 
the ratio of the total timber volume which has been sold on the Tongass 
to the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity 
called for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan. The percentage 
shall be calculated by Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is sold 
(for purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the 
determination of how much western redcedar is eligible for sale to 
various markets shall be made at the time each sale is awarded). Western 
redcedar shall be deemed ``surplus to the needs of domestic processors 
in Alaska'' when the

[Page 117 STAT. 274]

timber sale holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation of 
the inability to sell western redcedar logs from a given sale to 
domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to or greater than the log 
selling value stated in the contract. All additional western redcedar 
volume not sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 United States domestic 
processors may be exported to foreign markets at the election of the 
timber sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at prevailing 
export prices at the election of the timber sale holder.
    Sec. 319. <<NOTE: 16 USC 460l-6a note.>> A project undertaken by the 
Forest Service under the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program as 
authorized by section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as amended, shall not 
result in--
            (1) displacement of the holder of an authorization to 
        provide commercial recreation services on Federal lands. Prior 
        to initiating any project, the Secretary shall consult with 
        potentially affected holders to determine what impacts the 
        project may have on the holders. Any modifications to the 
        authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions of 
        the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency.
            (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the 
        Secretary for operation when such services have been provided in 
        the past by a private sector provider, except when--
                    (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such 
                opportunities;
                    (B) the private sector provider terminates its 
                relationship with the agency; or
                    (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance 
                with the terms and conditions of the authorization.

In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee Demonstration 
Program to provide for operations until a subsequent operator can be 
found through the offering of a new prospectus.
    Sec. 320. <<NOTE: 16 USC 1604 note.>> Prior to October 1, 2003, the 
Secretary of Agriculture shall not be considered to be in violation of 
subparagraph 6(f)(5)(A) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources 
Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)(A)) solely because more than 
15 years have passed without revision of the plan for a unit of the 
National Forest System. Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary 
from any other requirement of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable 
Resources Planning Act (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or any other law: 
Provided, That if the Secretary is not acting expeditiously and in good 
faith, within the funding available, to revise a plan for a unit of the 
National Forest System, this section shall be void with respect to such 
plan and a court of proper jurisdiction may order completion of the plan 
on an accelerated basis.

    Sec. 321. <<NOTE: 16 USC 565a-1 note.>> Until September 30, 2005, 
the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into an agreement 
under the first section of Public Law 94-148 (16 U.S.C. 565a-1) for a 
purpose described in such section includes the authority to use that 
legal instrument when the principal purpose of the resulting 
relationship is to the mutually significant benefit of the Forest 
Service and the other party or parties to the agreement, including 
nonprofit entities. An agreement entered into under this section shall 
not be subject to Public Law 95-224, Federal Grant and Cooperative 
Agreement Act (1977).

[Page 117 STAT. 275]

    Sec. 322. No funds provided in this Act may be expended to conduct 
preleasing, leasing and related activities under either the Mineral 
Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the Outer Continental Shelf Lands 
Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) within the boundaries of a National 
Monument established pursuant to the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--

        representative of the King of Spain, which grant was recognized 
        and confirmed by Congress in 1858 (11 Stat. 374); and
            (2) in 1994, the Pueblo filed a civil action against the

        the United States District Court for the District of Columbia 
        (Civil No. 1:94CV02624), asserting that Federal surveys of the 
        grant boundaries erroneously excluded certain land within the 
        Cibola National Forest, including a portion of the Sandia 
        Mountain Wilderness.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to establish the T'uf Shur Bien Preservation Trust Area 
        in the Cibola National Forest;
            (2) to confirm the status of national forest land and 
        wilderness land in the Area while resolving issues associated 
        with the civil action referred to in subsection (a)(2) and the 
        opinions of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior 
        dated December 9, 1988 (M-36963; 96 I.D. 331) and January 19, 
        2001 (M-37002); and
            (3) to provide the Pueblo, the parties to the civil action, 
        and the public with a fair and just settlement of the Pueblo's 
        claim.

withhold consent to new uses in the Area as set forth in section 
405(a)(3)(A).
    (c) Not Precedent.--The provisions of this title creating certain 
rights and interests in the National Forest System are uniquely suited

Fee Improvement Act of 2003''.

SEC. 502. <<NOTE: 16 USC 6231.>> FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND DEFINITIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Organizational camps, such as those administered by the 
        Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and faith-based and community-based 
        organizations, provide a valuable service to young people, 
        individuals with a disability, and their families by promoting 
        physical, mental, and spiritual health through activities 
        conducted in a natural environment.
            (2) The 192,000,0000 acres of national forests and 
        grasslands of the National Forest System managed for multiple 
        uses by the Forest Service provides an ideal setting for such 
        organizational camps.
            (3) The Federal Government should charge land use fees for 
        the occupancy and use of National Forest System lands by such 
        organizational camps that, while based on the fair market value 
        of the land in use, also recognize the benefits provided to 
        society by such organizational camps, do not preclude the 
        ability of such organizational camps from utilizing these lands, 
        and permit capital investment in, and maintenance of, camp 
        facilities by such organizational camps or their sponsoring 
        organizations.
            (4) Organizational camps should--
                    (A) ensure that their facilities meet applicable 
                building and safety codes, including fire and health 
                codes;
                    (B) have annual inspections as required by local 
                law, including at a minimum inspections for fire and 
                food safety; and
                    (C) have in place safety plans that address fire and 
                medical emergencies and encounters with wildlife.

    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a land use 
fee system that provides for an equitable return to the Federal 
Government for the occupancy and use of National Forest System lands by 
organizational camps that serve young people or individuals with a 
disability.
    (c) Definitions.--In this Act:
            (1) The term ``organizational camp'' means a public or 
        semipublic camp that--

[Page 117 STAT. 295]

                    (A) is developed on National Forest System lands by 
                a nonprofit organization or governmental entity;
                    (B) provides a valuable service to the public by 
                using such lands as a setting to introduce young people 
                or individuals with a disability to activities that they 
                may not otherwise experience and to educate them on 
                natural resource issues; and
                    (C) does not have as its primary purpose raising 
                revenue through commercial activities.
            (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of 
        Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service.
            (3) The term ``individual with a disability'' has the 
        meaning given the term in section 7(20) of the Rehabilitation 
        Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 705(20)).
            (4) The term ``children at risk'' means children who are 
        raised in poverty or in single-parent homes or are subject to 
        such circumstances as parental drug abuse, homelessness, or 
        child abuse.
            (5) The term ``change in control'' means--
                    (A) for a corporation, the sale or transfer of a 
                controlling interest in the corporation;

                organizational camp subject to this Act to another 
                party.

        annual land use fee for each organizational camp for its

        percent of the product of the following:
                    (A) The total number of acres of National Forest 
                System lands authorized for the organizational camp.
                    (B) The estimated per-acre market value of land and 
                buildings in the county where the camp is located, as 
                reported in the most recent Census of Agriculture 
                conducted by the National Agricultural Statistics 
                Service.
            (2) Annual adjustment.--The land use fee determined under 
        paragraph (1) for an organizational camp shall be adjusted 
        annually by the annual compounded rate of change between the two

            (3) Reduction in fees.--
                    (A) Type of participants.--The Secretary shall 
                reduce the land use fee determined under paragraph (1) 
                proportionate to the number of individuals with a 
                disability and children at risk who annually attend the 
                organizational camp.
                    (B) Type of programs.--After making the reduction 
                required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall reduce 
                the remaining land use fee amount by up to 60 percent, 
                proportionate to the number of persons who annually 
                attend the organizational camp who participate in youth

[Page 117 STAT. 296]

                programs through organized and supervised social, 
                citizenship, character-building, or faith-based 
                activities oriented to outdoor-recreation experiences.
                    (C) Relation to minimum fee.--The reductions made 
                under this paragraph may not reduce the land use fee for 
                an organizational camp below the minimum land use fee 
                required to be charged under paragraph (4).
                    (D) Special considerations.--For purposes of 
                determining the amount of the land use fee reduction 
                required under subparagraph (A) or (B), the Secretary 
                may not take into consideration the existence of 
                sponsorships or scholarships to assist persons in 
                attending the organizational camp.
            (4) Minimum land use fee.--The Secretary shall charge a 
        minimum land use fee under paragraph (1) that represents, on 
        average, the Secretary's cost annually to administer an 
        organizational camp special use authorization in the National 
        Forest Region in which the organizational camp is located. 
        Notwithstanding paragraph (3) or subsection (d), the minimum

        camp uses a Government-owned facility on National Forest System 
        lands pursuant to section 7 of the Act of April 24, 1950 
        (commonly known as the Granger-Thye Act; 16 U.S.C. 580d), the

        the value of the authorized facilities, as determined by the 
        Secretary.
            (2) Reduction in fees prohibited.--Notwithstanding 
        subsection (d), the facility use fees determined under paragraph 
        (1) shall not be subject to a reduction or waiver.

    (c) Fee Related to Receipt of Other Revenues.--If an organizational 
camp derives revenue from the use of National Forest System lands or 
authorized facilities described in subsection (b) for purposes other 
than to introduce young people or individuals with a disability to 
activities that they may not otherwise experience and to educate them on 
natural resource issues, the Secretary shall charge, in addition to the 
land use fee imposed under subsection (a) and the facility use fee 
imposed under subsection (b), an additional fee equal to 5 percent of 
that revenue.
    (d) Work-In-Lieu Program.--Subject to subsections (a)(4) and (b)(2),

obligation of the Government under section 1501 of title 31, and the

for a project at an airport having at least 0.25 percent of the total

        techniques.

        exit from,'' after ``prior to their arrival in'';

        ``relating to the importation'' and by inserting ``or exit'' 
        after ``port of entry'';

                currently made to ``customs officers'' or ``customs 
                officials'' in this subsection;

                    (C) inserting ``or that have gone directly from that 
                country to the United States'' after ``to that country 
                from the United States'';
                    (D) inserting ``or exportation'' after ``governing 
                the importation'';
                    (E) deleting ``and'' and inserting a comma (``,'') 
                after ``such functions'';
                    (F) inserting ``, and enjoy such privileges and 
                immunities'' after ``such duties'';
                    (G) inserting ``or are afforded'' after ``authorized 
                to perform''; and
                    (H) deleting ``under reciprocal agreement'' and 
                inserting ``by treaty, agreement or law''.
            (4) by adding at the end the following:

    ``(g) Persons designated to perform the duties of an officer of the 
Customs Service pursuant to section 1401 (i) of this title shall be 
entitled to the same privileges and immunities as an officer of the

of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) <<NOTE: 42 USC 300aa-33 note.>> are 
repealed.

    (b) Application <<NOTE: 42 USC 300aa-33 note.>> of the Public Health 
Service Act.--The Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) 
shall be applied and administered as if the sections repealed by 
subsection (a) had never been enacted.

    (c) Rule of <<NOTE: 42 USC 300aa-33 note.>> Construction.--No 
inference shall be drawn from the enactment of sections 1714 through 
1717 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296), or from 
this repeal, regarding the law prior to enactment of sections 1714 
through 1717 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296).

        steps are needed to revitalize our immunization efforts in order 
        to ensure an adequate supply of vaccines and to encourage the 
        development of new vaccines;
            (2) these steps include ensuring that patients who have 
        suffered vaccine-related injuries have the opportunity to seek 
        fair and timely redress, and that vaccine manufacturers, 
        manufacturers of components or ingredients of vaccines, and 
        physicians and other administrators of vaccines have adequate 
        protections;

[Page 117 STAT. 529]

            (3) prompt action is particularly critical given that 
        vaccines are a front line of defense against common childhood 
        and adult diseases, as well as against current and future 
        biological threats; and
            (4) not <<NOTE: Deadline. Reports.>> later than 6 months 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Committee on 
        Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the

        safety programs''; and

        section:

any Congressional committee shall also be submitted to, or held with,

as stipulated by this Act.''.

                to identify Chinese companies which are active in United 
                States markets and are also engaged in proliferation 
                activities or other activities harmful to United States 
                security interests.
