Federal Trust Fund Accounting Guide 

Introduction 

Trust Funds 

The Federal Government account structure consists of the following fund types: trust, special, general, 
revolving, and deposit. The fund type for the establishment of a new Federal account is dependent upon 
the terms stated in the legislation. For example, trust funds are established to carry out purposes of a 
trust agreement or statute. 

The Federal Budget of the U.S. Government groups funds into two major categories: trust funds and 
Federal funds. Trust funds are those designated by law as such, whereby receipts are earmarked for 
spending on specific purposes. The laws establishing trust funds may require balances to be invested, 
typically in Treasury debt securities. A small number of trust funds are further categorized as trust 
revolving funds, established to perform business-type operations. The accounting for trust revolving 
funds is similar to that of revolving funds in the Federal fund group. Federal funds include general, 
revolving, and special fund types. (Because deposit funds collect receipts that do not belong to the 
Federal Government, they are excluded from the Federal Budget.) This Guide covers the accounting 
for Federal trust funds only, excluding trust revolving funds. 

Funding sources for some of the larger dollar-volume trust funds include Federal and non-Federal 
contributions, interest on investments, taxes, premiums, State deposits, Federal fund transfers, excise 
taxes, customs duties, fines and penalties, and user fees. These funds generally are deposited in a trust 
fund receipt account. Trust funds finance various activities, including social insurance payments for 
individuals (e.g., social security, Medicare, and unemployment compensation), highway construction, 
and airport and airway development. There are also several smaller dollar-volume trust funds 
established to carry out the terms of gifts or bequests. 

Trust Fund Account Structure and Designation of Availability 

For trust funds established to collect receipts earmarked for specific spending purposes, Treasury 
Appropriation Fund Symbols (TAFS) are established as receipt and expenditure accounts. Receipt 
accounts are credited with receipts generated by the terms of a trust agreement or statute. An example 
of a TAFS trust fund receipt account structure is 20X8000.001. The "20" indicates Treasury, "X" shows 
the period of availability, "8000" represents the trust fund series, and ".001" is the type of earmarked 
receipt. 

Expenditure accounts are established to record amounts appropriated from trust fund receipt accounts 
that are to be expended in carrying out specific purposes according to the terms of a trust agreement or 
statute. Several receipt accounts can be associated with a single expenditure account. In following the 
example above, the TAFS for the trust fund expenditure account structure is 20X8000. 

Receipts are credited to trust fund receipt accounts at the point of collection. Each receipt account 
is designated as either available or unavailable for expenditure. As indicated in Treasury’s Federal 
Account Symbols and Titles (FAST) Book, approximately 99 percent of all trust fund receipt accounts 


are designated as available. An available receipt account carries the same symbol as its 
corresponding expenditure account. Amounts credited to available receipt accounts are appropriated 
immediately, without further legislative action, into the corresponding expenditure account. These 
amounts may then be invested if the legislation prescribes.1 


A trust fund’s designation of availability for investment has no bearing on whether it is available for 
obligation. For receipts collected that are not immediately available for obligation, the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) requires that budget authority and unobligated balances be excluded 
from the SF 133: Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources. However, if the law 
designates the receipts as available for investment, Treasury requires that unobligated balances be 
reported on the USSGL 2108: Year-End Closing Statement. This presents a disconnect in the reporting 
of unobligated balances, which Treasury and OMB acknowledge as a reconciling item. Receipts 
classified as available for investment but not obligation are discussed in Scenario III, Trust Fund 
Receipts Available for Investment but not Obligation. 

Not all funds received by trust funds are deposited to trust fund receipt accounts. For example, amounts 
are credited directly to trust fund expenditure accounts when nonexpenditure transfers occur. 
Nonexpenditure transfers are accomplished via an SF 1151: Nonexpenditure Transfer Authorization, and 
include both appropriation and allocation transfers. Refer to Scenario I, Basic Trust Fund Accounting, for 
further discussion. 

Refer to the flowchart at the end of this section for a basic illustration of a trust fund account structure 
and flow. 

Scenario Presentation 

This Guide is categorized into eight scenarios. The scenarios address specific topics approved by the 
USSGL Board. Each scenario begins with a narrative describing the events that follow. Additional 
scenarios will be forthcoming as guidance is further developed. This Guide also will be updated 
periodically to include new and revised USSGL account titles and transaction descriptions. The 
scenarios are as follows: 

• Scenario I Basic Trust Fund Accounting 
• Scenario II Trust Fund Balances Precluded from Obligation 
• Scenario III Trust Fund Receipts Available for Investment but not Obligation 
• Scenario IV Trust Fund Investments 
• Scenario V Treasury-Managed Trust Fund Allocation Accounts 
• Scenario VI Trust Fund Appropriation Transfers for Specific Treasury Appropriation 


 Fund Symbols 

• Scenario VII Trust Funds with Contract Authority – Part I: Appropriations to Liquidate 


Contract Authority – Funded by Nonexpenditure Transfers 

• Scenario VIII Trust Funds with Contract Authority – Part II: Transfers of Contract 


Authority 

1TFM Vol. I Part 2 - Chapter 1500 states that "all trust funds with investment authority are designated as available receipts in 
the Treasury system, even if the receipts of the trust fund are not available to the agency for obligation." 



Scenario Guidelines 

The following concepts apply to each scenario: 

• The scenarios are not all inclusive of the different types of revenues and/or expenses that 
may be recorded by a trust fund entity. The intent is to illustrate the main concepts through 
basic transactions recorded by trust funds. Refer to Section III, Accounting Transactions, of 
TFM S2-01-02 (as updated) for a complete listing of USSGL accounts that may be recorded 
by trust funds. Section III is located on the USSGL Web site. 
• Trust funds may or may not be subject to apportionment. Apportionments may apply to all or 
a portion of a trust fund. The scenarios vary in nature as to whether the trust fund is subject to 
apportionment. Refer to Section III, Accounting Transactions, of TFM S2-01-02 (as updated) 
for a complete listing of transactions. 
• Budgetary and financial reports reflect the pertinent lines to be reported based on the 
individual scenarios. For full presentations of the reports and line descriptions, refer to the 
appropriate authoritative guidance (see References section below).

Scenario I includes transactions and reports illustrating basic accounting for receipts and collections, 
expenditure transfers, nonexpenditure transfers, and exchange/nonexchange transactions. FASAB’s 
SFFAS #7, Accounting for Revenue and Other Financing Sources, prescribes the majority of proprietary 
accounting contained in this scenario. (Refer to Scenario IV, Trust Fund Investments, for discussion on 
investment transactions.) 

 

A basic concept of trust fund accounting is that trust funds do not use USSGL accounts 3100 
Unexpended Appropriations or 5700 Expended Appropriations (refer to SFFAS #7, paragraph 213). At 
least two justifications support this concept. 

 

First, trust funds do not receive Treasury appropriation warrants, for which Fiscal Service Form 6200: 
Appropriation Warrant is issued from the General Fund of Treasury as a result of an appropriation act. 
USSGL account 3100 Unexpended Appropriations generally is associated with these types of warrants. 
Instead, the source of most trust fund inflows includes receipts and collections that are either deposited 
directly into trust funds or first collected by a custodial entity. 

 

Second, trust fund receipts predominantly consist of tax receipts (e.g., social security taxes, railroad 
retirement taxes, and excise taxes), as well as customs duties, fines, penalties, etc. Collecting entities 
such as the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs Service collect these receipts and deposit 
them into Treasury general fund receipt accounts. 

 

SFFAS #7 states that dedicated tax receipts, as well as amounts transferred-in from collecting entities, 
should be recorded as revenue, not as part of unexpended appropriations (USSGL 3100). Furthermore, 
to account for these receipts as revenue and as unexpended appropriations in the same trust fund account 
would double-count the amounts as financing sources.1 Therefore, all USSGL trust fund guidance (i.e., 
guidance contained within this Guide) reflects that USSGL account 3100 Unexpended Appropriations 
and corresponding account 5700 Expended Appropriations are not recorded by trust fund appropriation 
fund symbols. 

1 SFFAS #7 - Accounting for Revenue and Other Financing Sources, paragraphs 60 and 213 

2 TFM Vol. I Part 2 - Chapter 2000; OMB Circular A-34 Sections 12.10 and 12.11 (dated November 3, 2000) 

3 For USSGL account definitions, refer to Section II, Accounts and Definitions, of TFM S2-01-02 (as updated). 

 

USSGL transfer accounts are split between nonexpenditure and expenditure transfers. This is because 
Treasury and OMB guidance prescribes different reporting requirements for each type of transfer.2 

 

The four proprietary USSGL accounts established to account for trust fund transfers are as follows:3 

 

5750 Expenditure Financing Sources – Transfers-In 

5755 Non-expenditure Financing Sources – Transfers-In 

5760 Expenditure Financing Sources – Transfers-Out 

5765 Non-expenditure Financing Sources – Transfers-Out 

 

For trust fund transfers, the appropriate action would be to either debit or credit the appropriate transfer 
account, rather than record USSGL accounts 3100 and/or 5700. Nonexpenditure USSGL accounts 5755 


and 5765 capture all trust-to-trust transfers, which, by definition, are nonexpenditure.

4 TFM Vol. I Part 2 - Chapter 2000 

5 Refer to TFM Vol. I Part 2 - Chapter 2000 for the distinction between the different types of nonexpenditure transfers. 

6 TFM Vol. I Part 2 - Chapter 2000; OMB Circular A-34 Section 12.11 (dated November 3, 2000) 

 

Expenditure USSGL accounts 5750 and 5760 capture transfers between trust funds and Federal funds 
(such as an agency’s general fund). This, by definition, is an expenditure transaction.6 However, these 
transfer accounts are recorded only if the transfer results from a nonexchange transaction, such as a law 
requiring the transfer. If the transaction is exchange in nature, then record a revenue or an expense 
account. On the budgetary side for expenditure transfers, the entity transferring-out must record an 
outlay, and the entity transferring-in must record a receipt or an appropriation. 

 

Other USSGL accounts were established to accommodate transfers between trust funds and Federal 
funds. They provide the mechanism to transfer financing sources where the funds remain invested for 
transfer at a later date. The proprietary USSGL accounts established for this purpose include: 

 

1335 Expenditure Transfers Receivable 
2155 Expenditure Transfers Payable 


 

On the budgetary side, the following USSGL account was established: 

 

 4114 Appropriated Trust or Special Fund Receipts 

 

Trust funds are to use USSGL account 4114 for appropriated receipts in the same way that Federal funds 
(with the exception of special funds) are to use USSGL budgetary account 4119 Other Appropriations 
Realized for appropriations received. USSGL account 4119 is not appropriate for trust funds to record 
for several reasons. First, it generally correlates with USSGL proprietary account 3100, which trust 
funds do not record. Additionally, USSGL account 4119 usually is associated with the receipt of an 
appropriation warrant, which trust funds do not receive. Therefore, trust funds should use USSGL 
account 4114 for all appropriated trust fund receipts, not USSGL account 4119. 

 

The term “appropriated” is used in the USSGL account title because, although trust funds do not receive 
actual appropriation warrants, amounts are appropriated from various sources. These sources include 
appropriations from a general fund receipt account to a trust fund receipt account (via Fiscal Service 
Optional Form 1017-G: Journal Voucher); from an agency’s general fund to the agency’s trust fund (via 
expenditure transfer, e.g., OPAC); and from a trust fund receipt account to a trust fund expenditure 
account. Therefore, USSGL account 4114 is used to record all trust fund receipts, and is counted as new 
budget authority on the SF 133. 

 

 

 


1. To record receipts deposited into a trust fund receipt account, which are automatically 
credited to the corresponding trust fund expenditure account.7 (Collections of tax receipts 
from the public are initially deposited into a Treasury General Fund Receipt Account (i.e. 
0152 Excise Taxes) and recorded as custodial revenue by the collecting entity (i.e. IRS). 
From there the receipts are appropriated to the trust fund receipt account (via Fiscal 
Service Optional Form 1017-G: Journal Voucher). Note that Fiscal Service Form 6200: 
Appropriation Warrant is not processed.) (TC A186) 


7 The transactions in this scenario combine the activity of the receipt and expenditure accounts. The receipt-expenditure 
account relationship is described in more detail in the Introduction of the Guide. 

8 This scenario assumes that the entire trust fund is subject to apportionment. For trust fund activity that is not subject to 
apportionment, credit USSGL account 4620 - Unobligated Funds Not Subject to Apportionment.

Certain trust funds fall under a requirement whereby any unobligated balances remaining at yearend must 
be classified as temporarily not available and, in effect, temporarily removed from budget execution. This 
requirement applies only to funds wherein receipts are immediately appropriated, but are precluded from 
obligation at yearend by a provision of law, such as a benefit formula or limitation. This authority can be 
precluded during the year (i.e., by legislation) but is more commonly seen with trust funds at the end of the 
year (i.e., for trust funds with legislative provisions that contain a benefit formula or limitation on 
obligations). Some of the larger dollar-value and commonly known trust funds fit into this category. 
Examples of these types of trust funds are the Federal Old-Age and Survivor's Insurance Trust Fund, 
Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, and Unemployment Trust Fund. 

 

Reporting guidelines stipulate that the yearend SF 133 must agree with the P&F in the Budget. 
Furthermore, there is a relationship between Schedule N: Schedule of Unavailable Collections (which 
precedes the P&F in the Budget) and the P&F. The Schedule N and P&F together, as well as the yearend 
SF 133, should reflect that the amount of current-year receipts less obligations equals amounts precluded 
from obligation. In addition, budgetary reporting of these trust funds reflects no beginning or ending 
unobligated balances available for obligation. 

 

During the year, appropriated receipts are recorded as new budget authority on Line 1A of the SF 133, 
while at the same time obligations are incurred. On September 30th, any remaining unobligated balances 
become temporarily precluded from obligation, and are subtracted from budget authority on Line 5 of the 
SF 133. This process results in a zero unobligated balance on both the SF 133 and P&F. However, the 
balances remain on Schedule N until such time as needed when current-year receipts are not enough to 
cover current-year obligations. Furthermore, the unobligated balances are to be included on the USSGL 
2108, Column 11, Unobligated Balances. 

 

To account for this type of activity, the following budgetary USSGL accounts were established to ensure 
accurate reporting on the SF 133, USSGL 2108, and multiple lines of the P&F: 

 

4157 Authority Made Available from Receipt or Appropriation Balances Previously Precluded 
from Obligation 

4158 Authority Made Available from Offsetting Collections Balances Previously Precluded from 
Obligation 

4397 Receipts and Appropriations Temporarily Precluded from Obligation 

4398 Offsetting Collections Temporarily Precluded from Obligation 

 

USSGL accounts 4397 and 4398 are recorded to temporarily preclude receipts or offsetting collections 
from obligation. These accounts are credited at yearend against any remaining unobligated balances and 
remain open. On the SF 133, they crosswalk to Line 5, Temporarily Not Available Pursuant to Public 
Law, as fiscal year amounts and are subtracted to bring total budgetary resources to zero. The beginning 
balances are carried forward to Line 2A, Unobligated Balance Brought Forward, the following year, but are 
netted against total actual resources collected, thus resulting in a zero balance on Line 2A. On the USSGL 
2108, these accounts crosswalk to Column 11, Unobligated Balances, and represent invested balances. 
This causes a disconnect between the unobligated balances reported on the SF 133 and USSGL 2108, with 
the difference captured in USSGL accounts 4397 and 4398. 

 


USSGL accounts 4157 and 4158 are recorded to return authority to the trust fund if current-year receipts 
are not enough to cover current-year obligations. The "returned" authority is treated as new budget 
authority on the SF 133. However, if the trust fund's total current-year receipts are greater than total 
current-year obligations, then these accounts must be adjusted to zero prior to submitting the FACTS II 
ATB (preclosing entry). If, on the other hand, the trust fund's total current-year receipts are not enough to 
cover current-year obligations, then these accounts are closed as part of the post-closing entries. The 
following scenario illustrates each of these concepts. 

 

Year 1 illustrates the proper entries for a trust fund where the total amount of current-year receipts is 
greater than total current-year obligations. 

 

Year 2 illustrates authority returned to the trust fund in order to cover obligations, and the corresponding 
entries where the total amount of current-year receipts at yearend is greater than the amount that was 
needed to cover current-year obligations. 

 

Year 3 illustrates authority returned to the trust fund to cover obligations, and the corresponding entries 
where the total amount of current-year receipts at yearend is not enough to cover current-year obligations.

1. To record appropriated receipts from Federal sources into a trust fund. The receipts are 
deposited into an available trust fund receipt account, and are automatically credited to the 
corresponding expenditure account.1 Assume a portion of the receipts is subject to 
apportionment. (TC A186) 

1 The transactions in this scenario combine the activity of the receipt and expenditure accounts. The receipt-expenditure 
account relationship is described in more detail in the Introduction of the Guide. 

2 Generally all trust fund receipts and collections are recorded into USSGL account 4114 Appropriated Trust or Special Fund 
Receipts. An exception exists for work performed under the Economy Act, for which the collections are recorded as offsetting 
and netted against outlays.

Scenario III illustrates the accounting and reporting procedures for trust fund receipts available for 
investment, but not immediately available for obligation. Examples include receipts collected in one 
year that are not available for obligation until the following year, or receipts only available for obligation 
subject to an annual appropriation act. In both cases, the amounts are available for investment, and 
therefore the unobligated balances should be reflected on the USSGL 2108. OMB, however, classifies 
these receipts as unavailable, or unappropriated, and requires the amounts to be excluded from the SF 
133 until the required conditions are met. An example would be the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund. 

 

As indicated in Treasury's FAST Book, most Federal trust funds are designated as available, indicating 
that receipts collected are immediately available for investment. Therefore, in Treasury's central 
accounting system, when receipts are deposited into an available trust fund receipt account, they are 
automatically credited to the corresponding expenditure account, with no further action required by 
Congress. Once in the expenditure account, the funds may be invested, based upon terms stipulated in 
legislation or a trust agreement. Regardless of whether a trust fund is designated as available in 
Treasury's system, the receipts of that trust fund may or may not be available to the agency for 
obligation. Obligational authority is also determined in the legislation governing the trust fund. If a 
fund symbol is available for both investment and obligation, then follow accounting guidance illustrated 
in Scenario I, Basic Trust Fund Accounting. However, if a fund symbol is designated as available for 
investment but not available for obligation, then observe the guidance provided in Scenario III. 

 

This scenario illustrates the use of USSGL account 4394 Receipts Not Available for Obligation Upon 
Collection. This account was established to provide the mechanism for properly including balances on 
the USSGL 2108 and excluding balances on the SF 133. Since there are more special funds than trust 
funds that employ this type of activity, a more detailed scenario was developed by the USSGL Special 
Fund Subcommittee, in conjunction with the USSGL Trust Fund Subcommittee. For additional 
background and presentation of this USSGL account, visit the USSGL Web site. 

 


Year 1 

 

1. To record the collection of excise taxes from the public into an available trust fund receipt 
account. Because the trust fund is designated as available, the receipts are automatically 
credited to the corresponding expenditure account, so that they may be invested.1 Assume 
that the legislation for this trust fund states that receipts are not available for obligation 
until the next fiscal year. (TC A188) 

1 The transactions in this scenario combine the activity of the receipt and expenditure accounts into one. The receipt-
expenditure account relationship is described in more detail in the Introduction of the Guide. 

 

2 This is a basic transaction to illustrate that the receipts collected are immediately invested. Investment transactions are kept 
to a minimum in this scenario in order to focus attention on the accounting for receipts that are available for investment but 
not obligation. Refer to Scenario IV, Trust Fund Investments, as well as Section III - Accounting Transactions of TFM S2-
01-02 (as updated) for more detailed guidance on trust fund investments.

Accordingly, the interest earned is classified as non-exchange, thus not deducted from the gross cost of operations. For those 
trust funds, however, where the main source of balances consist of exchange revenue (e.g. Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability fund), the interest shall be classified as exchange, and thus deducted from the gross cost of operations. (See SFFAS

Disability fund), the interest shall be classified as exchange, and thus deducted from the gross cost of operations. (See SFFAS

Federal trust funds are managed by either a Federal program agency or by Fiscal Service on behalf of an 
agency. The managing entities make the investment decisions. The Secretary of the Treasury 
administers the investment programs for Federal accounts authorized by law to invest in U.S. 
Government interest-bearing obligations. Treasury’s role is twofold: 1) to act as executor of investment 
decisions directed by Federal program agencies (for agency-managed trust funds) and 2) to maintain the 
role of managing trustee (for Treasury-managed trust funds), wherein Treasury makes and executes 
investment decisions for certain funds. Fiscal Service administers these two mission-critical functions. 
Scenario IV applies to both agency-managed and Treasury-managed trust funds. The entity that 
manages the fund, which would be either the agency or Fiscal Service acting on behalf of the agency, 
records the transactions outlined herein. 

 

Federal trust fund receipts can be invested in various types of securities, but appropriate authorization is 
required. Trust fund investments are primarily in public debt securities, issued by Fiscal Service, with 
maturities suitable to meet the needs of the fund. Investments in public debt securities are treated as an 
exchange of an asset. Scenario IV addresses these types of investments. A small number of trust funds 
are authorized to invest in non-Federal securities (securities held outside of the Government). 
Investments in non-Federal securities are treated as a purchase of an asset, rather than as an exchange of 
an asset. An obligation and an outlay must be recorded for the purchase. Investments in non-Federal 
securities are less common, and therefore are not covered in this scenario. Even fewer trust funds are 
authorized to invest in agency securities, whereby one agency purchases securities issued by another 
agency. This type of investment, which is also uncommon in the Federal Government, requires specific 
authorization and is not covered in this scenario. Refer to OMB Circular A-34 for additional reporting 
guidance, and to the USSGL Web site for guidance on accounting for agency securities. 

 

For trust funds managed by Federal program agencies (e.g., Civil Service Retirement and Disability 
Trust Fund), program agencies are responsible for determining the amounts to be invested and the terms 
of the investments. Agencies also are responsible for calling Fiscal Service with specific 
investment/redemption orders and reporting investment activity via the SF 224: Statement of 
Transactions, (SF 133, USSGL 2108, P&F), and on the agency financial statements. 

 

For trust funds managed by Fiscal Service (e.g., Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, 
Unemployment Trust Fund), Fiscal Service is responsible for administering and monitoring the daily 
activities of the managed trust funds for receipts, investments, redemptions, and interest calculations. 
Unlike agency-managed trust funds, Fiscal Service reports the investment activity via the SF 224 for the 
trust funds it manages. Fiscal Service also reports the appropriate investment figures through FACTS II 
and provides the same information to the agency responsible for FACTS I reporting and the agency 
financial statements. 

 

This scenario is specific to trust funds, and illustrates basic investment transactions. For additional 
transactions and reporting requirements, refer to OMB Circulars A-34 and A-11; TFM Volume I 

Part 2 - Chapter 4300: Intragovernmental Fiduciary Transactions Accounting Guide; TFM Volume I Part 
2 - Chapter 4300, T/L 587: Reporting Instructions for Accounts Invested in Department of the Treasury 
Securities; and additional individualized scenarios developed by the USSGL staff (located on the 
USSGL Web site). 

 


Scenario Assumptions 

 

The following assumptions apply to Scenario IV: 

 

• Receipts of this trust fund consist of predominantly non-exchange revenue. Therefore, the interest 
earned on investments is classified as non-exchange. For guidance on interest classified as 
exchange, refer to SFFAS #7, Accounting for Revenue and Other Financing Sources, paragraphs 
306-308. 
• The programs of the investing entity are not subject to apportionment. Refer to Section III, 
Accounting Transactions, of TFM S2-01-02 (as updated) for comprehensive transactions that 
include accounting for programs that are subject to apportionment. 



1. To record the collection of tax receipts that are deposited into a trust fund 


receipt account. The receipts are automatically credited to the corresponding expenditure 
account, whereby they can be invested.1 (TC A186) 

1 The transactions in this scenario combine the activity of the receipt and expenditure accounts into one. The receipt-
expenditure account relationship is described in more detail in the Introduction of the Guide.

Treasury-managed trust funds are a unique group of accounts in that the law has designated the Secretary 
of Treasury to act as managing trustee for a named group of trust funds. Fiscal Service administers this 
function. Treasury-managed trust funds are comprised of an individual TAFS reported by Fiscal Service 
(referred to as the "corpus account"), and an individual TAFS reported by the program agency (referred 
to as the "agency account"). 

 

In most instances, Fiscal Service TAFS are structured as 20X8000; the "20" indicates Treasury, "X" 
represents the period of availability, and "8000" represents the trust fund series. The agency TAFS are 
established in one of two ways: either as a separate appropriation fund symbol (i.e., 69X8123) or as a 
transfer appropriation symbol, which is commonly referred to as an allocation account (i.e., 75-
20X8000). Allocation accounts are symbolized by adding the receiving agency's department prefix to 
the original appropriation fund symbol. In the example above, the "75" represents the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services. The scenario that follows was developed for the allocation-type 
Treasury-managed trust funds. Refer to Scenario VI, Trust Fund Appropriation Transfers for Specific 
Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbols, for transactions between specific Treasury-managed trust funds 
and other trust fund appropriation accounts. 

 

In appearance, the Treasury-managed trust fund allocation accounts resemble general fund allocation 
accounts, but in practice there are several differences. First, most trust funds have investment authority, 
while general funds typically do not. Investment authority resides with the corpus account and is 
managed by Fiscal Service. Because Fiscal Service manages the trust fund's investments in the corpus 
account and the agency manages the trust fund's obligations and disbursements in the allocation account, 
sound cash management principles must be enforced. This is discussed in more detail below. Second, 
yearend reporting requirements for the Treasury-managed trust fund allocation accounts require that any 
amounts receivable or payable between the corpus and agency accounts either net to zero or be 
eliminated. This concept affects the SF 133, USSGL 2108, and P&F presentations, as well as agency 
and Governmentwide financial statement presentations. Scenario V illustrates this theory. 

 

The flowchart at the beginning of this section illustrates the basic framework and flow of activity within 
a Treasury-managed trust fund allocation account. Receipts are recorded in the corpus account and then 
invested based upon the terms stipulated by statute or trust agreement. As funds are needed by the 
agency account for disbursement, the program agency contacts Fiscal Service for a transfer of funds 
(accomplished via SF 1151). The Fiscal Service then disinvests the funds so that the transfer may be 
accomplished. The Treasury-managed trust fund allocation accounts also record nonexpenditure 
transfers that occur between other trust funds, as well as expenditure transfers with Federal funds. 
(Refer to Scenario I, Basic Trust Fund Accounting.) 

 

In contrast with other Federal nonexpenditure transfers, transfers between trust fund corpus accounts and 
agency allocation accounts require different accounting and reporting treatment. To maintain sound cash 
management principles, funds remain invested until needed for disbursement to maximize interest 
earned. Since Fiscal Service performs the investment function, and the program agency performs the 
obligation and disbursement function, a budgetary mechanism is sometimes needed to transfer the 
budget authority prior to actually transferring the funds. That mechanism results in a receivable and 
payable transaction recorded by each entity. 

 


Another notable concept is that the corpus TAFS consists of one or more receipt accounts (i.e., 
20X8000.001, 20X8000.002) and a corresponding expenditure account (i.e., 20X8000). Trust fund 
receipts are often comprised of taxes, customs duties, fines, penalties, etc., and are first credited to a trust 
fund receipt account. Because the law designates the Treasury-managed trust fund receipt accounts 
subject to this guidance as available for expenditure, the receipts are automatically credited to the 
corresponding expenditure account. There is no current requirement to have separate USSGL 
accounting for available trust fund receipt accounts; therefore, the following transactions combine 
activity of receipt and expenditure accounts. 

 

Below are the USSGL accounts commonly used by Treasury-managed trust fund allocation accounts. 

 

1330 Receivable for Transfers of Currently Invested Balances 

2150 Payable for Transfers of Currently Invested Balances 

4165 Allocations of Authority - Anticipated from Invested Balances 

4166 Allocations of Realized Authority - To Be Transferred from Invested Balances 

4167 Allocations of Realized Authority - Transferred from Invested Balances 

5755 Nonexpenditure Financing Sources - Transfers-In 

5765 Nonexpenditure Financing Sources - Transfers-Out 

 

The scenario also illustrates the unique reporting requirements for budgetary and proprietary 
transactions. For FACTS I (proprietary) and OMB Form and Content reporting, the agency account 
consolidates the data from the corpus account and reports the trust fund as a whole. For FACTS II 
(primarily budgetary) reporting (SF 133, USSGL 2108, P&F), each TAFS submits its portion of the 
activity, and then Treasury and OMB merge the data.

Scenario VI addresses the Budget’s unique presentation of nonexpenditure appropriation transfers1 for TAFS involving two specific 
entities: transferring-out entities, which are Treasury-managed trust funds, and receiving entities, which are agency trust funds. 
Currently, only four transferring-out Treasury-managed trust fund entities are subject to this guidance: Airport and Airway Trust Fund, 
Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, Highway Trust Fund, and Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. These funds are designed to collect receipts and 
transfer-out, based upon the legislation of the receiving entities. There are, however, multiple agency receiving entities involved. The 
receiving entities are responsible for managing the program activities, including tracking and recording appropriations and disbursements. 

1 TFM Vol. I Part 2 - Chapter 2000 defines nonexpenditure transactions. 

 

The reporting characteristics of the nonexpenditure transfers between the entities are very unique compared to typical nonexpenditure 
appropriation transfers. In the Budget, the entities transferring-out do not present P&Fs (with the exception of the Memorandum Entries); 
they only present Schedules of Unavailable Collections (Schedule N’s). Budget authority, which mainly consists of tax receipts and 
interest earned, is not executable. For the receiving entities, P&Fs are presented in the Budget, but Schedule N’s are not. 

 

Furthermore, definite amounts are typically appropriated annually to the receiving entities, but the amounts are appropriated from the 
receipts collected by the transferring-out entities. These are not appropriations from the General Fund of Treasury. Fiscal Service Forms 
6200: Appropriation Warrants, are not processed. Instead, the appropriations are accomplished via SF 1151. However, in the Budget, 
they are to be recorded as appropriations, not as transfers. In reporting terminology, the appropriation is to be recorded on SF 133 Line 
1A, not Line 1D, and also the respective P&F appropriation lines, not the P&F transfer lines. The TAR of the receiving entities, which is 
derived in part from USSGL 2108’s, reflects current-year nonexpenditure transfers in the "Appropriations and Other Obligational 
Authority" column (includes appropriations and appropriation transfer activity) and prior-year nonexpenditure transfers in the "Transfers" 
column. 

 

The four USSGL accounts below were established to account for this unique activity: 

 

4126 Amounts Appropriated from Specific Treasury-Managed Trust Fund TAFS - Receivable 

4127 Amounts Appropriated from Specific Treasury-Managed Trust Fund TAFS - Payable 

4128 Amounts Appropriated from Specific Treasury-Managed Trust Fund TAFS - Transfers-In 

4129 Amounts Appropriated from Specific Treasury-Managed Trust Fund TAFS - Transfers-Out 

 

Prior to the establishment of these accounts, all USSGL transfer accounts representing current-year nonexpenditure activity crosswalked 
to transfer lines on the SF 133 (Line 1D) and P&F (Lines 4100, 4200, 6100, 6200). The characteristics described above require the 
transfers to crosswalk to appropriation lines. Therefore, USSGL account 4128 was established to account for nonexpenditure transfers-in 


that crosswalk to SF 133 and P&F appropriation lines. Account 4129 was established to account for nonexpenditure transfers-out that do 
not crosswalk to the SF 133 or P&F, since the authority is not executable. 

 

Furthermore, a mechanism is sometimes needed to transfer authority to the receiving entity prior to transferring the funds. This gives the 
receiving entity the resource from which to obligate. The funds remain in the transferring-out TAFS in order to maximize interest earned 
until such time as needed by the receiving entity for disbursement. In order to support this mechanism, USSGL accounts 4126 and 4127 
were established to represent receivable and payable amounts between the two entities. These accounts will crosswalk to SF 133, P&F, 
and USSGL 2108 lines to accurately reflect authority transferred prior to funds. 


 

 

Year 1 illustrates receipts credited to a Treasury-managed trust fund account, where the receipts are immediately available for investment, but not 
available for obligation. A specific amount is then appropriated in the agency's appropriation act to the agency trust fund account. For year 1, assume that 
the full amount appropriated is simultaneously transferred via SF 1151.

Scenario VII illustrates the liquidation of contract authority for trust funds, where a nonexpenditure transfer from a Fiscal Service corpus trust 
fund account funds the liquidation. For a detailed description and background related to contract authority and the USSGL accounts 
involved, refer to contract authority scenarios posted on the USSGL Web site. 

 

The main factor that singles out these trust funds with contract authority from other TAFS with contract authority is the involvement of at 
least two different entities. The first entity is the piece managed by the Fiscal Service. The Fiscal Service records the collection and investment of 
receipts. For example, the Fiscal Service -managed Airport and Airway Trust Fund collects taxes paid by airport and airway users. The second 
entity is the piece managed by the Federal program agency. The agency TAFS is the account in which the contract authority is granted and 
where program activities are managed. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation manages 
the Liquidation of Contract Authorization trust fund, and is responsible for recording the contract authority, recording the appropriations to 
liquidate contract authority, as well as tracking obligations and disbursements of the fund. Note that while the appropriation to liquidate 
contract authority is granted in appropriation acts, the funds will not be transferred via SF 1151 until actually needed for disbursement. This 
is for cash management purposes so that the interest earned in the Fiscal Service TAFS is maximized. In order to capture this concept in the 
USSGL, and in order to support the SF 133 and P&F, USSGL account 4136 Contract Authority to be Liquidated by Trust Funds was 
established, and is the basis of this scenario. 

 

The pages that follow present transactions of the " Fiscal Service corpus account" and the "parent account." The parent account represents the 
agency TAFS, and is referred to as the parent account because it commonly has authority to transfer funds to recipient TAFS. Those types of 
transfers are illustrated in Scenario VIII, Trust Funds with Contract Authority, Part II: Transfers of Contract Authority. 

 

Scenario VII assumes that only "definite" contract authority is involved, and for the sake of simplicity also assumes that programs are not 
subject to apportionment. Refer to Section III, Accounting Transactions, of TFM S2-01-02 (as updated) for a more comprehensive listing of 
detailed transactions.

Scenario VIII illustrates accounting and reporting for the transfer of contract authority between two trust funds. For a detailed description 
and background related to contract authority and the USSGL accounts involved, refer to contract authority scenarios posted on the USSGL 
Web site. 

 

Trust funds with contract authority typically involve at least two reporting entities. The first is the TAFS managed by Fiscal Service. Fiscal 
Service is responsible for recording the collection and investment of receipts. For example, the Fiscal Service -managed Highway Trust Fund 
collects earmarked taxes on gasoline and other fuels. The second entity is the TAFS managed by the Federal program agency. The agency 
TAFS is the account in which contract authority is granted and program activities are managed. For example, the Federal Highway 
Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation manages the Liquidation of Contract Authorization trust fund, and is responsible for 
recording the contract authority, recording the appropriations to liquidate contract authority, as well as tracking obligations and disbursements 
of the fund. Note that while the appropriation to liquidate contract authority is granted in appropriation acts, the funds will not be transferred 
via SF 1151 until actually needed for disbursement. This is for cash management purposes so that the interest earned in the Fiscal Service 
TAFS is maximized. That concept is illustrated in Scenario VII, Trust Funds with Contract Authority, Part I: Appropriations to Liquidate 
Contract Authority – Funded by Nonexpenditure Transfers, and involves established USSGL account 4136 Contract Authority to be 
Liquidated by Trust Funds. 

 

In some instances, however, the agency entity (referred to in this scenario as the parent account) is also granted the authority to transfer 
contract authority to recipient TAFS (referred to as the recipient account). This is usually in the form of allocation transfers, but may also be 
an appropriation/balance transfer. At the time that the contract authority transfers, however, the funds will not be transferred until actually 
needed for disbursement. Again, this is in order to maintain sound cash management principles. For this reason, and in order to support 
specific P&F lines, USSGL account 4137 Transfers of Contract Authority was established, and is the basis of this scenario.
