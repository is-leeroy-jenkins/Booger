An index for these accounts by (1) agency name in alphabetical order; and (2) agency index number in numerical sequence, is included at the end of this book to assist the user in locating the account for an agency. Citations to the U.S.C. or United States Statutes at Large are shown for the revolving, special, deposit, and trust fund accounts.
