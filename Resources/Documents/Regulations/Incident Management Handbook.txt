UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 

DATE: January 2016 

SUBJECT: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Incident Management Handbook 


PURPOSE: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Incident Management 
Handbook (IMH) is designed to assist EPA personnel in the use of the Incident 
Command System (ICS) and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) 
during incident response operations and planned events. One of the major objectives 
of the IMH is to assist EPA responders by providing guidance on the integration 
of EPA assets into the ICS structure while maintaining the standard structure 
and functions. This IMH is a guidance document for responders and management 
to understand what their positions require under NIMS ICS and how they integrate 
with the rest of the response structure. It is a guidance document only, and users are 
encouraged to refer to Incident Action Plans (IAPs), incident objectives, and attend 

briefings and meetings as required by their positions within the ICS. 

This IMH aligns with the U.S. Coast Guard’s (USCG) IMH with modifications to 
address EPA-specific requirements, processes, and procedures. TheAgency’s response 
management processes should be consistent with other partner agencies that 
share the environmental mission within the National Response System (NRS) and 
in accordance with the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency 
Plan (NCP, 40 CFR Part 300) and the National Response Framework (NRF). 

ACTION: Regional On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs), Agency staff involved in responses, 
and Response Support Corps (RSC) personnel should refer to this IMH 
when involved in emergency response operations. 

I-II 


BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, EPA has faced unprecedented challenges 

in responding to Nationally Significant Incidents, including theWorld Trade Center 

and Pentagon terrorist attacks, the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Columbia Space Shuttle 
recovery, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and most recently the Deepwater Horizon, 
Enbridge, and Yellowstone River oil spills, Super Storm Sandy, and the Gold King 
Mine response. The Agency did an excellent job in responding to these incidents 
because of the experience and expertise of our emergency response program, as 
well as the experience we have gained over the past 15 years in response management. 
However, as with every response, lessons learned and corrective actions need 
to be addressed. The Deepwater Horizon response highlighted inconsistencies in 
implementation of ICS among responding agencies. In some cases, EPA personnel 
responding to the incident did not have an assigned ICS position or were not even 
familiar with the system, which caused confusion in roles and responsibilities. To 

resolve this issue, the EPA Office of Emergency Management (OEM) is working 

with the EPA NIMS Integration Team (NIT) to arrange joint exercises with response 
partners, and to improve ICS training material and access to training for all programs. 
Another issue that arose during the Deepwater Horizon response was with 
data management, including inconsistencies in methodology in data delivery, Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control, a lack of standardization of terminology, templates, 
and interfaces, and unfamiliarity with the Emergency Management Portal (EMP) 
and Scribe. To address this issue, OEM will develop a strategy to familiarize other 
programs with the EMP and Scribe and work with the EPA Information Technology 
Forum on correcting problems with methodologies, templates, and interfaces with 
other databases. Additionally, OEM will continue to move forward on development 

of electronic data deliverables and Web Electronic Deliverable Registry, which will 


expedite analytical data review. 

The response to Super Storm Sandy highlighted the success of communications and 
coordination between the Regional Emergency Operations Centers (REOCs) and 
the Headquarters (HQ) EOC by ensuring information sharing occurred horizontally 
and vertically across the Agency. In this way, EPA was able to work as a team and 

add order and efficiencies to the stresses of a response. 


The Gold King Mine response required the establishment of an Area Command to 
coordinate critical resources and response actions of the Incident Command Posts 
(ICPs). Coordination between the HQ EOC and the Area Commander was a critical 

I-III 


component of the response and highlighted the need for additional training on wide 
area responses, including engagement of states and local governments and consistent 
messaging to the public and media outlets. 

As the scope and complexity of incidents and threats expand, EPA must continue 
to strengthen and reinforce its response management capabilities. To that end, EPA 
is continuously improving its implementation of NIMS to maximize its manage


ment of its emergency response assets during Nationally Significant Incidents. By 

implementing NIMS, as required by the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 
(HSPD)-5, we are managing expertise and response capabilities within the Agency 
and are, therefore, better prepared to effectively handle large unprecedented incidents 
with our response partners. 

The NIMS ICS provides a common structure and terminology that facilitates the integration 
of multiple agencies while still maintaining a coherent chain of command. 
This approach provides consistency in addressing key aspects of a response such as 
organizational elements and lines of communication. It also ensures that roles and 
responsibilities of EPA personnel, whether in the ICP or in a support role in a re


gional office, are clearly understood. EPA’s goal is to integrate into the local ICS if 

established and then, if needed, bring in our own Incident Management Team (IMT) 
to manage or lead the response. 

Additionally, the ability of EPA to coordinate between management and tactical 

operations in the field is critical. Consistent, clear, and effective communications 


and information sharing between the executive levels to the Incident Commander 

(IC) is a necessity. The use of existing regulatory and delegated authorities provided 
to OSCs as well as coordination with National and Regional Incident Coordination 
Teams (RICT), HQ EOC, and the various REOCs are essential to this process. 
I-IV 


HOW TO USE THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT HANDBOOK (IMH) 

The IMH is a reference guide for field personnel working within an ICS, as well as 


management personnel and the Regional Incident Coordinator (RIC) in the Regional 
Emergency Operation Centers (REOCs) 

This IMH does not replace appropriate ICS training for responders. The responsibilities 
of staff during a response may vary depending on the size and complexity of 

the incident. In a small response, a single responder may fulfill multiple roles, while 
a more complex or sustained response may require more dedicated staff. While it is 
important that all responders come into an incident with sufficient training and understanding 
of ICS, in a very large response the agency may be required to activate 

employees that have little experience responding in the field. The IMH will serve as 


a guide for all EPA responders. 

The following explains how to use this IMH. In addition to this concise field guide, 
further information and tools—specific to many individual positions—can be found 
in position-specific job aids that are posted on the NIMS Integration Team website 


at epaosc.org. 

Please note that the IMH is not intended to be read in its entirety. You only 

need to refer to a chapter if it is relevant to the role/position you are filling in ICS. 

Some sections of the IMH are for all responders, while other sections contain specialized 
information that is only valuable to specific responders based on their positions 
within ICS in the field. 


• 
Part I (Introduction and Background) is intended for all audiences. It provides 
background information on EPA’s specific application of ICS and also provides 
a summary of common responsibilities of all responders. 
• 
Part II (ICS Process, Tools, and Position Responsibilities) explains the ICS 
Planning Cycle, tools, and is a reference for the responsibilities associated 
I-V 


with each individual position in the command structure. Users should review 

the responsibilities specific to their assigned positions and those they interact 


with on an as-needed basis. 

• 
Part III (Modular Response Organization) provides a description of the scalable 
nature of ICS in its potential expansion from a small organization to a 
large, complex and/or multijurisdictional incident, including a geographically 
widespread incident or multiple incidents. This part provides considerations 
for the establishment of the command organization, describes additional duties 
or responsibilities specific to large incidents for Command and General 
Staff positions (in addition to those in Part II), and has information on Special 
Teams. 

• 
Part IV offers additional organizational examples for specific types of response 
events. When using these chapters, readers should understand that the 
responsibilities discussed are in addition to those outlined in the first three 
parts of this handbook and more than one of these chapters may be applicable 
to a specific incident (e.g., biological event with law enforcement and animal 
response issues). The chapters in this part also include information on special 
teams and assets, which may assist in incidents involving those specific scenarios. 


• 
Part V provides reference material.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 

This Incident Management Handbook (IMH) is intended to be 
used as a reference aid for personnel involved in emergency 
response. This is not a policy document, but rather guidance 
for response personnel. 

It does not affect existing On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) authorities 
or their discretion in determining how to implement 
those authorities (e.g., monitoring private sector response, 
overseeing activities, directing a response that poses a substantial 
threat). 
However, 
with 
a 
nationally significant 
incident, 
senior Agency leadership will be playing a role as de


fined 
in 
the 
National 
Oil 
and 
Hazardous Substances Pollution 


Contingency Plan (NCP). 

Historically, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
has played an important role in responding to environmental 
emergencies. More than 40 years ago, the NCP was established 
as the Federal Government’s blueprint for responding 
to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases. A key 
component of the NCP is the National Response System 
(NRS), a multilayered response network of individuals and 
teams from Federal, state, local, and tribal agencies, and industry. 
The NRS includes: 

Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION 


11 


JANUARY 2016 

 Reporting of incidents to the National Response Center 
(NRC); 

 A cadre of Federal On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs); 

 The National Response Team (NRT); 

 13 Regional Response Teams (RRTs); and 

 “Special 
Teams” that 
provide 
specific expertise 
to 
assist 


OSCs. 

The NCP and the NRS provide the foundation of EPA’s 
Emergency Response Program. For more information on the 
NRS, see www.nrt.org. 

After September 11th 2001, EPA implemented the National 
Approach to Response (NAR) to manage its emergen


cy response 
assets during 
a 
Nationally Significant 
Incident 


in a coordinated manner. The NAR policy can be found on 
the EPA intranet under “OSWER National Approach to Response.” 
The NAR describes EPA’s internal system for engaging 
Regional Incident Management Teams (IMTs), Response 
Support Corps (RSC) members, Regional Incident 
Coordinators (RICs), and Headquarters (HQ) staff and senior 
leadership during a response. 

In accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 

(HSPD)-5, 
EPA’s field 
management 
structure 
for a 
response 


is the Incident Command System (ICS). It is the organiza-

Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION 
12 


JANUARY 2016 

tional structure by which EPA will manage a response and 
integrate and coordinate with Federal, state, local, and tribal 
response personnel and assets. 

The beginning part of this IMH provides generic information 
applicable to all responses. The information and processes 

unique 
to 
a 
specific type 
of 
incident 
follow 
in 
the 
latter part 
of 


the document. 

Each 
of 
the 
hazard-specific chapters addresses a 
specific 

type of incident and illustrates how response to an incident 

starts with 
first 
responders and 
then 
escalates to 
a 
large 


multiagency response organization. The organization charts 
in each chapter are only examples of how an ICS organization 
may be developed to respond to that type of incident. 

While 
the 
document 
has been 
divided 
into 
hazard-specific 

chapters, responders should be aware that more than one 
chapter may be applicable to a multi-hazard incident. Also, 

in 
each 
chapter are 
incident-specific job 
descriptions that 
will 


assist responders. 

Responders should have a basic understanding of ICS to ensure 
they can effectively operate within the ICS organization, 
and properly understand and use this IMH.

CHAPTER 2 

ORGANIZATION, COMMAND, 
AND COORDINATION WITHIN EPA 

This chapter provides an overview of the structure used to 
coordinate U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) 
response operations consistently across the Agency when 
supporting 
a 
field 
response. It 
reflects existing emergency 
response structures and policies, such as the EPA’s National 
Approach to Response (NAR), which 
defines roles and 
authorities 
within the Agency, and describes the general and 
specialized assets available to emergency responders in the 

field. 


INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM IS ALWAYS USED 

The Incident Command System (ICS) concepts will be used 
by EPA during all emergency responses, whether they are 

small 
incidents (80% 
of 
responses) or Nationally Significant 


Incidents (<1% of responses). 

ICS is a 
flexible, 
scalable 
structure 
that 
provides standardized 
processes, procedures, organizational structure, and 
common terminology for incident management. The system 
creates a basic expectation for emergency management 
that allows us to better coordinate among the various levels 

Chapter 2. ORGANIZATION, COMMAND, AND COORDINATION 

14 

WITHIN EPA 


JANUARY 2016 

of the Agency and interagency. This management structure 

is built 
around 
five 
major response 
management 
functional 


areas: Command, Operations, Planning, Logistics, and Finance. 


Emergency response actions are usually successfully managed 
within the region. Upon occasion, incidents may be of 
such magnitude that they exceed regional emergency response 
capacities, or transcend regional boundaries. These 
incidents most often may be the result of a chemical, biological, 
or radiological emergency, natural disaster, or cyber related 
incident. 

SCALE OF RESPONSE WILL INCREASE DURING A NATIONALLY 
SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT 

EPArecognizes that 
the 
response 
to 
a 
Nationally Significant 
Incident will require senior management attention and 
extraordinary coordination internally, and among Federal, 
state, and local entities. During 
a 
Nationally Significant 
Incident, 
responders apply ICS in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
National 


Response Framework (NRF). The NRF organizes and integrates 
Federal resources under “Emergency Support Functions” 
(ESFs). ESFs identify critical response functions and 
which Federal agencies are responsible for providing those 
functions during a response (Figure 2-1: Emergency Support 
Functions). 

Chapter 2. ORGANIZATION, COMMAND, AND COORDINATION 

15 

WITHIN EPA 


JANUARY 2016 

It is the Agency’s intention to implement a nationally coordinated 
approach whenever we respond to a Nationally Significant 
Incident. This chapter details the roles of and support 
available from the “national level.” The national level will generally 
be fully activated only in cases of very large respons


es or a 
Nationally Significant 
Incident. 
Consistent, 
clear, 
and 


effective communications and information sharing from the 

executive 
levels to 
Incident/Unified 
Command 
and 
from the 


incident to the executive levels within the Agency is essential. 
The EPA model for national incident coordination and 
information exchange is shown in Figure 2-2: EPA Internal 
Agency Coordination. 

EPA has created a coordinated structure to enhance the 
Agency’s ability to implement the operational components of 
a response by maintaining communication between senior 
management, providing resource support at a national or regional 
level, and supporting the incident command structure 

in 
the 
field. 
This structure 
includes the: 


 National and Regional Incident Coordination Teams 
(NICT/RICTs); 

 Regional Emergency Operations Centers (REOCs); and 

 Headquarters Emergency Operations Center (HQ EOC).

The function of an IMT, led by the IC, is to manage the tactical 
aspects of the response by developing and implementing 

incident 
objectives. 


EPA IMTs may be used to support discrete, assigned operational 
sectors of a large, multiagency ICS organization 
during the emergency phase. EPA ICs with the IMTs’ support 
will have the capability to assume the lead management 
role during the emergency response phase and sustain prolonged 
operations if needed. EPA IMTs may be deployed as 
an entire team or as a partial mobilization to meet the needs 
of the incident. 

Response Support Corps (RSC) – A key component of the 
NAR is the RSC, which supplements the Agency’s response 
staff. 
The 
RSC 
comprises staff 
from all 
program offices within 
EPA and provides a pool of trained personnel, technical 
experts, and additional response assets. Activation of RSC 
personnel should be coordinated through the RICT or the 
NICT (if there is HQ involvement). 

Additional Support 

In cases when a response is large and requires resources 

Chapter 2. ORGANIZATION, COMMAND, AND COORDINATION 

23 

WITHIN EPA 


JANUARY 2016 

beyond those available in the responding region, REOCs 
can access additional resources through the inter-regional 
backup system. Through this system, each EPA region has 
primary and secondary backup regions that can provide additional 
response support assets. 

If support is needed beyond that, REOCs can request additional 
assistance through the HQ EOC. The HQ EOC 

maintains a 
national 
roster of 
personnel 
qualified 
to 
assist 


in response activities. During an activation for a National


ly Significant 
Incident, 
EPAis the 
CoordinatingAgency for 

ESF #10, Oil and Hazardous Materials Response, and can 
request assistance through other ESF support agencies as 
outlined in the NRF. EPA is a supporting agency for: 

 ESF#3 Public Works and Engineering 

 ESF#4 
Firefighting 


 ESF#5 Information and Planning 

 ESF#8 Public Health and Medical Services 

 ESF#11 Agriculture and Natural Resources 

 ESF#13 Public Safety and Security

National Response Team/Regional Response Teams – 

Regional Response Teams (RRTs) and the National Response 
Team (NRT) provide an organization for Federal 
agency field 
offices and 
state 
agencies’coordination 
of 
assistance 
and advice to the OSC, acting as IC or other role, 
during response actions. RRT and NRT members do not respond 
directly to releases or spills, but may be called upon 

to 
provide 
incident-specific technical 
advice, 
equipment, 
or 

manpower to assist with a response. The RRTs and NRT 
may also coordinate regional and national interagency policy 
issues, respectively, in support of the OSC. 

Special Teams – “Special Teams” mandated by the National 
Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan 
(NCP) are available to provide technical specialists in support 
of the response at the request of the IC. Technical specialists 
may provide expertise in areas such as numerical 
modeling, site characterization, decontamination, clearance, 
waste management options, environmental chemistry, chemical 
hazard assessment, health and safety, and remote sensing, 
etc. Contact information for the most commonly used 
teams can be found on the inside cover of this handbook.

CHAPTER 4 

PLANNING CYCLE, MEETINGS, BRIEFINGS, 
AND THE PLANNING CHART 

Figure 4-1: The Operational Period Planning Cycle shows 
the initial response phase leading to the Incident Command 
System (ICS) Planning Cycle. If the responding Federal On-
Scene Coordinator (OSC) determines that an expanded 
ICS organization will be needed to manage the response, 

the 
ICS 201-EPAform Incident 
Briefing 
will 
end 
the 
initial 


response phase and launch the ICS process. The 201 Brief 
is used by the Command and General Staff to brief their assigned 
personnel and to begin managing, monitoring, and 

planning 
the 
response. 
The 
Objectives Meeting 
should 
be 
held 
immediately afterward 
to 
establish 
jurisdictional 
limits, 


establish the operational period to be used in the response, 

and 
agree 
to 
the 
overall 
incident 
objectives and 
priorities. 


OSCs should be aware that for a National Response Framework 
(NRF) incident1, which includes disasters to which EPA 
responds under the Stafford Act (i.e., generally under a Mission 
Assignment (MA) from FEMA/DHS), the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) will activate additional response 
structures, above the Incident Command Post (ICP) level, at 
which Federal agencies will coordinate among themselves 
and with states, local governments, and/or the private sec-

EPAuses the 
term 
“Nationally 
Significant 
Incidents” 
to 
differentiate 


large-scale responses from day-to-day response actions. 

Chapter 4. PLANNING CYCLE 


JANUARY 2016 

tor. 
These 
include 
the 
Joint 
Field 
Office 
(JFO) and 
other NRF 


coordination entities managed by DHS. The JFO is a Multiagency 
Coordination (MAC) center established locally during 
activations of the NRF. The JFO is composed of a Coordination 
Group, Staff, and Sections staffed by agencies with 
onsite response authorities and support functions. The JFO 
may become involved in some operational aspects of the response 
such as search and rescue. The EPA regional emergency 
response program will be expected to send an EPA 
representative(s) to the JFO to staff the Emergency Support 
Function (ESF) #10 desk, while EPA Headquarters (HQ) will 
send a representative(s) to appropriate NRF coordinating 
entities. 
If 
the 
response 
has significant 
ESF 
#10 
involvement, 
EPAHQ 
may send 
a 
Senior Federal 
Official 
(SFO) 
to 
the 
JFO 
Unified 
Coordination 
Group 
to 
provide 
strategic 
level 
guidance. 
The 
JFO 
Unified 
Coordination 
Group 
may 
also 
include 
officials representing 
other Federal 
departments 

or agencies with primary statutory responsibility and substantial 
assets for certain aspects of incident management. 
SFOs utilize existing authorities, expertise, and capabilities 
to assist in management of the incident, working in coordina


tion 
with 
the 
Principal 
Federal 
Official, 
Federal 
Contracting 
Officer, 
Senior Federal 
Law 
Enforcement 
Official, 
and 
other 
members of 
the 
JFO 
Unified 
Coordination 
Group. 
In 
addition 


to the OSC’s usual on-scene coordination, extra coordination 
will be needed with these other NRF response structures to 

develop 
and 
coordinate 
incident 
objectives. 


The guidance provided in this chapter is a general approach 

Chapter 4. PLANNING CYCLE 

34 


JANUARY 2016 

for planning incident operations. As needed, the Incident 
Management Team (IMT) may choose to adapt this cycle to 
address operational realities. For example, in a geograph


ically dispersed 
response, 
the 
Operations Briefing 
may be 
replaced 
with 
site-specific field 
supervisor briefings, 
especially 
once the Incident Action Plan (IAP) has stabilized and 

field 
operations have 
become 
routine. 
See 
page 
4-23 
for IAP 


components. 

INITIAL RESPONSE AND ASSESSMENT 

The period of Initial Response and Assessment occurs in all 
incidents. Short-term responses, which are small in scope or 
duration (e.g., a few resources working one operational period), 
can often be coordinated using only ICS 201 form (Inci


dent 
Briefing 
Form). 


INCIDENT BRIEFING (ICS 201-EPA FORM) – During the 
transfer-of-command process, an ICS 201-EPA form formatted 
briefing 
provides the 
incoming 
Incident 
Commander/Unified 
Command 
(IC/UC) with 
basic information 
regarding 
the 


incident situation and the resources allotted to the incident. 
Most importantly, it functions as the IAP for the initial response, 
and remains in force and continues to develop until 

the 
response 
ends or the 
incident’s first 
IAP 
is generated. 
It 
is also 
suitable 
for briefing 
individuals newly assigned 
to 
the 


Command and General Staff.

ASSESS PROGRESS – Assessment is an ongoing, contin


uous process to 
help 
adjust 
current 
operations and 
help 
plan 
for future 
operations. 
Following 
the 
briefing 
and 
shift 
change, 


all Command and General Staff Section Chiefs will review 
the incident response progress and make recommendations 

to 
the 
IC/UC 
in 
preparation 
for the 
next 
IC/UC 
Objectives 

Meeting. The IC/UC should maintain close coordination with 
the Regional Incident Coordinator (RIC) for situational updates. 
This feedback/information is continuously gathered 
from various sources, including Field Observers (FOBS), responder 
debriefs, and stakeholders (tools may include Situation 
Report, IAP, and WebEOC). IC/UC should encourage 
Command and General Staff to get out of the ICP to view 

firsthand 
the 
areas of 
the 
incident 
they are 
supporting. 


SPECIAL PURPOSE MEETINGS 

The Special Purpose Meetings are most applicable to larger 
incidents requiring an Operational Period Planning Cycle, but 
may be useful during Initial Response and Assessment. 

BUSINESS MANAGEMENT MEETING – This under-30-minute 
meeting develops and updates the operating plan for 

finance 
and 
logistical 
support. 
The 
agenda 
could 
include: 
documentation 
issues, 
cost 
sharing, 
cost 
analysis, 
finance 
requirements, 
resource 
procurement, 
and 
financial 
summary 
data. Attendees normally include: FSC, Cost Unit Leader 

Chapter 4. PLANNING CYCLE 60 


JANUARY 2016 

(COST), LSC, SITL, and RESL. 

AGENCY REPRESENTATIVE MEETING – This meeting is 
held to update Agency Representatives and ensure that they 
can support the IAP. It is conducted by the LNO, and attended 
by Agency Representatives. It is most appropriately held 
after the Planning Meeting to announce plans for the next 
operational period. It allows for minor changes should the 
plan not meet the expectations of the Agency Representatives. 


MEDIA BRIEFING – This meeting briefs media and the 
public on the most current and accurate facts. It is set up 
and moderated by the PIO, and features selected spokespersons. 
This brief must be held away from the ICP, and 
is normally conducted at a Joint Information Center (JIC). 
Spokespersons should be prepared by the PIO to address 
anticipated 
issues. 
The 
briefing 
should 
be 
well-planned, 
organized, 
and scheduled to meet the media’s needs. 

TECHNICAL SPECIALIST MEETING – Meetings may be 
held to gather technical specialist input to the IAP. As an example, 
the Environmental Unit Leader (ENVL) may call together 
technical specialists to review proposed tactics for the 
IAP.

CHAPTER 5 

RESOURCE ORDERING, INCIDENT SITUATION DISPLAYS, 
AND FORMS 

RESOURCE REQUEST AND ORDERING PROCESS 

The acquisition process begins by submission of Incident 
Command System (ICS) Form 213-RR-EPA requesting 
equipment or personnel. This request form can be used for 
tactical equipment (booms, vacuum trucks, frac tanks, etc.), 
non-tactical resources (trailer, crush and run, ice, etc.), or 

personnel 
(Scientific Support 
Coordinator, 
Field 
Observer, 


statistician, etc.). The form must be approved by a member 
of Command or General Staff. The Resource Unit is responsible 
for maintaining the status of all assigned tactical resources 
at a response. The Logistics Section Chief (LSC) 
will work with the impacted Region, backup Regions, special 
teams, and EPA Headquarters (HQ) to determine if the re


source 
can 
be 
provided 
from within 
theAgency or Unified 


Command (UC) if established. If the resource cannot be 
obtained within the Agency or UC, the LSC will forward the 
ICS 213-RR-EPA form to the Finance/Administration Section 
Chief (FSC) to initiate the procurement process. 

This process is managed by maintaining a status-keeping 
system indicating the current location and status of all re-

Chapter 5. RESOURCE ORDERING, INCIDENT SITUATION DISPLAYS, 

62 

AND FORMS 


JANUARY 2016 

sources. This can be a daunting task, so developing a system 
early, 
briefing 
incoming 
personnel 
on 
the 
resource 
request 
and ordering process, and maintaining the appropriate 
forms is essential. The use of purchase cards and executing 
warrant authority outside the requisition ordering process 

makes it 
very difficult 
to 
track assets during 
the 
response 


and to account for assets following the incident, when the 

audit 
by the 
Office 
of 
the 
Inspector General 
(OIG) usually 

begins. 

The Incident Commander (IC) must make it clear that the 
Resource Unit, Logistics Section, and Finance/ Administration 
Section are the primary mechanisms for obtaining equipment 
or personnel during a large response. Under no circumstances 
is this process intended to slow the pace of the 
response. If the requisition process does not meet the needs 
of 
response 
personnel, 
the 
IC 
should 
be 
notified 
immediately. 
At that time, the IC may direct an On-Scene Coordinator 
(OSC) to utilize his/her purchase card or warrant authority to 
prevent damage to the environment or risk impacting human 
health. Additional information can be found in the Resource 
Unit Leader (RESL) Job Aid, the Logistics Section Chief 
(LSC) Job Aid, and the Finance/Administration Section Chief 
(FSC) Job Aid. 

INCIDENT SITUATION DISPLAY 

The collection and display of information about an incident 

Chapter 5. RESOURCE ORDERING, INCIDENT SITUATION DISPLAYS, 

63 

AND FORMS 


JANUARY 2016 

and the nature and status of response operations is a critical 
aspect of establishing and maintaining a command and 

control 
environment, 
and 
promotes effective 
and 
efficient 


communications. Ideally, pre-designated status boards and/ 
or video 
projection 
screens should 
be 
used 
for display to 
ensure 
that critical information is captured and presented in a 
clear and logical fashion. 

Status boards and video display that depict information that 
is of use to two or more Sections in an Incident Command 
Post (ICP) should be grouped together in an area called the 
Incident Situation Display. The Incident Situation Display 
should be viewed as the one place in an ICP where anyone 
can go, at any time, to learn about the nature and status of 
an incident and response operations. 

Status boards in the Incident Situation Display should be 
limited in number and should be displayed in an ordered 
fashion to ensure that they impart an integrated and coherent 
message concerning: (1) the incident (e.g., nature, location, 
and extent of the incident, status of resources, type 
and quantity of resources, and the environmental conditions 
affecting the response); and (2) the nature and status of response 
operations to address the incident. Figure 5-1: Incident 
Situation Display presents an example of an Incident 
Situation Display layout that is consistent with a left to right 
viewing. 

Chapter 5. RESOURCE ORDERING, INCIDENT SITUATION DISPLAYS, 

64 

AND FORMS 


JANUARY 2016 

An Incident Situation Display should be established and 
maintained by the Situation Unit Leader (SITL) and RESL. It 
should be situated in a highly visible and easily accessible 
location, in close proximity to the Planning Section and easily 
accessible to the Operations Section. Since the ICP is an 
active area, the Incident Situation Display should be located 

away from areas subject 
to 
heavy foot 
traffic. 


Although an Incident Situation Display is established and 
maintained by personnel in the Planning Section, it belongs 
to everyone in the ICS. To the extent that the Incident Situation 
Display contains information about activities underway in 
other Sections, it is the obligation of appropriate personnel in 
those Sections to work with the Planning Section to ensure 
information posted in the Incident Situation Display is accurate 
and up-to-date. It is likewise the responsibility of the 
status board monitors within the Situation Unit to seek out 
sources and establish paths and schedules for needed information. 


As time allows, black-and-white, 8” by 11” versions of the 
status board information should be prepared. These documents 
should be time-stamped and distributed within ICS 
and remotely, and copies should be made available at the 
Incident Situation Display.

ICS FORMS 

To assist with information management during response activities, 
responders at all levels should make the best use of 
the 
most 
applicable 
ICS forms. 
The 
National 
Wildfire 
Coordinating 
Group (NWCG) forms are the longstanding conventional 
ICS forms that are most commonly used throughout 
the emergency services community and are designed based 
upon 
firefighting 
operations (e.g., 
ICS 215 
form tracks pumpers, 
bulldozers, 
and 
other firefighting 
apparatuses). 
U.S. 
Coast 
Guard 
(USCG)-modified 
forms have 
been 
prepared 


to align more closely with oil spill response operations (e.g., 
ICS 215-CG form tracks oil skimmers, vacuum trucks, and 

other oil 
spill 
response 
equipment). 
The 
EPA-modified 
forms 

have been prepared to track resources associated with conventional 
Superfund removal operations (e.g., ICS 215-EPA 
form tracks equipment operator, cleanup technician, chemist). 
Depending on the nature of an incident, any of these 
may be most suitable to the event. If working within a UC, or 
assisting with another agency’s Incident Management Team 
(IMT), responders may also encounter the use of other modi


fied 
forms that 
are 
also 
suitable 
for the 
event. 


The 
forms listed 
in 
this section 
are 
identified 
as reference 


only. Each of the forms listed below is available on epaosc. 
org under “Forms and Boilerplate documents”. The following

CHAPTER 6 
ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT 

Environmental data management is a crucial area of environmental 
response. It is the basis for meaningful risk communication 
with 
the 
public and 
other first 
responders. 
Environmental 
data is managed in the Planning Section of the 
Incident Command System (ICS), preferably in an Environmental 
Unit, given span of control and other organizational 
issues as determined by the Incident Commander (IC). This 
chapter is largely about the operations and processes of the 
Environmental Unit in managing environmental data. The responsibilities 
of technical specialists within the Environmental 
Unit can be found in Chapter 9 – Planning Section. 

The National Incident Management System (NIMS) discusses 
the establishment of an Environmental Unit within the 
Planning Section to facilitate interagency environmental data 
management, monitoring, sampling, analysis, and assessment. 
It is expected that most, if not all, EPA responses will 
include the establishment of an Environmental Unit within 
the Planning Section. It should be noted however, that some 
of the functions of an Environmental Unit may be assigned to 
a Technical Working Group (TWG), established either within 
the Planning Section or in Command Staff reporting directly 
to the Incident Commander. 

Chapter 6. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT 

69 


JANUARY 2016 

The 
Environmental 
Unit 
is responsible 
for scientific support 


associated with a response, including the following: 

 Support for response approaches including technologies; 


 Modeling and data interpretation; 

 Natural resources and ecological issues; 

 Establishment of standard methods and permitting issues; 


 Sampling and Analysis Plans; and 

 Quality Assurance and Control Plans. 

Personnel assigned to the Environmental Unit may include 
technical specialists in sampling and analytical methods, 
site response technologies, data management, hazardous 
material characterization, risk assessment, stabilization, site 
characterization, decontamination, cleanup, and waste management. 
The Environmental Unit, which is located in the 
Planning Section, conducts the following activities: participates 
in developing sampling and analysis plans; receives 
field 
data 
from the 
Operations Section 
from laboratory support; 
verifies, 
interprets, 
and 
manages the 
data; 
and 
advises 
the 
IC 
and 
Command 
Staff 
on 
findings, 
data 
gaps, 
and 
precautionary 
measures. 

The Environmental Unit may comprise Agency representa-

Chapter 6. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT 

70 


JANUARY 2016 

tives, private industry, and academia. It is anticipated that the 
Environmental Unit will coordinate with other Federal assets 
that generate and interpret data, such as the Federal Radiological 
Monitoring and Assessment Center (FRMAC), the 
Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center 
(IMAAC), National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration 
(NOAA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the 

U.S. Fire Administration (USFA). Additionally, a Science Unit 
or TWG may be established during the response to address 
emerging issues (such as dispersant use during the Deep 
Water Horizon response) and to ensure technical and stakeholder 
outreach. 
During 
a 
Nationally Significant 
Incident, 
an 
additional 
Headquarters 
(HQ) Environmental Unit will be established in the 
HQ Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The function of 

the 
HQ 
Environmental 
Unit 
is to 
support 
field 
operations by 

providing additional data quality control, coordinating with 
outside groups such as the Science Advisory Board, working 
with 
the 
Office 
of 
Public Affairs (OPA) to 
craft 
incident-specific 
information for the media, and providing risk assessments 
for the general public. The HQ Environmental Unit should 

work in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
field 
Environmental 
Unit 
and 
the 
Scientific Support 
Coordinator (SSC) in 
Command 


Staff. The purpose of the HQ Environmental Unit is to coor


dinate 
with 
and 
support 
the 
field 
Environmental 
Unit 
through 


the following activities: 

 External coordination with national political leadership 
and other Federal (including Agency for Toxic Substanc-

Chapter 6. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT 71 


JANUARY 2016 

es and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers (USACE)) and state agencies (via support 
from the regions); 

 Internal 
coordination 
with 
other EPAoffices, 
including 
the 
Office 
of 
theAdministrator, 
the 
Office 
of 
General 
Counsel, 
the 
Office 
of 
ExternalAffairs and 
Environmental 
Education, 
the 
Office 
ofAir and 
Radiation, 
the 
Office 
of 
Water, 
the 
Office 
of 
Enforcement 
and 
ComplianceAssurance, 
and 
other appropriate 
offices; 


 Analytical data management review and interpretation; 

 Quality assurance; 

 Hazard or risk assessments; 

 Coordinating technical issues with various regions such 
as debris management; 

 Dissemination of information to the public and the media; 
and 

 Ensuring information technology systems are in place for 
posting data on the Web and providing geographic information 
systems (GIS) support. 

ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
UNIT 

The Environmental Unit may have additional responsibilities, 

Chapter 6. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT 

72 


JANUARY 2016 

depending on the incident, including, but not limited to: 

 Using the appropriate technical approach to make recommenda


tions

 regarding the protection of public health, welfare, and 
the environment; 

 Developing plans to assess special environmental conditions 
or impacts related to an incident, and evaluating 
strategies to minimize those impacts; 

 Evaluating data collected for usability, and communicating 
the information to the rest of the IMT as needed; 

 Using 
models that 
are 
relevant 
to 
the 
specific conditions 

of the incident, and communicating the limitations and 
assumptions associated with models to the Planning 
Section Chief (PSC) and stakeholders; 

 Performing short-term and long-term risk assessment, 
as appropriate, to determine action and cleanup levels; 
and 

 Assessing the environmental conditions or impacts related 
to an incident and developing strategies to minimize 
those impacts. 

An example of a possible Environmental Unit structure is 
depicted in Figure 6-1: Example of an Environmental Unit in 

Incident/Unified 
Command. 


OPERATIONS SECTION AND PLANNING SECTION IN-

Chapter 6. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT 

73 


JANUARY 2016 

TEROPERABILITY 

The sharing of information and technical assistance should 
be commonplace among the Command and General Staff, 
as depicted in Figure 6-2: Environmental Unit’s Relationship 
with Other Incident Command Functions. Coordination must 
occur between Operations Section and Planning Section 
personnel to develop the technical/tactical elements of the 
response action. 

The responsibility for the development of plans is shared 
by the Operations Section and Planning Section. Strategic 
planning is the responsibility of the Planning Section. Tactical 
planning and implementation is the responsibility of the 
Operations Section. The Environmental Unit will provide 
technical expertise to the Operations Section to ensure that 

the 
technical 
approach 
in 
the 
specified 
operational 
period 
is 

effective. (Note: If established, this should be in consultation 
with any TWGs or the SSC.) The Environmental Unit will assist 
the incident command through the development of sampling 
plans, data analysis and interpretation, development of 
environmental models, and technology evaluation. 

In some cases technical specialists may be assigned to and 
stay with a Division/Group in the Operations Section. For example, 
an Air Monitoring Specialist is needed to support multiple 
Groups performing air monitoring in the Operations Section, 
and he/she is also needed to evaluate data coming into 

Chapter 6. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT 

74 


JANUARY 2016 

the Situation Unit or Environmental Unit. Since the technical 
specialist is critical to the implementation of an operation, he/ 
she would be assigned to the Operations Section. 

It is extremely important that Environmental Unit deliverables/
products are passed through the Environmental Unit 

Leader (ENVL) and 
PSC 
to 
the 
Incident 
Commander/Unified 


Command (IC/UC) prior to dissemination, use, or implementation. 
It is critical that the ENVL coordinate all facets of the 
Unit’s mission and the various agencies’ and organizations’ 
interests, concerns, and technical expertise with the PSC, 
Command Staff, and IC/UC as a recommendation, opinion, 
or proposed action plan. When an Environmental Unit is established 
at HQ, deliverables/products need to be coordi


nated 
with 
the 
HQ 
Environmental 
Unit 
before 
being 
finalized 


and sent to the PSC in the IMT. 

TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
UNIT 

The 
Environmental 
Unit, 
if 
the 
specific incident 
warrants, 


could address multiple technical issues or functions to properly 
support 
the 
Incident/Unified 
Command. 
Only those 
technical 
functions needed 
for a 
specific response 
should 
be 
incorporated 
into the Environmental Unit. 

Examples of technical specialists include:

LONG-TERM PLANNING, SCIENCE, AND AREA COMMAND 
COORDINATION 

Actions identified 
during 
the 
emergency response 
phase 


should be addressed and documented as the response 
progresses to ensure that information and data are not lost 

during 
the 
transition. 
The 
identified 
actions will 
transition 
to 


another program. If an Area Command (AC) is established, 
it is anticipated that the AC would support much of the non-

field 
functional 
science 
and 
technical 
work (see 
Chapter 13 


– Area Command for the role of the AC Environmental Unit). 
Area Command, if established, should be able to assist in 
identifying 
the 
programs that 
would 
have 
jurisdiction 
over 
specific aspects of 
the 
incident 
following 
the 
initial 
response 


action (e.g., the water program, remedial program, or air program). 


EPA’s Office 
of 
Emergency Management 
(OEM) has established 
and maintains the Environmental Response Laboratory 
Network (ERLN) to provide national environmental 
laboratory analytical capabilities and capacities necessary 
for effective and timely response to environmental contamination 
resulting from a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a 
national threat event associated with CBRN agents, or other 
Nationally Significant 
Incidents. 
The 
ERLN 
builds upon 
existing 
networks and infrastructure, and is developing testing 
capability and capacity to meet EPA’s responsibilities for surveillance, 
response, and recovery from incidents involving 
CBRN agents. OEM coordinates with other EPA programs 
and laboratories as well as works with other Federal or state 
agencies to leverage resources and develop necessary labo-

ratory capacity to meet the nation’s needs for environmental 

analyses associated 
with 
a 
nationally significant 
incident 
or 

a CBRN event. As such, OEM should be contacted prior to 
contacting or obtaining laboratory services from these other 
providers such as the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) 
or the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN).The 
ERLN can be contacted through the HQ EOC or HQ Environmental 
Unit, if established.

POSITION CHECKLISTS 

INCIDENT COMMANDER (IC) – The IC is responsible for 
overall incident management. In many incidents, the command 
activity is carried out by a single IC. For the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), the IC is normally the 
lead On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) assigned to the response. 

Although 
there 
are 
numerous OSCs filling 
critical 
positions 

within the Incident Management Team (IMT), the lead OSC, 
by regulation, is responsible for the overall management of 

the 
incident. 
The 
IC 
determines the 
incident 
objectives and 


coordinates with the Regional Incident Coordinator (RIC) to

* The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) National Pollution 
Funds Center (NPFC) manages the Oil Spill Liability 
Trust Fund (OSLTF). EPA has a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) agreement with the NPFC for 
reimbursement of costs associated with its oil spill 
response work. EPA can also access reimbursable 
funds through a Pollution Removal Funding Authorization 
(PRFA) with USCG. The USCG determines if a 
PRFA or MOU can be opened for a response. Some of 
the costs that are reimbursable under a PRFA include, 
but are not necessarily limited to: 
 Personnel salary costs, including overtime; 

 Travel and per diem expenses; 

 Actual expenses for contractor or vendor supplied 
goods and services obtained by the other government 
agency, through its own purchasing process;

CHAPTER 12 
UNIFIED COMMAND 

While a single Incident Commander (IC) normally handles 
the command function, an Incident Command System (ICS) 

organization 
may be 
expanded 
into 
a 
Unified 
Command 


(UC). As a component of ICS, the UC is a structure that 
brings together the 
“Incident 
Commanders” of 
all 
major organizations 
involved in the incident to coordinate an effective 
response, while at the same time carrying out their own 

jurisdictional 
responsibilities. 
The 
UC 
links the 
organizations 

responding to the incident and provides a forum for these 
agencies to make consensus decisions. Under the UC, the 

various jurisdictions and/or agencies and 
non-government 


responders may blend together throughout the organization 
to create an integrated response team. 

The 
UC 
may be 
used 
whenever multiple 
jurisdictions are 
involved 
in 
a 
response 
effort. 
These 
jurisdictions could 
be 
represented 
by: 

 Geographic boundaries (e.g., two states, Indian tribal 
land); 

 Governmental levels (e.g., Federal, state, local, tribal); 

 Functional 
responsibilities (e.g., 
fire, 
oil 
spill, 
Emergency 

Medical Services (EMS)); 

Chapter 12. UNIFIED COMMAND 

172 


JANUARY 2016 

 Statutory responsibilities (e.g., Federal Land Managers, 
Responsible Party (RP)); or 

 Some combination of the above. 

Chapter 12. UNIFIED COMMAND 

173 


JANUARY 2016 

Actual 
UC 
makeup 
for a 
specific incident 
will 
be 
determined 


on a case-by-case basis taking into account: (1) the spe


cifics of 
the 
incident; 
(2) determinations outlined 
in 
existing 


response plans; or (3) decisions reached during the initial 
meeting of the UC. The makeup of the UC may change as 
an incident progresses to account for changes in the situation. 


To be effective, the number of personnel should be kept as 
small as possible. The UC is responsible for overall management 
of the incident; ICs retain the responsibilities listed 
in 
Chapter 7 
– 
Command 
Staff. 
Awell-defined 
process requires 
the 
UC 
to 
set 
clear objectives to 
guide 
the 
on-scene 


response resources. The UC is not a “decision by committee.” 
The principals are there to command the response to 
an incident. Time is of the essence. The UC should develop 

synergy based 
on 
the 
significant 
capabilities that 
are 
brought 


by the various representatives. There should be personal 
acknowledgement of each representative’s unique capabilities, 
a shared understanding of the situation, and agreement 

on 
the 
common 
objectives. 
With 
the 
different 
perspectives 

on the UC comes the risk of disagreements, most of which 
can be resolved through the understanding of the underlying 
issues. Contentious issues may arise, but the UC framework 

provides a 
forum and 
a 
process to 
resolve 
problems and 
find 


solutions. 

A cooperative attitude is essential. Nevertheless, situations 
may arise where consensus agreement may not be reach-

Chapter 12. UNIFIED COMMAND 174 


JANUARY 2016 

able. In such instances, the UC member representing the 
agency with 
primary jurisdiction 
over the 
issue 
would 
normally 
be 
deferred 
to 
for the 
final 
decision. 


The bottom line is that UC has certain responsibilities as 

noted 
above. 
Failure 
to 
provide 
clear objectives for the 
next 


operational period means that the Command function has 
failed. While the UC structure is an excellent vehicle (and the 
only nationally recognized vehicle) for coordination, cooperation, 
and communication, the duly authorized representatives 
must make the system work successfully. A strong 
Command—a single IC or UC—is essential to an effective 
response. 

Each UC member may assign Deputy Incident Commander(
s) to assist in carrying out IC responsibilities. UC members 
may also be assigned individual legal and administrative 
support from their own organizations. 

To be considered for inclusion as a UC representative, 
your organization must: 

 Have 
jurisdictional 
authority or functional 
responsibility 

under a law or ordinance for the incident; 

 Be 
significantly impacted 
by the 
incident 
or response 
operations; 
and 

 Be 
specifically charged 
with 
commanding, 
coordinating, 
or managing 
a 
major aspect 
of 
the 
response. 


Chapter 12. UNIFIED COMMAND 

175 


JANUARY 2016 

Representatives to the UC should: 

 Have the capability to sustain an appropriate time commitment 
to the incident; 

 Have the authority to commit agency or company resources 
to the incident; and 

 Have the authority to spend agency or company funds. 

UC representatives must be able to: 

 Agree 
on 
common 
incident 
objectives and 
priorities; 


 Agree on an incident response organization; 

 Agree on which agency will take the lead as the IC 
(based 
on 
jurisdictional 
responsibilities) and 
the 
appropriate 
position assignments in General Staff to ensure 
clear direction for on-scene tactical resources; 

 Commit to speak with “one voice” through the Public In


formation 
Officer (PIO) or Joint 
Information 
Center (JIC), 


if established; 
 Agree on logistical support procedures; and 
 Agree on cost-sharing procedures, as appropriate. 

It is important to note that participation in a UC occurs without 
any agency abdicating authority, responsibility, or accountability. 


Chapter 12. UNIFIED COMMAND 

176 


JANUARY 2016 

What if your agency is not a part of the UC? Here is how 
to ensure your organization’s concerns or issues are addressed: 


 Serve as an agency or company representative; 

 Provide input to your agency or company representative 

who 
has direct 
contact 
with 
the 
Liaison 
Officer (LNO); 


 Provide stakeholder input to the LNO (for environmental, 
economic, or political issues); or 

 Serve as a technical specialist in the Planning Section 
(reassigned, as appropriate).

CHAPTER 13 
AREA COMMAND 

Area Command (AC) is an expansion of the incident command 
function primarily designed to manage a very large incident 
or area that has multiple Incident Management Teams 
(IMTs) assigned. An AC can be established any time incidents 
are close enough that oversight direction is required 

among 
IMTs to 
ensure 
conflicts do 
not 
arise. 


The 
function 
of 
theAC 
is to 
develop 
broad 
objectives for the 


impacted area and coordinate the development of individual 

incident 
objectives and 
strategies.Additionally theAC 
will 
set 


priorities for the use of critical resources allocated to the incidents 
assigned to the area. 

The organization is normally small with personnel assigned 
to Command, Planning, Logistics, and Finance/ Administration 
functions. Depending on the complexity of the interface 
between incidents, specialists in other areas such as aviation, 
environmental fate and transport, and occupational and/ 
or public health may also be assigned to the AC. 

An AC should not be confused with the functions performed 
by a local or state Emergency Operations Center (EOC) or 
a Departmental/Agency Operations Center (DOC), such as 

Chapter 13. AREA COMMAND 

178 


JANUARY 2016 

an EPA Regional Emergency Operations Center (REOC). An 
AC oversees management and resource allocation of the incident(
s), while an EOC/DOC coordinates support functions. 
When incidents do not have similar resource demands, they 
are usually handled separately and coordinated through an 
EOC. This organization does not supplant the Incident Commanders 
(ICs), but rather supports and provides strategic 
direction. Execution of tactical operations and coordination 
remains the responsibility of the on-scene incident command 
structure. 

AREA COMMAND CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS 

ACTIVATION CRITERIA – For situations that warrant an 
AC, it is likely in most cases that the impacted area would be 

subject 
to 
a 
multiagency response 
and 
require 
a 
UnifiedArea 
Command. 
Appropriate 
jurisdictions decide 
jointly, 
and 
the 
UnifiedArea 
Command 
Post 
would 
be 
located 
in 
the 
vicinity 

of the impacted area. For establishment of a single-agency 
(EPA) Area Command, the EPA Regional Incident Coordinator 
(RIC) or Incident Commander (IC) can determine when 
an incident(s) is of such magnitude, complexity, or operation


al 
intensity that 
it 
would 
benefit 
from the 
activation 
of 
anAC. 


Factors to consider when deciding to activate an AC include 
but are not limited to: 

 A complex incident that overwhelms regional assets; 

 An incident that impacts more than one EPA region; 

Chapter 13. AREA COMMAND 

179 


JANUARY 2016 

 An incident that crosses international borders; and 

 More than one active incident where incidents are competing 
for the same resources or an incident spread over 
a wide geographic area. 

ACTIVATION GUIDANCE – When the decision is made to 
activate an AC, the following actions should occur: 

 An Area Commander is designated by the EPA RIC(s); 

 Designated Area Commander and Deputy will be delegated 
clear succession of command authority; 

 If 
an 
incident(s) is multijurisdictional, 
theAC 
shall 
be 
established 
using 
Unified 
Command 
(UC) concepts and 


principles. When UC is established, representatives will 
typically consist of executives possessing the highest 
level of response authority as possible; and 

 Determine appropriate location for the Area Command 
Post. 

AREA COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITIES – The Area 
Commander has the overall responsibility for strategic management 
of the incident and will: 

a. EstablishAC 
strategic objectives; 
b. Establish overall response priorities; 
c. Rank incidents in order of priority; 
Chapter 13. AREA COMMAND 

180 


JANUARY 2016 

d. Identify and allocate critical resources based on incident 
needs; 
e. Ensure that the incident(s) is properly managed; 
f. Ensure 
that 
the 
on-scene 
incident(s) objectives are 
met; 

g. Minimize 
conflict 
with 
supporting 
agencies/ 
stakeholder 
and public concerns; 
h. Coordinate acquisition of critical or specialized resources; 
and 
i. In 
the 
event 
that 
a 
Joint 
Field 
Office 
(JFO) is activated, 
coordinate acquisition of national assets to support 
the incident(s) between AC and the JFO. 
The AC organization should be kept as small as possible. 
The size of the AC organization will be determined by the authorities 
and support requirements of the incident(s). Under 
normal 
circumstances,AC 
staffing 
will 
consist 
of 
the 
following 
positions: 

 Area Commander(s) and Deputy; 
 Liaison 
Officer (LNO); 
 Public Information 
Officer (PIO); 
 Area Planning Section Chief (PSC); 
 Area Logistics Section Chief (LSC); 
 Area Finance/Administration Section Chief (FSC); 

Chapter 13. AREA COMMAND 

181 


JANUARY 2016 

 Situation Unit Leader (SITL); 

 Resource Unit Leader (RESL); 

 Environmental Unit Leader (ENVL);and 

 Intelligence/Investigations Officer (IIO). 


The AC organization does not, in any way, replace the on-
scene incident organization or functions. The above positions, 
if established, are strictly related to supporting the AC 
functional responsibilities. Tactical operations continue to be 
directed at the on-scene command level. 

AC REPORTING RELATIONSHIPS 

It 
is envisioned 
that 
the 
role 
ofArea 
Commander will 
be 
filled 


by an appropriately trained IC with the ability to set priorities 
and 
objectives on 
behalf 
of 
the 
U.S. 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency (EPA). When established, the Area Commander 
reports through normal EPA management chain-of-command. 
If a JFO or other Multiagency Coordination (MAC) 
entity is established, the AC will need to determine the appropriate 
level of coordination and liaison required to support 
the incident(s).

CHAPTER 14 
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RESPONSE 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) routinely 
responds to releases of hazardous substances. Typically 
these responses are small and are easily handled by a 
Federal On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) with the support of 
response contractors, Special Teams, and/or other EPA personnel. 
In many cases, state and/or local resources assist 
with direct or indirect response support. In other instances, 
EPA may provide technical support to other Federal, state, 
local, or tribal agencies in response to releases of hazardous 
substances. EPA may also serve as either the Incident Com


mander (IC) or, 
more 
frequently, 
within 
the 
Unified 
Command 


(UC) when needed due to the magnitude of the situation, its 
technical complexity, or the unavailability of other response 
resources. 

The 
majority of 
hazardous substance 
releases are 
small 


events that will not and should not result in a response beyond 
that of an initial or reinforced response organization. 
The OSC should have knowledge of the local government 
response capabilities and/or be familiar with local responders, 
as this will affect the degree of leadership and control 
that the OSC will be expected to take in hazardous sub


stance/material 
events. 
Some 
first 
responders may only be 


trained to the awareness level, which will allow them to recognize 
the presence of hazards, protect themselves, secure 

Chapter 14. HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RESPONSE 217 


JANUARY 2016 

the site, and to call for specialized personnel. Do not assume 

that 
first 
responders have 
adequately assessed, 
contained, 


or completely controlled the release. 

In areas where the state and local government have a strong 
hazardous substance/materials response program, EPA may 
be primarily in a support role during the emergency phases. 
In areas where there is less hazardous substance response 
capability, EPA will be expected to take a much stronger 
leadership role. 

In this regard, there may also be reasons to expand the UC 
beyond the Federal OSC, state/tribal OSC, Responsible 
Party (RP) participation, 
and 
local 
jurisdiction. 
The 
UC 
represented 
in 
this chapter reflects the 
possible 
levels of 
participation 
that may be seen in some locations and situations for 
hazardous substance incidents. Area and regional planning 
allow 
OSCs to 
meet 
with 
other responders in 
their jurisdictions. 
These opportunities should be used to determine the 
response capabilities and personalities that may be involved 
in responses in your region. 

There are different terms used to describe hazardous materials 
throughout the transportation, response, and regulatory 
communities. Throughout this Incident Management Handbook 
(IMH), the term “hazardous substances” is intended to 
refer to “hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants” 
as defined 
under the 
National 
Oil 
and 
Hazardous Substances 
Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). 

Chapter 14. HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RESPONSE 

218 


JANUARY 2016 

The term “OSC” is used to refer to the Federal On-Scene 
Coordinator, in accordance with the NCP. EPA uses the designation 
“OPS” to refer to the Operations Section Chief position 
to avoid confusion with the Federal OSC designation in 
regulation. 

Finally, the designation “RP” is used for consistency with the 

U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) IMH, and includes both Responsible 
Parties under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) and Potentially 
Responsible Parties (PRP) under the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). 
It is impossible to address the full range of possible Incident 
Command System (ICS) organizations that may be 
used by EPA in responding to hazardous substance/material 
(hazmat) releases. Therefore, this chapter will use three 
possible scenarios to present the modular development of 
the ICS organization. The organization charts presented in 
this chapter highlight the positions/units that are critical for 
a hazmat response; empty boxes are shown to indicate that 
the complete ICS org chart may include additional positions. 
The 
first 
scenario, 
with 
an 
ICS organizational 
chart 
depicted 
in Figure 14-1: EPA-Led Response (Basic Structure), 
involves an EPA-led response to a fairly simple hazardous 
substances incident (for example, one in which only an EPA 
OSC and his/her contractors respond). The second, with 
an ICS organizational chart depicted in Figure 14-2: EPA-
Led Response (Complex Structure), involves an EPA-led 

Chapter 14. HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RESPONSE 219 


JANUARY 2016 

response to a fairly complex hazardous substance release, 

but 
without 
significant 
non-hazardous substance 
issues (i.e., 


all response activities are geared towards the hazardous 
substances incident). Finally, the third scenario, with an ICS 
organization chart depicted in Figure 14-3: Multiagency Response 
to a Multi-Hazard Incident, involves a complex incident 
in which the hazardous substance response represents 

just 
a 
fraction 
of 
the 
ongoing 
activities (for example, 
a 
train 


derailment involving a chlorine release impacting a nearby 
community). In such an incident, it is expected that a Hazardous 
Substance/Material (Hazmat) Branch or Group will 
be created to provide the necessary supervision and control 
for the essential functions required at virtually all hazardous 
substances incidents. The Hazmat Branch Director, if activated, 
or Group Supervisor will direct the primary functions 
and supervise all resources that have a direct involvement 
with hazardous substances. The presented organizational 
structures also 
reflect 
the 
modular development 
of 
a 
hazardous 
substances release ICS organization. The organization 
expands and contracts to accommodate the increasing complexity 
and response resources associated with the three responses, 
maintaining the span of control of each supervisor 
within the acceptable range. 

While not shown in any of the presented ICS organizations, it 
should be noted that, in some especially complex incidents, 
a 
modified 
planning 
structure 
can 
be 
adopted 
under the 
National 
Incident Management System (NIMS), with detailed 
action planning done within the Hazmat Branch. If an inci-

Chapter 14. HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RESPONSE

dent 
becomes so 
large 
that 
there 
is no 
logical 
set 
of 
objectives 
that pertain to the entire incident, or if the preparation 
and/or distribution of the Incident Action Plan (IAP) cannot 
be feasibly accomplished within the required timeframe, then 
Branch tactical planning may be appropriate. In such a case, 
the Environmental Unit would likely be moved to the Hazmat 
Branch. In such a case, the Planning Section would have to 
ensure that inter-Branch coordination takes place whenever 
necessary. When a hazardous substance incident is large 
enough in scope and/or complexity, both the Operations and 
Planning Sections will be fully engaged. The Operations 
Section will coordinate and carry out tactics for the current 
operational period while the Planning Section will work on 
plans for the next operational period and beyond. 

Due to the presence of hazardous substances/materials 
in a typical EPA response, the Agency expects to typically 
create an Environmental Unit within the Planning Section, 
as described in NIMS, to properly support the decision 

making 
capability of 
the 
ICS structure 
during 
a 
major 

incident. Planning, research, analytical data management, 
assessment, and other science or technical functions may 
not be able to be addressed by the responders as they 

focus on 
their field 
activities. 
The 
Environmental 
Unit 
would 


assemble and coordinate environmental stakeholders and 

needed 
technical 
specialists to 
provide 
scientific advice 


on various environmental and health issues and provide 
technical expertise, work products, plans, or deliverables.

Since the Logistics Section and Finance/Administration Section, 
if formed during a hazardous substance response, will 

reflect 
the 
same 
functional 
requirements as in 
the 
generic 

ICS organization, they have not been included in the organizational 
charts for this chapter.

UNIFIED COMMAND (UC) 

Hazardous materials incidents will usually be managed under 
UC principles. Thus—in addition to EPA and state/tribal 

and/or local 
environmental 
agencies—fire, 
law 
enforcement, 
and 
public health 
agencies will 
also 
have 
some 
statutory jurisdiction 
and functional responsibility to respond. Most hazardous 
substance emergencies will involve both environmental 
and public safety components. 

The 
best 
method 
of 
ensuring 
effective 
information 
flow 
and 


coordination among the responding agencies at the scene of 
a multiagency incident is to establish an Incident Command 
Post (ICP) and the use of a UC. Each key response agency 
should provide a representative to remain at the ICP who will 
have authority to speak for and commit agency resources. 
The RP may participate in the UC if they have resources involved 
in 
the 
response 
or specific information 
needed 
to 
facilitate 
response activities.

CHAPTER 15 
INTELLIGENCE 

The analysis and sharing of information and intelligence are 
important elements of the Incident Command System (ICS). 
Under the National Incident Management System (NIMS), intelligence 
includes not only national security and other types 
of 
classified 
information, 
but 
also 
other operational 
information, 
such as risk assessments that include law enforcement 
safety assessments, medical intelligence (e.g., surveillance), 
toxic contaminant levels, and other data that may come from 
a variety of different sources. Traditionally, the Intelligence/ 
Investigations Function is located in the Planning Section. 
However, the Incident Commander (IC) may assign the Intelligence/ 
Investigation Function to other parts of the ICS organization. 
Law enforcement-sensitive information and intelligence 
must be appropriately analyzed and shared only with 
personnel designated by the IC. Those designated individuals 
who have proper clearance and a “need-to-know” use the 
information ultimately to ensure the safety of all EPA personnel 
and support decision making in a dynamic environment. 

The Intelligence/Investigations Function may be divided into 
two separate functional areas or maintained as a single function, 
based on the mission and the IC’s preference. The Intelligence/
Investigations Function, for example, may be organized 
in any one of the following ways: 

Chapter 15. INTELLIGENCE 

257 


JANUARY 2016 

A. Within the Command Staff – This option may be most 
appropriate 
in 
incidents with 
little 
need 
for classified 


intelligence and in which incident-related intelligence 
is provided by supporting Agency Representatives, 
through real-time reach-back capabilities. 

B. As a Unit within the Planning Section – This option may 
be most appropriate in an incident with some need for 
tactical intelligence and when no law enforcement entity 
is a 
member of 
the 
Unified 
Command 
(UC). 


C. As a Branch within the Operations Section – This option 
may be most appropriate in incidents with a high 
need 
for tactical 
classified 
intelligence 
and 
when 
law 


enforcement is a member of the UC. 

D. As a separate General Staff Section – This option may 
be 
most 
appropriate 
when 
an 
incident 
is heavily influenced 
by intelligence factors or when there is a need 
to 
manage 
and/or analyze 
a 
large 
volume 
of 
classified 


and/or highly sensitive intelligence. This option is particularly 
relevant to a terrorism incident, for which intelligence 
plays a critical role throughout the incident life 
cycle. 

However it is organized, the Intelligence/Investigations Function 
develops, conducts, and manages information-related 

security plans and 
operations, 
to 
include 
mission-specific, 


critical investigations. These can include information security 
and operational security activities, as well as the complex 
task of ensuring that sensitive information of all types (e.g., 

Chapter 15. INTELLIGENCE 

258 


JANUARY 2016 

classified 
information, 
sensitive 
law 
enforcement 
information, 


proprietary and personal information, and export-controlled 
information) is handled in a way that not only safeguards the 
information, but also ensures that it gets to those who need 
access to it so that they can effectively and safely conduct 
their missions. The Intelligence/ Investigations Function also 
has the responsibility for coordinating information and oper


ational-security matters with 
the 
Public Information 
Officer 

(PIO), particularly where public awareness activities may affect 
information or operational security. 

INTELLIGENCE/INVESTIGATIONS OFFICER (IIO) – Based 
on the need/vision of the IC, and as previously stated, the 
IIO may be located within the Command or General Staff 

sections. 
The 
major responsibilities of 
the 
IIO 
are: 


a. Review Common Responsibilities (page 3-1); 
b. Collect and analyze incoming intelligence information 
from all sources; 
c. Determine 
the 
applicability, 
significance, 
and 
reliability 
of incoming intelligence; 
d. As requested, 
provide 
intelligence 
briefings to 
the 
IC/ 
UC; 
e. Coordinate 
with 
PIO 
and 
Office 
of 
External 
Affairs 
and Environmental Education (OPA as needed); 
f. Provide 
intelligence 
briefings in 
support 
of 
the 
Operational 
Planning Cycle; 

Chapter 15. INTELLIGENCE 

259 


JANUARY 2016 

g. Provide Situation Unit with periodic updates of intelligence 
issues that impact consequence management 
operations; 
h. Answer intelligence questions and advise Command 
and General Staff as appropriate; 
i. Supervise, coordinate, and participate in the collection, 
analysis, processing, and dissemination of intelligence 
and investigative functions; 
j. 
Assist in establishing and maintaining systematic, 
cross-referenced 
intelligence 
records and 
files; 
k. Establish liaison with all participating law enforcement 
agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI)/Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), 
and state, local, and tribal police departments; 
l. Conduct 
first-order analysis on 
all 
incoming 
intelligence, 
and fuse all applicable incoming intelligence 
with current intelligence holdings in preparation for 
briefings; 


m. Prepare all required intelligence reports and plans; 
n. As the incident dictates, determine need to implant 
Intelligence Specialists in the Planning and Operations 
Sections; and 
o. Maintain Unit/Activity Log (ICS 214 form).

CHAPTER 16 
NATURAL DISASTERS 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) response 
to a natural disaster is, at its core, a hazardous substances 
response. As such it should be responded to under the National 
Response System (NRS), using the guidance provided 
in Chapter 14 – Hazardous Substances Response. In the 
context of a response to a natural disaster, however, EPA’s 
activities will likely be conducted under Emergency Support 
Function (ESF) #10–Oil and Hazardous Materials Response 
Annex of the National Response Framework (NRF). EPA 
encourages On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs) to familiarize 
themselves with ESF #10 and the NRF as a whole. 
Within the context of an ESF #10 response, there are two 
major types of 
response 
organizations that 
may be 
established 
for the 
response. 
In 
the 
first 
type 
of 
response 
structure, 
EPA’s hazardous substances response is integrated 
into the overall incident response; 

this instance is essentially similar to the multiagency response 
structure provided in Chapter 14, and further detailed 
in Figure 14-3. 

The second response structure conducts ESF #10 activities 
(e.g., 
collection 
of 
orphan 
drums following 
a 
flood) independent 
of other response ESF missions. In such a case, the 

Chapter 16. NATURAL DISASTERS 262 


JANUARY 2016 

EPA-led response to a complex incident (depicted in Figure 
14-2) is most applicable, in partnership with command and 

operational 
response 
assets of 
the 
affected 
state 
jurisdiction. 


Natural 
disasters such 
as flooding 
or earthquakes are 
challenging 
to EPA’s response capabilities in that they often impact 
large geographical areas, potentially involving large residential/
commercial centers. Any organizational structure that 
is adopted will have to be expanded, usually within the Operations 
Section, to allow for both full coverage over a large 
area and coverage of potential Mission Assignments (MA) 
involving the continuing protection of citizens and the environment. 


This can be seen in the accompanying organization chart 
(Figure 16-1: Natural Disaster Response) where additional 
Branches and/or Divisions are created to account for the 

geographical 
spread, 
and 
provide 
for the 
specific tasking 
of 


the ESF #10 mission or sub-tasking from other ESFs, such 
as search and rescue operations, white goods collection, 
and household hazardous waste pickup. In addition, it is cer


tainly common 
for a 
natural 
disaster to 
cross jurisdictional 


and political boundaries, in which case the creation of separate 
Branches, Divisions, and/or Groups may be prudent. 

Depending upon the complexity, mission scope, geography, 
and other considerations associated with the disaster response, 
it may also be appropriate that an Area Command 
(AC) be established. In addition to the conventional role of 

Chapter 16. NATURAL DISASTERS 

263 


JANUARY 2016 

the AC (establish priorities, broker critical resources, etc. 
among multiple incident command structures), an AC may 
also absorb non-tactical “overhead” responsibilities to support 
the 
field, 
such 
as assistance 
with 
check-in, 
resource 
ordering, 
timekeeping, and travel support. 

NCP SPECIAL TEAMS AND OTHER ASSETS 

The phone numbers for the most commonly used National 
Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan

typically 
report to the Emergency Response Branch within the Operations 
Section. While these Groups are initially tasked with 
reconnaissance, their recon can potentially lead to emergency 
response activities and as such, members of these teams 
must have the prerequisite training and possess the appropriate 
personal protective equipment (PPE) and monitoring 
equipment. Activities may include: 

a. Review Division/Group Supervisor Responsibilities 
(page 8-11);

work has been conducted, approximate 
quantities and descriptions of hazardous waste 
removed, and any interaction with private property/ 
homeowners or state/local 
officials; 
and 


h. Maintain Unit/Activity Log (ICS 214 form). 
DEBRIS COLLECTION TEAM/TASK FORCE – This Team/ 
Task Force, led by a Team Leader or Task Force Leader, 
typically reports to a Division or Group Supervisor within a 

Chapter 16. NATURAL DISASTERS 

269 


JANUARY 2016 

Branch of the Operations Section. The Team/Task Force retrieves 
hazardous debris, drums, cylinders, totes, and larger 
containers from impacted areas. They may also be tasked 
with air or product monitoring/sampling prior to movement 

and 
offloading 
the 
product 
into 
transportable 
containers. 
The 
Team/Task Force 
per the 
specific IAP 
may also 
transport 
the 


containers to a pre-determined Staging Area. Additional activities 
may include: 

a. Review Strike Team/Task Force Leader Responsibilities 
(page 8-12);

in small containers in a home or small business setting. 
Examples of household hazardous waste (HHW) include: 
bleach, car batteries, barbeque-sized propane cylinders, 
pesticides/herbicides, some paints, degreasers, and solvents. 
This Team/Task Force may also transport these items 
to a pre-determined Staging Area. Since entering homes after 
they have been impacted by a natural disaster may have 
serious safety implications due to the lack of structural integrity, 
much of the retrieval of HHW may be conducted from 
the curbside after items have been moved there by homeowners 
or contractors. Additional activities may include: 

a. Review Strike Team/Task Force Leader Responsibilities 
(page 8-12); 
b. Assist in developing plans for the collection and 
transportation of HHW; 
c. Communicate and coordinate activities with the site 
safety officer,

CHAPTER 17 
INLAND OIL SPILLS 

The Inland Oil Spills Chapter of the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) Incident Management Handbook (IMH) 
is intended to be consistent with the U.S. Coast Guard’s 
(USCG) IMH. This chapter has been developed from the perspective 
of EPA responding to an oil spill occurring in the in


land 
zone 
and/or in 
EPA’s response 
jurisdiction. 


This chapter is designed to provide the organizational structure 
that will provide supervision and control for the essential 
functions required at inland oil spill incidents. The organizational 
structure will have much in common with the structure 
used for managing a hazardous substances response. As 
applicable, consult Chapter 14 – Hazardous Substances Response, 
regarding relevant aspects of those organizational 
structures. Only the organization and task descriptions that 
are pertinent to oil spill Incident Command System (ICS) positions, 
functions, and tasks are presented in this chapter. 

For a 
full 
description 
of 
a 
specific ICS position 
assignment 


or task, refer to the appropriate task assignment provided in 
Chapters 7 through 11 of this IMH. 

The 
typical 
incident 
objectives for an 
oil 
spill 
response 
are: 


 Ensure the safety of citizens and response personnel; 

Chapter 17. INLAND OIL SPILLS 

272 


JANUARY 2016 

 Control the source of the spill; 

 Manage a coordinated response effort; 

 Maximize protection of environmentally sensitive areas 
including wildlife and historic properties; 

 Contain and recover spilled material; 

 Recover and 
rehabilitate 
injured 
wildlife; 


 Remove oil from impacted areas; 

 Minimize economic impacts; 

 Keep stakeholders informed of response activities; and 

 Keep the public informed of response activities. 

Two scenarios are presented in this chapter, presenting 
unique 
concerns for incident 
management. 
The 
first 
scenario, 
with an ICS organization chart depicted in Figure 17-1: 
Non-Geographically Divided (Localized), involves an EPA-
led response to an inland oil spill that impacts areas in close 
proximity (for example, a release from a facility that impacts 
a localized area along a single shore of a navigable waterway). 
The second, with an ICS organization chart depicted 
in Figure 17-2: Geographically Dispersed Inland Oil Spill, 
involves an EPA-led response to an inland oil spill that involves 
locations which are geographically separate (for example, 
a pipeline break or vessel rupture in which oil impacts 
both shores of a wide river, with no bridge located nearby). 
It should be noted that there is no one “correct” approach to 

Chapter 17. INLAND OIL SPILLS 273 


JANUARY 2016 

managing either type of incident; in the latter case especially, 
a number of approaches are available for dealing with what 

could 
be 
a 
major incident 
including 
dividing 
the 
incident 
into 


two or more incidents, expanding the ICS planning capacity 
for the incident, or expanding the ICS organization to accommodate 
a second Operations or Logistics Section. For the 
purposes of this IMH, however, the organizational structure 
presented depicts a fairly straightforward response in which 
the Operations Section is divided and the Staging Areas are 
developed along the lines of the geographic division of the 
river.

UNIFIED COMMAND (UC) – WHENEVER POSSIBLE AND 
PRACTICAL, AN OIL SPILL RESPONSE SHOULD BE ORGANIZED 
UNDER A UC STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES, 
BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO: 

 The lead On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) 

 The state/tribal On-Scene Incident Commander (IC) 

 The representative of the Responsible Party (RP) IC 

 Appropriate local authorities 

The UC is responsible for the overall management of the incident; 
however, regulatory authority cannot be delegated or 
shared with other agencies. The UC oversees the incident 
activities, including the development and implementation of 
strategic decisions, and approves the ordering and releasing 
of resources. The UC may assign a Deputy IC to assist 

in 
carrying 
out 
IC 
responsibilities. 
Tasks specific to 
oil 
spill

SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT COORDINATOR (SSC) – The SSC 

is a 
technical 
specialist 
and 
is defined 
in 
the 
National 
Oil 
and 


Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) 

Chapter 17. INLAND OIL SPILLS 

278 


JANUARY 2016 

as the 
principal 
advisor to 
the 
OSC 
for scientific issues. 
The 
SSC 
provides expertise 
on 
chemical 
hazards, 
field 
observations, 
trajectory analysis, 
resources at 
risk, 
environmental 


tradeoffs of countermeasures and cleanup methods, and information 
management. The SSC is also charged with gain


ing 
consensus on 
scientific issues affecting 
the 
response, 
and 
ensuring 
that 
differing 
opinions within 
the 
scientific community 
are communicated to the incident command. Additionally, 
the SSC provides data on weather, tides, currents, 
and other applicable environmental conditions. The SSC 
may serve as the Environmental Unit Leader (ENVL). Tasks 

specific to 
the 
SSC 
include: 


a. Review SSC Responsibilities (page 7-13); 
b. Attend Planning Meetings;

NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT (NRDA) 
REPRESENTATIVE – The NRDA Representatives are re-

Chapter 17. INLAND OIL SPILLS 

279 


JANUARY 2016 

sponsible for coordinating NRDA needs and activities of the 
trustee team. NRDA activities generally do not occur within 
the structure, processes, and control of the ICS. However, 
particularly in the early phases of a spill response, many 
NRDA activities overlap with the environmental assessment 
performed for spill response. Therefore, NRDA Representatives 
should remain coordinated with the spill response or


ganization 
through 
the 
Liaison 
Officer (LNO), 
and 
they may 

need to work directly with the UC, Planning Section, Operations 
Section, and the SSC to resolve any problems or address 
areas of overlap. This includes close coordination with 
the 
LNO 
for obtaining 
timely information 
on 
the 
spill 
and 
injuries 
to natural resources. 

While NRDA resource requirements and costs may fall outside 
the responsibility of the Logistics and Finance/Administration 
Sections, coordination is important. The NRDA 

Representative 
will 
coordinate 
NRDAor injury determination 
activities. 
Tasks specific to 
the 
NRDARepresentative 
include: 


a. Review Agency Representative Responsibilities 
(page 7-8);

CHAPTER 18 

RADIOLOGICAL/NUCLEAR INCIDENTS 

INTRODUCTION 

A radiological or nuclear incident is inherently a hazardous 
substance incident. As such it should be responded to under 
the National Response System (NRS). This chapter discusses 
only those organizational and task descriptions pertinent 
to radiological/nuclear incident functions, tasks, and positions 
within an Incident Command System (ICS) structure. 
As applicable, consult Chapter 14 – Hazardous Substances 
Response and Chapter 20 – Chemical Agent Incidents of this 
Incident Management Handbook (IMH) regarding the establishment 
and use of ICS in hazardous substances incidents 
and chemical agent incidents. 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) response personnel 
should review the National Response Framework 
(NRF) Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex (NRIA) and the 
latest version of the EPA Radiological Emergency Response 
Plan for further details regarding these issues. In addition, 
EPA’s On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) Radiological Response 
Guidelines provides additional information about responding 
to radiological emergencies. Responders should also refer 
to the “PAG Manual: Protective Action Guides and Planning 
Guidance for Radiological Incidents” (2013), which can 
Chapter 18. RADIOLOGICAL/NUCLEAR INCIDENTS 

300 


JANUARY 2016 

be found at http://www2.epa.gov/radiation/protective-action-
guides-pags or its latest version. Operational information 
can be found in the 2015 Interim Draft EPA “National Tactical 
Radioactive Response Guide” developed by the Chemical, 
Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Consequence Management 
Advisory Team (CBRN CMAT). 

Exposure rates and total dose limits can be found in the 
EPA Memorandum, dated December 07, 2006, on Turnback 
Guidance for EPA Personnel Responding to Radiological 
Emergencies. 

In 
addition 
to 
the 
objectives established 
in 
Chapter 2 
of 
this 

IMH, a radiological incident response typically includes the 

following 
incident 
objectives: 


 Provide Protective Action Recommendations to state 
and local decision makers; 

 Implement radiation protection principles, including 
maintaining exposures as low as reasonably achievable 
(ALARA); 

 Provide support on radiation instrumentation, measurements, 
sampling, and analysis; 

 Provide experts on radiation control and health effects to 
support decision makers; and 

 Support cleanup decision making processes.

RADIOLOGICAL INCIDENT RESPONSE ORGANIZATIONS 


EPA personnel responding to a radiological/nuclear incident 
should be acutely aware of the unique nature of the Federal 
Government’s response mechanism for these types of incidents. 


It is FEMA’s policy to use the National Response Framework 
(NRF) structures to coordinate all Federal assistance to state 

and 
local 
governments for nationally significant 
incidents. 


The NRF includes a Terrorism Incident Law Enforcement 
and Investigation Annex, which in part describes potential 
EPA involvement in the Federal law enforcement and investigative 
response phase of an incident. In a terrorist threat or 
incident that may involve a chemical, biological, radiological, 
nuclear, or high-yield explosive (CBRNE) material, the traditional 
FBI command post will transition into a Joint Operations 
Center (JOC). The JOC is an interagency command 
and control center. EPA may be asked to provide a representative 
to the JOC. 

At the scene of a potential or actual terrorist incident, the FBI 
retains authority for criminal enforcement. EPA response personnel 
will likely have to work with the FBI to obtain access 
to a controlled site. EPA Incident Commanders (ICs) may 

wish 
to 
establish 
an 
Intelligence/Investigations Officer (IIO) 

Chapter 18. RADIOLOGICAL/NUCLEAR INCIDENTS 

302 


JANUARY 2016 

position, in Command Staff, to facilitate this process. 

The operations of the interagency Federal Radiological Monitoring 
and Assessment Center (FRMAC) in a radiological/ 

nuclear response 
represent 
a 
radiation-specific addition 
to 


typical NRS responses. A FRMAC is established in response 
to a request from a Coordinating Agency or state when there 
is a suspected or actual radiological or nuclear nationally sig


nificant 
incident. 


The FRMAC provides monitoring and assessment outside 
any law enforcement-controlled area or facility boundary. 
The 
FRMAC 
is responsible 
for the 
following 
incident 
objectives: 


a. Coordinate Federal radiological monitoring and assessment 
activities; 
b. Maintain liaisons with state, local, and other Federal 
agencies; 
c. Maintain radiological monitoring data; 
d. Provide monitoring data and radiological assessments, 
including 
dose 
projections and 
exposure 
rate 


contours; and 

e. Obtain technical assistance from other Federal, 
state, and private entities. 
RESPONSE WITHOUT THE FRMAC 

Chapter 18. RADIOLOGICAL/NUCLEAR INCIDENTS

JANUARY 2016 

Figure 18-1: ICS With No FRMAC and EPA as Coordinating 
or Lead Agency shows a radiological incident response 
structure that does not use the FRMAC (e.g., in a strictly National 
Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency 
Plan (NCP) response). The Radiological Operations Branch 
performs five 
functions: 
1) monitoring 
the 
site 
for radioactivity; 
2) radioactive waste management; 3) exclusion zone 
entry control; 4) infrastructure decontamination; and 5) laboratory 
support. The Monitoring Group performs real-time 
surveys and sampling of soil, water, air, and biota. The Laboratory 
Group includes onsite and/or offsite laboratories depending 
upon responder needs and may also include the 
use of data collected by EPA’s Airborne Spectral Photometric 
Environmental Collection Technology (ASPECT) aircraft 
or ground-based system known as ASPECT ASPHALT. The 
Infrastructure Decontamination Group handles decontamination 
of equipment and vehicles (not people). The Radioactive 
Waste Management Group ensures the safe handling and 
disposal of all radioactive waste generated from the incident. 
It also ensures that disposal complies with Federal and local 
laws. The Exclusion Zone Entry Control Group is responsible 
for the overall entry operations of assigned personnel within 
the Exclusion Zone Entry Control Group. The Health and 
Safety Implementation Branch carries out the necessary activities 
to ensure the health and safety of operations personnel. 


Figure 18-1 also depicts the use of an Environmental Unit 

Chapter 18. RADIOLOGICAL/NUCLEAR INCIDENTS 

304

within the Planning Section. Within the Environmental Unit, 
the Health/Environmental Assessment Team analyzes environmental 
data. This Team performs dose assessments and 
predictions and includes health physicists, fate and transport 
modelers, risk assessors, and other technical specialists. 
The Response and Cleanup Technology Team plans the radiation 
protection strategy during the emergency phases of 
the incident and the cleanup actions during recovery. The 
Quality Assurance 
Team identifies the 
Data 
Quality Objectives 
(DQO), 
writes the 
Quality Assurance 
Project 
Plans 

(QAPPs), and functions as an auditing group. The Data Management 
Team handles the large amount of measurement 
data and provides data output in tabular, graphic, and geographic 
information systems (GIS) formats. For less resource 
intensive responses, the Monitoring Group within the Operations 
Section could also perform Data Quality Assurance 

(QA) functions for field 
data 
management.

JANUARY 2016 

RESPONSE WITH THE FRMAC 

When a FRMAC is established and regardless of which department/
agency is the Coordinating Agency or lead agency, 
the 
Department 
of 
Energy (DOE) provides significant 
resources 
to establish the FRMAC as well as staff to manage it 
initially, during the emergency phase. When DOE response 
assets first 
arrive 
at 
the 
site, 
they will 
hold 
anAdvance 
Party 
meeting 
with 
key decision 
makers, 
and 
first 
responders, 
to determine how the FRMAC will be integrated into the response 
management structure. During this meeting, these 
initial DOE response assets (which will become part of the 
FRMAC once it is established) will work with the Coordinating 
Agency and the state(s) to determine their requirements, 

define 
the 
appropriate 
level 
and 
composition 
of 
the 
FRMAC 


response, and locate a suitable site to conduct operations. It 
is critical that, in an EPA-led response, EPA participate in this 
meeting to discuss how the FRMAC will integrate into the response 
management structure. Responders should work to 
ensure that open lines of communication are developed and 
that radiological data are accessible to the FRMAC and all 
response personnel. 

Under the NRF, all Federal, state, and local radiological monitoring 
assets are expected to coordinate radiological monitoring 
activities through and provide radiological monitoring 
data to the FRMAC. During the emergency response phase, 
DOE has indicated that the FRMAC will integrate into the In-

Chapter 18. RADIOLOGICAL/NUCLEAR INCIDENTS 

307 


JANUARY 2016 

cident Management Team (IMT) established at the incident. 
Once a series of conditions listed in the NRF/NRIA have 
been met, DOE will transfer control of the FRMAC to EPA to 
continue long-term monitoring activities. DOE and other Federal 
agencies will continue to provide resources. Figure 18-2: 
Potential EPA/FRMAC Organization Chart shows a potential 
ICS structure during the post-emergency phase, once EPA 
has assumed leadership of the FRMAC. It is anticipated that 
DOE and EPA RERT and CBRN CMAT members will staff 
FRMAC management positions, while other Federal, state, 
and local monitoring, sampling, and assessment efforts integrate 
into the staff positions. 

The FRMAC’s mission does not include incident management, 
radioactive waste management, or non-FRMAC worker 
radiation safety, so separate ICS Branches, Groups, etc., 
must be established to handle these activities. 

Additionally, EPA has a policy to immediately release validated 
data to the public after ensuring proper quality assurance 
and quality control procedures. EPA is known for its transparency 
and will continue to follow this process. The FRMAC 
data review process may not be as timely, and, therefore, 
EPA would release data on its own as needed.

CHAPTER 19 
BIOLOGICAL INCIDENTS 

As applicable, consult Chapter 14 – Hazardous Substances 
Response and Chapter 20 – Chemical Warfare Agent Incidents 
of this Incident Management Handbook (IMH) regarding 
establishment and use of ICS. 

A biological incident will likely be responded to under the National 
Response System (NRS). Only the organization and 
task descriptions pertinent to biological Incident Command 
System (ICS) positions, functions, and tasks are discussed 
in this chapter. 

Abiological 
agent 
is not 
a 
hazardous substance 
as defined 


by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation 
and Liability Act (CERCLA), but may be a “pollutant 
or contaminant.” CERCLA provides authority for EPA to respond 
to “a release or substantial threat of release… of any 
pollutant or contaminant which may present an imminent and 
substantial danger to public health or welfare…” Under CERCLA 
the term “pollutants or contaminants” encompasses 

just 
about 
anything. 
By definition, 
such 
substances include 


compounds that upon exposure “will or may reasonably be 

anticipated 
to 
cause” certain 
specified 
harmful 
health 
effects. 


While EPA can respond to and clean up a site polluted by 
either a hazardous substance or a pollutant or contaminant, 

Chapter 19. BIOLOGICAL INCIDENTS 

334 


JANUARY 2016 

the statute does not authorize EPA to recover its cleanup 
costs from private parties or to issue an order directing the 
parties to perform a cleanup when the substance involved is 
only a pollutant or contaminant. In addition, many releases 
of pollutants or contaminants do not meet the requirement 
that there be an “imminent and substantial danger,” which is 
a higher threshold than that for hazardous substances. Although, 
authorities exist under CERCLA to respond, the response 
will likely be conducted with the interagency structure 
under the Stafford Act. 

EPA can also respond under the National Response Framework 
(NRF), as the lead for the response under ESF #10 and 
the Biological Incident Annex. 

Federal On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs) are encouraged to 
consult the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear 
Consequence Management Advisory Team (CBRN CMAT), 
prior to responding to a biological incident for the latest tech


nical, 
scientific, 
and 
operational 
information. 


EPA personnel responding to a biological terrorism incident 
should be acutely aware of the unique nature of the Federal 
Government’s response mechanism for these types of incidents. 


The NRF includes a Terrorism Incident Law Enforcement

335

and Investigation Annex, which in part describes potential 
EPA involvement in the Federal law enforcement and investigative 
response phase of an incident. In a terrorist threat or 
incident that may involve a chemical, biological, radiological, 
nuclear, or high-yield explosive (CBRNE) material, the traditional 
FBI command post will transition into a Joint Operations 
Center (JOC). The JOC is an interagency command 
and control center. EPA may be asked to provide a representative 
to the JOC. 

At the scene of a potential or actual terrorist incident, the FBI 
retains authority for criminal enforcement. EPA response personnel 
will likely have to work with the FBI to obtain access 
to a controlled site. EPA Incident Commanders (ICs) may 

wish 
to 
establish 
an 
Intelligence/Investigations Officer (IIO) 

position, in Command Staff, to facilitate this process. 

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is 
designated the Primary Agency for Emergency Support 
Function (ESF) #8 – Public Health and Medical Services Annex 
and serves as the Federal Government’s lead agency 
for the public health and medical preparation and planning 
for and response to a biological terrorism attack or naturally 
occurring outbreak that results from either a known or novel 
pathogen, including an emerging infectious disease. If animal 
issues are involved, ESF #11 may be activated (refer to 
Chapter 21 – Animal Emergency Response). For both ESF 
#8 and ESF #11, EPA is a supporting agency.

ICS ORGANIZATION 

The ICS organization charts presented in this chapter highlight 
key functional positions/units that may be established 
for a biological response. These charts depict examples of 
organizational structures that can be utilized in a potential biological 
response. Figure 19-1: Initial Response Phase/Crisis 
Management Phase shows an organization chart for a Uni


fied 
Command 
(UC) during 
an 
emergency response 
phase, 


while Figure 19-2: Consequence Management Phase shows 
a UC during the cleanup phase of a biological incident.

These organizational charts depict examples of hypothetical 
ICS organizations developed for different phases of a biological 
incident response scenario. 

Initially, EPA will need to establish an Environmental Unit 
under the Planning Section. In this type of incident, the Environmental 
Unit is responsible for planning and strategy (e.g., 
site characterization strategies, sampling and analysis plan, 
quality assurance, laboratory networking, facility decontamination 
plan, containment/barrier strategies, decontamination 
options, 
decontamination 
verification 
methods, 
environmental 
clearance, re-occupancy plans), and coordination with 
Headquarters (HQ) Environmental Unit. The Environmental 
Unit may also establish Technical Working Groups (TWGs) 
as needed to support operations. As the response moves 
into consequence management, EPA will establish an Environmental 
Branch in the Operations Section to carry out 
environmental characterization and restoration activities including 
decontamination of buildings, semi-enclosed structures, 
outdoor areas, and sensitive items. The Environmental 
Branch is responsible for environmental sampling, air monitoring, 
waste management/disposal and decontamination 
methods inside and outside the hot zone.

of the ERLN. 

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 
Specialized Response Teams (SRTs) – To enhance their 
response capabilities for incidents involving chemical, biological, 
and radiological emergencies, as well as structural 
collapses, OSHA created four Specialized Response Teams 
(SRTs) to support the IC/UC in the areas of responder safety 
and health: 1) the chemical team (e.g., toxic industrial chemicals 
and materials, and chemical warfare agents), 2) the biological 
team, 3) the radiological team, and 4) the structural 
collapse team. OSHA’s Health Response Team coordinates 
the SRTs. The SRTs consist of seven to eight experts that 

Chapter 19. BIOLOGICAL INCIDENTS

CHAPTER 20 
CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENT INCIDENTS 

Chemical warfare agent releases will result in a response 
under the National Response System (NRS). As applicable, 
consult Chapter 14 – Hazardous Substances Response, 
Chapter 18 – Radiological/Nuclear Incidents, and Chapter 
19 – Biological Incidents of this Incident Management Handbook 
(IMH) regarding establishment and use of the Incident 
Command System (ICS) when a chemical warfare agent release 
occurs. 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) personnel responding 
to an incident where a chemical agent is involved 
should be acutely aware of the unique nature of the Federal 
Government’s response mechanism for these types of incidents. 
It is the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) 
policy to use the National Response Framework (NRF) structures 
to coordinate all Federal assistance to state and local 

governments for nationally significant 
incidents. 
The 
NRF 


includes a Terrorism Incident Law Enforcement and Investigation 
Annex, which in part describes potential EPA involvement 
in the Federal law enforcement and investigative response 
phase of an incident. In a terrorist threat or incident 
that may involve a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, 

Chapter 20. CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENT INCIDENTS 

353 


JANUARY 2016 

or high-yield explosive (CBRNE) material, the traditional FBI 
command post will transition into a Joint Operations Center 
(JOC). The JOC is an interagency command and control 
center. EPA may be asked to provide a representative to the 
JOC. 

The FBI, along with all other Federal departments and agencies, 
has been directed to adopt the National Incident Management 
System (NIMS). At the scene of a potential or actual 
terrorist incident, the FBI retains authority for criminal 
enforcement. EPA response personnel will likely work with 
the FBI to obtain access to a controlled site. Regardless of 
how the FBI establishes a command structure, EPA ICs will 
likely carry out their response operations using a standard 
hazardous substances ICS structure. EPA Incident Commanders 
(ICs) working with the FBI may wish to establish an 

Intelligence/Investigations Officer (IIO) position, 
in 
Command 


Staff, to facilitate this process. 

ICS ORGANIZATION CHARTS FOR CHEMICAL WARFARE 
AGENT SCENARIO 

The ICS organization charts presented in this chapter highlight 
key functional positions/units that may be established 
for a chemical agent response. These charts depict examples 
of hypothetical ICS organizations developed for two 
phases of a chemical agent response scenario at a facility. 

They include 
ICS organizations for a 
Unified 
Command 
(UC) 

during the initial response phase and a UC during the clean-

Chapter 20. CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENT INCIDENTS 

354 


JANUARY 2016 

up/restoration phase. In the initial response phase, the local 

fire 
and 
hazardous substance/material 
(hazmat) personnel, 


police, and health departments respond to the emergency 
and are responsible for establishing an ICS or UC structure 
to manage on-scene resources, conduct life safety operations 
(e.g., victim evacuation, rescue, decontamination, medical 
treatment), conduct chemical warfare agent, biological 

agent 
or radiological 
identification, 
and 
initiate 
the 
criminal 


investigation and evidence collection activities. During this 
phase, three Groups (Hazmat, Law Enforcement, and Mass 
Casualty) may be established in the Operations Section. In 
the cleanup/restoration (consequence management) phase, 
four Branches (Hazmat, Environmental, Law Enforcement, 
and Medical) may be established in the Operations Section 
to increase management span-of-control of additional 
functions. The Hazmat Branch continues to manage the hot 
zone, contamination reduction zone, decontamination line, 
rest and shelter areas, entry and egress points, care and 
maintenance of monitoring equipment, immediate support 
functions, health and safety, and security. In addition, the 

Hazmat 
Branch 
assists entry teams in 
donning 
and 
doffing 


PPE, and performs medical monitoring of personnel in the 
hot zone. 

Upon arrival onsite, EPA establishes an Environmental 
Branch in the Operations Section to carry out environmental 
characterization and restoration activities including decontamination 
of buildings, semi-enclosed structures, outdoor 
areas, and sensitive items. The Environmental Branch is re-

Chapter 20. CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENT INCIDENTS 

355 


JANUARY 2016 

sponsible for environmental sampling, air monitoring, waste 
management/disposal, and decontamination methods inside 
and outside the hot zone. EPA establishes an Environmental 
Unit in the Planning Section. The Environmental Unit is 
responsible for planning and strategy (e.g., site characterization 
strategies, sampling and analysis plan, quality assurance, 
laboratory networking, facility decontamination plan, 
containment/barrier strategies, decontamination options, 
decontamination 
verification 
methods, 
environmental 
clearance, 
re-occupancy plans), and will coordinate with Head


quarters (HQ) Environmental 
Unit 
for a 
Nationally Significant 


Incident. The Environmental Unit may also establish Technical 
Working Groups (TWGs) as needed to support operations. 
The Environmental Unit maintains very close liaison 
with the Operations Section in the development of tactical 
plans and 
coordinates with 
the 
Scientific Support 
Coordinator 
(SSC) in Command Staff. The Operations Section has 
overall responsibility for developing and implementing tac


tical 
operations designed 
to 
achieve 
the 
incident 
objectives 

established by the UC. An Environmental Clearance Committee 
(ECC) may be established to serve as an indepen


dent 
body of 
subject 
matter experts (SMEs) that 
may include 


representatives from other Federal agencies, state/local of


ficials, 
industry, 
academia, 
and 
building 
owners/operators. 


The ECC provides recommendations to the IC/UC on whether 
or not sampling data supports achievement of site clearance 
goals.

CHAPTER 21 
ANIMAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE 

Animal emergency response issues may be addressed utilizing 
the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and 
National Response Framework (NRF). U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) plays a lead role in responding to 
hazardous substance/material (hazmat) spills in residential 
or agricultural settings under Emergency Support Function 
(ESF) #10. EPA plays a support role in responding to decontamination 
and disposal issues associated with a Foreign Animal 
Disease (FAD) outbreak (ESF #11) or avian/pandemic 

flu 
(ESF 
#8). 
Utilizing 
the 
Incident 
Command 
System (ICS), 


these issues may be addressed within the Environmental 
Unit of the Planning Section or within the Cleaning and Disinfection 
Group, Decontamination Group, or Waste Management 
Group of the Operations Section. A Veterinary Hazmat 
Unit may be utilized in the Operations Section for activities 
within the hot zone. Awareness of these issues at the beginning 
of a response is important in establishing an ICS structure 
where they will be properly addressed and logistically 
integrated with other response activities. 

The animal health community may not understand the authority 
of emergency response managers, such as Federal 
On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs). In addition, EPA emergency 
responders may overlook or underestimate the size and 
complexity of animal care industries and their relevance to 

Chapter 21. ANIMAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE 366 


JANUARY 2016 

communities. It is essential for the animal/agricultural and 
emergency management communities to work together to 
deal with animal and public health emergencies. Whether 
responding in a lead or support role to an incident that is 
accidental 
or purposeful, 
responders will 
benefit 
from understanding 
the importance of animal emergency response 
issues and the resources available to address them. Responders 
have the capacity to play an important role in uniting 
the traditional animal health community with the emergency 
response community. 

In 
the 
last 
five 
years, 
infectious diseases such 
as West 
Nile 
Virus, 
porcine 
epidemic diarrhea, 
novel 
influenza 
viruses, 


and monkeypox have appeared in North America, and severe 
acute respiratory syndrome, Burkholderia pseudomallei, 

Schmallenberg 
virus, 
and 
avian 
influenza 
have 
emerged 
on 


a global scale. 

Strikingly, 75% of emerging infectious diseases have been 

identified 
as zoonotic (transmissible 
between 
species) in 


origin. These trends underscore the importance of animal 
health in protection of human health and the environment. 

This chapter summarizes animal emergency response is


sues for responders, 
identifies opportunities within 
ICS for 

addressing these issues, and provides contact information 
for the Emergency Response “tool kit.” 

Chapter 21. ANIMAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE 

367 


JANUARY 2016 

EPA’s role in animal emergency response varies. Primarily 
EPA will be responding to releases of hazardous materials. 
The animal emergency response issues that arise vary depending 
upon the type of contaminant and the location of the 
release. Resources required to address animal issues may 
be minimal but the impact may be substantial. In fact, a com


munity may well 
judge 
the 
entire 
response 
by how 
well 
their 

animal issues were addressed. 

In the urban setting, pets may be considered family members 
and residents may refuse evacuation without them. 
Temporary animal shelters may be required during an evacuation, 
provisions may be necessary for pets isolated in a 
hot zone, and animal retrieval from the hot zone may be required. 
Another consideration is stray animal populations, 
which may interfere with response operations. Pets may 
carry contamination to handlers, owners, or responders. 
Pets may require decontamination to be safely handled and 
removed from the site. Pets may exhibit toxicological signs/ 
symptoms of exposure to a contaminant and require treatment. 
In some cases, animals may be sentinels of disease. 
For example, dancing cat disease diagnosed by veterinarians 
in 
Minamata, 
Japan 
was the 
first 
warning 
of 
mercury toxicity 
in the human population. Another sensitive and important 
consideration is the diagnosis and disposal of animals 
that may have been killed by exposure to the contaminant. 

Chapter 21. ANIMAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE 

368 


JANUARY 2016 

An agricultural or rural setting presents additional animal issues. 
Livestock contamination may cause adverse impacts 
to animal health, resulting in decreased productivity and prof


it, 
or human 
health, 
resulting 
in 
disease 
or loss of 
confidence 


in the food supply. Livestock or wildlife may be contaminated 
or destroyed and require appropriate decontamination 
and disposal. A thorough evaluation of contaminant fate and 
transport both within animals and the environment is necessary 
to assess risk. 

In addition to releases of hazardous materials, EPA may be 
asked to provide a response support role in other types of 
emergencies. In responding to biological, radiological, or 
chemical weapons release, decontamination and disposal 
may include wildlife, livestock, service (search and rescue 
canines), or companion animals. Safe and effective decontamination 
agents and systems may be required. The collection, 
sampling, and disposal of runoff water may be necessary. 
Lastly, disposal capacity for large numbers of animal 
carcasses and the technologies available may greatly impact 
the cost of the response and resulting environmental impacts.
