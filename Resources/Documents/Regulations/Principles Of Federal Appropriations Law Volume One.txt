Foreword 

We are pleased to present the third edition of Volume I of Principles of 
Federal Appropriations Law, commonly known as the “Red Book.” Our 
objective in this publication is to present a basic reference work covering 
those areas of law in which the Comptroller General renders decisions. 
This volume and all other volumes of Principles are available on GAO’s 
Web site (www.gao.gov) under “GAO Legal Products.” 

Our approach in Principles is to lay a foundation with text discussion, 
using specific legal authorities to illustrate the principles discussed, their 
application, and exceptions. These authorities include GAO decisions and 
opinions, judicial decisions, statutory provisions, and other relevant 
sources. We would encourage users to start with at least a brief review of 
Chapter 1, which provides a general framework and context for all that 
follows. Chapter 1 includes a note regarding citations to GAO case law and 
other relevant GAO material and an explanation of those other materials. 

We have tried to be simultaneously basic and detailed—basic so that the 
publication will be useful as a “teaching manual” and guide for the novice 
or occasional user (lawyer and nonlawyer alike) and detailed so that it will 
assist those who require a more in-depth understanding. The purpose of 
Principles is to describe existing authorities; it should not be regarded as 
an independent source of legal authority. The material in this publication is, 
of course, subject to changes in statute or federal and Comptroller General 
case law. Also, it is manifestly impossible to cover in this publication every 
aspect and nuance of federal appropriations law. We have not attempted to 
include all relevant decisions, and we admit (albeit grudgingly) that errors 
and omissions probably are inevitable. Principles should therefore be used 
as a general guide and starting point, not as a substitute for original legal 
research. 

It is also important to emphasize that we have focused our attention on 
issues and principles of governmentwide application. In various instances, 
agency-specific legislation may provide authority or restrictions somewhat 
different from the general rule. While we have noted many of these 
instances for purposes of illustration, a comprehensive cataloguing of such 
legislation is beyond the scope of this publication. Thus, failure to note 
agency-specific exceptions in a given context does not mean that they do 
not exist. 

As with the second edition of Principles, we are publishing the third 
edition in a loose-leaf format. However, it will also be available 
electronically at www.gao.gov. We plan four volumes with annual updates.

Foreword 

Annual updates will only be published electronically. Users should retain 
copies of their five volumes of the second edition until each volume is 
revised. We will not update Volume III of the second edition, which was last 
revised in November 1994. It deals with functions that were transferred to 
the executive branch by the General Accounting Office Act of 1996 (Public 
Law 104-316), including claims against the United States, debt collection, 
and payment of judgments against the United States. Future editions and 
updates of Principles will not include these subjects. 

Volume V, published in April 2002, is a comprehensive index and table of 
authorities covering the entire second edition of Principles. It will continue 
to apply to the second edition volumes until they are revised. As each 
volume of the third edition is issued, it will contain its own index. Once the 
third edition is complete, we will publish a new comprehensive index and 
table of authorities. 

The response to Principles has been both gratifying and encouraging since 
the first edition was published in 1982. We express our appreciation to the 
many persons in all branches of the federal government, as well as 
nonfederal readers, who have offered comments and suggestions. Our goal 
now, as it was in 1982, is to present a document that will serve as a helpful 
reference for a wide range of users. To that end, we again invite comments 
and suggestions for improvement. We thank our readers for their support 
and hope that this publication continues to serve their needs.

Introduction 

“[T]he protection of the public fisc is a matter that is of 
interest to every citizen…” 

Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U.S. 253, 262 (1986). 

A. Nature of 
Appropriations 
Law 
A federal agency is a creature of law and can function only to the extent 
authorized by law.1 The Supreme Court has expressed what is perhaps the 
quintessential axiom of “appropriations law” as follows: 

“The established rule is that the expenditure of public funds 
is proper only when authorized by Congress, not that public 
funds may be expended unless prohibited by Congress.” 

United States v. MacCollom, 426 U.S. 317, 321 (1976). See also B-288266, 
Jan. 27, 2003. Thus, the concept of “legal authority” is central to the 
spending of federal money. When we use the term “federal appropriations 
law” or “federal fiscal law,” we mean that body of law that governs the 
availability and use of federal funds. 

Federal funds are made available for obligation and expenditure by means 
of appropriation acts (or occasionally by other legislation) and the 
subsequent administrative actions that release appropriations to the 
spending agencies. The use or “availability” of appropriations once enacted 
and released (that is, the rules governing the purpose, amounts, manner, 
and timing of obligations and expenditures) is controlled by various 
authorities: the terms of the appropriation act itself; legislation, if any, 
authorizing the appropriation; the “organic” or “enabling” legislation, which 
prescribes a function or creates a program that the appropriation funds; 
general statutory provisions that allow or prohibit certain uses of 
appropriated funds; and general rules that have been developed largely 
through decisions of the Comptroller General and the courts. These 
sources, together with certain provisions of the Constitution of the United 
States, form the basis of “appropriations law”—an area where questions 
may arise in as many contexts as there are federal actions that involve 
spending money. 

1 See, e.g., Atlantic City Electric Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 295 F.3d 1, 
8 (D.C. Cir. 2002); B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

Although this publication incorporates some other relevant authorities, its 
primary focus is on the decisions and opinions of the “accounting officers 
of the government”—the Comptroller General of the United States and his 
predecessors.2 

B. The Congressional 
“Power of the 
Purse” 
The congressional “power of the purse” refers to the power of Congress to 
appropriate funds and to prescribe the conditions governing the use of 
those funds.3 The power derives from specific provisions of the 
Constitution of the United States. First, article I, section 8 empowers 
Congress to “pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and 
general Welfare of the United States,” and to— 

“make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for 
carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers [listed in 
art. I, § 8], and all other Powers vested by this Constitution 
in the Government of the United States, or in any 
Department or Officer thereof.” 

Next, the so-called Appropriations Clause, the first part of article I, 
section 9, clause 7, provides that— 

“No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in 
Consequence of Appropriations made by Law… .” 

2 Early decisions often referred to the “accounting officers of the government.” While this 
phrase has fallen into disuse, its purpose was to distinguish those matters within the 
jurisdiction of the Comptroller General and the General Accounting Office and their 
predecessors from those matters within the jurisdiction of the “law officers of the 
government”—the Attorney General and the Department of Justice. 

3 The phrase itself is well known, and there are an increasing number of articles describing 
and analyzing the substantive aspects of the power. See, e.g., Sen. Robert C. Byrd, The 
Control of the Purse and the Line Item Veto Act, 35 Harv. J. on Legis. 297 (1998); Col. 
Richard D. Rosen, Funding “Non-Traditional” Military Operations: The Alluring Myth of 
a Presidential Power of the Purse, 155 Mil. L. Rev. 1 (1998); Charles Tiefer, Controlling 
Federal Agencies by Claims on Their Appropriations? The Takings Bill and the Power of 
the Purse, 13 Yale J. on Reg. 501 (1996); Kate Stith, Congress’ Power of the Purse, 97 Yale L.J. 
1343 (1988).

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

The Appropriations Clause has been described as “the most important 
single curb in the Constitution on Presidential power.”4 It means that “no 
money can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by 
an act of Congress.” Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 
321 (1937). See also B-300192, Nov. 13, 2002. Regardless of the nature of the 
payment—salaries, payments promised under a contract, payments 
ordered by a court, whatever—a federal agency may not make a payment 
from the United States Treasury unless Congress has made the funds 
available. As the Supreme Court stated well over a century more than 
150 years ago: 

“However much money may be in the Treasury at any one 
time, not a dollar of it can be used in the payment of any 
thing not… previously sanctioned [by a congressional 
appropriation].” 

Reeside v. Walker, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 272, 291 (1850). This prescription 
remains as valid today as it was when it was written.5 In 1990, citing both 
Cincinnati Soap and Reeside, the Supreme Court reiterated that any 
exercise of power by a government agency “is limited by a valid reservation 
of congressional control over funds in the Treasury.” Office of Personnel 
Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 425, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 2472 (1990).6 

4 Edward S. Corwin, The Constitution and What It Means Today, 134 (14th ed. 1978). 

5 Cf., e.g., Flick v. Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 205 F.3d 386, 395 (9th Cir. 2000), 
quoting Reeside, supra. 

6 Numerous similar statements exist. See, e.g., Knote v. United States, 95 U.S. 149, 154 
(1877); Gowland v. Aetna, 143 F.3d 951, 955 (5th Cir. 1998); Hart’s Case, 16 Ct. Cl. 459, 484 
(1880), aff’d, Hart v. United States, 118 U.S. 62 (1886); Jamal v. Travelers Lloyds of Texas 
Insurance Co., 131 F. Supp. 2d 910, 919 (S.D. Tex. 2001); Doe v. Mathews, 420 F. Supp. 865, 
870–71 (D. N.J. 1976).

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

As these statements by the Supreme Court make clear, the congressional 
power of the purse reflects the fundamental proposition that a federal 
agency is dependent on Congress for its funding.7 At its most basic level, 
this means that it is up to Congress to decide whether or not to provide 
funds for a particular program or activity and to fix the level of that 
funding. 

In exercising its appropriations power, however, Congress is not limited to 
these elementary functions. It is also well established that Congress can, 
within constitutional limits, determine the terms and conditions under 
which an appropriation may be used. See, e.g., New York v. United States, 
505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992); Cincinnati Soap Co., 301 U.S. at 321; Oklahoma v. 
Schweiker, 655 F.2d 401, 406 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (citing numerous cases); 
Spaulding v. Douglas Aircraft Co., 60 F. Supp. 985, 988 (S.D. Cal. 1945), 
aff’d, 154 F.2d 419 (9th Cir. 1946). Thus, Congress can decree, either in the 
appropriation itself or by separate statutory provisions, what will be 
required to make the appropriation “legally available” for any expenditure. 
It can, for example, describe the purposes for which the funds may be used, 
the length of time the funds may remain available for these uses, and the 
maximum amount an agency may spend on particular elements of a 
program. In this manner, Congress may, and often does, use its 
appropriation power to accomplish policy objectives and to establish 
priorities among federal programs. 

7 In Schism v. United States, 316 F.3d 1259, 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2002), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 
123 S. Ct. 2246 (2003), retired military personnel sued the government for breach of an 
implied-in-fact contract, claiming that recruiters had promised free lifetime medical care for 
them and their dependents, in exchange for 20 years of service. The court rejected those 
claims, observing: 

“As Commander-in-Chief, the President does not have the constitutional 
authority to make promises about entitlements for life to military personnel 
that bind the government because such powers would encroach on Congress’ 
constitutional prerogative to appropriate funding. Under Article I, § 8, only 
Congress has the power of the purse. To say that the Executive Branch could 
promise future funds for activities that Congress itself had not authorized… 
would allow the Executive Branch to commandeer the power of the 
Legislative Branch.”

Introduction 

Congress can also use its appropriation power for other measures. It can, 
for example, include a provision in an appropriation act prohibiting the use 
of funds for a particular program. By doing this without amending the 
program legislation, Congress can effectively suspend operation of the 
program for budgetary or policy reasons, or perhaps simply defer further 
consideration of the merits of the program. The courts recognized the 
validity of this application of the appropriation power. See, e.g., United 
States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 222 (1980); United States v. Dickerson, 310 U.S. 
554 (1940). For a recent example of this, see Atlantic Fish Spotters Ass’n v. 
Evans, 321 F.3d 220, 225, 229 (1st Cir. 2003), which considered an 
appropriation act provision banning the use of federal funds to grant 
permits to those fishermen who would use “spotter planes” to locate 
Atlantic bluefin tuna. At issue was whether the ban was temporary or 
permanent in nature. The court found the ban to be a temporary (i.e., 
annual) provision, based on the language used in it.8 The court commented: 

“[We do not] consider it unreasonable for Congress to enact 
such a ban for one year only. The record lays out the 
competing public policy interests that the ban affects. The 
choice to balance such interests by temporizing—putting a 
ban in place for one year and requiring it to be reenacted the 
following year to remain in effect—is a valid exercise of 
legislative prerogative. Politics is, after all, the art of 
compromise.” 

321 F.3d at 225. 

Congress also may use appropriation act provisions to impose 
preconditions on a program’s use of the funds being appropriated. The 
preconditions on use often effectuate congressional oversight of the 
program. In American Telephone & Telegraph v. United States, 307 F.3d 
1374, 1376–79 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the court addressed just such a provision 
found in the Department of Defense Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1988. 
The provision specified that 

“[n]one of the funds provided… in this Act may be obligated 
or expended for fixed price-type contracts in excess of 
$10,000,000 for the development of a major system or 

8 We address the duration of provisions like this in Chapter 2.

Introduction 

subsystem unless the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition determines, in writing, that program risk has 
been reduced to the extent that realistic pricing can 
occur…: Provided further, That the Under Secretary report 
to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and 
House of Representatives in writing, on a quarterly basis, 
the contracts which have obligated funds under such a fixed 
price-type developmental contract.” 

Pub. L. No. 100–202, § 8118, 101 Stat. 1329, 1329-84 (1987). The Navy had 
entered into a $34.5 million fixed-price contract with American 
Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) for technology to be included in an 
advanced submarine detecting sonar system. AT&T performed, but at a 
cost of $91 million. When Navy refused to pay the amount in excess of the 
contract’s fixed price, AT&T sued. AT&T pointed out, and Navy conceded, 
that the Under Secretary for Acquisitions had not satisfied the 
appropriation act’s preconditions on use of the appropriated funds; AT&T 
argued that the contract was, therefore, invalid and void ab initio. The 
court disagreed. The court said that the language of the Act “provides for 
legislative oversight and enforcement. The section does not create a cause 
of action inviting private parties to enforce the provision in courts.” AT&T, 
307 F.3d at 1379. The court emphasized the supervisory role of the 
legislative branch in ensuring compliance with policies imposed via 
appropriations act provisions, noting that such provisions permit “the 
appropriate legislative committees to monitor compliance and, 
presumably, guarantee enforcement in the form of future reductions in, or 
limitations on, appropriated funds.” Id. at 1377. 

While congressional power of the purse is a very broad power, courts have 
invalidated funding restrictions when the courts found that the restrictions 
violated some independent constitutional bar. For example, in United 
States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946), the Supreme Court held an 
appropriation act restriction unconstitutional as a bill of attainder. The 
rider in question was a prohibition on the payment of salary to certain 
named individuals rather than a condition on the receipt of funds. In 
another case, a provision in the 1989 District of Columbia appropriation act 
prohibited the use of any funds appropriated by the act unless the District 
adopted legislation spelled out in the rider. The provision was invalidated 
on first amendment grounds. Clarke v. United States, 705 F. Supp. 605 

(D.D.C. 1988), aff’d, 886 F.2d 404 (D.C. Cir. 1989), vacated en banc as moot, 
915 F.2d 699 (D.C. Cir. 1990).

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

The Supreme Court recognized the breadth of the power of the purse, and 
its limitations, in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), a decision 
addressing Congress’s use of its spending power to impose conditions on 
the use of federal grants. The court noted that— 

“the power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public 
moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct 
grants of legislative power found in the Constitution. Thus, 
objectives not thought to be within Article I’s enumerated 
legislative fields,… may nevertheless be attained through 
the use of the spending power and the conditional grant of 
federal funds.” 

Id. at 207. See also National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 
569, 588 (1998) (“So long as legislation does not infringe on other 
constitutionally protected rights, Congress has wide latitude to set 
spending priorities.”). 

On the other hand, as the Supreme Court also noted in Dole, “[t]he spending 
power is of course not unlimited.” Id. The courts have identified a number 
of limitations on it. In Dole, the Supreme Court listed what it referred to as 
four “general restrictions” established in previous cases: First, the exercise 
of the spending power must be in pursuit of the general welfare. Second, 
conditions imposed on the use of federal funds must be reasonably related 
to the articulated goals. Third, the intent of Congress to impose conditions 
must be authoritative and unambiguous. Fourth, the action in question 
must not be prohibited by an independent constitutional bar. Id. at 207–208. 
See also, e.g., Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d 445, 447–48 (9th Cir. 1989). After 
the Dole Court explained the application of the fourth restriction, it added, 
“Our decisions have [also] recognized that in some circumstances the 
financial inducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass 
the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’” Id. at 211, quoting 
Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937). Some courts have 
understood this passage to constitute a “fifth” limitation on congressional 
spending power. E.g., A.W. v. Jersey City Public Schools, 341 F.3d 234, 241 
(3rd Cir. 2003); Kansas v. United States, 214 F.3d 1196, 1201 (10th Cir. 2000); 
Litman v. George Mason University, 186 F.3d 544, 552–53 (4th Cir. 1999). 
Others have simply seen it as an “additional” consideration. E.g., West 
Virginia v. Department of Health & Human Services, 289 F.3d 281, 287 
(4th Cir. 2002). See also James Island Public Service District v. City of 
Charleston, 249 F.3d 323, 327 (4th Cir. 2001).

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

While the existence of this list might suggest otherwise, there have actually 
been few decisions striking down federal statutory spending conditions.9 
Kansas v. United States, 214 F.3d 1196, 1201–1202, n.6 (10th Cir. 2000). A 
recent example can be seen in <, wherein a conditional provision 
(contained in the annual appropriations for the Legal Service Corporation 
(LSC) since 1996) was struck down as inconsistent with the First 
Amendment. This provision prohibited LSC grantees from representing 
clients in efforts to amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law. The 
Supreme Court found this provision interfered with the free speech rights 
of clients represented by LSC-funded attorneys.10 

In addition to imposing restrictions in appropriation acts, Congress also 
exercises its spending power by imposing conditions in the legislation 
creating or modifying a program.11 An example of a statutorily imposed 
spending condition can be seen in the provisions of the Children’s Internet 
Protection Act (CIPA), Pub. L. No. 106-554, 114 Stat. 2763, 2763A-335 
(Dec. 21, 2000). CIPA barred public libraries from receiving federal 
assistance to provide computer access to the Internet unless they installed 
software to block obscenity and child pornography and prevent minors 
from obtaining access to material harmful to them. CIPA, § 1711. In United 
States v. American Library Ass’n, Inc., 539 U.S. 194, 123 S. Ct. 2297 (2003), 
the Supreme Court upheld CIPA’s condition as a legitimate exercise of 
congressional spending power. Among the challenges brought against the 
 


9 In United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1 (1936), the Supreme Court struck down a funding 
condition based on a narrow view of Congress’s powers under the Commerce Clause—an 
approach to which the Court no longer subscribes. See, e.g., Dole, 483 U.S. at 216–17 
(O’Connor, J., dissenting). See also Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 5-b, 
at 836 (3rd ed. 2000) (“the Supreme Court has effectively ignored Butler in judging the limits 
of congressional spending power”). Compare, in this regard, Commonwealth of Virginia v. 
Riley, 106 F.3d 559 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc); West Virginia v. Department of Health & 
Human Services, supra; and California v. United States, 104 F.3d 1086, 1092 (9th Cir. 1997), 
on how often and under what circumstances the courts might be willing to invalidate 
spending conditions as coercive. 

10 Similar challenges have been raised against restrictive federal regulations interpreting 
statutory spending conditions. E.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991) (statute barred 
funding programs that employ abortion as a method of family planning; court upheld 
implementing regulations prohibiting doctors employed by federally funded family planning 
clinics from discussing abortion options with clinic patients). 

11 Cf., e.g., New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 166 (1992) (“Our cases have identified a 
variety of methods, short of outright coercion, by which Congress may urge a State to adopt 
a legislative program consistent with federal interests.”).

CIPA condition was the claim that it constituted an impermissible coercion. 
The Court rejected that claim, explaining that CIPA did not penalize 
libraries that chose not to install the software. Rather, it simply precluded 
the use of taxpayer funds to subsidize those libraries that chose not to 
install such software. Id. at 2307–08. The Court also rejected claims that the 
condition infringed upon protected First Amendment rights, noting that 
CIPA expressly permitted libraries to customize or even disable the 
operation of the software for research and other lawful purposes—at the 
request of an adult user or, under certain circumstances, even at the 
request of a minor user. Id. at 2306–07. Citing Dole, supra, the Court noted 
again that, so long as Congress does not “induce” funding recipients to 
engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional, “Congress 
has wide latitude to attach conditions to the receipt of federal assistance in 
order to further its policy objectives.” Id. at 2303. 

For some additional recent cases upholding statutory funding conditions, 
see for example, Kansas v. United States, 214 F.3d 1196 (10th Cir. 2000) 
(upholding the statutory requirement conditioning receipt of federal block 
grants used to provide cash assistance and other supportive services to 
low-income families on a state’s participation in and compliance with a 
federal child support enforcement program); Litman v. George Mason 
University, supra (state university’s receipt of federal funds was validly 
conditioned upon waiver of the state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity 
from federal antidiscrimination lawsuits); and California v. United States, 
104 F.3d 1086, 1092 (9th Cir. 1997) (acknowledging that although it originally 
agreed to the condition for receipt of federal Medicaid funds on state 
provision of emergency medical services to illegal aliens, California now 
viewed that condition as coerced because substantial increases in illegal 
immigration left California with no choice but to remain in the program to 
prevent collapse of its medical system; the complaint was dismissed for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted).

Introduction 

It would appear safe to say that Congress can, as long as it does not violate 
the Constitution, appropriate money for any purpose it chooses, from 
paying the valid obligations of the United States to what the Supreme Court 
has termed “pure charity,”12 and can implement policy objectives by 
imposing conditions on the receipt or use of the money.13 

The Constitution does not provide detailed instructions on how Congress is 
to implement its appropriation power, but leaves it to Congress to do so by 
statute. Congress has in fact done this, and continues to do it, in two ways: 
through the annual budget and appropriations process and through a series 
of permanent “funding statutes.” As one court has put it: 

“ [The Appropriations Clause] is not self-defining and 
Congress has plenary power to give meaning to the 
provision. The Congressionally chosen method of 
implementing the requirements of Article I, section 9, 
clause 7 is to be found in various statutory provisions.” 

Harrington v. Bush, 553 F.2d 190, 194–95 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (footnote 
omitted). See also, e.g., Walker v. Department of Housing & Urban 
Development, 912 F.2d 819, 829 (5th Cir. 1990). There were few statutory 
funding controls in the early years of the nation and abuses were 
commonplace. As early as 1809, one senator, citing a string of abuses, 
introduced a resolution to look into ways to prevent the improper 
expenditure of public funds.14 In 1816 and 1817, John C. Calhoun lamented 
the “great evil” of diverting public funds to uses other than those for which 
they were appropriated.15 Even as late as the post-Civil War years, the 
situation saw little improvement. “Funds were commingled. Obligations 
were made without appropriations. Unexpended balances from prior years 
were used to augment current appropriations.”16

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

The permanent funding statutes, found mostly in Title 31 of the United 
States Code, are designed to combat these and other abuses. They did not 
spring up overnight, but have evolved over the span of nearly more than 
two centuries. Nevertheless, when viewed as a whole, they form a logical 
pattern. We may regard them as pieces of a puzzle that fit together to form 
the larger picture of how Congress exercises its control “power of the 
purse.” Some of the key statutory directives in this scheme, each of which 
is discussed elsewhere in this publication, are: 

• A statute will not be construed as making an appropriation unless it 
expressly so states. 31 U.S.C. § 1301(d). 

• Agencies may not spend, or commit themselves to spend, in advance of 
or in excess of appropriations. 31 U.S.C. § 1341 (Antideficiency Act). 

• Appropriations may be used only for their intended purposes. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1301(a) (“purpose statute”). 

• Appropriations made for a definite period of time may be used only for 
expenses properly incurred during that time. 31 U.S.C. § 1502(a) (“bona 
fide needs” statute). 

• Unless authorized by law, an agency may not keep money it receives 
from sources other than congressional appropriations, but must 
deposit the money in the Treasury. 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b) (“miscellaneous 
receipts” statute). 

The second part of article I, section 9, clause 7 of the Constitution requires 
that— 

“a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and 
Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from 
time to time.”

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

Implementation of this provision, as a logical corollary of the appropriation 
power, is also wholly within the congressional province, and the courts 
have so held.17 Washington Post Co. v. United States Department of State, 
685 F.2d 698, 700 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“the plenary authority of Congress in this 
area will be respected”), vacated as moot, 464 U.S. 979 (1983); United 
States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 178 n.11 (1974) (“it is clear that 
Congress has plenary power to exact any reporting and accounting it 
considers appropriate in the public interest”); Harrington v. Bush, 553 F.2d 
at 195; Hart’s Case, 16 Ct. Cl. 459, 484 (1880), aff’d, Hart v. United States, 
118 U.S. 62 (1886) (“[a]uditing and accounting are but parts of a scheme for 
payment”). See also B-300192, n.10, Nov. 13, 2002. 

The Constitution mentions appropriations in only one other place. Article I, 
section 8, clause 12 provides that Congress shall have power to “raise and 
support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a 
longer Term than two Years.”18 The 2-year limit in clause 12 has been 
strictly construed as applying essentially to appropriations for personnel 
and for operations and maintenance and not to other military 
appropriations such as weapon system procurement or military 
construction. See B-114578, Nov. 9, 1973; 40 Op. Att’y Gen. 555 (1948); 
25 Op. Att’y Gen. 105 (1904). In any event, Congress has traditionally made 
appropriations for military personnel and operations and maintenance on a 
fiscal year basis. 

Whenever one reflects upon the constitutional prerogatives of the 
legislature, it must be against the backdrop of a central theme underlying 
much of federal fiscal law and policy—the natural antithesis of executive 
flexibility and congressional control. Each objective is valid and necessary, 
but it is impossible to simultaneously maximize both. Either can be 
enhanced only at the expense of the other. Finding and maintaining a 

17 Thus, Congress has delegated authority to the Comptroller General to prescribe, after 
consultation with the President and the Secretary of the Treasury, accounting principles and 
standards for the federal government. 31 U.S.C. § 3511. Since 1991, GAO has implemented 
this responsibility largely through the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board 
(FASAB)—a federal advisory committee jointly created by the Comptroller General, the 
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. For 
more information about FASAB, check out FASAB Facts,

behind the 2-year limitation).

reasonable and proper balance is both the goal and the challenge of the 
legal process. 

C. Historical 
Perspective 
1. Evolution of the Budget 
and Appropriations 
Process 19 
The first general appropriation act, passed by Congress on September 29, 
1789, appropriated a total of $639,000 and illustrates what was once a 
relatively uncomplicated process. We quote it in full (1 Stat. 95): 

“Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
That there be appropriated for the service of the present 
year, to be paid out of the monies which arise, either from 
the requisitions heretofore made upon the several states, or 
from the duties on impost and tonnage, the following sums, 
viz. A sum not exceeding two hundred and sixteen 
thousand dollars for defraying the expenses of the civil list, 
under the late and present government; a sum not exceeding 
one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars for defraying 
the expenses of the department of war; a sum not exceeding 
one hundred and ninety thousand dollars for discharging the 
warrants issued by the late board of treasury, and remaining 
unsatisfied; and a sum not exceeding ninety-six thousand 
dollars for paying the pensions to invalids.” 

As the size and scope of the federal government have grown, so has the 
complexity of the appropriations process. 

In 1789, the House established the Ways and Means Committee to report on 
revenues and spending, only to disband it that same year following the 
creation of the Treasury Department. The House Ways and Means

process, see Allen Schick and Felix LoStracco, The Federal Budget: Politics, Policy, Process

Introduction 

Committee was re-established to function permanently in 1795 and was 
recognized as a standing committee in 1802. 

On the Senate side, the Finance Committee was established as a standing 
committee in 1816. Up until that time, the Senate had referred 
appropriation measures to temporary select committees. By 1834, 
jurisdiction over all Senate appropriation bills was consolidated in the 
Senate Finance Committee. 

In the mid-nineteenth century, a move was begun to restrict appropriation 
acts to only those expenditures that had been previously authorized by law. 
The purpose was to avoid the delays caused when legislative items or 
“riders” were attached to appropriation bills. Rules were eventually passed 
by both houses of Congress to require, in general, prior legislative 
authorizations for the enactment of appropriations. 

It was during this same period that the concept of a fiscal year separate and 
distinct from the calendar year came into existence.20 

Under the financial strains caused by the Civil War, appropriations 
committees first appeared in both the House and the Senate, diminishing 
the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees, 
respectively. Years later, the need for major reforms was again accentuated 
by the burdens of another war. Following World War I, Congress passed the 
Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. 67-13, 42 Stat. 20 (June 10, 
1921). 

20 Prior to 1842, the government did not distinguish between fiscal year and calendar year. 
From 1842 to 1976, the government’s fiscal year ran from July 1 to the following June 30. In 
1974, Congress changed the fiscal year to run, starting with fiscal year 1977, from October 1 
to September 30. 31 U.S.C. § 1102. The concept of a fiscal year has been termed an “absolute 
necessity.” Sweet v. United States, 34 Ct. Cl. 377, 386 (1899). See also Bachelor v. United 
States, 8 Ct. Cl. 235, 238 (1872) (reasons for fixing a fiscal year are “so obvious… that no one 
can fail to see their importance”).

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

Before 1921, departments and agencies generally made individual requests 
for appropriations. These submissions were compiled for congressional 
review in an uncoordinated “Book of Estimates.” The Budget and 
Accounting Act enhanced budgetary efficiency and aided in the 
performance of constitutional checks and balances through the budget 
process. It required the President to submit a national budget each year and 
restricted the authority of the agencies to present their own proposals. See 
31 U.S.C. §§ 1104, 1105. With this centralization of authority for the 
formulation of the executive branch budget in the President and the newly 
established Bureau of the Budget (now Office of Management and Budget), 
Congress also took steps to strengthen its oversight capability over fiscal 
matters by establishing the General Accounting Office.21 

The decades immediately following World War II saw growth in both the 
size and the complexity of the federal budget. It became apparent that the 
congressional role in the “budget and appropriations” process centered 
heavily on the appropriations phase and placed too little emphasis on the 
budgetary phase. In other words, Congress responded to the President’s 
spending and revenue proposals only through the cumulative result of 
individual pieces of legislation reached through an agglomeration of 
separate actions. Congress did not look at the budget as a whole, nor did it 
examine or vote on overall spending or revenues. There was no process by 
which Congress could establish its own spending priorities. Thus, the 
impetus for a congressional budget process began in the early 1970s. It was 
not created in a single step; rather, it was created in stages—and for the 
most part new pieces did not replace but were added to existing processes. 
As William G. Dauster, former Chief Counsel on the Committee on the 
Budget, put it: “[t]he law governing the budget process resembles nothing 
so much as sediment. It has accumulated in several statutes, each layered 
upon the prior one… [t]his incremental growth has created something of a 
legal nettle.” Budget Process Law Annotated, S. Print No. 102-22, at xxvii 
(1991). 

21 A summary of the changes brought about by the Budget and Accounting Act, including a 
listing of amendments that have been made to the Act, may be found in National Federation 
of Federal Employees v. Cheney, 883 F.2d 1038, 1043–46 (D.C. Cir. 1989).

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

The first major round of reforms came about with the Congressional 
Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.22 Titles I though IX of the 
act are referred to as the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, while Title X is 
referred to as the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. One of the 
fundamental objectives of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 was to 
establish a process through which Congress could systematically consider 
the total federal budget and determine priorities for allocating budget 
resources. The design of programs and the allocation of spending within 
each mission area would be left to the authorizing and appropriations 
committees. The focus was on overall fiscal policy and an allocation across 
priorities.23 The statute made several major changes in the budget and 
appropriations process. For example: 

• It established a detailed calendar governing the various stages of the 
congressional budget and appropriations process. 2 U.S.C. § 631. 

• It provided for congressional review of the President’s budget, the 
establishment of target ceilings for federal expenditures through one or 
more concurrent resolutions, and the evaluation of spending bills 
against these targets. 2 U.S.C. §§ 632–642. Prior to this time, Congress 
had considered the President’s budget only in the context of individual 
appropriation bills. To implement the new process, the law created 
Budget Committees in both the Senate and the House, and a 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 2 U.S.C. § 601. The law requires 
the CBO to prepare estimates of new budget authority, outlays, or 
revenue provided by bills or resolutions reported from committees of 
either house, or estimates of the costs that the government would incur 
in carrying out the provisions of the proposed legislation. 2 U.S.C. 
§ 602. 

22 Pub. L. No. 93-344, 88 Stat. 297 (July 12, 1974). 

23 The second and more immediate motive for passage of the Congressional Budget Act was 
the dispute in the early 1970s related to the impoundment by President Nixon of billions of 
dollars of funds appropriated by Congress. See Committee on the Budget, United States 
Senate, The Congressional Budget Process, An Explanation, S. Print No. 105-67 (1998); 

H.R. Rep. No. 93-1101, at 4 (1974); H.R. Rep. No. 93-658, at 19 (1974).

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

• Prompted by the growth of “backdoor spending,”24 it enhanced the role 

of the Appropriations Committees in reviewing proposals for contract 

authority, borrowing authority, and mandatory entitlements. 2 U.S.C. 

§ 651. 

The 1974 legislation also imposed limitations on the impounding of 
appropriated funds by the executive branch. 2 U.S.C. §§ 681–688. 

The next piece of major legislation in the fiscal area was the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, known as the Gramm


Rudman-Hollings Act (Gramm-Rudman).25 It was enacted to deal with a 
growing budget deficit (excess of total outlays over total receipts for a 
given fiscal year). 2 U.S.C. § 622(6). Gramm-Rudman established 
‘‘maximum deficit amounts.’’ Pub. L. No. 99-177,§ 201(a)(1). If the deficit 
exceeded these statutory limits, the President was required to issue a 
sequester order (a cancellation of budgetary resources) that would reduce 
all nonexempt spending by a uniform percentage. Id. § 252. In the spring of 
1990, it became clear that the deficit was going to exceed Gramm-Rudman 
maximum deficit limits by a considerable amount. To respond to these 
large deficits, President George H.W. Bush and congressional leadership 
convened negotiations on the budget in May 1990. In November, the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 was enacted, which 
represented the budget agreement negotiated between the Bush 
Administration and Congress. Pub. L. No. 101-508, 104 Stat. 1388 (Nov. 5, 
1990). See S. Print No. 105–67, supra. 

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 included the Budget 
Enforcement Act (1990 BEA),26 which provided a major overhaul of the 
Gramm-Rudman procedures. The law established maximum adjustable 
deficit amounts for each fiscal year through fiscal year 1995, but in effect, it 

24 The term backdoor spending is a collective designation for authority provided in 
legislation other than appropriation acts to obligate the government to make payments. The 
most common forms of backdoor spending are borrowing authority, contract authority, and 
entitlement authority. See U.S. General Accounting Office, A Glossary of Terms Used in the 
Federal Budget Process (Exposure Draft), GAO/AFMD-2.1.1 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 1993). 
From the perspective of the appropriations committees, funding provided by these forms of 
authority causes their funding control to “sneak out” legislative “back doors.”

Introduction 

replaced the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings system of deficit limits with two 
different enforcement mechanisms. The 1990 BEA established annual caps 
on spending controllable through the appropriations process (discretionary 
spending) and a pay-as-you-go requirement for spending controllable 
through substantive legislation outside of the appropriations process (so-
called direct or mandatory spending) and revenue legislation. The two 
types of spending were subject to different rules. If discretionary 
appropriations were enacted that exceeded the annual caps, the law 
provided mechanisms for making appropriate spending reductions, 
sequestrations of budget authority, similar to those provided for in Gramm-
Rudman. 2 U.S.C. § 903. For the second spending category, mandatory 
spending and receipts, the 1990 BEA required that all legislation within a 
session of Congress that increased mandatory spending or decreased 
receipts was to be fully offset or paid for by corresponding increases in 
receipts or decreases in spending so that it was deficit neutral. Failure to 
obtain budget neutrality for mandatory spending would trigger an 
offsetting sequestration among nonexempt mandatory accounts. 2 U.S.C. 
§ 902. This pay-as-you-go requirement was referred to as PAYGO, and 
legislation dealing with mandatory spending or receipts was often referred 
to as PAYGO legislation. 

To determine compliance with the 1990 BEA requirements, the Act required 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and CBO to estimate new 
budget authority and outlays provided by any new legislation through a 
process that came to be called “scorekeeping.” 2 U.S.C. §§ 901, 902. CBO 
would transmit its estimates to OMB, which would report any 
discrepancies to both houses of Congress. The 1990 BEA, however, 
required that OMB’s estimates be used to determine whether a 
sequestration was necessary. 2 U.S.C. §§ 902, 904. The statement of 
managers accompanying the conference report on the 1990 BEA instructed 
the House and Senate Budget Committees to work in consultation with 
OMB and CBO to develop scorekeeping guidelines. H.R. Rept. No. 101-964, 
at 1172 (1990). The guidelines are printed in OMB Circular A-11, 
Preparation, Submission and Execution of the Budget, app. B (July 25, 
2003). 

In 1993, the discretionary spending limits and the PAYGO rules were 
extended through fiscal year 1998. Pub. L. No. 103-66, 107 Stat. 683 
(Aug. 10, 1993). The 1997 Budget Enforcement Act (1997 BEA) again 
extended the discretionary spending caps and the PAYGO rules through 
2002. Pub. L. No. 105-33, title X, 111 Stat. 251, 701 (Aug. 5, 1997). Although 
the overall discretionary spending caps expired in 2002, additional caps on

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

Highway and Mass Transit spending established under the Transportation 
Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21)27 continued through 2003, and 
another set of caps on conservation spending,28 established as part of the 
fiscal year 2001 Interior Appropriations Act,29 were set through 2006. In 
addition, the sequestration procedures were to apply through 2006 to the 
conservation category. However, Pub. L. No. 107-312, 116 Stat. 2456 (Dec. 2, 
2002) eliminated the PAYGO sequestration requirement. 

While most of the budget enforcement mechanisms in the 1990 BEA have 
expired, OMB uses the same scorekeeping rules developed for use with 
BEA for purposes of budget execution. OMB determines how much budget 
authority must be obligated for individual transactions. OMB interprets the 
scorekeeping guidelines to determine the cost that should be recognized 
and recorded as an obligation at the time the agency signs a contract or 
enters into a lease. “When an agency signs a contract, budgetary resources 
to measure the government’s contribution to each of the terms of the 
contract are set aside (obligated). The ‘total score’ refers to the total 
amount of resources the government must obligate (set aside) for a given 
project.” Letter from Franklin D. Raines, Director, Office of Management 
and Budget, to the Honorable William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense, Re: 
Scoring DOD’s Military Housing Privatization Initiatives, June 25, 1997. 

In addition to the statutory spending caps, Congress, in fiscal year 1994, 
began including overall limits on discretionary spending in the concurrent 
budget resolution that have become known as congressional caps. H.R. 
Con. Res. 64, 103rd Cong. § 12(b) (1993). Congress established these caps to 
manage its internal budget process, while the BEA statutory caps 
continued to govern for sequestration purposes. The congressional caps 
were enforceable in the Senate by a point of order that prohibited the 
consideration of a budget resolution that exceeded the limits for that fiscal 
year (the point of order could be waived or suspended by a three-fifths 

27 Pub. L. No. 105-178, 112 Stat. 107 (June 9, 1998).

maintenance of federal and nonfederal lands and resources, and payments in lieu of taxes.

vote).30 Although the statutory 1997 BEA limits expired at the end of fiscal 
year 2002, Congress continues to use the concurrent resolution on the 
budget to establish and enforce congressional budgetary limits. H.R. Con. 
Res. 95, 108th Cong. § 504 (2003). 

2. GAO’s Role in the 
Process 
As the budget and appropriations process has evolved over the course of 
the twentieth century, GAO’s role with respect to it has also evolved. 
Title III of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921,31 GAO’s basic enabling 
statute, created two very different roles for the Comptroller General and 
the new agency. 

First, he was to assume all the duties of the Comptroller of the Treasury 
and his six subordinate auditors, and to serve as the chief accounting 
officer of the government. To this end, the Comptroller General was given 
the authority to settle all claims by and against the government.32 In 1995, 
Congress transferred GAO’s claim settlement authority to the executive 
branch.33 

Second, under the enabling statute the Comptroller General was given the 
authority to settle the accounts of the U.S. government, which includes the 
authority to issue legal decisions.34 The issuance of legal decisions is 
discussed in section E of this chapter.

Introduction 

The Comptroller General was also directed to investigate the receipt, 
disbursement, and application of public funds, reporting the results to 
Congress;35 and to make investigations and reports upon the request of 
either house of Congress or of any congressional committee with 
jurisdiction over revenue, appropriations, or expenditures.36 He was also 
directed to supply such information to the President when requested by the 
President.37 The mandates in the 1921 legislation, together with a 
subsequent directive in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to make 
expenditure analyses of executive branch agencies with reports to the 
cognizant congressional committees,38 have played a large part in preparing 
Congress to consider the merits of the President’s annual budget 
submission. 

The Accounting and Auditing Act of 1950 authorized the Comptroller 
General to audit the financial transactions of most39 executive, legislative, 
and judicial agencies;40 and to prescribe, in consultation with the President

36 Budget and Accounting Act § 312(b), 31 U.S.C. §§ 712(4) and (5). At about this same time,

single committee in each body.

39 With certain exceptions, the audit authority and responsibility of the General Accounting 
Office extends to all activities, financial transactions, and accounts of the federal 
government. However, certain agencies and activities are not subject to audit by reason of 
specific statutory prohibitions and the type of funds involved. For example, prior to 1980, 
the Comptroller General did not have the authority to audit expenditures approved without 
vouchers. Enactment of Pub. L. No. 96-226, § 101, 94 Stat. 311 (Apr. 3, 1980) provided the 
authority to the Comptroller General to audit these unvouchered transactions; however, the 
Comptroller General may only release the results of the audit to the President or head of the 
agency, or, if there is an unresolved discrepancy, to the Senate Committee on Governmental 
Affairs, the House Committee on Government Reform, and the committees of Congress 
having legislative or appropriation oversight of the expenditure. This law, however, does not 
provide GAO with the authority to audit transactions of the Central Intelligence Agency or 
certain other financial transactions involving specified sensitive matters exempted by the 
President. 31 U.S.C. § 3524.

and the Secretary of the Treasury, accounting principles, standards, and 
requirements for the executive agencies suitable to their needs.41 

The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 expanded the focus of GAO’s 
audit activities to include program evaluations as well as financial audits.42 

The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 gave 
GAO a number of additional duties in the budgetary arena. It directs GAO, 
in cooperation with Treasury, the Office of Management and Budget, and 
the Congressional Budget Office, to “establish, maintain, and publish 
standard terms and classifications for fiscal, budget, and program 
information of the Government, including information on fiscal policy, 
receipts, expenditures, programs, projects, activities, and functions.” 
Agencies are to use these terms and classifications in providing 
information to Congress.43 GAO published this information in A Glossary 
of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process (Exposure Draft), 
GAO/AFMD-2.1.1 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 1993). The law gives GAO a 
variety of functions relating to obtaining, studying, and reporting to 
Congress fiscal, budget, and program information.44 Finally, it gives the 
Comptroller General the responsibility to monitor and report to Congress 
on all proposed impoundments of budget authority by the executive 
branch.45

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

The Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act of 198246 is a very brief law 
but one that has had substantial impact. It was intended to increase 
governmentwide emphasis on internal accounting and administrative 
controls. Agencies are to establish internal accounting and administrative 
control systems in accordance with standards prescribed by the 
Comptroller General (see U.S. General Accounting Office, Standards for 
Internal Control in the Federal Government, GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1 
(Washington, D.C.: Nov. 9, 1999)), conduct annual reviews of their systems 
in accordance with Office of Management and Budget guidelines, and 
report the results of these reviews to the President and to Congress. OMB 
Circular No. A-123, Management Accountability and Control (June 21, 
1995). The act has been beneficial in focusing management and employee 
attention on the importance of internal controls. More recently, however, 
Congress enacted a number of statutes to provide a framework for 
performance-based management and accountability.47 GAO monitors, and 
issues governmentwide reports on, the implementation of these statutes. 
See, e.g., U.S. General Accounting Office, Financial Management: FFMIA 
(Federal Financial Management Improvement Act) Implementation 
Necessary to Achieve Accountability, GAO-03-31 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 1, 
2002); Managing for Results: Status of the Government Performance and 
Results Act, GAO/T-GGD-95-193 (Washington, D.C.: June 27, 1995). 

D. “Life Cycle” of an 
Appropriation 
An appropriate subtitle for this section might be “phases of the budget and 
appropriations process.” An appropriation has phases roughly similar to 
the various stages in the existence of “man”—conception, birth, death, 
even an afterlife. The various phases in an appropriation’s “life cycle” may 
be identified as follows: 

• executive budget formulation and transmittal, 

• congressional action, 

46 Pub. L. No. 97-255, 96 Stat. 814 (Sept. 8, 1982), codified at 31 U.S.C. §§ 3512(c) and (d). 

47 See, e.g., The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-576, 104 Stat. 2838 
(Nov. 15, 1990); the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-356, 
108 Stat. 3410 (Oct. 13, 1994); the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, Pub. L. 
No. 103-62, 107 Stat. 285 (Aug. 3, 1993); and the Federal Financial Management 
Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, title VIII, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-389 (Sept. 30, 
1996).

Introduction 

• budget execution and control, 
• audit and review, and 
• account closing. 

1. Executive Budget 
Formulation and 
Transmittal 
The first step in the life cycle of an appropriation is the long and exhaustive 
administrative process of budget preparation and review, a process that 
may well take place several years before the budget for a particular fiscal 
year is ready to be submitted to Congress. The primary participants in the 
process at this stage are the agencies and individual organizational units, 
which review current operations, program objectives, and future plans, and 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),48 which is charged with 
broad oversight, supervision, and responsibility for coordinating and 
formulating a consolidated budget submission. 

Throughout this preparation period, there is a continuous exchange of 
information among the various federal agencies, OMB, and the President, 
including revenue estimates and economic outlook projections from the 
Treasury Department, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Congressional 
Budget Office, and the Departments of Commerce and Labor. 

The President’s budget request must be submitted to Congress on or before 
the first Monday in February of each year, for use during the following 
fiscal year. 2 U.S.C. § 631.49 Numerous statutory provisions, the most 
important of which are 31 U.S.C. §§ 1104–1109, prescribe the content and 
nature of the materials and justifications that must be submitted with the 

48 Part 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (84 Stat. 2085), designated the former Bureau 
of the Budget as OMB and transferred all the authority vested in the Bureau and its director 
to the President. By Executive Order No. 11541, July 1, 1970, the President in turn delegated 
that authority to the Director of OMB. OMB’s primary functions include assistance to the 
President in the preparation of the budget and the formulation of the fiscal program of the 
government, supervision and control of the administration of the budget, centralized 
direction in executive branch financial management, and review of the organization and 
management of the executive branch. 

49 Section 1105(a) of title 31 of the United States Code states the requirement for a 
presidential budget submission slightly different than 2 U.S.C. § 631: “On or after the first 
Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year, the 
President shall submit a budget of the United States Government for the following fiscal 
year.”

Introduction 

President’s budget request. Specific instructions and policy guidance are 
contained in OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission and 
Execution of the Budget (July 25, 2003). 

2. Congressional Action 
a. Summary of Congressional 
Process 

In exercising the broad discretion granted by the Constitution, Congress 
can approve funding levels contained in the President’s budget request, 
increase or decrease those levels, eliminate proposals, or add programs not 
requested by the administration. 

In simpler times, appropriations were often made in the form of a single, 
consolidated appropriation act. The most recent regular consolidated 
appropriation act50 was the General Appropriation Act of 1951, Pub. L. 
No. 759, 64 Stat. 595 (Sept. 6, 1950). Since that time, appropriations have 
generally been made in a series of regular appropriation acts plus one or 
more supplemental appropriation acts. Most regular appropriation acts are 
organized based on one or more major departments and a number of 
smaller agencies (corresponding to the jurisdiction of appropriations 
subcommittees), although a few are based solely on function. An agency 
may receive funds under more than one appropriation act. The individual 
structures are of course subject to change over time. At the present time, 
there are 13 regular appropriation acts, as follows: 

• Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and related 
agencies; 

• Department of Defense; 

• Department of the Interior and related agencies; 

• Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and 
related agencies; 

• Department of Homeland Security; 

50 For a few years in the mid-1980s, very few regular appropriation acts were passed, 
resulting in consolidated continuing resolutions for those years.

Introduction 

• Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and independent agencies; 

• Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and 
independent agencies; 

• District of Columbia; 

• Energy and Water Development; 

• Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and related programs; 

• Legislative Branch; 

• Military Construction; and 

• Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and related agencies. 

Before considering individual appropriation measures, however, Congress 
must, under the Congressional Budget Act, first agree on governmentwide 
budget totals. A timetable for congressional action is set forth in 2 U.S.C. 
§ 631, with further detail in sections 632–656. Key steps in that timetable 
are summarized below.51 

First Monday in February. On or before this date, the President submits to 
Congress the Administration’s budget request for the fiscal year to start the 
following October 1. The deadline under the 1974 Budget Act had been the 
first Monday after January 3.52 

February 15. The Congressional Budget Office submits to the House and 
Senate Budget Committees its annual report required by 2 U.S.C. § 602(e). 

51 Some useful references discussing the congressional budget process are: U.S. General 
Accounting Office, Budget Process: Evolution and Challenges, GAO/T-AIMD-96-129 
(July 11, 1996); Committee on the Budget, United States Senate, The Congressional Budget 
Process, An Explanation, S. Print No. 105-67 (revised Dec. 1998); and Library of Congress, 
Congressional Research Service, No. RS20358, Overview of the Congressional Budget 
Process (July 23, 2003). 

52 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended section 1105(a) of Title 31 of the 
United States Code to require the President to submit a budget “[o]n or after the first 
Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year.”

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

The report contains the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of fiscal 
policy and budget priorities. 

Within 6 weeks after President submits a budget request, or at such time 
as may be requested by the Committee on the Budget. Each congressional 
committee with legislative jurisdiction submits to the appropriate Budget 
Committee its views and estimates on spending and revenue levels for the 
following fiscal year on matters within its jurisdiction. 2 U.S.C. § 632(d), as 
amended. The House and Senate Budget Committees then hold hearings 
and prepare their respective versions of a concurrent resolution, which is 
intended to be the overall budget plan against which individual 
appropriation bills are to be evaluated. 

April 15. Congress completes action on the concurrent resolution, which 
includes a breakdown of estimated new budget authority and outlays for 
each major budget function. 2 U.S.C. § 632(a). The conference report on 
the concurrent resolution allocates the totals among individual 
committees. 2 U.S.C. § 633(a). The resolution may also include 
“reconciliation directives”—directives to individual committees to 
recommend legislative changes in revenues or spending to meet the goals 
of the budget plan. 2 U.S.C. § 641(a). 

June 10. House Appropriations Committee completes the process of 
reporting out the individual appropriation bills. 

June 15. Congress completes action on any reconciliation legislation 
stemming from the concurrent resolution. 

June 30. House of Representatives completes action on annual 
appropriation bills. 

Of course, House of Representative consideration of the individual 
appropriation bills will have begun several months earlier. The first step is 
for each subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to study 
appropriation requests and evaluate the performance of the agencies 
within its jurisdiction. Typically, each subcommittee will conduct hearings 
at which federal officials give testimony concerning both the costs and 
achievements of the various programs administered by their agencies and 
provide detailed justifications for their funding requests. Eventually, each 
subcommittee reports a single appropriation bill for consideration by the 
entire committee and then the full House membership. 

Page 1-28 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 1 
Introduction 

As individual appropriation bills are passed by the House, they are sent to 
the Senate. As in the House, each appropriation measure is first considered 
in subcommittee and then reported by the full Appropriations Committee 
to be voted upon by the full Senate. In the event of variations in the Senate 
and House versions of a particular appropriation bill, a conference 
committee, including representatives of both houses of Congress, is 
formed. It is the function of the conference committee to resolve all 
differences, but the full House and Senate (in that order) must also vote to 
approve the conference report. 

Following either the Senate’s passage of the House version of an 
appropriation measure, or the approval of a conference report by both 
bodies, the enrolled bill is then sent to the President for signature or veto. 
The Congressional Budget Act envisions completion of the process by 
October 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year. 

b. Points of Order A number of requirements relevant to an understanding of appropriations 
law and the legislative process are found in rules of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives. For example, Rule XXI(2), Rules of the House of 
Representatives, prohibits appropriations for objects not previously 
authorized by law.53 A similar but more limited prohibition exists in 
Rule XVI, Standing Rules of the Senate.54 Other examples are the 
prohibition against including general legislation in appropriation acts55 
(Senate Rule XVI, House Rule XXI), and the prohibition against 
consideration by a conference committee of matters not committed to it by 
either House (Senate Rule XXVIII, House Rule XXII). The applicability of 
Senate and House rules is exclusively within the province of the particular 
House.56 

53 Citations to the Rules of the House are from the Rules of the House of Representatives, 
108th Congress, Jan. 7, 2003. 

54 Citations to the Senate rules are from the Standing Rules of the Senate, S. Doc. No. 106-15, 
Nov. 19, 1999 (revised as of April 27, 2000). 

55 Whether a given item is general legislation or merely a condition on the availability of an 
appropriation is frequently a difficult question. 

56 The Comptroller General will not render an opinion on these matters. E.g., B-173832, 
Aug. 1, 1975. 

Page 1-29 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 1 
Introduction 

In addition, rather than expressly prohibiting a given item, legislation may 
provide that it shall not be in order for the Senate or House to consider a 
bill or resolution containing that item. An important example from the 
Congressional Budget Act of 197457 is 2 U.S.C. § 651(a), which provides that 
it shall not be in order for either house to consider any bill, resolution, or 
amendment containing certain types of new spending authority, such as 
contract authority, unless that bill, resolution, or amendment also provides 
that the new authority is to be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent 
provided in appropriation acts. 

The effect of these rules and of statutes like 2 U.S.C. § 651(a) is to subject 
the noncomplying bill to a “point of order.” A point of order is a procedural 
objection raised on the House or Senate floor or in committees by a 
Member alleging a departure from a rule or statute governing the conduct 
of business. See U.S. General Accounting Office, A Glossary of Terms Used 
in the Federal Budget Process (Exposure Draft), GAO/AFMD-2.1.1 
(Washington, D.C.: Jan. 1993). It differs from an absolute prohibition in that 

(a) it is always possible that no one will raise it and (b) if raised, it may or 
may not be sustained. Also, some laws, like the Congressional Budget Act, 
authorize points of order to be raised, and some measures may be 
considered under special resolutions waiving points of order.58 If a point of 
order is raised and sustained, the offending provision is effectively killed 
and may be revived only if it is amended to cure the noncompliance. 
The potential effect of a rule or statute subjecting a provision to a point of 
order is limited to the pre-enactment stage. If a point of order is not raised, 
or is raised and not sustained, the provision, if enacted, is no less valid. To 
restate, a rule or statute subjecting a given provision to a point of order has 
no effect or application once the legislation or appropriation has been 
enacted. 65 Comp. Gen. 524, 527 (1986); 57 Comp. Gen. 34 (1977); 34 Comp. 
Gen. 278 (1954); B-173832, supra; B-123469, Apr. 14, 1955; B-87612, July 26, 
1949. 

57 Pub. L. No. 93-344, 88 Stat. 297 (July 12, 1974). 

58 Usually, a point of order may be waived by a simple majority vote. See GAO/AFMD-2.1.1. 
However, in the Senate, waiver of some points of order requires a three-fifths vote. See 
Congressional Research Service, No. 97-865, supra. For example, waiver of the prohibition 
against consideration of nongermane amendments to budget resolutions requires a three-
fifths vote of all members of the Senate. Pub. L. No. 93-344, § 305(b)(2).

Introduction 

3. Budget Execution and 
Control 
a. In General The body of enacted appropriation acts for a fiscal year, as amplified by 
legislative history and the relevant budget submissions, becomes the 
government’s financial plan for that fiscal year. The “execution and control” 
phase refers generally to the period of time during which the budget 
authority made available by the appropriation acts remains available for 
obligation. An agency’s task during this phase is to spend the money 
Congress has given it to carry out the objectives of its program legislation. 
The Office of Management and Budget apportions or distributes budgeted 
amounts to the executive branch agencies, thereby making funds in 
appropriation accounts (administered by the Treasury Department) 
available for obligation. 31 U.S.C. §§ 1511–1516. The apportionment system 
through which budget authority is distributed by time periods (usually 
quarterly) or by activities is intended to achieve an effective and orderly 
use of available budget authority, and to reduce the need for supplemental 
or deficiency appropriations. Each agency then makes allotments pursuant 
to the OMB apportionments or other statutory authority. 31 U.S.C. 
§§ 1513(d), 1514. An allotment is a delegation of authority to agency 
officials that allows them to incur obligations within the scope and terms of 
the delegation.59 These concepts will be discussed further in Chapter 6. 
Further detail on the budget execution phase may also be found in U.S. 
General Accounting Office, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal 
Budget Process (Exposure Draft), GAO/AFMD-2.1.1 (Washington, D.C.: 
Jan. 1993), and OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission and 
Execution of the Budget, pt. 4, Instructions on Budget Execution (July 25, 
2003). 
In addition, OMB exercises a leadership role in executive branch financial 
management. This role was strengthened and given a statutory foundation 
by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-576, 104 Stat. 
2838 (Nov. 15, 1990). The Chief Financial Officers Act also enacted a new 
31 U.S.C. ch. 9, which establishes a Chief Financial Officer in the cabinet 
departments and several other executive branch agencies to work with 

59 Note the distinction in terminology: Congress appropriates, OMB apportions, and the 
receiving agency allots (or allocates) within the apportionment.

Introduction 

OMB and to develop and oversee financial management plans, programs, 
and activities within the agency. 

b. Impoundment While an agency’s basic mission is to carry out its programs with the funds 
Congress has appropriated, there is also the possibility that, for a variety of 
reasons, the full amount appropriated by Congress will not be expended or 
obligated by the administration. Under the Impoundment Control Act of 
1974, an impoundment is an action or inaction by an officer or employee of 
the United States that delays or precludes the obligation or expenditure of 
budget authority provided by Congress. 2 U.S.C. §§ 682(1), 683.60 The act 
applies to “Salaries and Expenses” appropriations as well as program 
appropriations. 64 Comp. Gen. 370, 375–76 (1985). 
There are two types of impoundment actions—deferrals and rescission 
proposals. A deferral is a postponement of budget authority in the sense 
that an agency temporarily withholds or delays obligation or expenditure. 
The President is required to submit a special message to Congress 
reporting any deferral of budget authority. Deferrals are authorized only to 
provide for contingencies, to achieve savings made possible by changes in 
requirements or greater efficiency of operations, or as otherwise 
specifically provided by law.61 A deferral may not be proposed for a period 
beyond the end of the fiscal year in which the special message reporting it 
is transmitted, although, for multiple year funds, nothing prevents a new 
deferral message covering the same funds in the following fiscal year. 
2 U.S.C. §§ 682(1), 684.62 

60 For a detailed discussion of impoundment before the 1974 legislation, see B-135564, 
July 26, 1973. 

61 These requirements are repeated in 31 U.S.C. § 1512(c), which prescribes conditions for 
establishing reserves through the apportionment process. The President’s deferral authority 
under the Impoundment Control Act thus mirrors his authority to establish reserves under 
the Antideficiency Act. In other words, deferrals are authorized only in those situations in 
which reserves are authorized under the Antideficiency Act. U.S. General Accounting Office, 
Impoundment Control: President’s Third Special Impoundment Message for FY 1990, 
GAO/OGC-90-4 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 6, 1990). Deferrals for policy reasons are not 
authorized. 2 U.S.C. § 684(b). 

62 Under the original 1974 legislation, a deferral could be overturned by the passage of an 
impoundment resolution by either the House or the Senate. This “legislative veto” provision 
was found unconstitutional in City of New Haven v. United States, 809 F.2d 900 (D.C. Cir. 
1987), and the statute was subsequently amended to remove it. See Pub. L. No. 100-119, 
§ 206, 101 Stat. 754 (Sept. 29, 1987), codified at 2 U.S.C. § 684(b). Congress may, of course, 
enact legislation disapproving a deferral and requiring that the deferred funds be made 
available for obligation.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

A rescission involves the cancellation of budget authority previously 
provided by Congress (before that authority would otherwise expire), and 
can be accomplished only through legislation. The President must advise 
Congress of any proposed rescissions, again in a special message. The 
President is authorized to withhold budget authority that is the subject of a 
rescission proposal for a period of 45 days of continuous session following 
receipt of the proposal. Unless Congress acts to approve the proposed 
rescission within that time, the budget authority must be made available for 
obligation. 2 U.S.C. §§ 682(3), 683, 688.63 

The Impoundment Control Act requires the Comptroller General to 
monitor the performance of the executive branch in reporting proposed 
impoundments to Congress. A copy of each special message reporting a 
proposed deferral or rescission must be delivered to the Comptroller 
General, who then must review each such message and present his views to 
the Senate and House of Representatives. 2 U.S.C. § 685(b). If the 
Comptroller General finds that the executive branch has established a 
reserve or deferred budget authority and failed to transmit the required 
special message to Congress, the Comptroller General so reports to 
Congress. 2 U.S.C. § 686(a); U.S. General Accounting Office, Impoundment 
Control: Deferrals of Budget Authority in GSA, GAO/OGC-94-17 
(Washington, D.C.: Nov. 5, 1993) (unreported impoundment of General 
Service Administration funds); Impoundment Control: Comments on 
Unreported Impoundment of DOD Budget Authority, GAO/OGC-92-11 
(Washington, D.C.: June 3, 1992) (unreported impoundment of V-22 Osprey 
funds). The Comptroller General also reports to Congress on any special 
message transmitted by the executive branch that has incorrectly classified 
a deferral or a rescission. 2 U.S.C. § 686(b). GAO will construe a deferral as 
a de facto rescission if the timing of the proposed deferral is such that 
“funds could be expected with reasonable certainty to lapse before they 

63 In 1996, the Congress enacted the Line Item Veto Act, Pub. L. No. 104-130, 110 Stat. 1200 
(Apr. 9, 1996), which was codified at 2 U.S.C. §§ 691–692. The Line Item Veto Act (Veto Act) 
gave the President the power to “cancel in whole” three types of provisions already enacted 
into law: (1) any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, (2) any item of new direct 
spending, or (3) any limited tax benefit. The Veto Act imposed procedures for the President 
to follow whenever he exercised this cancellation authority. The Veto Act also provided for 
expedited congressional consideration of bills introduced to disapprove the cancellations. 
In Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), the Supreme Court held that because 
the Veto Act established cancellation procedures that authorized the President, by canceling 
already enacted provisions of law, “to create a different law—one whose text was not voted 
on by either House of Congress or presented to the President for signature,” it violated the 
Presentment Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 7) and thus was unconstitutional. Id. at 448.

Introduction 

could be obligated, or would have to be obligated imprudently to avoid that 
consequence.” 54 Comp. Gen. 453, 462 (1974). 

If, under the Impoundment Control Act, the executive branch is required to 
make budget authority available for obligation (if, for example, Congress 
does not pass a rescission bill) and fails to do so, the Comptroller General 
is authorized to bring a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Columbia to require that the budget authority be made available. 2 U.S.C. 
§ 687. 

The expiration of budget authority or delays in obligating it resulting from 
ineffective or unwise program administration are not regarded as 
impoundments unless accompanied by or derived from an intention to 
withhold the budget authority. B-229326, Aug. 29, 1989. Similarly, an 
improper obligation, although it may violate several other statutes, is 
generally not an impoundment. 64 Comp. Gen. 359 (1985). 

There is also a distinction between deferrals, which must be reported, and 
“programmatic” delays, which are not impoundments and are not 
reportable under the Impoundment Control Act. A programmatic delay is 
one in which operational factors unavoidably impede the obligation of 
budget authority, notwithstanding the agency's reasonable and good faith 
efforts to implement the program. B-290659, July 24, 2002; U.S. General 
Accounting Office, Impoundment Control: Deferral of DOD Budget 
Authority Not Reported, GAO/OGC-91-8 (Washington, D.C.: May 7, 1991); 
Impoundment Control: Deferrals of Budget Authority for Military 
Construction Not Reported, GAO/OGC-91-3 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 5, 
1991). Since intent is a relevant factor, the determination requires a caseby-
case evaluation of the agency’s justification in light of all of the 
surrounding circumstances. A programmatic delay may become a 
reportable deferral if the programmatic basis ceases to exist. 

Delays resulting from the following factors may be programmatic, 
depending on the facts and circumstances involved: 

• conditions on availability for using funds not met (B-290659, supra); 

• contract delays due to shipbuilding design modification, verification, or 
changes in scope (GAO/OGC-90-4); 

• uncertainty as to the amount of budget authority that will ultimately be 
available for the program (B-203057, Sept. 15, 1981; B-207374, July 20, 

Page 1-34 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 1 
Introduction 

1982, noting that the uncertainty is particularly relevant when it “arises 
in the context of continuing resolution funding, where Congress has not 
yet spoken definitively”); 

• time required to set up the program or to comply with statutory 
conditions on obligating the funds (B-96983, B-225110, Sept. 3, 1987); 

• compliance with congressional committee directives (B-221412, 
Feb. 12, 1986); 

• delay in receiving a contract proposal requested from contemplated 
sole source awardee (B-115398, Feb. 6, 1978); 

• historically low loan application level (B-115398, Sept. 28, 1976); 

• late receipt of complete loan applications (B-195437.3, Feb. 5, 1988); 

• delay in awarding grants pending issuance of necessary regulations 
(B-171630, May 10, 1976); and 

• administrative determination of allowability and accuracy of claims for 
grant payments (B-115398, Oct. 16, 1975). 

Where the Department of Defense withheld military construction funds to 
improve program efficiency, not because of an unavoidable delay, and the 
Department did not take the necessary steps to implement the program 
while funds were temporarily unobligated, the withholding was an 
impoundment, not a programmatic delay. B-241514.2, Feb. 5, 1991. 

4. Audit and Review 
a. Basic Responsibilities Every federal department or agency has the initial and fundamental 
responsibility to ensure that its application of public funds adheres to the 
terms of the pertinent authorization and appropriation acts, as well as any 
other relevant statutory provisions. This responsibility—enhanced by the 
enactment of the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act and the 
creation of an Inspector General in many agencies—includes establishing 
and maintaining appropriate accounting and internal controls, one of 
which is an internal audit program. Ensuring the legality of proposed 
payments is also, under 31 U.S.C. § 3528, one of the basic responsibilities of 

Page 1-35 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

Introduction 

agency certifying officers. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 
No. 101-576, §§ 303, 304, 104 Stat. 2838, 2849–53 (Nov. 15, 1990), codified at 
31 U.S.C. § 3515 and §§ 3521(e)–(h)) provides for the preparation and audit 
of financial statements for those agencies required to establish Chief 
Financial Officers. In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, is 
required to annually prepare and submit to the President and Congress a 
financial statement for the executive branch of the government that has 
been audited by GAO. 31 U.S.C. § 331(e). GAO also regularly audits federal 
programs under the various authorities that we summarize in section C.2 of 
this chapter. 

b. GAO Recommendations 
and Matters for 
Consideration 
In carrying out its various responsibilities to examine the financial, 
management, and program activities of federal agencies, and to evaluate 
the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of agency operations, GAO 
reports to Congress both objective findings and recommendations for 
improvement. Recommendations are addressed to agency heads for action 
that the agency is authorized to take under existing law. Matters for 
consideration are addressed to Congress. 

Under section 236 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 720(b), whenever GAO issues a report that contains recommendations to 
the head of a federal agency, the agency must submit a written statement of 
the actions taken with respect to the recommendations to (1) the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on 
Government Reform, not later than 60 days after the date of the report and 

(2) the Senate and House Appropriations Committees in connection with 
the agency’s first request for appropriations submitted more than 60 days 
after the date of the report. As GAO pointed out in a letter to a private 
inquirer (B-207783, Apr. 1, 1983, nondecision letter), the law does not 
require the agency to comply with the recommendation, merely to report 
on the “actions taken,” which can range from full compliance to zero. The 
theory is that, if the agency disagrees with the GAO recommendation, 
Congress will have both positions so that it can then take whatever action it 
might deem appropriate. 
The term “agency” for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 720 is broadly defined to 
include any department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. government, 
including wholly owned but not mixed-ownership government 
corporations, or the District of Columbia government. 31 U.S.C. § 720(a). 
See also B-114831-O.M., July 28, 1975.

Introduction 

5. Account Closing Continuing our “life cycle” analogy, an appropriation “dies” in a sense at the 
end of its period of obligational availability. There is, however, an afterlife 
to the extent of any unexpended balances. Unexpended balances, both 
obligated and unobligated, retain a limited availability for five fiscal years 
following expiration of the period for which the source appropriation was 
made. At midnight on the last day of an appropriation’s period of 
availability, the appropriation account expires and is no longer available for 
incurring new obligations. The expired appropriation remains available for 
5 years for the purpose of paying obligations incurred prior to the account’s 
expiration and adjusting obligations that were previously unrecorded or 
under recorded. 31 U.S.C. § 1553(a). After 5 years, the expired account is 
closed and the balances remaining are canceled. 31 U.S.C. § 1552(a). These 
concepts are discussed in Chapter 5. 
E. The Role of the 
Accounting 
Officers: Legal 
Decisions 
1. A Capsule History Since the early days of the Republic, Congress, in exercising its oversight of 
the public purse, has utilized administrative officials for the settlement of 
public accounts and the review of federal expenditures. 
a. Accounting Officers Prior Throughout most of the nineteenth century, the accounting officers64 
to 1894 consisted of a series of comptrollers and auditors. Starting in 1817 with two 
comptrollers and four auditors, the number increased until, for the second 
half of the century, there were three co-equal comptrollers (First 
Comptroller, Second Comptroller, Commissioner of Customs) and six 
auditors (First Auditor, Second Auditor, etc.), all officials of the Treasury 
Department. The jurisdiction of the comptrollers and auditors was divided 
generally along departmental lines, with the auditors examining accounts 
and submitting their settlements to the appropriate comptroller. 

64 See section A of this chapter, footnote 2.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

b. 1894–1921: Comptroller of 
the Treasury 
The practice of rendering written decisions goes back at least to 1817. 
However, very little of this material exists in published form. (Until 
sometime after the Civil War, the decisions were handwritten.) 

There are no published decisions of the First Comptroller prior to the term 
of William Lawrence (1880–85). Lawrence published his decisions in a 
series of six annual volumes. After Lawrence’s decisions, a gap of 9 years 
followed until First Comptroller Robert Bowler published a single 
unnumbered volume of his 1893–94 decisions.65 

The decisions of the Second Comptroller and the Commissioner of 
Customs were never published. However, volumes of digests of decisions 
of the Second Comptroller were published starting in 1852. The first 
volume, unnumbered, saw three cumulative editions, the latest issued in 
1869 and including digests for the period 1817–69. Three additional 
volumes (designated volumes 2, 3, and 4) were published in 1884, 1893, and 
1899 (the latter being published several years after the office had ceased to 
exist), covering respectively, the periods 1869–84, 1884–93, and 1893–94.66 

Thus, material available in permanent form from this period consists of 
Lawrence’s six volumes, Bowler’s single volume, and four volumes of 
Second Comptroller digests. 

In 1894, Congress enacted the so-called Dockery Act, actually a part of the 
general appropriation act for 1895 (ch. 174, 28 Stat. 162, 205 (July 31, 
1894)), which consolidated the functions of the First and Second 
Comptrollers and the Commissioner of Customs into the newly created 
Comptroller of the Treasury. (The title was a reversion to one that had been 
used before 1817.) The six auditors remained, with different titles, but their 
settlements no longer had to be automatically submitted to the 
Comptroller. 

65 Citations to these are rarely encountered, and we have observed no consistent citation 
format, except that the First Comptroller’s name is always included to prevent confusion 
with the later Comptroller of the Treasury series. Example: 5 Lawrence, First Comp. 
Dec. 408 (1884). 

66 Digests are numbered consecutively within each volume. Citations should specify the 
digest number rather than the page number since several digests appear on each page. 
Example: 4 Dig. Second Comp. Dec. ¶ 35 (1893). Without the text of the decisions 
themselves, the digests are primarily of historical interest.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

The Dockery Act included a provision requiring the Comptroller of the 
Treasury to render decisions upon the request of an agency head or a 
disbursing officer. (Certifying officers did not exist back then.) Although 
this was to a large extent a codification of existing practice, it gave 
increased significance to the availability of the decisions. Accordingly, the 
first Comptroller of the Treasury (Robert Bowler, who had been First 
Comptroller when the Dockery Act passed) initiated the practice of 
publishing an annual volume of decisions “of such general character as will 
furnish precedents for the settlements of future accounts.” 1 Comp. Dec. iv 
(1896) (Preface). 
The Decisions of the Comptroller of the Treasury series consists of 27 
volumes covering the period 1894–1921.67 Comptroller of the Treasury 
decisions not included in the annual volumes exist in bound “manuscript 
volumes,” which are now in the custody of the National Archives, and are 
thus, unavailable as a practical matter. 
c. 1921 to the Present Time When the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 created the General 
Accounting Office, the offices of the Comptroller of the Treasury and the 
six Auditors were abolished and their functions transferred to the 
Comptroller General. Among these functions was the issuance of legal 
decisions to agency officials concerning the availability and use of 
appropriated funds. Thus, the decisions GAO issues today reflect the 
continuing evolution of a body of administrative law on federal fiscal 
matters dating back to the Nation’s infancy. We turn now to a brief 
description of this function under the stewardship of the Comptroller 
General. 
2. Decisions of the 
Comptroller General 
a. General Information Certain federal officials are entitled by statute to receive GAO decisions. 
The Comptroller General renders decisions in advance of payment when 
requested by disbursing officers, certifying officers, or the head of any 

67 These are cited by volume and page number, respectively, and the year of the decision, 
using the abbreviation “Comp. Dec.” Example: 19 Comp. Dec. 582 (1913). There is also a 
hefty (2,497 pages) volume, published in 1920, of digests of decisions appearing in 
volumes 1–26.

Introduction 

department or establishment of the federal government, who may be 
uncertain whether he or she has authority to make, or authorize the making 
of, particular payments. 31 U.S.C. § 3529. The Comptroller General also 
renders, for example, decisions to heads of agency components, including 
general counsels and inspectors general. See, e.g., B-291947, Aug. 15, 2003; 
B-285794, Dec. 5, 2000. The Comptroller General’s decisions are logically 
known as “advance decisions.” 

Decisions are also provided to disbursing and certifying officers who 
request review of a settlement of their accounts. 31 U.S.C. §§ 3527, 3528(b). 
In addition, the Comptroller General may, in his discretion, render 
decisions or legal opinions to other individuals or organizations, both 
inside and outside the government. 

A decision regarding an account of the government is binding on the 
executive branch68 and on the Comptroller General himself,69 but is not 
binding on a private party who, if dissatisfied, retains whatever recourse to 
the courts he would otherwise have had. The Comptroller General has no 
power to enforce decisions. Ultimately, agency officials who act contrary to 
Comptroller General decisions may have to respond to congressional 
appropriations and program oversight committees. 

There is no specific procedure for requesting a decision from the 
Comptroller General. A simple letter is usually sufficient. The request 
should, however, include all pertinent information or supporting material 
and should present any arguments the requestor wishes to have considered. 
GAO will also receive requests for decisions by e-mail. To submit a request

54 Comp. Gen. 921 (1975); 45 Comp. Gen. 335, 337 (1965). Comptroller General decisions on 
bid protests under the Competition in Contracting Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3551–3556, are advisory 
only. See Ameron, Inc. v. Corps of Engineers, 809 F.2d 979 (3rd Cir. 1986).

Introduction

www.gao.gov, and follow the instructions provided therein. 

A request for an advance decision submitted by a certifying officer will 
usually arise from “a voucher presented… for certification.” 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3529(a)(2). At one time, GAO insisted that the original voucher 
accompany the request and occasionally declined to render the decision if 
this was not done. See, e.g., 21 Comp. Gen. 1128 (1942). The requirement 
was eliminated in B-223608, Dec. 19, 1988: 

“Consistent with our current practice, submission of the 
original voucher need not accompany the request for an 
advance decision. Accordingly, in the future, the original 
voucher should be retained in the appropriate finance 
office. A photocopy accompanying the request for decision 
will be sufficient. Language to the contrary in prior 
decisions may be disregarded.” 

Even if no voucher is submitted, GAO will most likely render the decision 
notwithstanding the absence of a voucher if the question is of general 
interest and appears likely to recur. See, e.g., 55 Comp. Gen. 652 (1976); 
53 Comp. Gen. 429 (1973); 53 Comp. Gen. 71 (1973); 52 Comp. Gen. 83 
(1972). 

Often, requests for decisions will require factual development, and GAO 
will contact the agency as necessary to establish and document relevant 
facts. It is the usual practice of GAO to obtain the legal positions and views 
of the agency or agencies involved in the request for a decision or opinion. 

An involved party or agency may request reconsideration of a decision. The 
standard applied is whether the request demonstrates error of fact or law 
(e.g., B-184062, July 6, 1976) or presents new information not considered in 
the earlier decision. B-271838.2, May 23, 1997. While the Comptroller 
General gives precedential weight to prior decisions,70 a decision may be 
modified or overruled by a subsequent decision. In overruling its decisions, 

70 It is a general principle of administrative law that an agency or administrative board 
rendering administrative decisions should follow its own decisions or give a reasoned 
explanation for departure. See, e.g., Hinson v. National Transportation Safety Board, 
57 F.3d 1144 (D.C. Cir. 1995); Doubleday Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 655 F.2d 417, 422–23 
(D.C. Cir. 1981).

b. Matters Not Considered 
Chapter 1 
Introduction 

GAO tries to follow the approach summarized by the Comptroller of the 
Treasury in a 1902 decision: 

“I regret exceedingly the necessity of overruling decisions of 
this office heretofore made for the guidance of heads of 
departments and the protection of paying officers, and fully 
appreciate that certainty in decisions is greatly to be desired 
in order that uniformity of practice may obtain in the 
expenditure of the public money, but when a decision is 
made not only wrong in principle but harmful in its 
workings, my pride of decision is not so strong that when 
my attention is directed to such decision I will not promptly 
overrule it. It is a very easy thing to be consistent, that is, to 
insist that the horse is 16 feet high, but not so easy to get 
right and keep right.” 

8 Comp. Dec. 695, 697 (1902). 

GAO also entertains informal inquiries, via telephone and e-mail, regarding 
matters of appropriations law. To submit such an inquiry by e-mail, refer to 
the “Legal Products” page of GAO’s Web site, www.gao.gov, and follow the 
instructions provided therein. Informal opinions expressed by GAO 
officers or employees may not represent the views of the Comptroller 
General or GAO and are in no way controlling on any subsequent formal or 
official determinations by the Comptroller General. 56 Comp. Gen. 768, 
773–74 (1977); 31 Comp. Gen. 613 (1952); 29 Comp. Gen. 335 (1950); 
12 Comp. Gen. 207 (1932); 4 Comp. Gen. 1024 (1925). 

There are a number of areas in which, as a matter of law or policy, the 
Comptroller General will generally decline to render a decision. 

For example, as we discussed earlier in this chapter, effective June 30, 
1996, Congress transferred claims settlement authority under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3302 to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
Congress gave the director of OMB the authority to delegate this function 
to such agency or agencies as he deemed appropriate. See, e.g., B-278805, 
July 21, 1999. 

Other areas where the Comptroller General will decline to render decisions 
include questions concerning which the determination of another agency is 
by law “final and conclusive.” Examples are determinations on the merits 
of a claim against another agency under the Federal Tort Claims Act 

Page 1-42 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 1 
Introduction 

(28 U.S.C. § 2672) or the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees’ Claims 
Act of 1964 (31 U.S.C. § 3721). Another example is a decision by the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs on a claim for veterans’ benefits (38 U.S.C. 
§ 511). See 56 Comp. Gen. 587, 591 (1977); B-266193, Feb. 23, 1996; 
B-226599.2, Nov. 3, 1988 (nondecision letter). 

In addition, GAO has traditionally declined to render decisions in a number 
of areas that are specifically within the jurisdiction of some other agency 
and concerning which GAO would not be in the position to make 
authoritative determinations, even though the other agency’s determination 
is not statutorily “final and conclusive.” Thus, GAO will not “decide” 
whether a given action violates a provision of the Criminal Code (Title 18 of 
the United States Code) since this is within the jurisdiction of the Justice 
Department and the courts.71 If the use of public funds is an element of the 
alleged violation, the extent of GAO’s involvement will be to determine if 
appropriated funds were in fact used and to refer the matter to the Justice 
Department if deemed appropriate or if requested to do so.72 

Other examples of areas where GAO has declined to render decisions are 
antitrust law,73 political activities of federal employees under the Hatch 
Act,74 and determinations as to what is or is not taxable under the Internal 
Revenue Code.75

Introduction 

GAO avoids opining on an issue that is the subject of current litigation, 
unless the court expresses an interest in receiving GAO’s opinion.76 GAO’s 
policy with respect to issues that are the subject of agency administrative 
proceedings is generally similar to its litigation policy. See 69 Comp. 
Gen. 134 (1989) (declining to render an opinion on the propriety of an 
attorney’s fee award being considered by the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission). See also B-259632, June 12, 1995. 

Another long-standing GAO policy concerns the constitutionality of acts of 
Congress. As an agent of Congress, GAO recognizes that it is neither our 
role nor our province to opine on or adjudicate the constitutionality of duly 
enacted statutes. Such laws come to GAO with a heavy presumption in 
favor of their constitutionality and, like the courts, GAO will construe 
statutes narrowly to avoid constitutional issues.77 Immigration & 
Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 299, n.12 (2001); 
B-300192, Nov. 13, 2002 (regarding a provision in the fiscal year 2003 
Continuing Resolution, Pub. L. No. 107-229, § 117, 116 Stat. 1465, 1468 
(Sept. 30, 2002), prohibiting the use of appropriations to acquire private 
sector printing and specifically prohibiting the use of appropriations to pay 
for printing the President’s Budget other than through the Government 
Printing Office: “Given our authority to settle and audit the accounts of the 
government…, we will apply laws as we find them absent a controlling 
opinion that such laws are unconstitutional”). GAO will, however, express 

76 58 Comp. Gen. 282, 286 (1979); B-240908, Sept. 11, 1990; B-218900, July 9, 1986; B-217954, 
July 30, 1985; B-203737, July 14, 1981; B-179473, Mar. 7, 1974; A-36314, Apr. 29, 1931. For 
examples of cases where GAO’s opinion was requested by a court, see 56 Comp. Gen. 768 
(1977) and B-186494, July 22, 1976. Also, under 28 U.S.C. § 2507, the United States Court of 
Federal Claims may issue a “call” upon GAO (or any other agency) for comments on a 
particular issue or for other information. 

77 B-215863, July 26, 1984; B-210922.1, June 27, 1983; B-114578, Nov. 9, 1973; B-157984, 
Nov. 26, 1965; B-124985, Aug. 17, 1955; A-23385, June 28, 1928; see also Youngstown Sheet & 
Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952). Except for matters perceived as involving 
conflicts between the prerogatives of the executive and legislative branches, the Attorney 
General has expressed a similar policy. See, e.g., 39 Op. Att’y Gen. 11 (1937); 20 Op. Off. 
Legal Counsel 214, 226 (1996). In B-300192, Nov. 13, 2002, Walter Dellinger, the United States 
Assistant Attorney General is quoted as stating: 

“When the President’s obligation to execute laws enacted by Congress is in 

tension with his responsibility to act in accordance with the Constitution, 

questions arise that really go to the very heart of the system. And the President 

can decline to comply with the law, in our view, only where there is a 

judgment where the Supreme Court has resolved the issue.”

its opinion, upon the request of a Member or committee of Congress, on the 
constitutionality of a bill prior to enactment. E.g., B-360241, Mar. 18, 2003; 
B-300192, supra; B-228805, Sept. 28, 1987. 
c. Research Aids Between July 1921 and September 1994, decisions that the General Counsel 
determined had wide applicability were published annually in hardbound 
volumes entitled Decisions of the Comptroller General. All other decisions, 
after GAO had distributed copies to the requester and other interested 
parties, were filed at GAO and available publicly upon request. There is no 
legal distinction between a decision published in Decisions of the 
Comptroller General and an unpublished decision. 28 Comp. Gen. 69 
(1948). Since 1994, all decisions have been posted to the GAO Internet Web 
site, www.gao.gov. The decisions are available at the GAO Web site only for 
a period of 60 days. After 60 days, the Government Printing Office (GPO) 
posts GAO’s decision to its GPO Access WAIS system, an archival system. 
Researchers can access the GPO system through GAO’s Web site. The GPO 
system includes GAO decisions issued since January 1996. GAO’s Office of 
General Counsel will assist researchers who have difficulty locating a copy 
of GAO decisions. 
Some of the computerized legal research systems (e.g., Lexis, Westlaw) 
carry Comptroller General decisions. Researchers might also find decisions 
available through the Air Force’s Federal Legal Information Through 
Electronics (FLITE) Web site. GAO’s procurement decisions are published 
commercially, and some of the commercial “newsletter” services include 
summaries of other GAO issuances, including appropriations law 
decisions. 
d. Note on Citations Decisions of the Comptroller General published in the Decisions of the 
Comptroller General volumes are cited by volume, page number on which 
the decision begins, and the year. For example: 31 Comp. Gen. 350 (1952). 
Unpublished decisions before 1994 and all decisions thereafter are cited by 
file number and date. For example: B-193282, Dec. 21, 1978. The present 
file numbering system (“B-numbers”) has been in use since January 1939. 
From 1924 through 1938, file numbers had an “A” prefix.78 

78 Cases prior to 1924 were classified according to type into one of four categories: advance 
decision (A.D. 1234), review decision (Review No. 2345), division memorandum (D.M.) 
3456, or appeal (Appeal No. 4567). In addition, some of the earliest decisions have no file 
designation. These must be cited by reference to the “manuscript volume” in which the 
decision appears. (These volumes are maintained by GAO, containing the written products 
of the Office of General Counsel for a given month in chronological sequence.) Example: 
unpublished decision of September 1, 1921, 1 MS Comp. Gen. 712.

Introduction 

3. Other Relevant 
Authorities 
a. GAO Materials GAO expresses its positions in many forms. Most of the GAO materials cited 
in this publication are decisions of the Comptroller General. While these 
constitute the most significant body of GAO positions on legal issues, the 
editors have also included, as appropriate, citations to the following items: 
1. Legal opinions to Congress—GAO prepares legal opinions at the 
request of congressional committees or individual Members of 
Congress. Congressional opinions are prepared in letter rather than 
decision format, but have the same weight and effect as decisions. The 
citation form is identical to that for decisions. As a practical matter, 
except where specifically identified in the text, the reader will not be 
able to distinguish between a decision and a congressional opinion 
based on the form of the citation. 
2. Office memoranda—Legal questions are frequently presented by other 
divisions or offices within GAO. The response is in the form of an 
internal memorandum, formerly signed by the Comptroller General, but 
now, for the most part, signed by the General Counsel or someone on 
the General Counsel’s staff. The citation is the same as for an 
unpublished decision, except that the suffix “O.M.” (Office 
Memorandum) has traditionally been added. More recent material 
tends to omit the suffix, in which case our practice in this publication is 
to identify the citation as a memorandum to avoid confusion with 
decisions. Office memoranda are usually not cited in decisions. 
Technically, an office memorandum is not a decision of the Comptroller 
General as provided in 31 U.S.C. § 3529, does not have the same legal or 
precedential effect, and should never be cited as a decision. See, e.g., 
A-10786, May 23, 1927. Instead, office memoranda represent the views 
of the General Counsel or members of the General Counsel’s staff. 
Notwithstanding these limitations, we have included selected citations 
to GAO office memoranda, particularly where they provide guidance in 
the absence of formal decisions on a given point or contain useful 
research or discussion. 
3. Audit reports—A GAO audit report is cited by its title, date of issuance, 
and a numerical designation. Up to the mid-1970s, the same file 
numbering system was used as in decisions (“B-numbers”). From the 
mid-1970s until October 2000, the designation for an audit report 

Page 1-46 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 1 
Introduction 

consisted of the initials of the issuing division, the fiscal year, and the 
report number, although a “B-number” was also assigned. Now the 
designation includes only the fiscal year and the report number. 
Reports are numbered sequentially within each fiscal year. 

Several audit reports are cited throughout this publication either as 
authority for some legal proposition or to provide sources of additional 
information to supplement the discussion in the text. To prevent 
confusion stemming from different citation formats used over the 
years, our practice in this publication is to always identify an audit 
report as a “GAO report” in the text, in addition to the citation. 

As required by 31 U.S.C. § 719(g), GAO issues monthly and annual lists 
of reports. In addition, GAO occasionally prepares bibliographies of 
reports and decisions in a given subject area (food, land use, etc.). The 
lists and GAO reports can be found at GAO’s Web site, www.gao.gov. 

In addition to the reports themselves, GAO publishes a number of 
pamphlets and other documents relating to its audit function. See, e.g., 

U.S.General Accounting Office, Government Auditing Standards, 
GAO-03-673G (Washington, D.C.: June 2003) (known as the “Yellow 
Book”). References to any of these will be fully described in the text 
where they occur. 
4. Nondecision letters—On occasion, GAO may issue letters, signed by 
some subordinate official on the General Counsel’s staff, usually to an 
individual or organization who has requested information or who has 
requested a legal opinion, but is not entitled by law to a formal decision. 
Their purpose is basically to convey information rather than resolve a 
legal issue. Several of these are cited in this publication, either because 
they offer a particularly clear statement of some policy or position, or 
to supplement the material found in the decisions. Each is identified 
parenthetically. The citation form is otherwise identical to an 
unpublished decision. As with the office memoranda, these are not 
decisions of the Comptroller General and do not have the same legal or 
precedential effect. 
5. Circular letters—A circular letter is a letter addressed simply to the 
“Heads of Federal Departments and Agencies” or to “Federal Certifying 
and Disbursing Officers.” Circular letters, although not common, are 
used for a variety of purposes and may emanate from a particular 
division within GAO or directly from the Comptroller General. Circular 
Page 1-47 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 1 
Introduction 

letters that announce significant changes in pertinent legal 
requirements or GAO audit policy or procedures are occasionally cited 
in this publication. They are identified as such and often, but not 
always, bear file designations similar to unpublished decisions. See 
B-275605, Mar. 17, 1997 (announcing changes resulting from the 
transfer of claims settlement and other related functions). 

6. GAO’s Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal 
Agencies—Originally published in 1957 as a large loose-leaf volume, 
this was, for many years, the official medium through which the 
Comptroller General issued accounting principles and standards and 
related material for the development of accounting systems and 
internal auditing programs, uniform procedures, and regulations 
governing GAO’s relationship with other federal agencies and private 
parties. Of the eight original titles of the volume, only three remain in 
effect. The title of particular relevance for federal appropriations law is 
Title 7, “Fiscal Procedures.” It is an important complement to this 
manual. Researchers can access Title 7 on GAO’s Web site, 
www.gao.gov. 
7. Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process (Exposure 
Draft), GAO/AFMD-2.1.1 (Jan. 1993)—This publication contains 
standard definitions of fiscal and budgetary terms. It is published by 
GAO as required by 31 U.S.C. § 1112(c), and is updated periodically. 
Definitions used throughout Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 
are based on the Glossary unless otherwise noted. 
b. Non-GAO Materials As we have emphasized, the primary focus of this publication is the 
issuance of GAO, particularly legal decisions and opinions. Manifestly, 
however, various non-GAO authorities require inclusion. 
References to legislative materials should be readily recognizable. 
Citations to the United States Code are to the edition or its supplements 
current as of the time of publication, unless specified otherwise. We specify 
the year only when referring to an obsolete edition of the Code. Section 
numbers and even title numbers may change over the years as a result of 
amendments or recodifications. For convenience and (we hope) clarity, we 
have generally used current citations even though the referenced decision 
may have used an older obsolete citation. Where the difference is 
significant, it will be noted in the text.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

c. Note on Title 31 
Recodification 
We have also included relevant decisions and opinions of other 
administrative agencies, although our research in these areas has not been 
exhaustive. For example, we have included some relevant opinions of the 
Attorney General. The Attorney General renders legal opinions pursuant to 
various provisions of law. E.g., 28 U.S.C. §§ 511–513. There are two series 
of published opinions. Those signed by the Attorney General are called 
“formal opinions,” and are published in volumes entitled Official Opinions 
of the Attorneys General of the United States Advising the President and 
Heads of Departments in Relation to Their Official Duties (cited “Op. 
Att’y Gen.”). The series started in 1852 and now numbers 43 volumes. They 
are published at irregular intervals. 

The second series consists of selected opinions by the Justice Department’s 
Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which prepares and issues legal opinions 
under delegation from the Attorney General. Commencing in 1977, 
volumes 1–20 of the Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel have thus far 
been published. Logically enough, they are cited “Op. Off. Legal Counsel.” 
Given the lengthy intervals in recent decades between volumes of the 
“formal” Attorney General opinions, these are now included in the OLC 
volumes as well. We have used a parallel citation format to identify this 
latter group. Example: 43 Op. Att’y Gen. 224, 4A Op. Off. Legal Counsel 16 
(1980). 

A Treasury Department publication cited a number of times is the Treasury 
Financial Manual (TFM), Volume I. This, also issued in loose-leaf form, is 
the Treasury Department’s detailed procedural guidance on fiscal matters 
(central accounting and reporting, receipts, disbursements, etc.). The TFM 
is indispensable for finance personnel. 

Many of the key statutes of general applicability that govern the use of 
appropriated funds are found in Title 31 of the United States Code (U.S.C.). 
Title 31 was recodified on September 13, 1982 (Pub. L. No. 97-258, 96 Stat. 
877). A recodification is intended as a— 

“compilation, restatement, and revision of the general and 
permanent laws of the United States which conforms to the 
understood policy, intent, and purpose of the Congress in 
the original enactments, with such amendments and 
corrections as will remove ambiguities, contradictions, and 
other imperfections both of substance and of form… .” 

Page 1-49 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 1 
Introduction 

2 U.S.C. § 285b(1). Enactment of a recodification transforms the title into 
“positive law.” A recodified title is legal evidence of the law, and resorting 
to the Statutes at Large for evidentiary purposes is no longer necessary. 

The recodification of Title 31 is essentially a restatement in updated form. 
It is not supposed to make any substantive change in the law. This point is 
made in the statute itself (Pub. L. No. 97-258, § 4(a), 96 Stat. 1067, 31 U.S.C. 
note preceding § 101) and in the accompanying report of the House 
Judiciary Committee (H.R. Rep. No. 97-651, at 3 (1982)). In addition, the 
courts will not read a substantive change into a recodification in the 
absence of evidence that Congress intended a substantive change. E.g., 
Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U.S. 200, 209 (1993); United States v. 
Thompson, 319 F.2d 665, 669 (2nd Cir. 1963).

A. Appropriations and 
Related 
Terminology 
1. Introduction The reader will find it useful to have a basic understanding of certain 
appropriations law terminology that will be routinely encountered 
throughout this publication. Some of our discussion will draw upon 
definitions that have been enacted into law for application in various 
budgetary contexts. Other definitions are drawn from custom and usage in 
the budget and appropriations process, in conjunction with administrative 
and judicial decisions. 
In addition, 31 U.S.C. § 1112(c), previously noted in Chapter 1, requires the 
Comptroller General, in cooperation with the Treasury Department, Office 
of Management and Budget, and Congressional Budget Office, to maintain 
and publish standard terms and classifications for “fiscal, budget, and 
program information,” giving particular consideration to the needs of the 
congressional budget, appropriations, and revenue committees. Federal 
agencies are required by 31 U.S.C. § 1112(d) to use this standard 
terminology when providing information to Congress. 
The terminology developed pursuant to this authority is published in a GAO 
booklet entitled A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process 
(Exposure Draft), GAO/AFMD-2.1.1 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 1993) 
[hereinafter Glossary]. Unless otherwise noted, the terminology used 
throughout this publication is based on the Glossary. 1 The following 
sections present some of the more important terminology in the budget and 
appropriations process. Many other terms will be defined in the chapters 
that deal specifically with them. 
2. Concept and Types of 
Budget Authority 
Congress finances federal programs and activities by providing “budget 
authority.” Budget authority is a general term referring to various forms of 
authority provided by law to enter into financial obligations that will result 

1 The Office of Management and Budget adopted these definitions in OMB Circular No. A-11, 
Preparation, Submission and Execution of the Budget (July 25, 2003).

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

in immediate or future outlays of government funds. As defined by the 
Congressional Budget Act, “budget authority” includes: 

“(i) provisions of law that make funds available for 
obligation and expenditure (other than borrowing 
authority), including the authority to obligate and expend 
the proceeds of offsetting receipts and collections; 

“(ii) borrowing authority, which means authority granted to 
a Federal entity to borrow and obligate and expend the 
borrowed funds, including through the issuance of 
promissory notes or other monetary credits; 

“(iii) contract authority, which means the making of funds 
available for obligation but not for expenditure; and 

“(iv) offsetting receipts and collections as negative budget 
authority, and the reduction thereof as positive budget 
authority. 

“The term includes the cost for direct loan and loan 
guarantee programs, as those terms are defined by [the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. 
No. 101-508, § 13201(a)].” 2 

a. Appropriations Appropriations are the most common form of budget authority. As we have 
seen in Chapter 1 in our discussion of the congressional “power of the 
purse,” the Constitution prohibits the withdrawal of money from the 
Treasury unless authorized in the form of an appropriation enacted by 
Congress.3 Thus, funds paid out of the United States Treasury must be 
2 Section 3(2) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. 
§ 622(2) and note, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. 
No. 101-508, §§ 13201(b) and 13211(a), 104 Stat. 1388, 1388-614 and 1388-620 (Nov. 5, 1990). 
Prior to the Congressional Budget Act, the term “obligational authority” was frequently used 
instead of budget authority. 

3 The Constitution does not specify precisely what assets comprise the “Treasury” of the 
United States. An important statute in this regard is 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b), discussed in detail 
in Chapter 6, which requires that, unless otherwise provided, a government agency must 
deposit any funds received from sources other than its appropriations in the general fund of 
the Treasury, where they are then available to be appropriated as Congress may see fit. 

Page 2-4 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

accounted for by charging them to an appropriation provided by or derived 
from an act of Congress. 

The term “appropriation” may be defined as:

 “Authority given to federal agencies to incur obligations 
and to make payments from Treasury for specified 
purposes.”4 

While other forms of budget authority may authorize the incurring of 
obligations, the authority to incur obligations by itself is not sufficient to 
authorize payments from the Treasury. See, e.g., National Ass’n of 
Regional Councils v. Costle, 564 F.2d 583, 586 (D.C. Cir. 1977); New York 
Airways, Inc. v. United States, 369 F.2d 743 (Ct. Cl. 1966). Thus, at some 
point if obligations are paid, they are paid by and from an appropriation. 
Section B.1 of this chapter discusses in more detail precisely what types of 
statutes constitute appropriations. 

Appropriations do not represent cash actually set aside in the Treasury. 
They represent legal authority granted by Congress to incur obligations and 
to make disbursements for the purposes, during the time periods, and up to 
the amount limitations specified in the appropriation acts. See United 
States ex rel. Becker v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 305 F.3d 284 
(4th Cir. 2002). 

Appropriations are identified on financial documents by means of “account 
symbols,” which are assigned by the Treasury Department, based on the 
number and types of appropriations an agency receives and other types of 
funds it may control. An appropriation account symbol is a group of 
numbers, or a combination of numbers and letters, which identifies the 
agency responsible for the account, the period of availability of the 
appropriation, and the specific fund classification. Detailed information on 
reading and identifying account symbols is contained in the Treasury 
Financial Manual (I TFM 2-1500). Specific accounts for each agency are 
listed in a publication entitled Federal Account Symbols and Titles, issued 
quarterly as a supplement to the TFM.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

b. Contract Authority Contract authority is a form of budget authority that permits obligations to 
be incurred in advance of appropriations. Glossary at 22. It is to be 
distinguished from the inherent authority to enter into contracts possessed 
by every government agency, but which depends on the availability of 
funds. 
Contract authority itself is not an appropriation; it provides the authority to 
enter into binding contracts but not the funds to make payments under 
them. Therefore, contract authority must be funded (or, in other words, the 
funds needed to liquidate obligations under the contracts must be 
provided) by a subsequent appropriation (called a “liquidating 
appropriation”) or by the use of receipts or offsetting collections 
authorized for that purpose. See PCL Construction Service, Inc. v. United 
States, 41 Fed. Cl. 242 (1998); National Ass’n of Regional Councils v. 
Costle, 564 F.2d 583, 586 (D.C. Cir. 1977); B-300167, Nov. 15, 2002; B-228732, 
Feb. 18, 1988. 

Contract authority may be provided in appropriation acts (e.g., B-174839, 
Mar. 20, 1984) or, more commonly, in other types of legislation (e.g., 
B-228732, Feb. 18, 1988). Either way, the authority must be specific. 
31 U.S.C. § 1301(d). As we noted in Chapter 1, one of the objectives of the 
Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was to 
provide increased control by the appropriations process over various forms 
of so-called “backdoor spending” such as contract authority. To this end, 
legislation providing new contract authority will be subject to a point of 
order in either the Senate or the House of Representatives unless it also 
provides that the new authority will be effective for any fiscal year only to 
such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation 
acts. 2 U.S.C. § 651(a). 

Contract authority has a “period of availability” analogous to that for an 
appropriation. Unless otherwise specified, if it appears in an appropriation 
act in connection with a particular appropriation, its period of availability 
will be the same as that for the appropriation. If it appears in an 
appropriation act without reference to a particular appropriation, its period 
of availability, again unless otherwise specified, will be the fiscal year 
covered by the appropriation act. 32 Comp. Gen. 29, 31 (1952); B-76061, 
May 14, 1948. See Cray Research, Inc. v. United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 327, 331 

n.4(1999); Costle, 564 F.2d at 587–88. This period of availability refers to 
the time period during which the contracts must be entered into. 
Page 2-6 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

As noted above, appropriations constitute budget authority. An 
appropriation to liquidate contract authority, however, is not new budget 
authority, since contract authority itself constitutes new budget authority. 
This treatment is necessary to avoid counting the amounts twice. B-171630, 
Aug. 14, 1975. 

Since the contracts entered into pursuant to contract authority constitute 
obligations binding on the United States, Congress has little practical 
choice but to make the necessary liquidating appropriations. B-228732, 
Feb. 18, 1988; B-226887, Sept. 17, 1987. As the Supreme Court has put it:

 “The expectation is that appropriations will be 

automatically forthcoming to meet these contractual 

commitments. This mechanism considerably reduces 

whatever discretion Congress might have exercised in the 

course of making annual appropriations.” 

Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 39 n.2 (1975). A failure or refusal by 
Congress to make the necessary appropriation would not defeat the 
obligation, and the party entitled to payment would most likely be able to 
recover in a lawsuit. E.g., B-211190, Apr. 5, 1983. 

c. Borrowing Authority “Borrowing authority” is authority that permits agencies to incur 
obligations and make payments to liquidate the obligations out of 
borrowed moneys.5 Borrowing authority may consist of (a) authority to 
borrow from the Treasury (authority to borrow funds from the Treasury 
that are realized from the sale of public debt securities), (b) authority to 
borrow directly from the public (authority to sell agency debt securities), 
(c) authority to borrow from (sell agency debt securities to) the Federal 
Financing Bank, or (d) some combination of the above. 
Borrowing from the Treasury is the most common form and is also known 
as “public debt financing.” As a general proposition, GAO has traditionally 
expressed a preference for financing through direct appropriations on the 
grounds that the appropriations process provides enhanced congressional 
control. E.g., B-301397, Sept. 4, 2003; B-141869, July 26, 1961. The 
Congressional Budget Act met this concern to an extent by requiring 
generally that new borrowing authority, as with new contract authority, be 

5 Glossary at 22.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

limited to the extent or amounts provided in appropriation acts. 2 U.S.C. 
§ 651(a). GAO has recommended that borrowing authority be provided 
only to those accounts that can generate enough revenue in the form of 
collections from nonfederal sources to repay their debt. U.S. General 
Accounting Office, Budget Issues: Budgeting for Federal Capital, 
GAO/AIMD-97-5 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 12, 1996); Budget Issues: Agency 
Authority to Borrow Should Be Granted More Selectively, GAO/AFMD-89-4 
(Washington, D.C.: Sept. 15, 1989).6 On occasion, however, GAO has 
recommended borrowing authority when supplemental appropriations 
might otherwise be necessary. See U.S. General Accounting Office, 
Aviation Insurance: Federal Insurance Program Needs Improvements to 
Ensure Success, GAO/RCED-94-151 (Washington, D.C.: July 15, 1994). 

d. Monetary Credits A type of borrowing authority specified in the expanded definition of 
budget authority contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1990 is monetary credits. The monetary credit is a relatively uncommon 
concept in government transactions. At the present time, it exists mostly in 
a handful of statutes authorizing the government to use monetary credits to 
acquire property such as land or mineral rights. Examples are the 
Rattlesnake National Recreation Area and Wilderness Act of 1980, 
discussed in 62 Comp. Gen. 102 (1982), and the Cranberry Wilderness Act, 
discussed in B-211306, Apr. 9, 1984.7 
Under the monetary credit procedure, the government does not issue a 
check in payment for the acquired property. Instead, it gives the seller 
“credits” in dollar amounts reflecting the purchase price. The holder may 
then use these credits to offset or reduce amounts it owes the government 
in other transactions that may, depending on the terms of the governing 
legislation, be related or unrelated to the original transaction. The statute 
may use the term “monetary credit” (as in the Cranberry legislation) or 

6 If an agency cannot repay with external collections, it must either extend its debt with new 
borrowings, seek appropriations to repay the debt, or seek to have the debt forgiven by 
statute. Repayment from external collections is the only alternative that reimburses the 
Treasury in any meaningful sense. See GAO/AFMD-89-4 at 17, 20. 

7 These and other examples are noted in the report: U.S. General Accounting Office, Budget 
Treatment of Monetary Credits, GAO/AFMD-85-21 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 8, 1985). For 
more recent examples, see Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument Completion Act, 
Pub. L. No. 105-279, 112 Stat. 2690 (Oct. 23, 1998); Kentucky National Forest Land Transfer 
Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-429, app. A-1, 114 Stat. 1900, 1900A-71 (Nov. 6, 2000); and Pueblo 
of Acoma Land and Mineral Consolidation, Pub. L. No. 107-138, 116 Stat. 6 (Feb. 6, 2002).

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

some other designation such as “bidding rights” (as in the Rattlesnake Act). 
Where this procedure is authorized, the acquiring agency does not need to 
have appropriations or other funds available to cover the purchase price 
because no cash disbursement is made. An analogous device authorized for 
use by the Commodity Credit Corporation is “commodity certificates.”8 

The inclusion of monetary credits as budget authority has the effect of 
making them subject to the appropriation controls of the Congressional 
Budget Act, such as the requirements of 2 U.S.C. § 651. 

e. Offsetting Receipts The federal government receives money from numerous sources and in 
numerous contexts. For budgetary purposes, collections are classified in 
two major categories, governmental receipts and offsetting collections.9 
Governmental receipts or budget receipts are collections resulting from 
the government’s exercise of its sovereign or regulatory powers. Examples 
are tax receipts, customs duties, and court fines. Collections in this 
category are deposited in receipt accounts and are compared against total 
outlays for purposes of calculating the budget surplus or deficit. 

Offsetting collections are collections resulting from business-type or 
market-oriented activities, such as the sale of goods or services to the 
public, and intragovernmental transactions. Their budgetary treatment 
differs from governmental receipts in that they are offset against (deducted 
from or “netted against”) budget authority in determining total outlays. 
Offsetting collections are also divided into two major categories.10 

First is offsetting collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts. 
These are collections which, under specific statutory authority, may be 
deposited in an appropriation or fund account under the control of the 
receiving agency and which are then available for obligation by the agency 
subject to the purpose and time limitations of the receiving account.

USDA’s Commodity Certificates, GAO/RCED-87-117BR (Mar. 26, 1987).

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

f. Loan and Loan Guarantee 
Authority 
Second is offsetting receipts. Offsetting receipts are offsetting collections 
that are deposited in a receipt account.11 For budgetary purposes, these 
amounts are deducted from budget authority by function or subfunction 
and by agency.12 

The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, Pub. L. 
No. 99-177, 99 Stat. 1038 (Dec. 12, 1985), first addressed the budgetary 
treatment of offsetting receipts by adding the authority “to collect 
offsetting receipts” to the definition of budget authority. The expanded 
definition in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. 
No. 101-508, 104 Stat. 1388 (Nov. 5, 1990), is more explicit. The authority to 
obligate and expend the proceeds of offsetting receipts and collections is 
treated as negative budget authority. In addition, the reduction of offsetting 
receipts or collections (e.g., legislation authorizing an agency to forego 
certain collections) is treated as positive budget authority.13 

A loan guarantee is any guarantee, insurance, or other pledge with respect 
to the payment of all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt 
obligation of a nonfederal borrower to a nonfederal lender.14 The 
government does not know whether or to what extent it may be required to 
honor the guarantee until there has been a default. Loan guarantees are 
contingent liabilities that may not be recorded as obligations until the 
contingency occurs. See 64 Comp. Gen. 282, 289 (1985); B-290600, July 10, 
2002. See also Chapter 11. 

Prior to legislation enacted in November 1990, loan guarantees were 
expressly excluded from the definition of budget authority. Budget 
authority was created only when an appropriation to liquidate loan 
guarantee authority was made. 

11 This usually means a general fund receipt account (miscellaneous receipts), but also 
includes amounts deposited in special or trust fund accounts. See American Medical 
Ass’n v. Reno, 857 F. Supp. 80 (D.D.C. 1994); B-199216, July 21, 1980. 

12 H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-433, at 102 (1985). This is the conference report on the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. 

13 This was the intent of the 1985 legislation, as reflected in the conference report, supra, 
although it had not been expressed in the legislation itself. 

14 Glossary at 50–51.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Statutory reform of the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs 
came about in two stages. First, the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985 added a definition of “credit authority” to the 
Congressional Budget Act, specifically, “authority to incur direct loan 
obligations or to incur primary loan guarantee commitments.” 2 U.S.C. 
§ 622(10).15 Any bill, resolution, or conference report providing new credit 
authority will be subject to a point of order unless the new authority is 
limited to the extent or amounts provided in advance in appropriation acts. 
2 U.S.C. § 651(a).16 

The second stage was the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990,17 effective 
starting with fiscal year 1992. Under this legislation, the “cost” of loan and 
loan guarantee programs is budget authority. Cost means the estimated 
long-term cost to the government of a loan or loan guarantee (defaults, 
delinquencies, interest subsidies, etc.), calculated on a net present value 
basis, excluding administrative costs. Except for entitlement programs (the 
statute notes the guaranteed student loan program and the veterans’ home 
loan guaranty program as examples) and certain Commodity Credit 
Corporation programs, new loan guarantee commitments may be made 
only to the extent budget authority to cover their costs is provided in 
advance or other treatment is specified in appropriation acts. 
Appropriations of budget authority are to be made to “credit program 
accounts,” and the programs administered from revolving nonbudgetary 
“financing accounts.” 

The Federal Credit Reform Act reflects the thrust of proposals by GAO, the 
Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, and 
the Senate Budget Committee. See U.S. General Accounting Office, Credit 
Reform: U.S. Needs Better Method for Estimating Cost of Foreign Loans 
and Guarantees, GAO/NSIAD/GGD-95-31 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 19, 
1994); Credit Reform: Case-by-Case Assessment Advisable in Evaluating 

15 The statute does not further define the term “primary loan guarantee.” 

16 This is the same control device we have previously noted for contract authority and 
borrowing authority. Although loan guarantee authority was not viewed as budget authority 
in 1985, the apparent rationale was that the control, if it is to be employed, must apply at the 
authorization stage because the opportunity for control no longer exists by the time 
liquidating budget authority becomes necessary. An example of a statute including this 
language is discussed in B-230951, Mar. 10, 1989. 

17 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508, § 13201(a), 104 Stat. 
1388, 1388-609 (Nov. 5, 1990).

D.C.: Apr. 10, 1989) (discussion of the “net present value” approach to 
calculating costs). 

3. Some Related Concepts 
a. Spending Authority The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 introduced the concept of “spending 
authority.” The term is a collective designation for authority provided in 
laws other than appropriation acts to obligate the United States to make 
payments. It includes, to the extent budget authority is not provided in 
advance in appropriation acts, permanent appropriations (such as 
authority to spend offsetting collections), the nonappropriation forms of 
budget authority described above (e.g., contract authority, borrowing 
authority, and authority to forego collection of offsetting receipts), 
entitlement authority, and any other authority to make payments. 2 U.S.C. 
§ 651(c)(2). The different forms of spending authority are subject to 
varying controls in the budget and appropriations process. See Chapter 1, 
sections C and D. For example, as noted previously, proposed legislation 
providing new contract authority or new borrowing authority will be 
subject to a point of order unless it limits the new authority to such extent 
or amounts as provided in appropriation acts. 
Further information on spending authority may be found in two 1987 GAO 
companion reports—one a summary presentation18 and the other a detailed 
inventory19—as well as in more recent updates.20

The Legal Framework 

b. Entitlement Authority Entitlement authority is statutory authority, whether temporary or 
permanent, 
“to make payments (including loans and grants), the budget 
authority for which is not provided for in advance by 
appropriation Acts, to any person or government if, under 
the provisions of the law containing that authority, the 
United States is obligated to make such payments to 
persons or governments who meet the requirements 
established by that law.”21 
Entitlement authority is treated as spending authority during congressional 
consideration of the budget. In order to make entitlements subject to the 
reconciliation process, the Congressional Budget Act provides that 
proposed legislation providing new entitlement authority to become 
effective prior to the start of the next fiscal year will be subject to a point of 
order. 2 U.S.C. § 651(b)(1). Entitlement legislation, which would require 
new budget authority in excess of the allocation made pursuant to the most 
recent budget resolution, must be referred to the appropriations 
committees. Id. § 651(b)(2). 
4. Types of Appropriations Appropriations are classified in different ways for different purposes. Some 
are discussed elsewhere in this publication.22 The following classifications, 
although phrased in terms of appropriations, apply equally to the broader 
concept of budget authority. 
a. Classification Based on 
Duration23 
1. One-year appropriation: An appropriation that is available for 
obligation only during a specific fiscal year. This is the most common 
type of appropriation. It is also known as a “fiscal year” or “annual” 
appropriation. 

21 2 U.S.C. § 622(9)(A); Glossary at 44. 

22 Supplemental and deficiency appropriations are discussed in Chapter 6, section D; lump-
sum and line-item appropriations in Chapter 6, section F; and continuing resolutions in 
Chapter 8.

2. Multiple year appropriation: An appropriation that is available for 
obligation for a definite period of time in excess of one fiscal year. 
3. No-year appropriation: An appropriation that is available for 
obligation for an indefinite period. A no-year appropriation is usually 
identified by appropriation language such as “to remain available until 
expended.” 
b. Classification Based on 1. Definite appropriation: An appropriation of a specific amount of 
Presence or Absence of money.

2. Indefinite appropriation: An appropriation of an unspecified amount 
of money. An indefinite appropriation may appropriate all or part of the 
receipts from certain sources, the specific amount of which is 
determinable only at some future date, or it may appropriate “such 
sums as may be necessary” for a given purpose. 
c. Classification Based on 1. Current appropriation: An appropriation made by Congress in, or 
Permanency25 immediately prior to, the fiscal year or years during which it is available 
for obligation. 

2. Permanent appropriation: A “standing” appropriation which, once 
made, is always available for specified purposes and does not require 
repeated action by Congress to authorize its use.26 Legislation 
authorizing an agency to retain and use offsetting receipts tends to be 
permanent; if so, it is a form of permanent appropriation.

26 This is similar to a no-year appropriation except that a no-year appropriation will be 
closed if there are no disbursements from the appropriation for two consecutive fiscal 
years, and if the head of the agency or the President determines that the purposes for which 
the appropriation was made have been carried out. 31 U.S.C. § 1555. In actual usage, the 
term “permanent appropriation” tends to be used more in reference to appropriations 
contained in permanent legislation, such as legislation establishing a revolving fund, while 
“no-year appropriation” is used more to describe appropriations found in appropriation 
acts.

d. Classification Based on 1. Current or unexpired appropriation: An appropriation that is 
Availability for New available for incurring new obligations. 
Obligations27 
2. Expired appropriation: An appropriation that is no longer available to 
incur new obligations, although it may still be available for the 
recording and/or payment (liquidation) of obligations properly incurred 
before the period of availability expired. 
3. Canceled appropriation: An appropriation whose account is closed, 
and is no longer available for obligation or expenditure for any purpose. 
An appropriation may combine characteristics from more than one of the 
above groupings. For example, a “permanent indefinite” appropriation is 
open ended as to both period of availability and amount. Examples are 
31 U.S.C. § 1304 (payment of certain judgments against the United States) 
and 31 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(2) (refunding amounts erroneously collected and 
deposited in the Treasury). 

e. Reappropriation The term “reappropriation” means congressional action to continue the 
availability, whether for the same or different purposes, of all or part of the 
unobligated portion of budget authority that has expired or would 
otherwise expire. Reappropriations are counted as budget authority in the 
first year for which the availability is extended.28 
B. Some Basic 
Concepts 
1. What Constitutes an The starting point is 31 U.S.C. § 1301(d), which provides: 
Appropriation 
“A law may be construed to make an appropriation out of 
the Treasury or to authorize making a contract for the 
payment of money in excess of an appropriation only if the

Chapter 5, section D. 

28 Glossary at 23. See also 31 U.S.C. § 1301(b) (reappropriation for a different purpose is to 
be accounted for as a new appropriation). 

Page 2-15 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

law specifically states that an appropriation is made or that 
such a contract may be made.” 

Thus, the rule is that the making of an appropriation must be expressly 
stated. An appropriation cannot be inferred or made by implication. E.g., 

50 Comp. Gen. 863 (1971). 

Regular annual and supplemental appropriation acts present no problems 
in this respect as they will be apparent on their face. They, as required by 
1 U.S.C. § 105, bear the title “An Act making appropriations … .” There are 
situations in which statutes other than regular appropriation acts may be 
construed as making appropriations, however. See, e.g., 31 U.S.C. § 1304(a) 
(“necessary amounts are appropriated to pay final judgments, awards, 
compromise settlements”); 31 U.S.C. § 1324 (“necessary amounts are 
appropriated to the Secretary of Treasury for refunding internal revenue 
collections”). 

An appropriation is a form of budget authority that makes funds available 
to an agency to incur obligations and make expenditures.29 2 U.S.C. 
§ 622(2)(A)(i). See also 31 U.S.C. § 701(2)(C) (“authority making amounts 
available for obligation or expenditure”). Consequently, while the authority 
must be expressly stated, it is not necessary that the statute actually use 
the word “appropriation.” If the statute contains a specific direction to pay 
and a designation of the funds to be used, such as a direction to make a 
specified payment or class of payments “out of any money in the Treasury 
not otherwise appropriated,” then this amounts to an appropriation. 
63 Comp. Gen. 331 (1984); 13 Comp. Gen. 77 (1933). See also 34 Comp. 
Gen. 590 (1955). 

For example, a private relief act that directs the Secretary of the Treasury 
to pay, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, a 
specified sum of money to a named individual constitutes an appropriation. 
23 Comp. Dec. 167, 170 (1916). Another example is B-160998, Apr. 13, 1978, 
concerning section 11 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 
1974,30 which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to reimburse local 
fire departments or districts for costs incurred in fighting fires on federal 

29 We discuss the concept of budget authority and define the term appropriation in section A 
(“Appropriations and Related Terminology”) of this chapter. 

30 Pub. L. No. 93-498, 88 Stat. 1535, 1543 (Oct. 29, 1974).

The Legal Framework 

property. Since the statute directed the Secretary to make payments “from 
any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated” (i.e., it contained 
both the specific direction to pay and a designation of the funds to be 
used), the Comptroller General concluded that section 11 constituted a 
permanent indefinite appropriation. 

Both elements of the test must be present. Thus, a direction to pay without 
a designation of the source of funds is not an appropriation. For example, a 
private relief act that contains merely an authorization and direction to pay 
but no designation of the funds to be used does not make an appropriation. 
21 Comp. Dec. 867 (1915); B-26414, Jan. 7, 1944.31 Similarly, public 
legislation enacted in 1978 authorized the U.S. Treasury to make an annual 
prepayment to Guam and the Virgin Islands of the amount estimated to be 
collected over the course of the year for certain taxes, duties, and fees. 
While it was apparent that the prepayment at least for the first year would 
have to come from the general fund of the Treasury, the legislation was 
silent as to the source of the funds for the prepayments, both for the first 
year and for subsequent years. It was concluded that while the statute may 
have established a permanent authorization, it was not sufficient under 
31 U.S.C. § 1301(d) to constitute an actual appropriation. B-114808, Aug. 7, 
1979. (Congress subsequently made the necessary appropriation in Pub. L. 
No. 96-126, 93 Stat. 954, 966 (Nov. 27, 1979).) 

The designation of a source of funds without a specific direction to pay is 
also not an appropriation. 67 Comp. Gen. 332 (1988). 

Thus far, we have been talking about the authority to make disbursements 
from the general fund of the Treasury. There is a separate line of decisions 
establishing the proposition that statutes, which authorize the collection of 
fees and their deposit into a particular fund, and, which make the fund 
available for expenditure for a specified purpose, constitute continuing or 
permanent appropriations; that is, the money is available for obligation or 
expenditure without further action by Congress. Often it is argued that a 
law making moneys available from some source other than the general 
fund of the Treasury is not an appropriation. This view is wrong. Statutes 
establishing revolving funds and various special deposit funds and making 

31 A few early cases will be found that appear inconsistent with the proposition stated in the 
text. E.g., 6 Comp. Dec. 514, 516 (1899); 4 Comp. Dec. 325, 327 (1897). These cases predate 
the enactment on July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. 552, 560) of what is now 31 U.S.C. § 1301(d) and 
should be disregarded. 

Page 2-17 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

amounts in those funds available for obligation and expenditure are 
permanent appropriations. The reason is that, under 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b), all 
money received for the use of the United States must be deposited in the 
general fund of the Treasury absent statutory authority for some other 
disposition.; B-271894, July 24, 1997. Once the money is in the Treasury, it 
can be withdrawn only if Congress appropriates it.32 Therefore, the 
authority for an agency to obligate or expend collections without further 
congressional action amounts to a continuing appropriation or permanent 
appropriation of the collections. E.g., United Biscuit Co. v. Wirtz, 359 F.2d 
206, 212 (D.C. Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 971 (1966); 69 Comp. 
Gen. 260, 262 (1990; 73 Comp. Gen. 321 (1994). 

Cases involving the “special fund” principle fall into two categories. In the 
first group, the question is whether a particular statute authorizing the 
deposit and expenditure of a class of receipts makes those funds available 
for the specified purpose or purposes without further congressional action. 
These cases, in other words, raise the basic question of whether the statute 
may be regarded as an appropriation. Cases answering this question in the 
affirmative include 59 Comp. Gen. 215 (1980) (mobile home inspection fees 
collected by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development); B-228777, 
Aug. 26, 1988 (licensing revenues received by the Commission on the 
Bicentennial); B-204078.2, May 6, 1988, and B-257525, Nov. 30, 1994 
(Panama Canal Revolving Fund); B-197118, Jan. 14, 1980 (National Defense 
Stockpile Transaction Fund); and B-90476, June 14, 1950. See also 1 Comp. 
Gen. 704 (1922) (revolving fund created in appropriation act remains 
available beyond end of fiscal year where not specified otherwise). 

The second group of cases involves the applicability of statutory 
restrictions or other provisions that by their terms apply to “appropriated 
funds” or exemptions that apply to “nonappropriated funds.” For example, 
fees collected from federal credit unions and deposited in a revolving fund 
for administrative and supervisory expenses have been regarded as 
appropriated funds for various purposes. 63 Comp. Gen. 31 (1983), aff’d 
upon reconsideration, B-210657, May 25, 1984 (payment of relocation 
expenses); 35 Comp. Gen. 615 (1956) (restrictions on reimbursement for 
certain telephone calls made from private residences). Other situations 
applying the “special fund as appropriation” principle are summarized 
below:

• Various funds held to constitute appropriated funds for purposes of 
GAO’s bid protest jurisdiction:33 65 Comp. Gen. 25 (1985) (funds 
received by National Park Service for visitor reservation services); 
64 Comp. Gen. 756 (1985) (Tennessee Valley Authority power program 
funds); 57 Comp. Gen. 311 (1978) (commissary surcharges). 

• Applicability of other procurement laws: United Biscuit Co., supra 
(Armed Services Procurement Act applicable to military commissary 
purchases); B-217281-O.M., Mar. 27, 1985 (federal procurement 
regulations applicable to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 
revolving funds); B-275669.2, July 30, 1997 (American Battle 
Monuments Commission must comply with the Federal Acquisition 
Regulations and Federal Property and Administrative Services Act). 

• User fee toll charges collected by the Saint Lawrence Seaway 
Development Corporation are appropriated funds. However, many of 
the restrictions on the use of appropriated funds will nevertheless be 
inapplicable by virtue of the Corporation’s organic legislation and its 
status as a corporation. B-193573, Jan. 8, 1979, modified and aff’d, 
B-193573, Dec. 19, 1979; B-217578, Oct. 16, 1986. The December 1979 
decision noted that the capitalization of a government corporation, 
whether a lump-sum appropriation in the form of capital stock or the 
authority to borrow through the issuance of long-term bonds to the U.S. 
Treasury, consists of appropriated funds. 

• User fees collected under the Tobacco Inspection Act are appropriated 
funds and as such are subject to restrictions on payment of employee 
health benefits. 63 Comp. Gen. 285 (1984). 

• Customs Service duty collections are appropriations authorized to be 
used for administration and collection costs. B-241488, Mar. 13, 1991. 

• The Prison Industries Fund is an appropriated fund subject to the 
General Services Administration’s surplus property regulations. 
60 Comp. Gen. 323 (1981). 

Other cases in this category are 50 Comp. Gen. 323 (1970); 35 Comp. 
Gen. 436 (1956); B-191761, Sept. 22, 1978; and B-67175, July 16, 1947. In

each of the special fund cases cited above, the authority to make payments 
from the fund involved was clear from the governing legislation. 

Finally, the cases cited above generally involve statutes that specify the 
fund to which the collections are to be deposited. This is not essential, 
however. A statute that clearly makes receipts available for obligation or 
expenditure without further congressional action will be construed as 
authorizing the establishment of such a fund as a necessary 
implementation procedure. 59 Comp. Gen. 215 (42 U.S.C. § 5419); 
B-226520, Apr. 3, 1987 (nondecision letter) (26 U.S.C. § 7475). See also 
13 Comp. Dec. 700 (1907). 

Two recent court decisions held that revolving funds do not constitute 
“appropriations” for purposes of determining whether those courts have 
jurisdiction over claims against the United States under the Tucker Act 
(28 U.S.C. § 1491). These decisions—Core Concepts of Florida, Inc. v. 
United States, 327 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2003), petition for cert. filed, 
72 U.S.L.W. 3148 (Aug. 18, 2003), and AINS, Inc. v. United States, 56 Fed. 
Cl. 522 (2002)—concluded that GAO’s view of revolving funds as 
continuing or permanent appropriations does not apply to issues of Tucker 
Act jurisdiction.34 The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Court of 
Federal Claims, and their predecessors traditionally hold that Tucker Act 
jurisdiction does not extend to “nonappropriated fund instrumentalities” 
that receive no traditional general revenue appropriations derived from the 
general fund of the Treasury.35 Core Concepts and AINS dealt only with the 
issue of Tucker Act jurisdiction in this context and have no bearing on the 
status of revolving funds in the broader appropriations law context 
discussed above.36 

34 But see MDB Communications, Inc. v. United States, 53 Fed. Cl. 245 (2002), and 
American Management Systems, Inc. v. United States, 53 Fed. Cl. 525 (2002), two other 
recent decisions that do apply GAO’s view that revolving funds are appropriations to 
support Tucker Act jurisdiction. 

35 E.g., Furash & Co. v. United States, 252 F.3d 1336, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Denkler v. 
United States, 782 F.2d 1003 (Fed. Cir. 1986); Aaron v. United States, 51 Fed. Cl. 690 (2002); 
L’Enfant Plaza Properties, Inc. v. United States, 668 F.2d 1211 (Ct. Cl. 1982); Kyer v. 
United States, 369 F.2d 714, 718 (Ct. Cl. 1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 929 (1967). 

36 See, in this regard, Core Concepts, 327 F.3d at 1338, noting that GAO’s position and the 
authorities it cites on the status of revolving funds “are not applicable to the non-
appropriated funds doctrine [governing Tucker Act jurisdiction] in the same sense that they 
are applicable to federal appropriations law.”

The Legal Framework 

2. Specific versus General 
Appropriations 
a. General Rule An appropriation for a specific object is available for that object to the 
exclusion of a more general appropriation, which might otherwise be 
considered available for the same object, and the exhaustion of the specific 
appropriation does not authorize charging any excess payment to the more 
general appropriation, unless there is something in the general 
appropriation to make it available in addition to the specific 
appropriation.37 In other words, if an agency has a specific appropriation 
for a particular item, and also has a general appropriation broad enough to 
cover the same item, it does not have an option as to which to use. It must 
use the specific appropriation. Were this not the case, agencies could evade 
or exceed congressionally established spending limits. 
The cases illustrating this rule are legion.38 Generally, the fact patterns and 
the specific statutes involved are of secondary importance. The point is 
that the agency does not have an option. If a specific appropriation exists 
for a particular item, then that appropriation must be used and it is 
improper to charge the more general appropriation (or any other 
appropriation) or to use it as a “back-up.” A few cases are summarized as 
examples: 

• A State Department appropriation for “publication of consular and 
commercial reports” could not be used to purchase books in view of a 
specific appropriation for “books and maps.” 1 Comp. Dec. 126 (1894). 
The Comptroller of the Treasury referred to the rule as having been 
well established “from time immemorial.” Id. at 127. 

• The existence of a specific appropriation for the expenses of repairing 
the U.S. courthouse and jail in Nome, Alaska, precludes the charging of 
such expenses to more general appropriations such as “Miscellaneous 
expenses, U.S. Courts” or “Support of prisoners, U.S. Courts.” 4 Comp. 
Gen. 476 (1924). 

37 See, e.g., B-272191, Nov. 4, 1997. 

38 A few are 64 Comp. Gen. 138 (1984); 36 Comp. Gen. 526 (1957); 17 Comp. Gen. 974 (1938); 
5 Comp. Gen. 399 (1925); B-289209, May 31, 2002; B-290011, Mar. 25, 2002.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

• A specific appropriation for the construction of an additional wing on 
the Navy Department Building could not be supplemented by a more 
general appropriation to build a larger wing desired because of 
increased needs. 20 Comp. Gen. 272 (1940). See B-235086, Apr. 24, 1991 
(a specific appropriation for the construction and acquisition of a 
building precludes the Forest Service from using a more general 
appropriation to pay for such a purchase). See also B-278121, Nov. 7, 
1997. 

• Appropriations of the District of Columbia Health Department could 
not be used to buy penicillin to be used for Civil Defense purposes 
because the District had received a specific appropriation for “all 
expenses necessary for the Office of Civil Defense.” 31 Comp. Gen. 491 
(1952). 

Further, the fact that an appropriation for a specific purpose is included as 
an earmark in a general appropriation does not deprive it of its character as 
an appropriation for the particular purpose designated, and where such 
specific appropriation is available for the expenses necessarily incident to 
its principal purpose, such incidental expenses may not be charged to the 
more general appropriation. 20 Comp. Gen. 739 (1941). In the cited 
decision, a general appropriation for the Geological Survey contained the 
provision “including not to exceed $45,000 for the purchase and exchange 
… of … passenger-carrying vehicles.” It was held that the costs of 
transportation incident to the delivery of the purchased vehicles were 
chargeable to the specific $45,000 appropriation and not to the more 
general portion of the appropriation. Similarly, a general appropriation for 
the Library of Congress contained the provision, “$9,619,000 is to remain 
available until expended for the acquisition of books, periodicals, 
newspapers and all other materials… .” The Comptroller General held that 
the $9,619,000 was an earmark requiring the Library to set aside that money 
to purchase books and other library materials. The earmark barred the 
Library from transferring or using those funds for another purpose. 
B-278121, supra. In deciding the proper appropriation to charge for 
administrative costs for Oil Pollution Act claims, the Comptroller General 
stated, “As a general rule, an appropriation for a specific object is available 
for that object to the exclusion of a more general appropriation which 
might otherwise be considered for the same object.” B-289209, supra 
(citing 65 Comp. Gen. 881 (1986)); B-290005, July 1, 2002. 

The rule has also been applied to expenditures by a government 
corporation from corporate funds for an object for which the corporation 

Page 2-22 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

The Legal Framework 

b. Two Appropriations 
Available for Same Purpose 
had received a specific appropriation, where the reason for using corporate 
funds was to avoid a restriction applicable to the specific appropriation. 
B-142011, June 19, 1969. 

Of course, the rule that the specific governs over the general is not peculiar 
to appropriation law. It is a general principle of statutory construction and 
applies equally to provisions other than appropriation statutes. E.g., 
62 Comp. Gen. 617 (1983); B-277905, Mar. 17, 1998; B-152722, Aug. 16, 1965. 
However, another principle of statutory construction is that two statutes 
should be construed harmoniously so as to give maximum effect to both 
wherever possible. In dealing with nonappropriation statutes, the 
relationship between the two principles has been stated as follows: 

“Where there is a seeming conflict between a general 
provision and a specific provision and the general provision 
is broad enough to include the subject to which the specific 
provision relates, the specific provision should be regarded 
as an exception to the general provision so that both may be 
given effect, the general applying only where the specific 
provision is inapplicable.” 

B-163375, Sept. 2, 1971. See also B-255979, Oct. 30, 1995. 

As stated before, however, in the appropriations context, this does not 
mean that a general appropriation is available when the specific 
appropriation has been exhausted. Using the more general appropriation 
would be an unauthorized transfer (discussed later in this chapter) and 
would improperly augment the specific appropriation (discussed in 
Chapter 6). 

Although rare, there are situations in which either of two appropriations 
can be construed as available for a particular object, but neither can 
reasonably be called the more specific of the two. The rule in this situation 
is this: Where two appropriations are available for the same purpose, the 
agency may select which one to charge for the expenditure in question. 
Once that election has been made, the agency must continue to use the 
same appropriation for that purpose unless the agency at the beginning of 
the fiscal year informs the Congress of its intent to change for the next 
fiscal year. See U.S. General Accounting Office, Unsubstantiated DOE 
Travel Payments, GAO/RCED-96-58R (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 28, 1995). Of 
course, where statutory language clearly demonstrates congressional 
intent to make one appropriation available to supplement or increase a 

Page 2-23 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

different appropriation for the same type of work, both appropriations are 
available. See B-272191, Nov. 4, 1997 (Army permitted to use Operations 
and Maintenance (O&M) funds for property maintenance and repair work 
in Germany even though Real Property Maintenance, Defense (RPM,D) 
funds were available for the same work because Congress said the O&M 
funds were “in addition to the funds specifically appropriated for real 
property maintenance under the heading [RPM,D]”). 

3. Transfer and 
Reprogramming 
For a variety of reasons, agencies have a legitimate need for a certain 
amount of flexibility to deviate from their budget estimates. Two ways to 
shift money are transfer and reprogramming. While the two concepts are 
related in this broad sense, they are nevertheless different. 
a. Transfer Transfer is the shifting of funds between appropriations.39 For example, if 
an agency receives one appropriation for Operations and Maintenance and 
another for Capital Expenditures, a shifting of funds from either one to the 
other is a transfer. 
The basic rule with respect to transfer is simple: Transfer is prohibited 
without statutory authority. The rule applies equally to (1) transfers from 
one agency to another,40 (2) transfers from one account to another within 
the same agency,41 and (3) transfers to an interagency or intra-agency 
working fund.42 In each instance, statutory authority is required. An 
agency’s erroneous characterization of a proposed transfer as a 
“reprogramming” is irrelevant. See B-202362, Mar. 24, 1981. Moreover, 
informal congressional approval of an unauthorized transfer of funds

between appropriation accounts does not have the force and effect of law.

The rule applies even though the transfer is intended as a temporary 
expedient (for example, to alleviate a temporary exhaustion of funds) and 
the agency contemplates reimbursement. Thus, without statutory authority, 
an agency cannot “borrow” from another account or another agency. 

36 Comp. Gen. 386 (1956); 13 Comp. Gen. 344 (1934); B-290011, Mar. 25, 
2002. An exception to this proposition is 31 U.S.C. § 1534, under which an 
agency may temporarily charge one appropriation for an expenditure 
benefiting another appropriation of the same agency, as long as amounts 
are available in both appropriations and the accounts are adjusted to 
reimburse the appropriation initially charged during or as of the close of 
the same fiscal year. This statute was intended to facilitate “common 
service” activities. For example, an agency procuring equipment to be used 
jointly by several bureaus or offices within the agency funded under 
separate appropriations may initially charge the entire cost to a single 
appropriation and later apportion the cost among the appropriations of the 
benefiting components. See generally S. Rep. No. 89-1284 (1966). 

The prohibition against transfer is codified in 31 U.S.C. § 1532, the first 
sentence of which provides: 

“An amount available under law may be withdrawn from 
one appropriation account and credited to another or to a 
working fund only when authorized by law.” 

In addition to the express prohibition of 31 U.S.C. § 1532, an unauthorized 
transfer would violate 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) (which prohibits the use of 
appropriations for other than their intended purpose); would constitute an 
unauthorized augmentation of the receiving appropriation; and could, if the 
transfer led to overobligating the receiving appropriation, result in an 
Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. § 1341) violation as well. E.g., B-286929, 
Apr. 25, 2001; B-248284.2, Sept. 1, 1992; B-222009-O.M., Mar. 3, 1986; 15 Op. 
Off. Legal Counsel 74 (1991). 

Some agencies have limited transfer authority either in permanent 
legislation or in appropriation act provisions. Such authority will 
commonly set a percentage limit on the amount that may be transferred 
from a given appropriation and/or the amount by which the receiving 
appropriation may be augmented. A transfer pursuant to such authority is, 
of course, entirely proper. B-290659, Oct. 31, 2002; B-167637, Oct. 11, 1973. 

Page 2-25 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

An example is 7 U.S.C. § 2257, which authorizes transfers between 
Department of Agriculture appropriations. The amount to be transferred 
may not exceed 7 percent of the “donor” appropriation, and the receiving 
appropriation may not be augmented by more than 7 percent except in 
extraordinary emergencies. Cases construing this provision include 
33 Comp. Gen. 214; B-218812, Jan. 23, 1987; B-123498, Apr. 11, 1955; and 
B-218812-O.M., July 30, 1985. See also B-279886, Apr. 28, 1998 (noting 
5 percent limit on transfer in Department of Justice appropriation). 

If an agency has transfer authority of this type, its exercise is not precluded 
by the fact that the amount of the receiving appropriation had been 
reduced from the agency’s budget request. B-151157, June 27, 1963. Also, 
the transfer statute is an independent grant of authority and, unless 
expressly provided otherwise, the percentage limitations do not apply to 
transfers under any separate transfer authority the agency may have. 

B-239031, June 22, 1990. 

Another type of transfer authority is illustrated by 31 U.S.C. § 1531, which 
authorizes the transfer of unexpended balances incident to executive 
branch reorganizations, but only for purposes for which the appropriation 
was originally available. Cases discussing this authority include 31 Comp. 
Gen. 342 (1952) and B-92288 et al., Aug. 13, 1971. 

Statutory transfer authority does not require any particular “magic words.” 
Of course the word “transfer” will help, but it is not necessary as long as the 
words that are used make it clear that transfer is being authorized. 
B-213345, Sept. 26, 1986; B-217093, supra; B-182398, Mar. 29, 1976 (letter to 
Senator Laxalt), modified on other grounds by 64 Comp. Gen. 370 (1985). 

Some transfer statutes have included requirements for approval by one or 
more congressional committees. In light of the Supreme Court’s decision in 
Immigration & Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), 
such “legislative veto” provisions are no longer valid. Whether the transfer 
authority to which the veto provision is attached remains valid depends on 
whether it can be regarded as severable from the approval requirement. 
This in turn depends on an evaluation, in light of legislative history and 
other surrounding circumstances, of whether Congress would have enacted 
the substantive authority without the veto provision. See, e.g., 15 Op. Off. 
Legal Counsel 49 (1991) (the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel 
(OLC) concluded that an unconstitutional legislative veto provision of the 
Selective Service Act was severable from the statute’s grant of authority to 

Page 2-26 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

the President to obtain expedited delivery of military contracts); 6 Op. Off. 
Legal Counsel 520 (1982) (OLC concluded that a Treasury Department 
transfer provision was severable and therefore survived a legislative veto 
provision). 

The precise parameters of transfer authority will, of course, depend on the 
terms of the statute which grants it. The analytical starting point is the 
second sentence of 31 U.S.C. § 1532: 

“Except as specifically provided by law, an amount 
authorized to be withdrawn and credited [to another 
appropriation account or to a working fund] is available for 
the same purpose and subject to the same limitations 
provided by the law appropriating the amount.” 

In a 2001 decision, the Comptroller General found that funds withdrawn 
from other agencies’ appropriations and credited to the Library of Congress 
FEDLINK43 revolving fund retained their time character and did not assume 
the time character of the FEDLINK revolving fund. B-288142, Sept. 6, 2001. 
The Library of Congress proposed retaining in the fund amounts of fiscal 
year money advanced by other agencies in earlier fiscal years when orders 
were placed and, to the extent the advances were not needed to cover the 
costs of the orders, applying the excess amounts to new orders placed in 
subsequent fiscal years. The Library pointed out that the law establishing 
the revolving fund made amounts in the fund available without fiscal year 
limitation. The Comptroller General concluded that “amounts withdrawn 
from a fiscal year appropriation and credited to a no year revolving fund, 
such as the FEDLINK revolving fund, are available for obligation only 
during the fiscal year of availability of the appropriation from which the 
amount was withdrawn.” Id. The Comptroller General noted that 
section 1532 is a significant control feature protecting Congress’s 
constitutional prerogatives of the purse. Placing time limits on the 
availability of appropriations is a fundamental means of congressional 
control because it permits Congress to periodically review a given agency’s 
programs and activities. Given the significance of time restrictions in 
preserving congressional powers of the purse, GAO looks for clear

Appropriations, Pub. L. No. 107-68, 115 Stat. 560, 588–89 (Nov. 12, 2001), codified at 2 U.S.C.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

legislative expressions of congressional intent before interpreting 
legislation to override time limitations that Congress, through the 
appropriations process, has imposed on an agency’s use of funds. The 
Comptroller General rejected the Library’s view that the language in the 
FEDLINK statute overrode the time limitation imposed on funds 
transferred into FEDLINK because, until the Library had earned those 
amounts by performing the services ordered from the Library, these 
transferred amounts were not a part of the corpus of FEDLINK. Id. 

The FEDLINK decision references a situation that GAO addressed in 1944 
with regard to a no-year revolving fund called the Navy Procurement Fund. 
23 Comp. Gen. 668 (1944). The Navy incorrectly believed that because the 
revolving fund was not subject to fiscal year limitation, advances to the 
fund made from annual appropriations were available until expended. A 
number of other GAO decisions, several predating the enactment of 
31 U.S.C. § 1532, have made essentially the same point—that, except to the 
extent the statute authorizing a transfer provides otherwise, transferred 
funds are available for purposes permissible under the donor appropriation 
and are subject to the same limitations and restrictions applicable to the 
donor appropriation. An example of this is the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1535.44 

Restrictions applicable to the receiving account but not to the donor 
account may or may not apply. Where transfers are intended to accomplish 
a purpose of the source appropriation (Economy Act transactions, for 
example), transferred funds have been held not subject to such 
restrictions. E.g., 21 Comp. Gen. 254 (1941); 18 Comp. Gen. 489 (1938); 
B-35677, July 27, 1943; B-131580-O.M., June 4, 1957. However, for transfers 
intended to permit a limited augmentation of the receiving account 
(7 U.S.C. § 2257, for example), this principle is arguably inapplicable in 
view of the fundamentally different purpose of the transfer. 

As noted above, in the context of working funds, the prohibition against 
transfer applies not only to interagency funds, but to the consolidation of 
all or parts of different appropriations of the same agency into a single fund 
as well. In a few instances, the “pooling” of portions of agency unit 

44 E.g., 31 Comp. Gen. 109, 114–15 (1951); 28 Comp. Gen. 365 (1948); 26 Comp. Gen. at 548; 
18 Comp. Gen. 489; 17 Comp. Gen. 900 (1938); 17 Comp. Gen. 73 (1937); 16 Comp. Gen. 545 
(1936); B-167034-O.M., Jan. 20, 1970. We discuss the Economy Act in detail in Chapter 12, 
Volume III of the third edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations Law.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

appropriations has been found authorized where necessary to implement a 
particular statute. In B-195775, Sept. 10, 1979, the Comptroller General 
approved the transfer of portions of unit appropriations to an agencywide 
pool to be used to fund the Merit Pay System established by the Civil 
Service Reform Act of 1978. The transfers, while not explicitly authorized 
in the statute, were seen as necessary to implement the law and carry out 
the legislative purpose. Following this decision, the Comptroller General 
held in 60 Comp. Gen. 686 (1981) that the Treasury Department could pool 
portions of appropriations made to several separate bureaus to fund an 
Executive Development Program also authorized by the Civil Service 
Reform Act. However, pooling that would alter the purposes for which 
funds were appropriated is an impermissible transfer unless authorized by 
statute. E.g., B-209790-O.M., Mar. 12, 1985. It is also impermissible to 
transfer more than the cost of the goods or services provided to an ordering 
agency. 70 Comp. Gen. 592, 595 (1991). 

The reappropriation of an unexpended balance for a different purpose is a 
form of transfer. Such funds cease to be available for the purposes of the 
original appropriation. 18 Comp. Gen. 564 (1938); A-79180, July 30, 1936. 
Cf. 31 U.S.C. § 1301(b) (reappropriation for different purpose to be 
accounted for as a new appropriation). If the reappropriation is of an 
amount “not to exceed” a specified sum, and the full amount is not needed 
for the new purpose, the balance not needed reverts to the source 
appropriation. 18 Comp. Gen. at 565. 

The prohibition against transfer would not apply to “transfers” of an 
agency’s administrative allocations within a lump-sum appropriation since 
the allocations are not legally binding.45 This is a reprogramming, which we 
discuss below. Thus, where the then Department of Health, Education, and 
Welfare received a lump-sum appropriation covering several grant 
programs, it could set aside a portion of each program’s allocation for a 
single fund to be used for “cross-cutting” grants intended to serve more 
than one target population, as long as the grants were for projects within 
the scope or purpose of the lump-sum appropriation. B-157356, Aug. 17, 
1978. 

b. Reprogramming In 1985, the Deputy Secretary of Defense made the following statement: 
45 The agency must be careful that a transfer of administrative allocations does not, under its 
own fund control regulations, produce a violation of 31 U.S.C. § 1517(a), discussed further 
in Chapter 6. 

Page 2-29 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

“The defense budget does not exist in a vacuum. There are 
forces at work to play havoc with even the best of budget 
estimates. The economy may vary in terms of inflation; 
political realities may bring external forces to bear; fact-oflife 
or programmatic changes may occur. The very nature of 
the lengthy and overlapping cycles of the budget process 
poses continual threats to the integrity of budget estimates. 
Reprogramming procedures permit us to respond to these 
unforeseen changes and still meet our defense 
requirements.”46 

The thrust of this statement, while made from the perspective of the 
Defense Department, applies at least to some extent to all agencies. 

Reprogramming is the utilization of funds in an appropriation account for 
purposes other than those contemplated at the time of appropriation.47 In 
other words, it is the shifting of funds from one object to another within an 
appropriation. The term “reprogramming” appears to have come into use in 
the mid-1950s although the practice, under different names, predates that 
time.48 

The authority to reprogram is implicit in an agency’s responsibility to 
manage its funds; no statutory authority is necessary. See Lincoln v. Vigil, 
508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993) (“After all, the very point of a lump-sum 
appropriation is to give an agency the capacity to adapt to changing 
circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it sees as the 
most effective or desirable way.”). See also 4B Op. Off. Legal Counsel 701 
(1980) (discussing the Attorney General’s authority to reprogram to avoid 
deficiencies); B-196854.3, Mar. 19, 1984 (Congress is “implicitly conferring 
the authority to reprogram” by enacting lump-sum appropriations). Indeed, 
reprogramming is usually a nonstatutory arrangement. This means that 
there is no general statutory provision either authorizing or prohibiting it, 

46 Reprogramming Action Within the Department of Defense: Hearing Before the House 
Armed Services Committee (Sept. 30, 1985) (remarks prepared for delivery by The 
Honorable William H. Taft IV, Deputy Secretary of Defense, unprinted). 

47 U.S. General Accounting Office, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process 
(Exposure Draft), GAO/AFMD-2.1.1 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 1993), at 74; B-164912-O.M., 
Dec. 21, 1977. 

48 Louis Fisher, Presidential Spending Power, 76–77 (1975). Fisher also briefly traces the 
evolution of the concept.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

and it has evolved largely in the form of informal (i.e., nonstatutory) 
agreements between various agencies and their congressional oversight 
committees. These informal arrangements do not have the force and effect 
of law. Blackhawk Heating & Plumbing Co. v. United States, 622 F.2d 539, 
548 (Ct. Cl. 1980). See also 56 Comp. Gen. 201 (1976), holding that the 
Navy’s failure to complete a form required by Defense Department 
reprogramming regulations was not sufficient to support a claim for 
proposal preparation costs by an unsuccessful bidder upon cancellation of 
the proposal. 

Thus, as a matter of law, an agency is free to reprogram unobligated funds 
as long as the expenditures are within the general purpose of the 
appropriation and are not in violation of any other specific limitation or 
otherwise prohibited. E.g., B-123469, May 9, 1955; B-279338, Jan. 4, 1999. 
This is true even though the agency may already have administratively 
allotted the funds to a particular object. 20 Comp. Gen. 631 (1941). In some 
situations, the agency’s discretion may rise to the level of a duty. E.g., 
Blackhawk Heating & Plumbing, 622 F.2d at 552 n.9 (satisfaction of 
obligations under a settlement agreement). 

There are at present no reprogramming guidelines applicable to all 
agencies. As one might expect, reprogramming policies, procedures, and 
practices vary considerably among agencies.49 In view of the nature of its 
activities and appropriation structure, the Defense Department has 
detailed and sophisticated procedures.50 

In some cases, Congress has attempted to regulate reprogramming by 
statute, and of course any applicable statutory provisions control.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

reprogramming request to the Appropriations Committees “where the item 
for which reprogramming is requested has been denied by the Congress.”51 
The Comptroller General has construed this provision as prohibiting a 
reprogramming request that would have the effect of restoring funds which 
had been specifically deleted in the legislative process; that is, the 
provision is not limited to the denial of an entire project. See U.S. General 
Accounting Office, Legality of the Navy’s Expenditures for Project 
Sanguine During Fiscal Year 1974, LCD-75-315 (Washington, D.C.: 
Jan. 20, 1975). 

Under Defense’s arrangement as reflected in its written instructions, 
reprogramming procedures apply to funding shifts between program 
elements, but not to shifts within a program element. Thus, the denial of a 
request to reprogram funds from one program element to another does not 
preclude a military department from shifting available funds within the 
element. 65 Comp. Gen. 360 (1986). The level at which reprogramming 
procedures and restrictions will apply depends on applicable legislation, if 
any, and the arrangements an agency has worked out with its respective 
committees. 

In the absence of a statutory provision such as the Defense provision noted 
above, a reprogramming that has the effect of restoring funds deleted in the 
legislative process has been held not legally objectionable. B-195269, 
Oct. 15, 1979. 

Reprogramming frequently involves some form of notification to the 
appropriations and/or legislative committees. In a few cases, the 
notification process is prescribed by statute. However, in most cases, the 
committee review process is nonstatutory and derives from instructions in 
committee reports, hearings, or other correspondence. Sometimes, in 
addition to notification, reprogramming arrangements also provide for 
committee approval. As in the case of transfer, under the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Immigration & Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 
919 (1983), statutory committee approval or veto provisions are no longer 
permissible. However, an agency may continue to observe committee 
approval procedures as part of its informal arrangements, although they 
would not be legally binding. B-196854.3, supra.

and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States Act, 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-117,

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

In sum, reprogramming procedures provide an element of congressional 
control over spending flexibility short of resort to the full legislative 
process. They are for the most part nonbinding, and compliance is largely a 
matter of “keeping faith” with the pertinent committees. 

4. General Provisions: 
When Construed as 
Permanent Legislation 
Appropriation acts, in addition to making appropriations, frequently 
contain a variety of provisions either restricting the availability of the 
appropriations or making them available for some particular use. Such 
provisions come in two forms: (a) “provisos” attached directly to the 
appropriating language and (b) general provisions. A general provision may 
apply solely to the act in which it is contained (“No part of any 
appropriation contained in this Act shall be used …”), or it may have 
general applicability (“No part of any appropriation contained in this or any 
other Act shall be used …”).52 General provisions may be phrased in the 
form of restrictions or positive authority. 

Provisions of this type are no less effective merely because they are 
contained in appropriation acts. It is settled that Congress may repeal, 
amend, or suspend a statute by means of an appropriation bill, so long as its 
intention to do so is clear. Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society, 503 U.S. 
429, 440 (1992); McHugh v. Rubin, 220 F.3d 53, 57 (2nd Cir. 2000); see also 
United States v. Dickerson, 310 U.S. 554 (1940); Cella v. United States, 208 
F.2d 783, 790 (7th Cir. 1953), cert. denied, 347 U.S. 1016 (1954); NLRB v. 
Thompson Products, Inc., 141 F.2d 794, 797 (9th Cir. 1944); B-300009, July 1, 
2003; 41 Op. Att’y Gen. 274, 276 (1956). 

Congress likewise can enact general or permanent legislation in 
appropriation acts, but again its intent to do so must be clear. This point 
was made as follows in Building & Construction Trades Department, 
AFL-CIO v. Martin, 961 F.2d 269, 273 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 915 
(1992): 

52 In recent decades, general provisions of governmentwide applicability—the “this or any 
other act” provisions—have often been consolidated in the annual Treasury and General 
Government appropriation acts. E.g., Pub. L. No. 108-7, div. J, title I, § 104, 117 Stat. 11, 437 
(Feb. 20, 2003) (fiscal year 2003). Beginning in 2004, these provisions are now part of what is 
called the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act. See H.R. 
2989, 108th Cong. (passed by the House on September 9, 2003, and the Senate on October 23, 
2003). 

Page 2-33 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

“While appropriations are ‘Acts of Congress’ which can 
substantively change existing law, there is a very strong 
presumption that they do not … and that when they do, the 
change is only intended for one fiscal year.” 

In Atlantic Fish Spotters Ass’n v. Evans, 321 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2003), 
the court cautioned: 

“Congress may create permanent, substantive law through 
an appropriations bill only if it is clear about its intentions. 
Put another way, Congress cannot rebut the presumption 
against permanence by sounding an uncertain trumpet.” 

As noted in Chapter 1, rules of both the Senate and the House of 
Representatives prohibit “legislating” in appropriation acts. However, this 
merely subjects the provision to a point of order and does not affect the 
validity of the legislation if the point of order is not raised, or is raised and 
not sustained. Thus, once a given provision has been enacted into law, the 
question of whether it is “general legislation” or merely a restriction on the 
use of an appropriation, that is, whether it might have been subject to a 
point of order, is academic. 

This section deals with the question of when provisos or general provisions 
appearing in appropriation acts can be construed as permanent legislation. 

Since an appropriation act is made for a particular fiscal year, the starting 
presumption is that everything contained in the act is effective only for the 
fiscal year covered. Thus, the rule is: A provision contained in an annual 
appropriation act is not to be construed to be permanent legislation unless 
the language used therein or the nature of the provision makes it clear that 
Congress intended it to be permanent. The presumption can be overcome if 
the provision uses language indicating futurity or if the provision is of a 
general character bearing no relation to the object of the appropriation. 

65 Comp. Gen. 588 (1986); 62 Comp. Gen. 54 (1982); 36 Comp. Gen. 434 
(1956); 32 Comp. Gen. 11 (1952); 24 Comp. Gen. 436 (1944); 10 Comp. 
Gen. 120 (1930); 5 Comp. Gen. 810 (1926); 7 Comp. Dec. 838 (1901). 

In analyzing a particular provision, the starting point in ascertaining 
Congress’s intent is, as it must be, the language of the statute. The question 
to ask is whether the provision uses “words of futurity.” The most common 
word of futurity is “hereafter” and provisions using this term have often 
been construed as permanent. For specific examples, see Cella v. United

States, 208 F.2d at 790; 70 Comp. Gen. 351 (1991); 26 Comp. Gen. 354, 357 
(1946); 2 Comp. Gen. 535 (1923); 11 Comp. Dec. 800 (1905); B-108245, 
Mar. 19, 1952; B-100983, Feb. 8, 1951; B-76782, June 10, 1948. However, use 
of the word hereafter may not guarantee that an appropriation act 
provision will be found to constitute permanent law. Thus, in Auburn 
Housing Authority v. Martinez, 277 F.3d 138 (2nd Cir. 2002), the court 
declined to give permanent effect to a provision that included the word 
hereafter. The court acknowledged that hereafter generally denoted 
futurity, but held that this was not sufficient to establish permanence in the 
circumstances of that case. To read hereafter as giving permanence to one 
provision would have resulted in repealing another provision enacted in the 
same act.53 The court concluded that this result was not what Congress had 
intended. 

As Auburn Housing Authority indicates, mere use of the word hereafter 
may not be adequate as an indication of future effect to establish 
permanence. Other facts such as the precise location of the word hereafter 
and the sense in which it is used are also important. Moreover, the use of 
the word hereafter may not be sufficient, for example, if it appears only in 
an exception clause and not in the operative portion of the provision, 
B-228838, Sept. 16, 1987, or if it is used in a way that does not necessarily 
connote futurity beyond the end of the fiscal year. Williams v. United 
States, 240 F.3d 1019, 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 

Words of futurity other than hereafter have also been deemed sufficient. 
Thus, there is no significant difference in meaning between hereafter and 
“after the date of approval of this act.” 65 Comp. Gen. at 589; 36 Comp. Gen. 
at 436; B-209583, Jan. 18, 1983. Using a specific date rather than a general 
reference to the date of enactment produces the same result. B-287488, 
June 19, 2001; B-57539, May 3, 1946. “Henceforth” may also do the job. 
B-209583, supra. So may specific references to future fiscal years. 
B-208354, Aug. 10, 1982. On the other hand, the word “hereinafter” was not 
considered synonymous with hereafter by the First Circuit Court of 
Appeals and was not deemed to establish a permanent provision. Atlantic 
Fish Spotters Ass’n, supra. Rather, the court held that hereinafter is 

53 The appropriation provision in Auburn Housing Authority was aimed at countering 
another provision in the very same act. Thus, the court reasoned that the presumption 
against repeal by implication was particularly strong in this case. Id. at 146. The court also 
contrasted the hereafter provision with another provision in the same act that was more 
explicit as to permanence. The latter provision read in part: “[T]his subsection shall apply to 
fiscal year 1999 and each fiscal year thereafter.” Id. at 146–47.

universally understood to refer only to what follows in the same writing 
(i.e., statute). 321 F.3d at 225–26. 

In 24 Comp. Gen. 436, the Comptroller General viewed the words “at any 
time” as words of futurity in a provision which authorized reduced 
transportation rates to military personnel who were “given furloughs at any 
time.” In that decision, however, the conclusion of permanence was further 
supported by the fact that Congress appropriated funds to carry out the 
provision in the following year as well and did not repeat the provision but 
merely referred to it. 

The words “or any other act” in a provision addressing funds appropriated 
in or made available by “this or any other act” are not words of futurity. 
They merely refer to any other appropriation act for the same fiscal year. 
Williams v. United States, 240 F.3d at 1063; 65 Comp. Gen. 588; B-230110, 
Apr. 11, 1988; B-228838, supra; B-145492, Sept. 21, 1976.54 See also A-88073, 
Aug. 19, 1937 (“this or any other appropriation”). Similarly, the words 
“notwithstanding any other provision of law” are not words of futurity and, 
standing alone, offer no indication as to the duration of the provision. 

B-271412, June 13, 1996; B-208705, Sept. 14, 1982. 

The words “this or any other act” may be used in conjunction with other 
language that makes the result, one way or the other, indisputable. The 
provision is clearly not permanent if the phrase “during the current fiscal 
year” is added. Norcross v. United States, 142 Ct. Cl. 763 (1958). Addition of 
the phrase “with respect to any fiscal year” makes the provision permanent. 
B-230110, supra. 

If words of futurity indicate permanence, it follows that a proviso or 
general provision that does not contain words of futurity will generally not 
be construed as permanent. 65 Comp. Gen. 588; 32 Comp. Gen. 11; 
20 Comp. Gen. 322 (1940); 10 Comp. Gen. 120; 5 Comp. Gen. 810; 3 Comp. 
Gen. 319 (1923); B-209583, supra; B-208705, supra; B-66513, May 26, 1947; 
A-18614, May 25, 1927. The courts have applied the same analysis. See 
United States v. Vulte, 233 U.S. 509, 514 (1914); Minis v. United States, 
40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 423 (1841); Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v. Royce 

54 One early case found the words “or any other act” sufficient words of futurity. 26 Comp. 
Dec. 1066 (1920). A later decision, B-37032, Oct. 5, 1943, regarded their effect as 
inconclusive. Both of these cases must be regarded as implicitly modified by the consistent 
position expressed in the more recent decisions.

Laboratories, Inc., 69 F.3d 1130, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1995); United States v. 
International Business Machines Corp., 892 F.2d 1006, 1009 (Fed. Cir. 
1989); NLRB v. Thompson Products, Inc., supra; City of Hialeah v. United 
States Housing Authority, 340 F. Supp. 885 (S.D. Fla. 1971). 

In particular, the absence of the word hereafter is viewed as telling 
evidence that Congress did not intend a provision to be permanent. E.g., 
Building & Construction Trades Department, 961 F.2d at 273; 
International Business Machines Corp., supra; Department of Justice, 
Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum for James S. Gilliland, General 
Counsel, Department of Agriculture, Severability and Duration of 
Appropriations Rider Concerning Frozen Poultry Regulations, June 4, 
1996. For example, the court in Building & Construction Trades 
Department concluded that the absence of the word hereafter in an 
appropriation provision was more significant than the inclusion of other 
language that might have indicated permanence. 

As the preceding paragraphs indicate, the language of the statute is the 
crucial determinant. However, other factors may also be taken into 
consideration. Thus, the repeated inclusion of a provision in annual 
appropriation acts indicates that it is not considered or intended by 
Congress to be permanent. 32 Comp. Gen. 11; 10 Comp. Gen. 120; B-270723, 
Apr. 15, 1996; A-89279, Oct. 26, 1937; 41 Op. Att’y Gen. at 279–80. However, 
where adequate words of futurity exist, the repetition of a provision in the 
following year’s appropriation act has been viewed simply as an “excess of 
caution.” 36 Comp. Gen. at 436. This factor is of limited usefulness, since 
the failure to repeat in subsequent appropriation acts a provision that does 
not contain words of futurity can also be viewed as an indication that 
Congress did not consider it to be permanent and simply did not want it to 
continue. See 18 Comp. Gen. 37 (1938); A-88073, supra. Thus, if the 
provision does not contain words of futurity, then repetition or 
nonrepetition lead to the same result—that the provision is not permanent. 
If the provision does contain words of futurity, then nonrepetition indicates 
permanence but repetition, although it suggests nonpermanence, is 
inconclusive. 

The inclusion of a provision in the United States Code is relevant as an 
indication of permanence but is not controlling. 36 Comp. Gen. 434; 
24 Comp. Gen. 436. Failure to include a provision in the Code would appear 
to be of no significance. A reference by the codifiers to the failure to 
reenact a provision suggests nonpermanence. 41 Op. Att’y Gen. at 280–81. 

Page 2-37 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Legislative history is also relevant, but has been used for the most part to 
support a conclusion based on the presence or absence of words of 
futurity. See Cella v. United States, 208 F.2d at 790 n.1; NLRB v. Thompson 
Products, 141 F.2d at 798; 65 Comp. Gen. 588; B-277719, Aug. 20, 1997; 
B-209583, supra; B-208705, supra; B-108245, supra; B-57539, supra. In 
B-192973, Oct. 11, 1978, a general provision requiring the submission of a 
report “annually to the Congress” was held not permanent in view of 
conflicting expressions of congressional intent. Legislative history by itself 
has not been used to find futurity where it is missing in the statutory 
language. See Building & Construction Trades Department, 961 F.2d 
at 274. 

The degree of relationship between a given provision and the object of the 
appropriation act in which it appears or the appropriating language to 
which it is appended is a factor to be considered. If the provision bears no 
direct relationship to the appropriation act in which it appears, this is an 
indication of permanence. For example, a provision prohibiting the 
retroactive application of an energy tax credit provision in the Internal 
Revenue Code was found sufficiently unrelated to the rest of the act in 
which it appeared, a supplemental appropriations act, to support a 
conclusion of permanence. B-214058, Feb. 1, 1984. See also 62 Comp. Gen. 
at 56; 32 Comp. Gen. 11; 26 Comp. Gen. at 357; B-37032, supra; A-88073, 
supra. The closer the relationship, the less likely it is that the provision will 
be viewed as permanent. A determination under rules of the Senate that a 
proviso is germane to the subject matter of the appropriation bill will 
negate an argument that the proviso is sufficiently unrelated as to suggest 
permanence. B-208705, supra. 

The phrasing of a provision as positive authorization rather than a 
restriction on the use of an appropriation is an indication of permanence, 
but usually has been considered in conjunction with a finding of adequate 
words of futurity. 36 Comp. Gen. 434; 24 Comp. Gen. 436. An early decision, 
17 Comp. Dec. 146 (1910), held a proviso to be permanent based solely on 
the fact that it was not phrased as a restriction on the use of the 
appropriation to which it was attached, but this decision seems 
inconsistent with the weight of authority and certainly with the Supreme 
Court’s decision in Minis v. United States, cited above. 

Finally, a provision may be construed as permanent if construing it as 
temporary would render the provision meaningless or produce an absurd 
result. 65 Comp. Gen. 352 (1986); 62 Comp. Gen. 54; B-200923, Oct. 1, 1982. 
These decisions dealt with a general provision designed to prohibit cost-of-

Page 2-38 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

living pay increases for federal judges “except as may be specifically 
authorized by Act of Congress hereafter enacted.” Pub. L. No. 97-92, § 140, 
95 Stat. 1183, 1200 (Dec. 15, 1981). The provision appeared in a fiscal year 
1982 continuing resolution, which expired on September 30, 1982. The next 
applicable pay increase would have been effective October 1, 1982. Thus, if 
the provision were not construed as permanent, it would have been 
meaningless “since it would have been enacted to prevent increases during 
a period when no increases were authorized to be made.” 62 Comp. Gen. 
at 56–57.55 Similarly, a provision was held permanent in 9 Comp. Gen. 248 
(1929) although it contained no words of futurity, because it was to become 
effective on the last day of the fiscal year and an alternative construction 
would have rendered it effective for only 1 day, clearly not the legislative 
intent. See also 65 Comp. Gen. at 590; B-214058, supra; B-270723, supra. 

In sum, the six additional factors mentioned above are all relevant indicia 
of whether a given provision should be construed as permanent. However, 
the presence or absence of words of futurity remains the crucial factor, and 
the additional factors have been used for the most part to support a 
conclusion based primarily on this presence or absence. Four of the 
factors—occurrence or nonoccurrence in subsequent appropriation acts, 
inclusion in United States Code, legislative history, and phrasing as positive 
authorization—have never been used as the sole basis for finding 
permanence in a provision without words of futurity. The two remaining 
factors—relationship to rest of statute and meaningless or absurd result— 
can be used to find permanence in the absence of words of futurity, but the 
conclusion is almost invariably supported by at least one of the other 
factors, such as legislative history. 

55 In Williams v. United States, 240 F.3d at 1026, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 
held that the provision addressed in these decisions was not permanent, referring to the 
“unmistakable language of Public Law 97-92 … terminating the effect of Section 140 in 
1982.” The court did not address the consequence, if any, of Congress’s use of the word 
hereafter. The court did concede, however, that “even if Section 140 did not expire as of 
September 30, 1982, the 1989 Act falls well within the specific exception in that statute for 
an ‘Act of Congress hereafter enacted.’” Id. at 1027. The 1989 Act the court referred to is the 
Ethics Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 101-194, 103 Stat. 1716 (Nov. 30, 1989), which entitled federal 
judges to cost-of-living pay increases whenever federal employees received a cost-of-living 
increase. The 1989 Act was enacted after the series of GAO decisions was issued that 
addressed the fiscal year 1982 law.

Legislation 

1. Distinction between 
Authorization and 
Appropriation 
Appropriation acts must be distinguished from two other types of 
legislation: “enabling” or “organic” legislation and “appropriation 
authorization” legislation. Enabling or organic legislation is legislation that 
creates an agency, establishes a program, or prescribes a function, such as 
the Department of Education Organization Act or the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act. While the organic legislation may provide the 
necessary authority to conduct the program or activity, it, with relatively 
rare exceptions, does not provide any money. 

Appropriation authorization legislation, as the name implies, is legislation 
which authorizes the appropriation of funds to implement the organic 
legislation. It may be included as part of the organic legislation or it may be 
separate. As a general proposition, it too does not give the agency any 
actual money to spend. With certain exceptions (discussed in section B.1 of 
this chapter), only the appropriation act itself permits the withdrawal of 
funds from the Treasury. The principle has been stated as follows: 

“The mere authorization of an appropriation does not 
authorize expenditures on the faith thereof or the making of 
contracts obligating the money authorized to be 
appropriated.” 

16 Comp. Gen. 1007, 1008 (1937). Restated, an authorization of 
appropriations does not constitute an appropriation of public funds, but 
contemplates subsequent legislation by Congress actually appropriating 
the funds. 35 Comp. Gen. 306 (1955); 27 Comp. Dec. 923 (1921).56 

Like the organic legislation, authorization legislation is considered and 
reported by the committees with legislative jurisdiction over the particular 

56 See also 67 Comp. Gen. 332 (1988); 37 Comp. Gen. 732 (1958); 26 Comp. Gen. 452 (1947);

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

subject matter, whereas the appropriation bills are exclusively within the 
jurisdiction of the appropriations committees. 

There is no general requirement, either constitutional or statutory, that an 
appropriation act be preceded by a specific authorization act. E.g., 
71 Comp. Gen. 378, 380 (1992). The existence of a statute (organic 
legislation) imposing substantive functions upon an agency that require 
funding for their performance is itself sufficient authorization for the 
necessary appropriations. B-173832, July 16, 1976; B-173832, Aug. 1, 1975; 
B-111810, Mar. 8, 1974. However, statutory requirements for authorizations 
do exist in a number of specific situations. An example is section 660 of the 
Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7270 (“Appropriations 
to carry out the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to annual 
authorization”). Another example is 10 U.S.C. § 114(a), which provides that 
no funds may be appropriated for military construction, military 
procurement, and certain related research and development “unless funds 
therefor have been specifically authorized by law.” 

In addition, rules of the House of Representatives prohibit appropriations 
for expenditures not previously authorized by law. See Rule XXI(2), Rules 
of the House of Representatives. The effect of this Rule is to subject the 
offending appropriation to a point of order. A more limited provision exists 
in Rule XVI, Standing Rules of the Senate. 

The majority of appropriations today are preceded by some form of 
authorization although, as noted, it is not statutorily required in all cases. 

Authorizations take many different forms, depending in part on whether 
they are contained in the organic legislation or are separate. Authorizations 
contained in organic legislation may be “definite” (setting dollar limits 
either in the aggregate or for specific fiscal years) or “indefinite” 
(authorizing “such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of 
this act”). An indefinite authorization serves little purpose other than to 
comply with House Rule XXI. Appropriation authorizations enacted as 
separate legislation resemble appropriation acts in structure, for example, 
the annual Department of Defense Authorization Acts. 

An authorization act is basically a directive to Congress itself, which 
Congress is free to follow or alter (up or down) in the subsequent 
appropriation act. A statutory requirement for prior authorization is also 
essentially a congressional mandate to itself. Thus, for example, if Congress 
appropriates money to the Defense Department in violation of 10 U.S.C. 

Page 2-41 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

§ 114, there are no practical consequences. The appropriation is just as 
valid, and just as available for obligation, as if section 114 had been 
satisfied or did not exist. 

In sum, the typical sequence is: (1) organic legislation; (2) authorization of 
appropriations, if not contained in the organic legislation; and (3) the 
appropriation act. While this may be the “normal” sequence, there are 
deviations and variations, and it is not always possible to neatly label a 
given piece of legislation. Consider, for example, the following: 

“The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to 
pay to the Secretary of the Interior … for the benefit of the 
Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana … out of any money in the 
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the sum of 
$1,300,000.”57 

This is the first section of a law enacted to settle land claims by the 
Coushatta Tribe against the United States and to prescribe the use and 
distribution of the settlement funds. Applying the test described above in 
section B.1, it is certainly an appropriation—it contains a specific direction 
to pay and designates the funds to be used—but, in a technical sense, it is 
not an appropriation act. Also, it contains its own authorization. Thus, we 
have an authorization and an appropriation combined in a statute that is 
neither an authorization act (in the sense described above) nor an 
appropriation act. General classifications may be useful and perhaps 
essential, but they should not be expected to cover all situations. 

2. Specific Problem Areas 
and the Resolution of 
Conflicts 
a. Introduction Appropriation acts, as we have seen, do not exist in a vacuum. They are 
enacted against the backdrop of program legislation and, in many cases, 
specific authorization acts. This section deals with two broad but closely 
related issues. First, what precisely can Congress do in an appropriation 
act? Is it limited to essentially “rubber stamping” what has previously been 

57 Pub. L. No. 100-411, § 1(a)(1), 102 Stat. 1097 (Aug. 22, 1988). 

Page 2-42 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

authorized? Second, what does an agency do when faced with what it 
perceives to be an inconsistency between an appropriation act and some 
other statute? 

The remaining portions of this section raise these issues in a number of 
specific contexts. In this introduction, we present four important 
principles. The resolution of problems in the relationship of appropriation 
acts to other statutes will almost invariably lie in the application of one or 
more of these principles. 

First, as a general proposition, appropriations made to carry out 
authorizing laws “are made on the basis that the authorization acts in effect 
constitute an adjudication or legislative determination of the subject 
matter.” B-151157, June 27, 1963. Thus, except as specified otherwise in the 
appropriation act, appropriations to carry out enabling or authorizing laws 
must be expended in strict accord with the original authorization both as to 
the amount of funds to be expended and the nature of the work authorized. 
36 Comp. Gen. 240, 242 (1956); B-258000, Aug. 31, 1994; B-220682, Feb. 21, 
1986; B-204874, July 28, 1982; B-151157, supra; B-125404, Aug. 31, 1956. 
While it is true that one Congress cannot bind a future Congress, nor can it 
bind subsequent action by the same Congress, an authorization act is more 
than an academic exercise and its requirements must be followed unless 
changed by subsequent legislation. 

Second, Congress is free to amend or repeal prior legislation as long as it 
does so directly and explicitly and does not violate the Constitution. It is 
also possible for one statute to implicitly amend or repeal a prior statute, 
but it is firmly established that “repeal by implication” is disfavored, and 
statutes will be construed to avoid this result whenever reasonably 
possible. E.g., Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 189–90 
(1978); Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 549 (1974); Posadas v. National 
City Bank of New York, 296 U.S. 497, 503 (1936); 72 Comp. Gen. 295, 297 
(1993); 68 Comp. Gen. 19, 22–23 (1988); 64 Comp. Gen. 142, 145 (1984); 
58 Comp. Gen. 687, 691–92 (1979); B-290011, Mar. 25, 2002; B-261589, 
Mar. 6, 1996; B-258163, Sept. 29, 1994; B-236057, May 9, 1990. Repeals by 
implication are particularly disfavored in the appropriations context. 
Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society, 503 U.S. 429, 440 (1992). 

A repeal by implication will be found only where “the intention of the 
legislature to repeal [is] clear and manifest.” Posadas, 296 U.S. at 503; 
B-290011, supra; B-236057, supra. The principle that implied repeals are 
disfavored applies with special weight when it is asserted that a general 

Page 2-43 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

statute repeals a more specific statute. 72 Comp. Gen. at 297 and cases 
cited. 

A corollary to the “cardinal rule” against repeal by implication, or perhaps 
another way of saying the same thing, is the rule of construction that 
statutes should be construed harmoniously so as to give maximum effect to 
both wherever possible. E.g., Posadas, 296 U.S. at 503; Strawser v. Atkins, 
290 F.3d 720 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1045 (2002); 53 Comp. 
Gen. 853, 856 (1974); B-290011, supra; B-208593.6, Dec. 22, 1988. See 
B-258000, supra, for an example of harmonizing ambiguous appropriation 
and authorization provisions in order to effectuate congressional intent. 

Third, if two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict, the more recent statute, 
as the latest expression of Congress, governs. As one court concluded in a 
statement illustrating the eloquence of simplicity, “[t]he statutes are thus in 
conflict, the earlier permitting and the later prohibiting,” so the later statute 
supersedes the earlier. Eisenberg v. Corning, 179 F.2d 275, 277 (D.C. Cir. 
1949). In a sense, the “last in time” rule is yet another way of expressing the 
repeal by implication principle. We state it separately to highlight its 
narrowness: it applies only when the two statutes cannot be reconciled in 
any reasonable manner, and then only to the extent of the conflict. E.g., 
Posadas, 296 U.S. at 503; B-203900, Feb. 2, 1989; B-226389, Nov. 14, 1988; 
B-214172, July 10, 1984, aff’d upon reconsideration, 64 Comp. Gen. 282 
(1985). 

We will see later in this section that while the last in time rule can be stated 
with eloquent simplicity, its application is not always so simple. 

The fourth principle we state in two parts: 

First, despite the occasional comment to the contrary in judicial decisions 
(a few of which we will note later), Congress can and does “legislate” in 
appropriation acts. E.g., Preterm, Inc. v. Dukakis, 591 F.2d 121 (1st Cir.), 
cert. denied, 441 U.S. 952 (1979); Friends of the Earth v. Armstrong, 
485 F.2d 1 (10th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1171 (1974); Eisenberg v. 
Corning, supra; Tayloe v. Kjaer, 171 F.2d 343 (D.C. Cir. 1948). See also the 
Dickerson, Cella, and Thompson Products cases cited above in section B.4, 
and the discussion of the congressional power of the purse in Chapter 2, 
section B. It may well be that the device is “unusual and frowned upon.” 
Preterm, 591 F.2d at 131; Building & Construction Trades Department, 
AFL-CIO v. Martin, 961 F.2d 269, 273 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 915

which can substantively change existing law, there is a very strong 
presumption that they do not … and that when they do, the change is only 
intended for one fiscal year.”). It also may well be that the appropriation act 
will be narrowly construed when it is in apparent conflict with authorizing 
legislation. Calloway v. District of Columbia, 216 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2000); 
Donovan v. Carolina Stalite Co., 734 F.2d 1547, 1558 (D.C. Cir. 1984). 
Nevertheless, appropriation acts are, like any other statute, passed by both 
Houses of Congress and either signed by the President or enacted over a 
presidential veto. As such, and subject of course to constitutional 
strictures, they are “just as effective a way to legislate as are ordinary bills 
relating to a particular subject.” Friends of the Earth, 485 F.2d at 9; 
Envirocare of Utah Inc. v. United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 474, 482 (1999). 

Second, legislative history is not legislation. As useful and important as 
legislative history may be in resolving ambiguities and determining 
congressional intent, it is the language of the appropriation act, and not the 
language of its legislative history, that is enacted into law. E.g., Shannon v. 
United States, 512 U.S. 573, 583 (1994) (declining to give effect to 
“legislative history that is in no way anchored in the text of the statute.”). 
As the Supreme Court stated in a case previously cited, which we will 
discuss in more detail later: 

“Expressions of committees dealing with requests for 
appropriations cannot be equated with statutes enacted by 
Congress … .” 

Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. at 191; see also Lincoln v. 
Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993); Thompson v. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, 
334 F.3d 1075 (Fed. Cir. 2003). 

These, then, are the “guiding principles” that will be applied in various 
combinations and configurations to analyze and resolve the problem areas 
identified in the remainder of this section. For the most part, our 
subsequent discussion will merely note the applicable principle(s). A useful 
supplemental reference on many of the topics we discuss is Louis Fisher, 

The Authorization-Appropriation Process in Congress: Formal Rules and 
Informal Practices, 29 Cath. U.L. Rev. 51 (1979).

b. Variations in Amount 
Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

(1) Appropriation exceeds authorization 
Generally speaking, Congress is free to appropriate more money for a given 
object than the amount previously authorized. As the Comptroller General 
stated in a brief letter to a Member of Congress: 

“While legislation providing for an appropriation of funds in 
excess of the amount contained in a related authorization 
act apparently would be subject to a point of order under 
rule 21 of the Rules of the House of Representatives, there 
would be no basis on which we could question otherwise 
proper expenditures of funds actually appropriated.” 

B-123469, Apr. 14, 1955. 

The governing principle was stated as follows in 36 Comp. Gen. 240, 242 
(1956): 

“It is fundamental … that one Congress cannot bind a future 
Congress and that the Congress has full power to make an 
appropriation in excess of a cost limitation contained in the 
original authorization act. This authority is exercised as an 
incident to the power of the Congress to appropriate and 
regulate expenditures of the public money.” 

If we are dealing with a line-item appropriation or a specific earmark in a 
lump-sum appropriation, the quoted statement would appear beyond 
dispute. However, complications arise where the authorization for a given 
item is specific and a subsequent lump-sum appropriation includes a higher 
amount for that item specified only in legislative history and not in the 
appropriation act itself. In this situation, the rule that one Congress cannot 
bind a future Congress or later action by the same Congress must be 
modified somewhat by the rule against repeal by implication. The line of 
demarcation, however, is not precisely defined. 

In 36 Comp. Gen. 240, Congress had authorized the construction of two 
bridges across the Potomac River “at a cost not to exceed” $7 million. A 
subsequent appropriation act made a lump-sum appropriation that 
included funds for the bridge construction (specified in legislative history 
but not in the appropriation act itself) in excess of the amount authorized. 
The decision concluded that the appropriation, as the latest expression of 
Congress on the matter, was available for expenditure. Similarly, it was 

Page 2-46 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

held in B-148736, Sept. 15, 1977, that the National Park Service could 
expend its lump-sum appropriation for planning and construction of parks 
even though the expenditures for specific parks would exceed amounts 
authorized to be appropriated for those parks. 

Both of these cases were distinguished in 64 Comp. Gen. 282 (1985), which 
affirmed a prior decision, B-214172, July 10, 1984. Authorizing legislation 
for the Small Business Administration (SBA) provided specific funding 
levels for certain SBA programs. SBA’s 1984 appropriation act contained a 
lump-sum appropriation for the programs which, according to the 
conference report, included amounts in excess of the funding levels 
specified in the authorization. Relying in part on Tennessee Valley 
Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978), GAO concluded that the two statutes 
were not in conflict, that the appropriation did not implicitly repeal or 
amend the authorizations, and that the spending levels in the authorization 
were controlling. The two prior cases were distinguished as being limited 
in scope and dealing with different factual situations. 64 Comp. Gen. at 285. 
For example, it was clear in the prior cases that Congress was knowingly 
providing funds in excess of the authorization ceilings. In contrast, the SBA 
appropriation made explicit reference to the authorizing statute, thus 
suggesting that Congress did not intend that the appropriation be 
inconsistent with the authorized spending levels. Id. at 286–87. 

(2) Appropriation less than authorization 
Congress is free to appropriate less than an amount authorized either in an 
authorization act or in program legislation, again, as in the case of 
exceeding an authorization, at least where it does so directly. E.g., 
53 Comp. Gen. 695 (1974). This includes the failure to fund a program at all, 
that is, not to appropriate any funds. United States v. Dickerson, 310 U.S. 
554 (1940). 

A case in point is City of Los Angeles v. Adams, 556 F.2d 40 (D.C. Cir. 
1977). The Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 authorized airport 
development grants “in aggregate amounts not less than” specified dollar 
amounts for specified fiscal years, and provided an apportionment formula. 
Pub. L. No. 91-258, title I, 84 Stat. 219 (May 21, 1970). Subsequent 
appropriation acts included specific limitations on the aggregate amounts 
to be available for the grants, less than the amounts authorized. The court 
concluded that both laws could be given effect by limiting the amounts 
available to those specified in the appropriation acts, but requiring that 

Page 2-47 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

they be distributed in accordance with the formula of the authorizing 
legislation. In holding the appropriation limits controlling, the court said: 

“According to its own rules, Congress is not supposed to use 
appropriations measures as vehicles for the amendment of 
general laws, including revision of expenditure 
authorization… . Where Congress chooses to do so, 
however, we are bound to follow Congress’s last word on 
the matter even in an appropriations law.” 

Id. at 48–49. 

Relying on City of Los Angeles v. Adams, the court in Ramah Navajo 
School Board, Inc. v. Babbitt, 87 F.3d 1338 (D.C. Cir. 1996), held that, while 
appropriations in amounts less than envisioned in authorization acts 
control, an agency must still adhere as much as possible to the authorizing 
statute in distributing such funds: 

“[I]t is clear that the Congress responsible for the ISDA 
[Indian Self-Determination Act] did not intend, in the case of 
insufficient funding, for the numerous detailed provisions of 
the Act to be shunted aside by a Secretary exercising total 
discretion in allocation of the funds. Nor, as the legislative 
history shows, did the 1995 Congress which appropriated 
insufficient funds intend for its shortfall to eviscerate the 
substantive provisions of the earlier Act.” 

87 F.3d at 1349 (emphasis in original). 

Where the amount authorized to be appropriated is mandatory rather than 
discretionary, Congress can still appropriate less, or can suspend or repeal 
the authorizing legislation, as long as the intent to suspend or repeal the 
authorization is clear. The power is considerably diminished, however, with 
respect to entitlements that have already vested. The distinction is made 
clear in the following passage from the Supreme Court’s decision in United 
States v. Larionoff, 431 U.S. 864, 879 (1977): 

“No one disputes that Congress may prospectively reduce 
the pay of members of the Armed Forces, even if that 
reduction deprived members of benefits they had expected 
to be able to earn… . It is quite a different matter, however, 

Page 2-48 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

for Congress to deprive a service member of pay due for 
services already performed, but still owing. In that case, the 
congressional action would appear in a different 
constitutional light.” 

Several earlier cases provide concrete illustrations of what Congress can 
and cannot do in an appropriation act to reduce or eliminate a nonvested 
mandatory authorization. In United States v. Fisher, 109 U.S. 143 (1883), 
permanent legislation set the salaries of certain territorial judges. Congress 
subsequently appropriated a lesser amount, “in full compensation” for that 
particular year. The Court held that Congress had the power to reduce the 
salaries, and had effectively done so. “It is impossible that both acts should 
stand. No ingenuity can reconcile them. The later act must therefore 
prevail… .” Id. at 146. See also United States v. Mitchell, 109 U.S. 146 
(1883). In the Dickerson case cited above, the Court found a mandatory 
authorization effectively suspended by a provision in an appropriation act 
prohibiting the use of funds for the payment in question “notwithstanding 
the applicable portions of” the authorizing legislation. 

In the cases in the preceding paragraph, the “reduction by appropriation” 
was effective because the intent of the congressional action was 
unmistakable. The mere failure to appropriate sufficient funds is not 
enough. In United States v. Langston, 118 U.S. 389 (1886), for example, the 
Court refused to find a repeal by implication in “subsequent enactments 
which merely appropriated a less amount … and which contained no words 
that expressly, or by clear implication, modified or repealed the previous 
law.” Id. at 394. A similar holding is United States v. Vulte, 233 U.S. 509 
(1914). A failure to appropriate in this type of situation will prevent 
administrative agencies from making payment, but, as in Langston and 
Vulte, is unlikely to prevent recovery by way of a lawsuit. See also Wetsel-
Oviatt Lumber Co., Inc. v. United States, 38 Fed. Cl. 563, 570–571 (1997); 
New York Airways, Inc. v. United States, 369 F.2d 743 (Ct. Cl. 1966); 
Gibney v. United States, 114 Ct. Cl. 38 (1949). 

Thus, appropriating less than the amount of a nonvested mandatory 
authorization, including not appropriating any funds for it, will be effective 
under the “last in time” rule as long as the intent to suspend or repeal the 
authorization is clear. However, by virtue of the rule against repeal by 
implication, a mere failure to appropriate sufficient funds will not be 
construed as amending or repealing prior authorizing legislation. 

Page 2-49 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Another complication arises when an authorization act creates what would 
otherwise be an entitlement to funds, but then makes that entitlement 
“subject to the availability of appropriations.” A case in point is the Indian 
Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 450–450n. 
The complex provisions of the Act in effect guarantee Indian tribes a 
certain level of reimbursement for their costs in administering federal 
programs. However, the Act makes this guarantee subject to the availability 
of appropriations and further provides that the Secretary of the Interior is 
not required to reduce program funding for other tribes or tribal 
organizations in order to satisfy this guarantee. See 25 U.S.C. § 450j-1(a) 
and (b). These provisions have spawned much litigation, including the 
Ramah Navajo School Board case, discussed previously. 

The courts have agreed that the “subject to the availability of 
appropriations” language conditions the Act’s entitlement, so that the 
reimbursement amounts intended by the Act must be reduced where 
Congress has clearly appropriated insufficient funds to meet them in full. 
See in addition to Ramah: Thompson v. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, 334 
F.3d 1075 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Cherokee Nation II); Cherokee Nation of 
Oklahoma v. Thompson, 311 F.3d 1054 (10th Cir. 2002) (Cherokee Nation I); 
Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation v. Thompson, 
279 F.3d 660 (9th Cir. 2002); and Babbitt v. Oglala Sioux Tribal Public 
Safety Department, 194 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 
1203 (2000). However, the courts differ on whether Congress did or did not 
provide insufficient funds for particular fiscal years. Compare Cherokee 
Nation II with Cherokee Nation I and Shoshone-Bannock. 

(3) Earmarks in authorization act 
In Chapter 6, section B, we set forth the various types of language Congress 
uses in appropriation acts when it wants to “earmark” a portion of a lump-
sum appropriation as either a maximum or a minimum to be spent on some 
particular object. These same types of earmarking language can be used in 
authorization acts. 

A number of cases have considered the question of whether there is a 
conflict when an authorization establishes a minimum earmark (“not less 
than,” “shall be available only”), and the related appropriation is a lump-
sum appropriation which does not expressly mention the earmark. Is the 
agency in this situation required to observe the earmark? Applying the 
principle that an appropriation must be expended in accordance with the 
related authorization unless the appropriation act provides otherwise, GAO 

Page 2-50 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

has concluded that the agency must observe the earmark. 64 Comp. 
Gen. 388 (1985); B-220682, Feb. 21, 1986 (“an earmark in an authorization 
act must be followed where a lump sum is appropriated pursuant to the 
authorization”); B-207343, Aug. 18, 1982; B-193282, Dec. 21, 1978. See also 
B-131935, Mar. 17, 1986. This result applies even though following the 
earmark will drastically reduce the amount of funds available for 
nonearmarked programs funded under the same appropriation. 64 Comp. 
Gen. at 391. (These cases can also be viewed as another application of the 
rule against repeal by implication.) 

If Congress expressly appropriates an amount at variance with a previously 
enacted authorization earmark, the appropriation will control under the 
last in time rule. For example, in 53 Comp. Gen. 695 (1974), an 
authorization act had expressly earmarked $18 million for the United 
Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) for specific 
fiscal years. A subsequent appropriation act provided a lump sum, out of 
which only $15 million was earmarked for UNICEF. The Comptroller 
General concluded that the $15 million specified in the appropriation act 
was controlling and represented the maximum available for UNICEF for 
that fiscal year. 

c. Variations in Purpose As noted previously, it is only the appropriation, and not the authorization 
by itself, that permits the incurring of obligations and the making of 
expenditures. It follows that an authorization does not, as a general 
proposition, expand the scope of availability of appropriations beyond 
what is permissible under the terms of the appropriation act. The 
authorized purpose must be implemented either by a specific appropriation 
or by inclusion in a broader lump-sum appropriation. Thus, an 
appropriation made for specific purposes is not available for related but 
more extended purposes contained in the authorization act but not 
included in the appropriation. 19 Comp. Gen. 961 (1940). See also 37 Comp. 
Gen. 732 (1958); 35 Comp. Gen. 306 (1955); 26 Comp. Gen. 452 (1947). 
In addition to simply failing to appropriate funds for an authorized purpose, 
Congress can expressly restrict the use of an appropriation for a purpose or 
purposes included in the authorization. E.g., B-24341, Apr. 1, 1942 
(“whatever may have been the intention of the original enabling act it must 
give way to the express provisions of the later act which appropriated 
funds but limited their use”). 

Page 2-51 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


d. Period of Availability 
Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Similarly, by express provision in an appropriation act, Congress can 
expand authorized purposes. In 67 Comp. Gen. 401 (1988), for example, an 
appropriation expressly included two mandatory earmarks for projects 
beyond the scope of the related authorization. Noting that “the 
appropriation language provides its own expanded authorization for these 
programs,” GAO concluded that the agency was required to reserve funds 
for the two mandatory earmarks before committing the balance of the 
appropriation for discretionary expenditures. 

Except to the extent Congress expressly expands or limits authorized 
purposes in the appropriation act, the appropriation must be used in 
accordance with the authorization act in terms of purpose. Thus, in 
B-125404, Aug. 31, 1956, it was held that an appropriation to construct a 
bridge across the Potomac River pursuant to a statute authorizing 
construction of the bridge and prescribing its location was not available to 
construct the bridge at a slightly different location even though the 
planners favored the alternate location. Similarly, in B-193307, Feb. 6, 1979, 
the Flood Control Act of 1970 authorized construction of a dam and 
reservoir for the Ellicott Creek project in New York. Subsequently, 
legislation was proposed to authorize channel construction instead of the 
dam and reservoir, but was not enacted. A continuing resolution made a 
lump-sum appropriation for flood control projects “authorized by law.” The 
Comptroller General found that the appropriation did not repeal the prior 
authorization, and that therefore, the funds could not properly be used for 
the alternative channel construction. 

An authorization of appropriations, like an appropriation itself, may 
authorize appropriations to be made on a multiple year or no-year, as well 
as fiscal year, basis. The question we address here is the extent to which 
the period of availability specified in an authorization or enabling act is 
controlling. Congress can, in an appropriation act, enact a different period 
of availability than that specified in the authorization. The implications for 
an appropriation of language in the authorization of that appropriation 
specifying a period of availability for the appropriation being authorized is 
a matter of statutory construction. 

Thus, an appropriation of funds “to remain available until expended” (noyear) 
was found controlling over a provision in the authorizing legislation 
that authorized appropriations on a 2-year basis. B-182101, Oct. 16, 1974. 
See also B-149372, B-158195, Apr. 29, 1969 (2-year appropriation of 
presidential transition funds held controlling notwithstanding provision in 
Presidential Transition Act of 1963, which authorized services and facilities 

Page 2-52 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

to former President and Vice President only for 6 months after expiration 
of term of office). In a 1982 decision, 61 Comp. Gen. 532, GAO reconciled 
an authorization act and an appropriation act by finding the appropriation 
to be a no-year appropriation, except to the extent the related authorization 
specified a lesser period of availability. The authorization act had 
authorized funds to be appropriated for a particular project “for fiscal year 
1978.” The fiscal year 1978 funds for that project were included in a larger 
lump sum appropriated “as authorized by law, to remain available until 
expended.” In reconciling the two statutes, GAO concluded that funds for 
the project in question from the lump-sum appropriation were available for 
obligation only during fiscal year 1978. 

Until 1971, the test GAO applied in cases like these was whether the 
appropriation language specifically referred to the authorization. If it did, 
then GAO considered the provisions of the authorization act—including 
any multiple year or no-year authorizations—to be incorporated by 
reference into the provisions of the appropriation act. This was regarded as 
sufficient to overcome 31 U.S.C. § 1301(c), which presumes that an 
appropriation is for one fiscal year unless the appropriation states 
otherwise, and to overcome the presumption of fiscal year availability 
derived from the enacting clause of the appropriation act. If the 
appropriation language did not specifically refer to the authorization act, 
the appropriation was held to be available only for the fiscal year covered 
by the appropriation act. 45 Comp. Gen. 508 (1966); 45 Comp. Gen. 236 
(1965); B-147196, Apr. 5, 1965; B-127518, May 10, 1956; B-37398, Oct. 26, 
1943. The reference had to be specific; the phrase “as authorized by law” 
was not enough. B-127518, May 10, 1956. 

By 1971, however, Congress was enacting (and continues to enact) a 
general provision in all appropriation acts: “[n]o part of any appropriation 
contained in this Act shall remain available for obligation beyond the 
current fiscal year unless expressly so provided herein.” Now, if an 
appropriation act contains the provision quoted in the preceding 
paragraph, it will not be sufficient for an appropriation contained in that 
act to merely incorporate a multiple year or no-year authorization by 
reference. The effect of this general provision is to require the 
appropriation language to expressly provide for availability beyond one 
year in order to overcome the enacting clause. 50 Comp. Gen. 857 (1971). 

The general provision resulted from the efforts of the House Committee on 
Appropriations in connection with the 1964 foreign aid appropriations bill. 

Page 2-53 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

In its report on that bill, the Committee first described then-existing 
practice: 

“The custom and practice of the Committee on 
Appropriations has been to recommend appropriations on 
an annual basis unless there is some valid reason to make 
the item available for longer than a one-year period. The 
most common technique in the latter instances is to add the 
words ‘to remain available until expended’ to the 
appropriation paragraph. 

“In numerous instances, … the Congress has in the 
underlying enabling legislation authorized appropriations 
therefor to be made on an ‘available until expended’ basis. 
When he submits the budget, the President generally 
includes the phrase ‘to remain available until expended’ in 
the proposed appropriation language if that is what the 
Executive wishes to propose. The Committee either concurs 
or drops the phrase from the appropriation language.” 

H.R. Rep. No. 88-1040, at 55 (1963). The Committee then noted a situation 
in the 1963 appropriation that had apparently generated some 
disagreement. The President had requested certain refugee assistance 
funds to remain available until expended. The report goes on to state: 
“The Committee thought the funds should be on a 1-year 

basis, thus the phrase ‘to remain available until expended’ 

was not in the bill as reported. The final law also failed to 

include the phrase or any other express language of similar 

import. Thus Congress took affirmative action to limit the 

availability to the fiscal year 1963 only.” 

Id. at 56. The Committee then quoted what is now 31 U.S.C. § 1301(c), and 
stated: 

“The above quoted 31 U.S.C. [§ 1301(c)] seems clearly to 
govern and, in respect to the instant class of appropriation, 
to require the act making the appropriation to expressly 
provide for availability longer than 1 year if the enacting 
clause limiting the appropriations in the law to a given fiscal 
year is to be overcome as to any specific appropriation 

Page 2-54 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

therein made. And it accords with the rule of reason and 
ancient practice to retain control of such an elementary 
matter wholly within the terms of the law making the 
appropriation. The two hang together. But in view of the 
question in the present case and the possibility of similar 
questions in a number of others, consideration may have to 
be given to revising the provisions of 31 U.S.C. [§ 1301(c)] to 
make its scope and meaning crystal clear and perhaps 
update it as may otherwise appear desirable.” 

Id. (emphasis in original). 

Section 1301(c) was not amended, but soon after the above discussion 
appeared, appropriation acts started including the general provision stating 
that “[n]o part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall remain 
available for obligation beyond the current fiscal year unless expressly so 
provided herein.” This added another ingredient to the recipe that had not 
been present in the earlier decisions, although it took several years before 
the new general provision began appearing in almost all appropriation acts. 

When the issue arose again in a 1971 case, GAO considered the new 
appropriation act provision and the 1963 comments of the House 
Appropriations Committee. In that decision, GAO noted that “it seems 
evident that the purpose [of the new general provision] is to overcome the 
effect of our decisions … regarding the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 
[§ 1301(c)],” and further noted the apparent link between the discussion in 
House Report 1040 and the appearance of the new provision. 50 Comp. 
Gen. at 859. See also 58 Comp. Gen. 321 (1979); B-207792, Aug. 24, 1982. 
Thus, the appropriation act will have to expressly repeat the multiple year 
or no-year language of the authorization, or at least expressly refer to the 
specific section of the authorizing statute in which it appears. 

Changes in the law from year to year may produce additional 
complications. For example, the National Historic Preservation Act, Pub. L. 
No. 89-665, § 103(b), 80 Stat. 915, 916 (Oct. 15, 1966) (authorization), 
provided that funds appropriated and apportioned to states would remain 
available for obligation for three fiscal years, after which time any 
unobligated balances would be reapportioned. This amounted to a no-year 
authorization. For several years, appropriations to fund the program were 
made on a no-year basis, thus permitting implementation of the 
authorization provision. Starting with fiscal year 1978, however, the 
appropriation act was changed and the funds were made available for two 

Page 2-55 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

e. Authorization Enacted 
After Appropriation 
fiscal years. See Pub. L. No. 95-74, 91 Stat. 289 (July 26, 1977). This raised 
the question of whether the appropriation act had the effect of overriding 
the apparently conflicting authorizing language, or if it meant merely that 
reapportionment could occur after two fiscal years instead of three, thus 
effectively remaining a no-year appropriation. 

GAO concluded that the literal language and plain meaning of the 
appropriation act must govern. In addition to the explicit appropriation 
language, the appropriation acts contained the general provision restricting 
availability to the current fiscal year unless expressly provided otherwise 
therein. Therefore, any funds not obligated by the end of the 2-year period 
would expire and could not be reapportioned. B-151087, Feb. 17, 1982; 
B-151087, Sept. 15, 1981. 

For purposes of the rule of 50 Comp. Gen. 857 and its progeny, it makes no 
difference whether the authorization is in an annual authorization of 
appropriations act or in permanent enabling legislation. It also appears to 
make no difference whether the authorization merely authorizes the longer 
period of availability or directs it. See, for example, 58 Comp. Gen. 321, 
supra, in which the general provision restricting availability to the current 
fiscal year, as the later expression of congressional intent, was held to 
override 25 U.S.C. § 13a, which provides that the unobligated balances of 
certain Indian assistance appropriations “shall remain available for 
obligation and expenditure” for a second fiscal year. See also 71 Comp. 
Gen. 39, 40 (1991); B-249087, June 25, 1992. Similarly, in Dabney v. Reagan, 
No. 82 Civ. 2231-CSH (S.D. N.Y. June 6, 1985), the court held that a 2-year 
period of availability specified in appropriation acts would override a 
“mandatory” no-year authorization contained in the Solar Energy and 
Energy Conservation Bank Act. 

Our discussion thus far has, for the most part, been in the context of the 
normal sequence—that is, the authorization act is passed before the 
appropriation act. Sometimes, however, consideration of the authorization 
act is delayed and it is not enacted until after the appropriation act. 
Determining the relationship between the two acts involves application of 
the same general principles we have been applying when the acts are 
enacted in the normal sequence. 

The first step is to attempt to construe the statutes together in some 
reasonable fashion. To the extent this can be done, there is no real conflict, 
and the reversed sequence will in many cases make no difference. Earlier, 
for example, we discussed the rule that a specific earmark in an 

Page 2-56 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

authorization act must be followed when the related appropriation is an 
unspecified lump sum. In two of the cases cited for that proposition— 
B-220682, Feb. 21, 1986, and B-193282, Dec. 21, 1978—the appropriation act 
had been enacted prior to the authorization, a factor that did not affect the 
outcome. 

In B-193282, for example, the 1979 Justice Department authorization act 
authorized a lump-sum appropriation to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service (INS) and provided that $2 million “shall be 
available” for the investigation and prosecution of certain cases involving 
alleged Nazi war criminals. The 1979 appropriation act made a lump-sum 
appropriation to the INS but contained no specific mention of the Nazi war 
criminal item. The appropriation act was enacted on October 10, 1978, but 
the authorization act was not enacted until November. In response to a 
question as to the effect of the authorization provision on the 
appropriation, the Comptroller General advised that the two statutes could 
be construed harmoniously, and that the $2 million earmarked in the 
authorization act could be spent only for the purpose specified. It was 
further noted that the $2 million represented a minimum but not a 
maximum. B-193282, supra, amplified by B-193282, Jan. 25, 1979. This is 
the same result that would have been reached if the normal sequence had 
been followed. 

Similarly, in B-226389, Nov. 14, 1988, a provision in the 1987 Defense 
Appropriation Act prohibited the Navy from including certain provisions in 
ship maintenance contracts. The 1987 authorization act, enacted after the 
appropriation, amended a provision in Title 10 of the United States Code to 
require the prohibited provisions. Application of the last in time rule would 
have negated the appropriation act provision. However, it was possible to 
give effect to both provisions by construing the appropriation restriction as 
a temporary exemption from the permanent legislation in the authorization 
act. Again, this is the same result that would have been reached if the 
authorization act were enacted first. 

If the authorization and appropriation cannot be reasonably reconciled, the 
last in time rule will apply just as it would under the normal sequence, 
except here the result will be different because the authorization is the 
later of the two. A 1989 case will illustrate. The 1989 Treasury Department 
appropriation act contained a provision prohibiting placing certain 
components of the Department under the oversight of the Treasury 
Inspector General. A month later, Congress enacted legislation placing 
those components under the Inspector General’s jurisdiction and 

Page 2-57 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

transferring their internal audit staffs to the Inspector General 
“notwithstanding any other provision of law.” But for the “notwithstanding” 
clause, it might have been possible to use the same approach as in B-226389 
and find the appropriation restriction a temporary exemption from the new 
permanent legislation. In view of that clause, however, GAO found that the 
two provisions could not be reconciled, and concluded that the Inspector 
General legislation, as the later enactment, superseded the appropriation 
act provision. B-203900, Feb. 2, 1989. 

Two other examples of invoking the last in time rule can be found in 
dueling Defense Department authorization and appropriation act 
provisions. In one case, the Defense appropriations act for 1992 directed 
the Defense Department to extend a contract relating to the Civilian Heath 
and Medical Program for Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) program for 
another year. However, the defense authorization act for 1992 
countermanded that mandate and permitted the Defense Department to 
award a new contract. In B-247119, Mar. 2, 1992, the Comptroller General 
had little difficulty concluding that the two provisions were irreconcilably 
in conflict. Indeed, the legislative history demonstrated that the drafters of 
the appropriation and authorization acts sought to trump each other on this 
point as their two bills proceeded through Congress. The more difficult 
issue was how to apply the last in time rule to the case. The complication 
was that, while Congress had completed action on the authorization bill 
first (1 day before the appropriation bill), the President acted in the 
opposite order—signing the appropriation bill into law 9 days before he 
signed the authorization bill. Noting that the date on which the President 
signs a bill is clearly the date it becomes law, the Comptroller General held 
that the authorization act was the later in time, and thus, its provisions 
controlled. 

The other case involved competing provisions in the Defense authorization 
and appropriation acts for fiscal year 1993. Section 351(a) of the 
authorization act (Pub. L. No. 102-484, 106 Stat. 2377), which the President 
signed into law on October 23, 1992, required the use of competitive 
procedures before Defense took action to consolidate certain maintenance 
activities at a single depot. Section 9152 of the appropriation act (Pub. L. 
No. 102-396, 106 Stat. 1943), which the President had signed several weeks 
earlier on October 6, provided that, notwithstanding section 351(a) of the 
authorization act, no funds could be used to prevent or delay the depot 
consolidation. In the ensuing litigation, the court ultimately determined 
that the two provisions could be reconciled. American Federation of 
Government Employees, Local 1945 v. Cheney, CV92-PT-2453-E (N.D.  


Page 2-58 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Ala., Dec. 21, 1992). However, citing B-247119 among other sources, the 
court added that if the provisions were irreconcilable, the later in time 
would prevail. In this connection, the court noted that the tension between 
the two provisions apparently stemmed from efforts by individual Members 
of Congress to protect federal facilities within their districts and observed: 

“There is perhaps even more reason to apply the more 
objective standards of ‘last enacted prevails’ and/or the 
requirement of a ‘clear manifestation of intent to repeal’ 
when the legislation is more significantly influenced by 
individual Congressmen than by the ‘intent’ of Congress.” 

AFGE, Local 1945, Slip Op. at 24. 

Just as with any other application of the last in time rule, the later 
enactment prevails only to the extent of the irreconcilable conflict. 
B-61178, Oct. 21, 1946 (specific limitations in appropriation act not 
superseded by after-enacted authorization absent indication that 
authorization was intended to alter provisions of prior appropriation). 

Sometimes, application of the standard principles fails to produce a simple 
answer. For example, Congress appropriated $75 million for fiscal year 
1979 for urban formula grants “as authorized by the Urban Mass 
Transportation Act of 1964.” When the appropriation was enacted, 
legislation was pending—and was enacted 3 months after the 
appropriation—repealing the existing formula and replacing it with a new 
and somewhat broader formula. The new formula provision specified that 
it was to be applicable to “sums appropriated pursuant to subparagraph (b) 
of this paragraph.” On the one hand, since the original formula had been 
repealed, it could no longer control the use of the appropriation. Yet on the 
other hand, funds appropriated 3 months prior to passage of the new 
formula could not be said to have been appropriated “pursuant to” the new 
act. Hence, neither formula was clearly applicable to the $75 million. The 
Comptroller General concluded that the $75 million earmarked for the 
grant program had to be honored and that it should be distributed in 
accordance with those portions of the new formula that were “consistent 
with the terms of the appropriation,” that is, the funds should be used in 
accordance with those elements of the new formula that had also been 
reflected in the original formula. B-175155, July 25, 1979. 

f. Two Statutes Enacted on The Supreme Court has said that the doctrine against repeal by implication 
Same Day is even more forceful “where the one act follows close upon the other, at 
Page 2-59 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

the same session of the Legislature.” Morf v. Bingaman, 298 U.S. 407, 414 
(1936); see also Auburn Housing Authority v. Martinez, 277 F.3d 138, 145 
(2nd Cir. 2002); B-277905, Mar. 17, 1998. This being the case, the doctrine 
reaches perhaps its strongest point, and the “last in time” rule is 
correspondingly at its weakest, when both statutes are enacted on the 
same day. Except in the very rare case in which the intent of one statute to 
affect the other is particularly manifest, it makes little sense to apply a last 
in time concept where the time involved is a matter of hours, or as in one 
case (B-79243, Sept. 28, 1948), 7 minutes. Thus, the starting point is the 
presumption—applicable in all cases but even stronger in this situation— 
that Congress intended both statutes to stand together. 67 Comp. Gen. 332, 
335 (1988); B-204078.2, May 6, 1988. 

When there is an apparent conflict between an appropriation act and 
another statute enacted on the same day, the approach is to make every 
effort to reconcile the statutes so as to give maximum effect to both. In 
some cases, it will be found that there is no real conflict. In 67 Comp. 
Gen. 332, for example, one statute authorized certain Commodity Credit 
Corporation appropriations to be made in the form of current, indefinite 
appropriations, while the appropriation act, enacted on the same day, made 
line-item appropriations. There was no conflict because the authorization 
provision was a directive to Congress itself that Congress was free to 
disregard, subject to a possible point of order, when making the actual 
appropriation. Similarly, there was no inconsistency between an 
appropriation act provision, which required that Panama Canal 
Commission appropriations be spent only in conformance with the Panama 
Canal Treaty of 1977 and its implementing legislation, and an authorization 
act provision, enacted on the same day, requiring prior specific 
authorizations. B-204078.2, supra. 

In other cases, applying traditional rules of statutory construction will 
produce reconciliation. For example, if one statute can be said to be more 
specific than the other, they can be reconciled by applying the more 
specific provision first, with the broader statute then applying to any 
remaining situations. See B-231662, Sept. 1, 1988; B-79243, supra. 

Legislative history may also help. In B-207186, Feb. 10, 1989, for example, 
authorizing legislation extended the life of the Solar Energy and Energy 
Conservation Bank to March 15, 1988. The 1988 appropriation, enacted on 
the same day, made a 2-year appropriation for the Bank. Not only were 
there no indications of any intent for the appropriation to have the effect of 
extending the Bank’s life, there were specific indications to the contrary. 

Page 2-60 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

g. Ratification by 
Appropriation 
Thus, GAO regarded the appropriation as available, in theory for the full 
2-year period, except that the authority for anyone to obligate the 
appropriation would cease when the Bank went out of existence. 

The most extreme situation, and one in which the last in time rule by 
definition cannot possibly apply, is two conflicting provisions in the same 
statute. Even here, the approaches outlined above will usually prove 
successful. See, e.g., B-211306, June 6, 1983. We have found only one case, 
26 Comp. Dec. 534 (1920), in which two provisions in the same act were 
found irreconcilable. One provision in an appropriation act appropriated 
funds to the Army for the purchase of land; another provision a few pages 
later in the same act expressly prohibited the use of Army appropriations 
for the purchase of land. The Comptroller of the Treasury concluded, in a 
very brief decision, that the prohibition nullified the appropriation. The 
advantage of this result, although not stated this way in the decision, is that 
Congress would ultimately have to resolve the conflict and it is easier to 
make expenditures that have been deferred than to recoup money after it 
has been spent. 

The fact that two allegedly conflicting provisions were contained in the 
same statute influenced the court to reconcile them in Auburn Housing 
Authority, supra. The funding restriction provision used the word 
“hereafter,” which, as the court acknowledged, ordinarily connotes 
permanence. However, the court nonetheless held that this provision 
applied only for the duration of the fiscal year and did not constitute an 
implied repeal of the other provision. The opinion observed in this regard: 

“Given the unique circumstances of this case, the court is not 
convinced that the mere presence of the word ‘hereafter’ in 
section 226 clearly demonstrates Congress’s intent to repeal 
section 519(n). This could be a different case if sections 226 
and 519(n) appeared in separate statutes, but that is not the 
question we consider in the instant appeal.” 

277 F.3d at 146. 

“Ratification by appropriation” is the doctrine by which Congress can, by 
the appropriation of funds, confer legitimacy on an agency action that was 
questionable when it was taken. Clearly Congress may ratify that which it 
could have authorized. Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, 300 U.S. 297, 
301–02 (1937). It is also settled that Congress may manifest its ratification 
by the appropriation of funds. Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474,

504–06 (1959); Ex Parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283, 303 n.24 (1944); Brooks v. 
Dewar, 313 U.S. 354, 360–61 (1941). 

Having said this, however, we must also emphasize that “ratification by 
appropriation is not favored and will not be accepted where prior 
knowledge of the specific disputed action cannot be demonstrated clearly.” 
District of Columbia Federation of Civic Ass’ns v. Airis, 391 F.2d 478, 482 

(D.C. Cir. 1968); Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. Morton, 507 F.2d 
1167, 1174 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 830 (1975); American 
Legion v. Derwinski, 827 F. Supp. 805, 809 (D.D.C. 1993), aff’d, 54 F.3d 789 
(D.C. Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1041 (1996). 
Thus, a simple lump-sum appropriation, without more, will generally not 
afford sufficient basis to find a ratification by appropriation. Endo, 323 U.S. 
at 303 n.24; Airis, 391 F.2d at 481–82; Wade v. Lewis, 561 F. Supp. 913, 944 

(N.D. Ill. 1983); B-213771, July 10, 1984. The appropriation “must plainly 
show a purpose to bestow the precise authority which is claimed.” Endo, 
323 U.S. at 303 n.24. Accord: Schism v. United States, 316 F.3d 1259, 1289– 
1290 (Fed. Cir. 2002), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 123 S. Ct. 2246 (2003) 
(“ratification ordinarily cannot occur in the appropriations context unless 
the appropriations bill itself expressly allocates funds for a specific agency 
or activity”); A-1 Cigarette Vending, Inc. v. United States, 49 Fed. Cl. 345, 
354 (2001), aff’d sub nom. 304 F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2002), cert. denied sub 
nom. ___ U.S. ___, 123 S. Ct. 1570 (2003) (“[S]imply because the lack of an 
appropriation demonstrates a lack of authority does not mean that an 
appropriation by itself will create such authority… . [A] general 
appropriation of funds for an overall program is not sufficient to bestow 
authority upon a particular aspect of an agency’s program.”). 
Some courts have used language which, when taken out of context, implies 
that appropriations cannot serve to ratify prior agency action. E.g., 
Concerned Residents of Buck Hill Falls v. Grant, 537 F.2d 29, 35 n.12 
(3rd Cir. 1976); University of the District of Columbia Faculty Ass’n v. 
Board of Trustees of the University of the District of Columbia, 994 F. 
Supp. 1, 10 (D.D.C. 1998). Nevertheless, while the doctrine may not be 
favored, it does exist. The courts demonstrate their reluctance to apply this 
doctrine by giving extra scrutiny to alleged ratifications by appropriation. 
Their reluctance to find such ratifications probably stems from a more 
general judicial aversion to interpreting appropriation acts as changing 
substantive law. Thus, the court observed in Thomas v. Network Solutions, 
Inc., 2 F. Supp. 2d 22, 32 at n.12 (D.D.C. 1998), aff’d, 176 F.3d 500 (D.C. Cir. 
1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1115 (2000) (citations omitted):

The Legal Framework 

“ [I]t is well recognized that Congress does not normally 
perform legislative functions—such as ratification— 
through appropriations bills… . This does not mean that 
Congress cannot effect a ratification through an 
appropriations bill, but it does mean that Congress must be 
especially clear about its intention to do so.” 

We turn now to some specific situations in which the doctrine of 
ratification by appropriation has been accepted or rejected. 

Presidential reorganizations have generated perhaps the largest number of 
cases. Generally, when the President has created a new agency or has 
transferred a function from one agency to another, and Congress 
subsequently appropriates funds to the new agency or to the old agency for 
the new function, the courts have found that the appropriation ratified the 
presidential action. Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking & Lumber Co., 331 U.S. 
111, 116 (1947); Isbrandtsen-Moller Co. v. United States, 300 U.S. 139, 147 
(1937). The transfer to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC) in 1978 of enforcement responsibility for the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act and the Equal Pay Act produced a minor flood of 
litigation. The cases were complicated by the existence of a legislative veto 
issue, with the ratification issue having to be faced only if the 
reorganization authority were found severable from the legislative veto. 
Although the courts were not uniform, a clear majority found that the 
subsequent appropriation of funds to the EEOC ratified the transfer. 
EEOC v. Dayton Power & Light Co., 605 F. Supp. 13 (S.D. Ohio 1984); 
EEOC v. Delaware Dept. of Health & Social Services, 595 F. Supp. 568 (D. 
Del. 1984); EEOC v. New York, 590 F. Supp. 37 (N.D. N.Y. 1984); EEOC v. 
Radio Montgomery, Inc., 588 F. Supp. 567 (W.D. Va. 1984); EEOC v. City of 
Memphis, 581 F. Supp. 179 (W.D. Tenn. 1983); Muller Optical Co. v. EEOC, 
574 F. Supp. 946 (W.D. Tenn. 1983), aff’d on other grounds, 743 F.2d 380

Co., 570 F. Supp. 1224 (S.D. Miss. 1983), appeal dismissed, 467 U.S. 1232 
(1984). Congress resolved any doubt by enacting legislation in 1984 to 
expressly ratify all prior reorganization plans implemented pursuant to any 
reorganization statute.58

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Another group of cases that has refused to find ratification by 
appropriation concern proposed construction projects funded under lump-
sum appropriations where the effect would be either to expand the scope 
of a prior congressional authorization or to supply an authorization 
required by statute but not obtained. Libby Rod & Gun Club v. Poteat, 
594 F.2d 742 (9th Cir. 1979); National Wildlife Federation v. Andrus, 440 F. 
Supp. 1245 (D.D.C. 1977); Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co v. 
Callaway, 382 F. Supp. 610 (D.D.C. 1974); B-223725, June 9, 1987. 

A few additional cases in which ratification by appropriation was found are 
summarized below: 

• The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) had asserted the authority to 
construct power plants. TVA’s position was based on an interpretation 
of its enabling legislation that the court found consistent with the 
purpose of the legislation although the legislation itself was ambiguous. 
The appropriation of funds to TVA for power plant construction ratified 
TVA’s position. Young v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 606 F.2d 143 
(6th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 942 (1980). 

• The authority of the Postmaster General to conduct a mail 
transportation experiment was ratified by the appropriation of funds to 
the former Post Office Department under circumstances showing that 
Congress was fully aware of the experiment. The court noted that 
existing statutory authority was broad enough to encompass the 
experiment and that nothing prohibited it. Atchison, Topeka & Santa 
Fe Railway Co. v. Summerfield, 229 F.2d 777 (D.C. Cir. 1955), cert. 
denied, 351 U.S. 926 (1956). 

• The authority of the Department of Justice to retain private counsel to 
defend federal officials in limited circumstances, while not explicitly 
provided by statute, is regarded as ratified by the specific appropriation 
of funds for that purpose. 2 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 66 (1978). 

• Another Office of Legal Counsel opinion described instances in which 
Congress has ratified by appropriation the use of United States combat 
forces. The opinion concludes on this point: 

“In sum, basic principles of constitutional law—and, in 
particular, the fact that Congress may express approval 
through the appropriations process—and historical practice 
in the war powers area, as well as the bulk of the case law 

Page 2-64 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

and a substantial body of scholarly opinion, support the 
conclusion that Congress can authorize hostilities through 
its use of the appropriations power. Although it might be the 
case that general funding statutes do not necessarily 
constitute congressional approval for conducting hostilities, 
this objection loses its force when the appropriations 
measure is directly and conspicuously focused on specific 
military action.”59 

Note that in all of the cases in which ratification by appropriation was 
approved, the agency had at least an arguable legal basis for its action. See 
also Airis, 391 F.2d at 481 n.20; B-232482, June 4, 1990. The doctrine has 
not been used to excuse violations of law. Also, when an agency action is 
constitutionally suspect, the courts will require that congressional action 
be particularly explicit. Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. at 506–07; Martin 
Industries, 581 F. Supp. at 1033–37; Muller Optical Co., 574 F. Supp. at 954. 

In B-285725, Sept. 29, 2000, the Comptroller General condensed the 
foregoing principles into this test for ratification by appropriation: 

“To conclude that Congress through the appropriations 
process has ratified agency action, three factors generally 
must be present. First, the agency takes the action pursuant 
to at least arguable authority; second, the Congress has 
specific knowledge of the facts; and third, the appropriation 
of funds clearly bestows the claimed authority.” 

The opinion in B-285725 rejected an assertion by the District of Columbia 
government that Congress had ratified certain funding practices that 
otherwise violated the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341. Specifically, it 
held that information contained in the District’s budget justifications and 
said to constitute notice to Congress (1) lacked clarity and precision, 

(2) did not create any awareness that could be imputed to Congress as a 
whole, and (3) was not reflected in any legislative language that could 
reasonably be viewed as authorizing the practices in question.

The Legal Framework 

h. Repeal by Implication We have on several occasions referred to the rule against repeal by 
implication. The leading case in the appropriations context is Tennessee 
Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978) (hereafter TVA v. Hill). In that 
case, Congress had authorized construction of the Tellico Dam and 
Reservoir Project on the Little Tennessee River, and had appropriated 
initial funds for that purpose. Subsequently, Congress passed the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531 et seq. Under the 
provisions of that Act, the Secretary of the Interior declared the “snail 
darter,” a 3-inch fish, to be an endangered species. It was eventually 
determined that the Little Tennessee River was the snail darter’s critical 
habitat and that completion of the dam would result in extinction of the 
species. Consequently, environmental groups and others brought an action 
to halt further construction of the Tellico Project. In its decision, the 
Supreme Court held in favor of the plaintiffs, notwithstanding the fact that 
construction was well under way and that, even after the Secretary of the 
Interior’s actions regarding the snail darter, Congress had continued to 
make yearly appropriations for the completion of the dam project. 
The appropriation involved was a lump-sum appropriation that included 
funds for the Tellico Dam but made no specific reference to it. However, 
passages in the reports of the appropriations committees indicated that 
those committees intended the funds to be available notwithstanding the 
Endangered Species Act. The Court held that this was not enough. The 
doctrine against repeal by implication, the Court said, applies with even 
greater force when the claimed repeal rests solely on an appropriation act: 

“When voting on appropriations measures, legislators are 
entitled to operate under the assumption that the funds will 
be devoted to purposes which are lawful and not for any 
purpose forbidden.” 

Id. at 190. Noting that “[e]xpressions of committees dealing with requests 
for appropriations cannot be equated with statutes enacted by Congress” 
(id. at 191), the Court held that the unspecified inclusion of the Tellico Dam 
funds in a lump-sum appropriation was not sufficient to constitute a repeal 
by implication of the Endangered Species Act insofar as it related to that 
project.60 In other words, the doctrine of ratification by appropriation

we discussed in the preceding section does not apply, at least when the 
appropriation is an otherwise unspecified lump sum, where the effect 
would be to change an existing statutory requirement. 

TVA v. Hill is important because it is a clear and forceful statement from 
the Supreme Court. In terms of the legal principle involved, however, the 
Court was breaking little new ground. A body of case law from the lower 
courts had already laid the legal foundation. One group of cases, for 
example, had established the proposition that the appropriation of funds 
does not excuse noncompliance with the National Environmental Policy 
Act. Environmental Defense Fund v. Froehlke, 473 F.2d 346 (8th Cir. 1972); 
Committee for Nuclear Responsibility v. Seaborg, 463 F.2d 783 (D.C. Cir. 
1971); National Audubon Society v. Andrus, 442 F. Supp. 42 (D.D.C. 1977); 
Environmental Defense Fund v. Corps of Engineers, 325 F. Supp. 749 

(E.D. Ark. 1971). Cases supporting the general proposition of TVA v. Hill in 
other contexts were also not uncommon. See Associated Electric 
Cooperative, Inc. v. Morton, 507 F.2d 1167 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 
830 (1974); District of Columbia Federation of Civic Ass’ns v. Airis, 
391 F.2d 478 (D.C. Cir. 1968); Maiatico v. United States, 302 F.2d 880 (D.C. 
Cir. 1962). 
Some subsequent cases applying the concept of TVA v. Hill (although not 
all citing that case) include Donovan v. Carolina Stalite Co., 734 F.2d 1547 

(D.C. Cir. 1984); 64 Comp. Gen. 282 (1985); B-208593.6, Dec. 22, 1988; 
B-213771, July 10, 1984; B-204874, July 28, 1982; and B-193307, Feb. 6, 1979. 
In B-204874, for example, the Comptroller General advised that the 
otherwise unrestricted appropriation of coal trespass receipts to the 
Bureau of Land Management did not implicitly amend or repeal the 
provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act prescribing the 
use of such funds. 
In reading the cases, one will encounter the occasional sweeping statement 
such as “appropriations acts cannot change existing law,” National 
Audubon Society v. Andrus, 442 F. Supp. at 45. Such statements can be 
misleading, and should be read in the context of the facts of the particular 
case. It is clear from TVA v. Hill, together with its ancestors and its 
progeny, that Congress cannot legislate by legislative history. It seems 
equally clear that the appropriation of funds, without more, is not sufficient 
to overcome a statutory requirement. If, however, instead of an 
unrestricted lump sum, the appropriation in TVA v. Hill had provided a 
specific line-item appropriation for the Tellico project, together with the 
words “notwithstanding the provisions of the Endangered Species Act,” it is 

Page 2-67 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

difficult to see how a court could fail to give effect to the express mandate 
of the appropriation. 

Thus, the message is not that Congress cannot legislate in an appropriation 
act. It can, and we have previously cited a body of case law to that effect. 
The real message is that, if Congress wants to use an appropriation act as 
the vehicle for suspending, modifying, or repealing a provision of existing 
law, it must do so advisedly, speaking directly and explicitly to the issue. 

The Supreme Court conveyed this message succinctly in Robertson v. 
Seattle Audubon Society, 503 U.S. 429, 440 (1992) (citations omitted), 
holding that— 

“[A]lthough repeals by implication are especially disfavored 
in the appropriations context, Congress nonetheless may 
amend substantive law in an appropriations statute, as long 
as it does so clearly.” 

In Robertson, the Court found an implied repeal by appropriation act to be 
clear and explicit. 

Subsequent judicial decisions, of course, apply the Robertson approach to 
alleged implied repeals by appropriation. Since the issue is one of basic 
statutory construction, the courts naturally reach different results 
depending on the particular statutory language involved. For example, 
Pontarelli v. United States Department of the Treasury, 285 F.3d 216 
(3rd Cir. 2002), held that an annual appropriation restriction enacted for 
many years stating that “[n]one of the funds appropriated herein shall be 
available to investigate or act upon applications for relief from Federal 
firearms disabilities under 18 U.S.C. § 925(c)” clearly superseded the 
provision in Title 18 of the United States Code. Pontarelli cites many other 
decisions that reached the same conclusion with respect to this particular 
appropriation language. Another case finding a clear implied repeal by 
appropriation is Bald Eagle Ridge Protection Ass’n, Inc. v. Mallory, 119 F. 
Supp. 2d 473 (M.D. Pa. 2000), aff’d, 275 F.3d 33 (3rd Cir. 2001). 

Examples of cases that reconciled the appropriation and other statutory 
provisions, and thus found no implied repeal include: Strawser v. Atkins, 
290 F.3d 720 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1045 (2002); Auburn  
Housing Authority v. Martinez, 277 F.3d 138 (2nd Cir. 2002); Firebaugh 
Canal Co. v. United States, 203 F.3d 568 (9th Cir. 2000); Ramey v. 

Page 2-68 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Stevedoring Services of America, 134 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 1998); 
Environmental Defense Center v. Babbitt, 73 F.3d 867 (9th Cir. 1995). 

Still other cases hold that appropriation restrictions alleged to be 
permanent in superseding other laws were effective only for a fiscal year. 
E.g., Auburn Housing Authority, supra; Building & Construction Trades 
Department, AFL-CIO v. Martin, 961 F.2d 269, 273 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 
506 U.S. 915 (1992). In a related context, the court in Williams v. United 
States, 240 F.3d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 911 (2002), 
disagreed with a series of Comptroller General decisions and held that 
appropriation language enacted in 1982 that required specific 
congressional authorization for pay raises for judges was not permanent 
legislation but expired at the end of fiscal year 1982. 

i. Lack of Authorization As we have previously noted, there is no general statutory requirement that 
appropriations be preceded by specific authorizations, although they are 
required in some instances. Where authorizations are not required by law, 
Congress may, subject to a possible point of order, appropriate funds for a 
program or object that has not been previously authorized or which 
exceeds the scope of a prior authorization, in which event the enacted 
appropriation, in effect, carries its own authorization and is available to the 
agency for obligation and expenditure. E.g., 67 Comp. Gen. 401 (1988); 
B-219727, July 30, 1985; B-173832, Aug. 1, 1975. 
It has also been held that, as a general proposition, the appropriation of 
funds for a program whose funding authorization has expired, or is due to 
expire during the period of availability of the appropriation, provides 
sufficient legal basis to continue the program during that period of 
availability, absent indication of contrary congressional intent. 65 Comp. 
Gen. 524 (1986); 65 Comp. Gen. 318, 320–21 (1986); 55 Comp. Gen. 289 
(1975); B-131935, Mar. 17, 1986; B-137063, Mar. 21, 1966. The result in these 
cases follows in part from the fact that the total absence of appropriations 
authorization legislation would not have precluded the making of valid 
appropriations for the programs. E.g., B-202992, May 15, 1981. In addition, 
as noted, the result is premised on the conclusion, derived either from 

Page 2-69 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

legislative history or at least the absence of legislative history to the 
contrary, that Congress did not intend for the programs to terminate.61 

There are limits on how far this principle can be taken, depending on the 
particular circumstances. One illustration is B-207186, Feb. 10, 1989. A 1988 
continuing resolution provided funds for the Solar Bank, to remain 
available until September 30, 1989. Legislation enacted on the same day 
provided for the Bank to terminate on March 15, 1988. Based in part on 
legislative history indicating the intent to terminate the Bank on the 
specified sunset date, GAO distinguished prior decisions in which 
appropriations were found to authorize program continuation and 
concluded that the appropriation did not authorize continuation of the 
Solar Bank beyond March 15, 1988. 

The Comptroller General’s decision in 71 Comp. Gen. 378 (1992) provides 
another variant. Section 8 of the Civil Rights Commission’s authorizing act 
stated that “the provisions of this Act shall terminate on September 30, 
1991.” While Congress was actively working on reauthorization legislation 
for the Commission toward the end of fiscal year 1991, this legislation was 
not enacted until after September 30, 1991. Nevertheless, Congress had 
enacted a continuing resolution for the early part of fiscal year 1992 that 
specifically included funding for the Commission. The Comptroller General 
first observed that the line of cases discussed above permitting programs to 
continue after expiration of their authorization did not apply. Unlike the 
mere authorization lapse in those cases, the statute here provided that the 
Commission would “terminate” on September 30. The Comptroller General 
also distinguished the Solar Bank case, discussed above, since the provision 
for termination of the Commission was enacted long before the continuing 
resolution that provided for the Commission’s funding after September 30. 
In the final analysis, the decision held that the funding provision for the 
Commission was irreconcilable with the section 8 termination provision 
and effectively suspended the operation of section 8. In reaching this 
conclusion, the decision noted the clear intent of Congress that the 

61 Congressional practice also firmly supports this conclusion since Congress appropriates 
huge sums each year to fund programs with expired authorizations. According to the 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO), appropriations for which specific authorizations had 
expired have ranged between about $90 billion and about $120 billion in recent fiscal years. 

Unauthorized Appropriations and Senate Resolution 173: Hearing Before the Senate 
Committee on Rules and Administration, 108th Cong. 3 (July 9, 2003) (statement by CBO 
Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin).

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Commission continue to operate without interruption after September 30, 
1991. 

A device Congress has used on occasion to avoid this type of problem is an 
“automatic extension” provision under which funding authorization is 
automatically extended for a specified time period if Congress has not 
enacted new authorizing legislation before it expires. An example is 
discussed in B-214456, May 14, 1984. 

Questions concerning the effect of appropriations on expired or about-toexpire 
authorizations have tended to arise more frequently in the context of 
continuing resolutions. The topic is discussed further, including several of 
the cases cited above, in Chapter 8. 

Where specific authorization is statutorily required, the case may become 
more difficult. In Libby Rod & Gun Club v. Poteat, 594 F.2d 742 (9th Cir. 
1979), the court held that a lump-sum appropriation available for dam 
construction was not, by itself, sufficient to authorize a construction 
project for which specific authorization had not been obtained as required 
by 33 U.S.C. § 401. The court suggested that TVA v. Hill and similar cases 
do not “mandate the conclusion that courts can never construe 
appropriations as congressional authorization,” although it was not 
necessary to further address that issue in view of the specific requirement 
in that case. Poteat, 594 F.2d at 745–46. The result would presumably have 
been different if Congress had made a specific appropriation 
“notwithstanding the provisions of 33 U.S.C. § 401.” It should be apparent 
that the doctrines of repeal by implication and ratification by appropriation 
are relevant in analyzing issues of this type.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

1. The Goal of Statutory 
Construction62 
As we have noted elsewhere, an appropriation can be made only by means 
of a statute. In addition to providing funds, the typical appropriation act 
includes a variety of general provisions. Anyone who works with 
appropriations matters will also have frequent need to consult authorizing 
and program legislation. It should thus be apparent that the interpretation 
of statutes is of critical importance to appropriations law.63 

The objective of this section is to provide a brief overview, designed 
primarily for those who do not work extensively with legislative materials. 
The cases we cite are but a sampling, selected for illustrative purposes or 
for a particularly good judicial statement of a point. The literature in the 
area is voluminous, and readers who need more than we can provide are 
encouraged to consult one of the established treatises such as Sutherland’s 
Statutes and Statutory Construction (hereafter “Sutherland”).64 

The goal of statutory construction is simply stated: to determine and give 
effect to the intent of the enacting legislature. Philbrook v. Glodgett, 
421 U.S. 707, 713 (1975); United States v. American Trucking Ass’ns, Inc., 
310 U.S. 534, 542 (1940); 55 Comp. Gen. 307, 317 (1975); 38 Comp. Gen. 229 
(1958). While the goal may be simple, the means of achieving it are complex 
and often controversial. The primary vehicle for determining legislative 
intent is the language of the statute itself. There is an established body of 
principles, known as “canons” of construction, that are designed to aid in 
arriving at the best interpretation of statutory language. The statute’s 
legislative history also is usually consulted to aid in the effort. 

At this point, it is important to recognize that the concept of “legislative 
intent” is in many cases a fiction. Where not clear from the statutory 
language itself, it is often impossible to ascribe an intent to Congress as a 

62 There is a technical distinction between “interpretation” (determining the meaning of 
words) and “construction” (application of words to facts). 2A Sutherland, Statutes and 
Statutory Construction § 45.04 (6th ed. 2000). The distinction, as Sutherland points out, has 
little practical value. We use the terms interchangeably, as does Sutherland. 

63 “But if Congress has all the money of the United States under its control, it also has the 
whole English language to give it away with… .” 9 Op. Att’y Gen. 57, 59 (1857). 

64 We will refer to the 6th edition, edited by Professor Norman J. Singer and published in 
2000.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

whole.65 As we will note later, a committee report represents the views of 
that committee. Statements by an individual legislator represent the views 
of that individual. Either may, but do not necessarily or inherently, reflect a 
broader congressional perception. 

Even interpretive aids that rely on the statutory language itself do not 
provide hard and fast rules that can pinpoint congressional intent with 
scientific precision. One problem is that, more often than not, a statute has 
no obvious meaning that precisely answers a particular issue in dispute 
before the courts, the Comptroller General, or another decision maker. If 
the answers were that obvious, most of the cases discussed in this section 
would never have arisen. 

The reality is that there probably is (and was) no actual “congressional 
intent” with respect to most specific issues that find their way to the courts, 
GAO, or other forums. In all likelihood, Congress did not affirmatively 
consider these specific issues for purposes of forming an intent about 
them. Necessarily, Congress writes laws in fairly general terms that convey 
broad concepts, principles, and policies. It leaves administering agencies 
and courts to fill in the gaps. Indeed, Congress sometimes deliberately 
leaves issues ambiguous because it lacks a sufficient consensus to resolve 
them in the law. 

To point out the challenges in statutory interpretation, however, is by no 
means to denigrate the process. Applying the complex maze of interpretive 
aids, imperfect as they may be, serves the essential purpose of providing a 
common basis for problem solving and determining what the law is. 

This in turn is important for two reasons. First, everyone has surely heard 
the familiar statement that our government is a government of laws and not 
of men.66 This means that you have a right to have your conduct governed 
and judged in accordance with identifiable principles and standards, not by 
the whim of the decision maker. The law should be reasonably predictable. 
A lawyer’s advice that a proposed action is or is not permissible amounts to 

65 E.g., United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass’n, 166 U.S. 290, 318 (1897): “Looking 
simply at the history of the bill from the time it was introduced in the Senate until it was 
finally passed, it would be impossible to say what were the views of a majority of the 
members of each house in relation to the meaning of the act.” 

66 “The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of 
laws, and not of men.” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 (1803). 

Page 2-73 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

a reasoned and informed judgment as to what a court is likely to do if the 
action is challenged. While this can never be an absolute guarantee, it once 
again must be based on identifiable principles and standards. Conceding its 
weaknesses, the law of statutory construction represents an organized 
approach for doing this. 

Second, predictability is important in the enactment of statutes as well. 
Congress legislates against the background of the rules and principles that 
make up the law of statutory construction, and must be able to anticipate 
how the courts will apply them in interpreting the statutes it enacts.67 

2. The “Plain Meaning” 
Rule 
“The Court’s task is to construe not English but 
congressional English.” 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Acker, 361 U.S. 87, 95 (1959) 
(Frankfurter, J., dissenting). 
a. In General By far the most important rule of statutory construction is this: You start 
with the language of the statute. Countless judicial decisions reiterate this 
rule. E.g., Hartford Underwriters Insurance Co. v. Union Planters Bank, 
N.A., 530 U.S. 1 (2000); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997); 
Connecticut National Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249 (1992); Mallard v. 
United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, 490 U.S. 
296, 300 (1989). The primary vehicle for Congress to express its intent is the 
words it enacts into law. As stated in an early Supreme Court decision: 
“The law as it passed is the will of the majority of both 
houses, and the only mode in which that will is spoken is in 
the act itself; and we must gather their intention from the 
language there used … .” 

67 See McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 496 (1991) (“It is presumable 
that Congress legislates with knowledge of our basic rules of statutory construction.”); 
Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545, 556 (1989) (“What is of paramount importance is that 
Congress be able to legislate against a background of clear interpretive rules, so that it may 
know the effect of the language it adopts.”).

The Legal Framework 

Aldridge v. Williams, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 9, 24 (1845). A somewhat better 
known statement is from United States v. American Trucking Ass’ns, 
310 U.S. 534, 543 (1940): 

“There is, of course, no more persuasive evidence of the 
purpose of a statute than the words by which the legislature 
undertook to give expression to its wishes.” 

If the meaning is clear from the language of the statute, there is no need to 
resort to legislative history or any other extraneous source. As the Supreme 
Court observed in Connecticut National Bank v. Germain: 

“[I]n interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to 
one, cardinal canon before all others. We have stated time 
and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in 
a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says 
there… . When the words of a statute are unambiguous, 
then, this first canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is 
complete.” 

503 U.S. at 253–254 (citations and quotation marks omitted). See also 
Hartford Underwriters Insurance Co., supra; Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 
519 U.S. 337 (1997); Mallard, 490 U.S. 296; United States v. Ron Pair 
Enterprises, Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 241 (1989); Tennessee Valley Authority v. 
Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 184 n.29 (1978); 56 Comp. Gen. 943 (1977); B-287158, 
Oct. 10, 2002; B-290021, July 15, 2002; B-288173, June 13, 2002; B-288658, 
Nov. 30, 2001. 

This is the so-called “plain meaning” rule. If the meaning is “plain,” that’s 
the end of the inquiry and you apply that meaning. The unanimous opinion 
in Robinson v. Shell Oil Co. stated the rule as follows: 

“Our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine 
whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous 
meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case. 
Our inquiry must cease if the statutory language and ‘the 
statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.’… 

“The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is 
determined by reference to the language itself, the specific

The Legal Framework 

b. The Plain Meaning Rule 
versus Legislative History 
context in which that language is used, and the broader 
context of the statute as a whole.” 

519 U.S. at 340–341 (citations omitted). 

The plain meaning rule thus embodies the universal view that 
interpretations of a statute should be anchored in, and flow from, the 
statute’s text. Its application to a particular statutory provision turns on 
subjective judgments over which reasonable and intelligent people will 
differ. 

An example of this is Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223 (1993), in which 
the Justices agreed that the case should be resolved on the basis of the 
statute’s plain meaning, but reached sharply divergent conclusions as to 
what that plain meaning was. In Smith, the defendant had traded his gun 
for illegal drugs. He was convicted under a statute that provided enhanced 
penalties for the “use” of a firearm “during and in relation to … [a] drug 
trafficking crime.” The majority affirmed his conviction, reasoning that 
exchanging a firearm for drugs constituted a “use” of the firearm within the 
plain meaning of the statute—that is, use in the sense of employ. Three 
Justices dissented, contending vehemently that the plain meaning of the 
statute covered only the use of a firearm for its intended purpose as a 
weapon.68 

The extent to which sources outside the statute itself, particularly 
legislative history, should be consulted to help shed light on the statutory 
scheme has been the subject of much controversy in recent decades. One 
school of thought, most closely identified with Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia, holds that resort to legislative history is never appropriate. 
This approach is sometimes viewed as a variant of the plain meaning rule.69 
A more widely expressed statement of the plain meaning rule is that 
legislative history can be consulted but only if it has first been determined 
that the statutory language is “ambiguous”—that is, that there is no plain 
meaning. 

68 The federal circuits had likewise split on the plain meaning of this statute prior to the 
Smith decision. See Smith, 508 U.S. at 227. 

69 See Eric S. Lasky, Perplexing Problems with Plain Meaning, 27 Hofstra L. Rev. 891 (1999); 

R. Randall Kelso, Statutory Interpretation Doctrine on the Modern Supreme Court and 
Four Doctrinal Approaches to Judicial Decision-Making, 25 Pepp. L. Rev. 37 (1997). 
Professor Kelso describes Justice Scalia’s approach as “new textualism.”

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

As a practical matter, however, courts generally examine the legislative 
history as an integral part of statutory construction. Thus, Sutherland 
observes: 

“[I]t has been said, usually a court looks into the legislative 
history to clear up some statutory ambiguity… but such 
ambiguity is not the sine qua non for judicial inquiry into 
legislative history … the plain meaning rule is not to be used 
to thwart or distort the intent of Congress by excluding from 
consideration enlightening material from the legislative 
files… .” 

2A Sutherland, § 48:01, at 412–413 (citations and quotation marks omitted). 

In other words, like all “rules” of statutory construction, the plain meaning 
rule is “rather an axiom of experience than a rule of law, and does not 
preclude consideration of persuasive evidence if it exists.” Boston Sand & 
Gravel Co. v. United States, 278 U.S. 41, 48 (1928) (Holmes, J.), quoted in 
Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 266 (1981). In another often-quoted statement, 
the Supreme Court said:

 “When aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used 
in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no ‘rule of 
law’ which forbids its use, however clear the words may 
appear on ‘superficial examination.’” 

United States v. American Trucking Ass’ns, Inc., 310 U.S. 534, 543–44 
(1940), as quoted in Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group, 
Inc., 426 U.S. 1, 10 (1976) (footnotes omitted). 

Indeed, the Supreme Court, like other courts, routinely consults the 
legislative history even if the statutory language seems unambiguous.70 One 
example is Conroy v. Aniskoff, 507 U.S. 511 (1993), in which the Court 
found the relevant statute to be “unambiguous, unequivocal, and 
unlimited.” Id. at 514. Nevertheless, Justice Stevens, writing for the Court, 

70 “[S]hortly before Justice Scalia’s appointment, the Justices consulted the legislative 
records in almost every case involving the interpretation of a statute. Today, despite years of 
Justice Scalia’s advocation for the plain meaning rule, ‘legislative history is [still] used by at 
least one Justice in virtually every decision of the Supreme Court in which the meaning of a 
federal statute is at issue.’” Lasky, supra, at 896 (footnotes omitted).

The Legal Framework 

examined the legislative history in detail to confirm that its literal reading 
of the statute was not absurd, illogical, or contrary to congressional intent. 
Justice Scalia, however, wrote a spirited concurring opinion that described 
the inquiry into the legislative history as “a waste of research time and ink” 
as well as a “disruptive lesson in the law.” Id. at 519.

Consequences” Guiseppi v. Walling, 144 F.2d 608, 624 (2nd Cir. 1944) (Learned Hand, J.). 
Even the strictest adherence to the plain meaning rule does not justify 
application of the literal terms of a statute in all cases. There are two well-
established exceptions. The first is that statutory language will not be 
enforced literally when that language is the product of an obvious drafting 
error. In such cases, courts (and other decision makers) will, in effect, 
rewrite the statute to correct the error and conform the statute to the 
obvious intent. 
The second exception is the frequently cited canon of construction that 
statutory language will not be interpreted literally if doing so would 
produce an “absurd consequence” or “absurd result,” that is, one that the 
legislature, presumably, could not have intended. 
a. Errors in Statutes (1) Drafting errors 
A statute may occasionally contain what is clearly a technical or 
typographical error which, if read literally, could alter the meaning of the 
statute or render execution effectively impossible. In such a case, if the 
legislative intent is clear, the intent will be given effect over the erroneous 
language. One recent example is Chickasaw Nation v. United States, 
534 U.S. 84 (2001). The decision turned on the effect of a parenthetical 
reference to the Tax Code that had been included in the Indian Gaming 
Regulatory Act. After examining the structure and language of the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act as a whole, as well as its legislative history, the 
Court concluded that the parenthetical reference was “simply a drafting 
mistake”—specifically, the failure to delete a cross-reference from an 
earlier version of the bill—and declined to give it any effect. Chickasaw 
Nation, 534 U.S. at 91.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

In a number of other cases, courts have followed the same approach by 
correcting obvious printing or typographical errors. See United States 
National Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insurance Agents of America, 
Inc., 508 U.S. 439 (1993); Ronson Patents Corp. v. Sparklets Devices, Inc., 
102 F. Supp. 123 (E.D. Mo. 1951); Fleming v. Salem Box Co., 38 F. Supp. 997 

(D. Ore. 1940); Neely v. State of Arkansas, 877 S.W.2d 589 (Ark.1994); 
Pressman v. State Tax Commission, 102 A.2d 821 (Md. 1954); Johnson v. 
United States Gypsum Co., 229 S.W.2d 671 (Ark. 1950); Baca v. Board of 
Commissioners of Bernalillo County, 62 P. 979 (N.M. 1900).71 
Comptroller General decisions have likewise repaired obvious drafting 
errors. In one situation, a supplemental appropriation act provided funds to 
pay certain claims and judgments as set forth in Senate Document 94-163. 
Examination of the documents made it clear that the reference should have 
been to Senate Document 94-164, as Senate Document 94-163 concerned a 
wholly unrelated subject. The manifest congressional intent was held 
controlling, and the appropriation was available to pay the items specified 
in Senate Document 94-164. B-158642-O.M., June 8, 1976. The same 
principle had been applied in a very early decision in which an 1894 
appropriation provided funds for certain payments in connection with an 
election held on “November fifth,” 1890. The election had in fact been held 
on November 4. Recognizing the “evident intention of Congress,” the 
decision held that the appropriation was available to make the specified 
payments. 1 Comp. Dec. 1 (1894). See also 11 Comp. Dec. 719 (1905); 
8 Comp. Dec. 205 (1901); 1 Comp. Dec. 316 (1895). 

Other decisions follow the same approach. See, e.g., 64 Comp. Gen. 221 
(1985) (erroneous use of the word “title” instead of “subchapter”); 
B-261579, Nov. 1, 1995 (mistaken cross-reference to the wrong section of 
another law); B-127507, Dec. 10, 1962 (printing error causing the statute to 
refer to “section 12” of a certain township for inclusion in a national forest, 
rather than “section 13”). 

71 United States National Bank of Oregon is a particularly interesting case, which 
concerned whether Congress had repealed a provision of law originally enacted in 1918. The 
issue turned on the effect, if any, to be given the placement of quotation marks in a later 
statute that allegedly constituted the repeal. Upon detailed examination of the overall 
statutory scheme and its evolution over many decades, the Court concluded that the 
quotation marks were misplaced as a result of a drafting error. Therefore, the 1918 provision 
had not been repealed.

The Legal Framework 

b. Avoiding “Absurd 
Consequences” 
The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel applied Comptroller 
General decisions in an opinion dated May 21, 1996, that addressed an 
obvious problem with the application of an appropriations act.72 The act 
required the United States Information Agency to move an office to south 
Florida “not later than April 1, 1996,” and made funds available for that 
purpose. However, the act was not signed into law until April 26, 1996. 
Recognizing that the act could not be implemented as written, the opinion 
concluded that the funds remained available to finance the move after 
April 1. 

(2) Error in amount appropriated 
A 1979 decision illustrates one situation in which the above rule will not 
apply. A 1979 appropriation act contained an appropriation of $36 million 
for the Inspector General of the Department of Health, Education, and 
Welfare. The bills as passed by both Houses and the various committee 
reports specified an appropriation of only $35 million. While it seemed 
apparent that the $36 million was the result of a typographical error, it was 
held that the language of the enrolled act signed by the President must 
control and that the full $36 million had been appropriated. The 
Comptroller General did, however, inform the Appropriations Committees. 
58 Comp. Gen. 358 (1979). See also 2 Comp. Dec. 629 (1896); 1 Bowler, First 
Comp. Dec. 114 (1894). 

However, if the amount appropriated is a total derived from adding up 
specific sums enumerated in the appropriation act, then the amount 
appropriated will be the amount obtained by the correct addition, 
notwithstanding the specification of an erroneous total in the appropriation 
act. 31 U.S.C. § 1302; 2 Comp. Gen. 592 (1923). 

Departures from strict adherence to the statutory text go beyond cases 
involving drafting and typographical errors. In fact, it is more common to 
find cases in which the courts do not question that Congress meant to 
choose the words it did, but conclude that it could not have meant them to 
apply literally in a particular context. The generally accepted principle here 
is that the literal language of a statute will not be followed if it would

The Legal Framework 

produce a result demonstrably inconsistent with clearly expressed 
congressional intent. 

The case probably most frequently cited for this proposition is Church of 
the Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U.S. 457 (1892), which gives several 
interesting examples. One of those examples is United States v. Kirby, 
74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 482 (1868), in which the Court held that a statute making it 
a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully obstruct or retard a driver or 
carrier of the mails did not apply to a sheriff arresting a mail carrier who 
had been indicted for murder. Another is an old English ruling that a statute 
making it a felony to break out of jail did not apply to a prisoner who broke 
out because the jail was on fire. Holy Trinity, 143 U.S. at 460–61. An 
example from early administrative decisions might be 24 Comp. Dec. 775 
(1918), holding that an appropriation for “messenger boys” was available to 
hire “messenger girls.”73 

In cases decided after Holy Trinity, the Court has emphasized that 
departures from the plain meaning rule are justified only in “rare and 
exceptional circumstances,” such as the illustrations used in Holy Trinity. 
Crooks v. Harrelson, 282 U.S. 55, 60 (1930). See also United States v. Ron 
Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 242 (1989); Griffin v. Oceanic 
Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 571 (1982); Tennessee Valley Authority v. 
Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 187 n.33 (1978) (citing Crooks v. Harrelson with 
approval; hereafter TVA v. Hill). 

This exception to the plain meaning rule is also sometimes phrased in 
terms of avoiding absurd consequences. E.g., United States v. Ryan, 
284 U.S. 167, 175 (1931). As the dissenting opinion in TVA v. Hill points out 
(437 U.S. at 204 n.14), there is a bit of confusion in this respect in that 
Crooks—again, cited with approval by the majority in TVA v. Hill— 
explicitly states that avoiding absurd consequences is not enough, although 
the Court has used the absurd consequence formulation in post-Crooks 
cases such as Ryan. In any event, as a comparison of the majority and 
dissenting opinions in TVA v. Hill will demonstrate, the absurd 
consequences test is not always easy to apply in that what strikes one 
person as absurd may be good law to another. 

73 The decision had nothing to do with equality of the sexes; the “boys” were all off fighting 
World War I.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

The case of United States v. Singleton, 144 F.3d 1343 (10th Cir. 1998), 
vacated on reh’g en banc, 165 F.3d 1297, cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1024 (1999), 
provides another illustration of this point. Ms. Singleton was convicted of 
various crimes following testimony against her by a witness who had 
received a plea bargain in exchange for his testimony. She maintained that 
her conviction was tainted because the plea bargain constituted a violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2), which provides in part: 

“Whoever … directly or indirectly … promises anything of 
value to any person, … because of the testimony under oath 
or affirmation given or to be given by such person as a 
witness upon trial … before any court … shall be fined 
under this title or imprisoned for not more than two years, 
or both.” 

A three judge panel of the Tenth Circuit agreed and reversed her 
conviction. They held that the word “whoever” by its plain terms applied to 
the federal prosecutor and, just as plainly, the plea bargain promised 
something of value because of testimony to be given as a witness upon 
trial. 

The full Tenth Circuit vacated the panel’s ruling and reinstated the 
conviction. The majority held that the panel’s construction of the statute 
was “patently absurd” and contradicted long-standing prosecutorial 
practice. 165 F.3d at 1300. The three original panel members remained 
unconvinced and dissented. Far from being “absurd,” they viewed their 
construction as a “straight-forward interpretation” of the statute that 
honored important constitutional values. One such value, they said, was 
“the proper role of the judiciary as the law-interpreting, rather than 
lawmaking, branch of the federal government.” Id. at 1309. 

While the absurd consequences rule must be invoked with care, it does 
have useful applications. The Comptroller General invoked this rule in 
holding that an appropriation act proviso requiring competition in the 
award of certain grants did not apply to community development block 
grants, which were allocated by a statutory formula. B-285794, Dec. 5, 2000 
(“Without an affirmative expression of such intent, we are unwilling to read 
the language of the questioned proviso in a way that would clearly produce 
unreasonable and impractical consequences.”). See also B-260759, May 2, 
1995 (rejecting a literal reading of a statutory provision that would defeat 
its purpose and produce anomalous results).

The Legal Framework 

4. Statutory Aids to 
Construction 
a. Definitions, Effective Dates, 
and Severability Clauses 
b. The Dictionary Act 
The remainder of this section discusses various sources to assist in 
determining the meaning of statutory language, plain or otherwise. We start 
with sources that are contained in the statute being construed or in other 
statutes that provide interpretive guidance for general application. The 
main advantage of these statutory aids is that, as laws themselves, they 
carry authoritative weight. Their main disadvantage is that, while useful on 
occasion, they have limited scope and address relatively few issues of 
interpretation. 

Statutes frequently contain their own set of definitions for terms that they 
use. Obviously, these definitions take precedence over other sources to the 
extent that they apply. 

A statute may also contain an effective date provision that sets forth a date 
(or dates) when it will become operative. These provisions are most 
frequently used when Congress intends to delay or phase in the 
effectiveness of a statute in whole or in part. The general rule, even absent 
an effective date provision, is that statutes take effect on the date of their 
enactment and apply prospectively. See, e.g., B-300866, May 30, 2003, and 
authorities cited. Therefore, effective date provisions are unnecessary if 
the normal rule is intended. (Later in this chapter we will discuss more 
complicated issues concerning the retroactive application of statutes.) 

Another provision sometimes included is a so-called “severability” clause. 
The purpose of this provision is to set forth congressional intent in the 
unhappy event that part of a statute is held to be unconstitutional. The 
clause states whether or not the remainder of the statute should be 
“severed” from the unconstitutional part and continue to be operative. 
Again, the general rule is that statutes will be considered severable absent a 
provision to the contrary or some other clear indication of congressional 
intent that the whole statute should fall if part of it is declared 
unconstitutional. Thus, the clause is unnecessary in the usual case. 
However, the absence of a severability clause will not create a presumption 
against severability. See, e.g., New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 186– 
187 (1992). 

Chapter 1 of Title 1 of the United States Code, §§ 1–8, commonly known as 
the “Dictionary Act,” provides certain rules of construction and definitions 
that apply generally to federal statutes. For example, section 1 provides in 
part: 

Page 2-83 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

“In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless 
the context indicates otherwise— 

****** 

“the words ‘person’ and ‘whoever’ include corporations, 
companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and 
joint stock companies, as well as individuals … .” 

Occasionally, the courts use the Dictionary Act to resolve questions of 
interpretation. E.g., United States v. Reid, 206 F. Supp. 2d 132 (D. Mass. 
2002) (an aircraft is not a “vehicle” for purposes of the USA PATRIOT Act); 
United States v. Belgarde, 148 F. Supp. 2d 1104 (D. Mont.), aff’d, 300 F.3d 
1177 (9th Cir. 2001) (a government agency, which the defendant was 
charged with burglarizing, is not a “person” for purposes of the Major 
Crimes Act). Courts also hold on occasion that the Dictionary Act does not 
apply. See Rowland v. California Men’s Colony, 506 U.S. 194 (1993) 
(context refutes application of the Title 1, United States Code, definition of 
“person”). 

c. Effect of Codification Congress regularly passes laws that “codify,” or enact into positive law, the 
contents of various titles of the United States Code. The effect of such 
codifications is to make that United States Code title the official evidence 
of the statutory language it contains.74 Codification acts typically delete 
obsolete provisions and make other technical and clarifying changes to the 
statutes they codify. Codification acts usually include language stating that 
they should not be construed as making substantive changes in the laws 
they replace. See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 97-258, § 4(a), 96 Stat. 877, 1067 (1982) 
(codifying Title 31 of the United States Code); 69 Comp. Gen. 691 (1990).75 
74 If United States National Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insurance Agents of America, 
Inc., 508 U.S. 439 (1993), discussed above, had involved codified provisions of law, the 
Court’s task would have been much easier. In fact, the case probably would never have 
arisen.

on the Web site of the Office of the Law Revision Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives:

The Legal Framework 

5. Canons of Statutory 
Construction 
a. Construe the Statute as a 
Whole 
As discussed previously, under the plain meaning rule—the overriding 
principle of statutory construction—the meaning of a statute must be 
anchored in its text. Over the years, courts have developed a host of 
conventions or guidelines for ascertaining the meaning of statutory text 
that are usually referred to as “canons” of construction. They range from 
broad principles that apply in virtually every case (such as the canon that 
statutes are construed as a whole) to narrow rules that apply in limited 
contexts. 

Like all other aids to construing statutes, the canons represent rules of 
thumb that are often useful but do not lend themselves to mechanistic 
application or slavish adherence. As the Supreme Court observed in 
Chickasaw Nation v. United States: 

“[C]anons are not mandatory rules. They are guides that 
need not be conclusive… . They are designed to help judges 
determine the Legislature’s intent as embodied in particular 
statutory language. And other circumstances evidencing 
congressional intent can overcome their force.” 

534 U.S. 84, 94 (2001) (citations and quotation marks omitted). 

One problem with the canons is that they often appear to contradict each 
other. In a frequently cited law review article, Professor Karl Llewellyn 
presented an analysis demonstrating that for many canons, there was an 
offsetting canon to the opposite effect.76 

Recognizing their limitations, this section will briefly describe some of the 
more frequently invoked canons. 

We start with one canon that virtually always applies and is rarely if ever 
contradicted. As Sutherland puts it: 

76 Karl N. Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons 
About How Statutes Are To Be Construed, 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395 (1950). The Supreme Court 
has recognized the contradictory nature of canons. E.g., Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 
532 U.S. 105, 115 (2001) (“Canons of construction need not be conclusive and are often 
countered, of course, by some maxim pointing in a different direction.”); Landgraf v. USI 
Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 263 (1994) (“It is not uncommon to find ‘apparent tension’ 
between different canons of statutory construction. As Professor Llewellyn famously 
illustrated, many of the traditional canons have equal opposites.”). 

Page 2-85 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

“A statute is passed as a whole and not in parts or sections 
and is animated by one general purpose and intent. 
Consequently, each part or section should be construed in 
connection with every other part or section so as to produce 
a harmonious whole.” 

2A Sutherland, § 46:05 at 154. 

Like all other courts, the Supreme Court follows this venerable canon. E.g., 
United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U.S. 200, 217 (2001) 
(“it is, of course, true that statutory construction ‘is a holistic endeavor’ and 
that the meaning of a provision is ‘clarified by the remainder of the 
statutory scheme’”); FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 
120 (2000); Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc., 513 U.S. 561, 569 (1995) (“the Act 
is to be interpreted as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme, one 
in which the operative words have a consistent meaning throughout”); 
Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994) (“[a]mbiguity is a creature not 
of definitional possibilities but of statutory context”). 

The Court elaborated on this canon in FDA v. Brown & Williamson 
Tobacco Corp., noting as well that the “holistic” approach may embrace 
more than a single statute: 

“[A] reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a 
particular statutory provision in isolation. The meaning—or 
ambiguity—of certain words or phrases may only become 
evident when placed in context… . It is a fundamental 
canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute 
must be read in their context and with a view to their place 
in the overall statutory scheme… . A court must therefore 
interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent 
regulatory scheme, … and fit, if possible, all parts into an 
harmonious whole… . Similarly, the meaning of one statute 
may be affected by other Acts, particularly where Congress 
has spoken subsequently and more specifically to the topic 
at hand.” 

529 U.S. at 132–133 (citations and quotation marks omitted). 

Comptroller General decisions, of course, also follow this canon: 

Page 2-86 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

“In interpreting provisions of a statute, we follow the settled 
rule of statutory construction that provisions with 
unambiguous language and specific directions may not be 
construed in any manner that will alter or extend their plain 
meaning… . However, if giving effect to the plain meaning of 
words in a statute leads to an absurd result which is clearly 
unintended and at variance with the policy of the legislation 
as a whole, the purpose of the statute rather than its literal 
words will be followed… . Consequently, statutory phrases 
and individual words cannot be viewed in isolation.” 

B-287158, Oct. 10, 2002 (citations omitted).77 

The following decisions illustrate applications of the “whole statute” rule: 

• B-290125.2, B-290125.3, Dec. 18, 2002 (redacted): Viewed in isolation, 
the phrase “notwithstanding any other provision of law” might be read 
as exempting a procurement from GAO’s bid protest jurisdiction under 
the Competition in Contracting Act. However, when the statute is read 
as a whole, as it must be, it does not exempt the procurement from the 
Act. 

• B-286661, Jan. 19, 2001: The Department of Energy’s interpretation of 
the statutory phrase “expenses of privatization” conflicts with the plain 
meaning of the statute as a whole as well as the legislative history. 

• B-261522, Sept. 29, 1995: The statute as a whole supports the Social 
Security Administration’s contention that it can use wage data collected 
by the Internal Revenue Service in certifying wages to the Secretary of 
the Treasury. 

b. Give Effect to All the Closely related to the “whole statute” canon is the canon that all words of a 
Language: No “Surplusage” statute should be given effect, if possible. The theory is that all of the words 
have meaning since Congress does not include unnecessary language, or 
“surplusage.” 

77 This decision held that, absent a specific appropriation, the Railroad Retirement Board 
had no obligation to repay certain funds that had been transferred to it from the Treasury. 
While the statute that transferred the funds characterized them as a “loan,” it also clearly 
provided that repayment was required only if an appropriation was enacted for that 
purpose. 

Page 2-87 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

The courts and the Comptroller General regularly invoke the “no 
surplusage” canon. Some examples follow: 

• Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 216 (1995): Words in a 
statute will not be treated as “utterly without effect” even if the 
consequence of giving them effect is to render the statute 
unconstitutional. 

• Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 140–141 (1994): The no 
surplusage canon applies with even greater weight when the arguably 
surplus words are part of the elements of a crime. In this case, the 
Court declined to treat as surplusage the word “willfully” in a statute 
that subjected to criminal penalties anyone willfully violating certain 
prohibitions. 

• 70 Comp. Gen. 351 (1991): Appropriation act language stating that none 
of the funds provided in this or any other act shall hereafter be used for 
certain purposes constitutes permanent legislation. The argument that 
the word hereafter should be construed only to mean that the provision 
took effect on the date of its enactment is unpersuasive. Since statutes 
generally take effect on their date of enactment, this construction 
would inappropriately render the word hereafter superfluous. 

• B-261522, Sept. 29, 1995: The Social Security Act requires the Social 
Security Administration to calculate employee wage data “in 
accordance with such reports” of wages filed by employers with the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The “such reports” language cannot be 
read as referring only to a particular report that the IRS no longer 
requires since this would render the language meaningless, contrary to 
established maxims of statutory construction. 

Although frequently invoked, the no surplusage canon is less absolute than 
the “whole statute” canon. One important caveat, previously discussed, is 
that words in a statute will be treated as surplus and disregarded if they 
were included in error. E.g., Chickasaw Nation v. United States, 534 U.S. 
84, 94 (2001) (emphasis in original): 

“The canon requiring a court to give effect to each word ‘if 
possible’ is sometimes offset by the canon that permits a 
court to reject words ‘as surplusage’ if ‘inadvertently 
inserted or if repugnant to the rest of the statute …’”

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

c. Apply the Common 
Meaning of Words 
d. Give a Common 
Construction to the Same or 
Similar Words 
When words used in a statute are not specifically defined, they are 
generally given their “plain” or ordinary meaning rather than some obscure 
usage. E.g., Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U.S. 179, 187 (1995); 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 476 (1994); 
Mallard v. United States, 490 U.S. 296, 301 (1989); 70 Comp. Gen. 705 
(1991); 38 Comp. Gen. 812 (1959); B-261193, Aug. 25, 1995. 

One commonsense way to determine the plain meaning of a word is to 
consult a dictionary. E.g., Mallard, 490 U.S. at 301; American Mining 
Congress v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1177, 1183–84 & n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Thus, the 
Comptroller General relied on the dictionary in B-251189, Apr. 8, 1993, to 
hold that business suits did not constitute “uniforms,” which would have 
permitted the use of appropriated funds for their purchase. See also 
B-261522, Sept. 29, 1995. 

As a perusal of any dictionary will show, words often have more than one 
meaning.78 The plain meaning will be the ordinary, everyday meaning. E.g., 
Mallard, 490 U.S. at 301; 38 Comp. Gen. 812 (1959). If a word has more than 
one ordinary meaning and the context of the statute does not make it clear 
which is being used, there may well be no plain meaning for purposes of 
that statute. See Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223 (1993), discussed 
previously. 

When Congress uses the same term in more than one place in the same 
statute, it is presumed that Congress intends for the same meaning to apply 
absent evidence to the contrary. E.g., United States v. Cleveland Indians 
Baseball Club, 532 U.S. 200, 213 (2001); Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 
135 (1994). The Comptroller General stated the principle as follows in 
29 Comp. Gen. 143, 145 (1949), a case involving the term “pay and 
allowances”:

 “[I]t is a settled rule of statutory construction that it is 
reasonable to assume that words used in one place in a 
legislative enactment have the same meaning in every other 
place in the statute and that consequently other sections in 
which the same phrase is used may be resorted to as an aid 
in determining the meaning thereof; and, if the meaning of 

78 “A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought and 
may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which 
it is used.” Towne v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425 (1918) (Holmes, J.). 

Page 2-89 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

the phrase is clear in one part of the statute and in others 
doubtful or obscure, it is in the latter case given the same 
construction as in the former.” 

A corollary to this principle is that when Congress uses a different term, it 
intends a different meaning. E.g., 56 Comp. Gen. 655, 658 (1977) (term 
“taking line” presumed to have different meaning than “taking area,” which 
had been used in several other sections in the same statute). 

Several different canons of construction revolve around these seemingly 
straightforward notions. Before discussing some of them, it is important to 
note once more that these canons, like most others, may or may not make 
sense to apply in particular settings. Indeed, the basic canon that the same 
words have the same meaning in a statute is itself subject to exceptions. In 
Cleveland Indians Baseball Club, the Court cautioned: 

“Although we generally presume that identical words used 
in different parts of the same act are intended to have the 
same meaning, … the presumption is not rigid, and the 
meaning [of the same words] well may vary with the 
purposes of the law.” 

532 U.S. at 213 (citations and quotation marks omitted). To drive the point 
home, the Court quoted the following admonition from a law review article: 

“The tendency to assume that a word which appears in two 
or more legal rules, and so in connection with more than 
one purpose, has and should have precisely the same scope 
in all of them … has all the tenacity of original sin and must 
constantly be guarded against.” 

Id. Of course, all bets are off if the statute clearly uses the same word 
differently in different places. See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 
343 (1997) (“[o]nce it is established that the term ‘employees’ includes 
former employees in some sections, but not in others, the term standing 
alone is necessarily ambiguous”). 

Two canons are frequently applied to the use of similar—but not identical— 
words in a statute when they are part of the same phrase. These canons are 
known as “ejusdem generis,” or “of the same kind,” and “noscitur a sociis,” 
loosely meaning that words are known by the company they keep. 

Page 2-90 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

In Washington State Department of Social and Health Services v. 
Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371 (2003), the issue was 
whether the state’s retention of Social Security Act benefits to cover some 
of its costs for providing foster care violated a provision of the Act that 
shielded benefits from “execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other 
legal process.” The Court noted that, under the two canons— 

“ ‘where general words follow specific words in a statutory 
enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace 
only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated 
by the preceding specific words.’” 

537 U.S. at 379, quoting Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 
114–115 (2001). Applying the canons, the Court held that the state’s receipt 
of the Social Security benefits as a “representative payee” did not 
constitute “other legal process” within the Act’s meaning. It reasoned that, 
based on the accompanying terms, “other legal process” required at a 
minimum the use of some judicial or quasi-judicial process. 

Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 573–74 (1995), concerned the scope 
of statute that defined the term “prospectus” to mean— 

“any prospectus, notice, circular, advertisement, letter, or 
communication, written or by radio or television, which 
offers any security for sale or confirms the sale of any 
security.” 

Applying noscitur a sociis to the list of items in section 12(2), the Court 
held that the definition of “prospectus” connoted some sort of public 
offering of a security and, therefore, did not extend to private sales 
agreements. 

The Court also invoked the noscitur canon in Gutierrez v. Ada, 528 U.S. 
250, 254–255 (2000), to construe the term “any election”: 

“The reference to ‘any election’ is preceded by two 
references to gubernatorial election and followed by four. 
With ‘any election’ so surrounded, what could it refer to 
except an election for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, 
the subject of such relentless repetition? To ask the question 
is merely to apply an interpretive rule as familiar outside the 

Page 2-91 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

e. Punctuation, Grammar, 
Titles, and Preambles Are 
Relevant but Not 
Controlling 
law as it is within, for words and people are known by their 
companions.” 

Another familiar canon dealing with word patterns in statutes is “expressio 
unius est exclusio alterius,” meaning that the expression of one thing is 
the exclusion of another. Sutherland describes this canon as simply 
embodying the commonsense notion that when people say one thing, they 
generally do not mean something else. 2A Sutherland, § 45:14. As usual, 
care must be used in applying this canon. See Barnhart v. Peabody Coal 
Co., 537 U.S. 149 (2003); United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55 (2002). The 
Court observed in Vonn: 

“At best, as we have said before, the canon that expressing 
one item of a commonly associated group or series excludes 
another left unmentioned is only a guide, whose fallibility 
can be shown by contrary indications that adopting a 
particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal 
any exclusion of its common relatives.” 

537 U.S. at 65 (citations omitted). 

Punctuation, grammar, titles, and preambles are part of the statutory text. 
As such, they are fair game for consideration in construing statutes. 
However, as discussed below, they carry less weight than the substantive 
terms of the statute. The common principle that applies to these sources is 
that they can be consulted to help resolve ambiguities in the substantive 
text, but they cannot be used to introduce ambiguity that does not 
otherwise exist. 

Punctuation and Grammar. Punctuation may be taken into consideration 
when no better evidence exists. For example, whether an “except” clause is 
or is not set off by a comma may help determine whether the exception 
applies to the entire provision or just to the portion immediately preceding 
the “except” clause. E.g., B-218812, Jan. 23, 1987. Punctuation was a 
relevant factor in the majority opinion in United States v. Ron Pair 
Enterprises, Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 241–42 (1989). A number of additional 
cases, which we do not repeat here, are cited in Justice O’Connor’s 
dissenting opinion, 489 U.S. at 249. 

On the other hand, punctuation or the lack of it should never be the 
controlling factor. As the Supreme Court stated in United States National 

Page 2-92 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insurance Agents of America, Inc., 
508 U.S. 439, 454 (1993), “a purported plain-meaning analysis based only on 
punctuation is necessarily incomplete and runs the risk of distorting a 
statute’s true meaning.” In that case, the Court disregarded an 
interpretation based on the placement of quotation marks in a statute, 
finding that all other evidence in the statute pointed to a different 
interpretation. 

Likewise, a statute’s grammatical structure is useful but not conclusive. In 
Arcadia, Ohio v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U.S. 73 (1991), the Court devoted 
considerable attention to the placement of the word “or” in a series of 
clauses. It questioned the interpretation proffered by one of the parties that 
would have given the language an awkward effect, noting: “In casual 
conversation, perhaps, such absentminded duplication and omission are 
possible, but Congress is not presumed to draft its laws that way.” Arcadia, 
Ohio, 498 U.S. at 79. By contrast, in Nobelman v. American Savings Bank, 
508 U.S. 324, 330 (1993), the Court rejected an interpretation, noting: “We 
acknowledge that this reading of the clause is quite sensible as a matter of 
grammar. But it is not compelled.” 

Titles and Headings. The title of a statute is relevant in determining its 
scope and purpose. By “title” in this context we mean the line on the slip 
law immediately following the words “An Act,” as distinguished from the 
statute’s “popular name,” if any. For example, Public Law 97-177, 96 Stat. 85 
(May 21, 1982), is “An Act [t]o require the Federal Government to pay 
interest on overdue payments, and for other purposes” (title); section 1 
says that the act may be cited as the “Prompt Payment Act” (popular 
name). A public law may or may not have a popular name; it always has a 
title. 

The title of an act may not be used to change the plain meaning of the 
enacting clauses. It is evidence of the act’s scope and purpose, however, 
and may legitimately be taken into consideration to resolve ambiguities. 
E.g., Lapina v. Williams, 232 U.S. 78, 92 (1914); White v. United States, 
191 U.S. 545, 550 (1903); Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, 
143 U.S. 457, 462–63 (1892); United States v. Fisher, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 358, 
386 (1805); 36 Comp. Gen. 389 (1956); 19 Comp. Gen. 739, 742 (1940). To 
illustrate, in Church of the Holy Trinity, the Court used the title of the 
statute in question, “An act to prohibit the importation and migration of 
foreigners and aliens under contract or agreement to perform labor in the 
United States,” as support for its conclusion that the statute was not

Problems 
intended to apply to professional persons, specifically in that case, 
ministers and pastors.79 

The same considerations apply to a statute’s popular name and to the 
headings, or titles, of particular sections of the statute. See Immigration & 
Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 308–309 (2001); 
Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 
(1998). In St. Cyr, the Supreme Court concluded that a section entitled 
“Elimination of Custody Review by Habeas Corpus” did not, in fact, 
eliminate habeas corpus jurisdiction. It found that the substantive terms of 
the section were less definitive than the title. 

Preambles. Federal statutes often include an introductory “preamble” or 
“purpose” section before the substantive provisions in which Congress sets 
forth findings, purposes, or policies that prompted it to adopt the 
legislation. Such preambles have no legally binding effect. However, they 
may provide indications of congressional intent underlying the law. 
Sutherland states with respect to preambles: 

“[T]he settled principle of law is that the preamble cannot 
control the enacting part of the statute in cases where the 
enacting part is expressed in clear, unambiguous terms. In 
case any doubt arises in the enacted part, the preamble may 
be resorted to to help discover the intention of the law 
maker.” 

2A Sutherland, § 47:04 at 221–222.80 

It is well settled that courts will attempt to avoid a construction of a statute 
that would render the statute unconstitutional. E.g., Edward J. DeBartolo 
Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 
485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) and the host of precedents it cites in observing: 

79 The utility of this principle will, of course, depend on the degree of specificity in the title. 
Its value has been considerably diminished by the practice, found in many recent statutes 
such as the Prompt Payment Act noted above, of adding on the words “and for other 
purposes.” 

80 An interesting use of a preamble arose in Association of American Railroads v. Surface 
Transportation Board, 237 F.3d 676 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Recognizing that the preamble lacked 
operative effect, the court nonetheless held that it was arbitrary and capricious for the 
agency to construe the statute without at least considering the policy set out in its preamble. 

Page 2-94 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

“[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute 
would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will 
construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such 
construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress… . 
This cardinal principle … has for so long been applied by 
this Court that it is beyond debate… . [T]he elementary rule 
is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in 
order to save a statute from unconstitutionality. This 
approach not only reflects the prudential concern that 
constitutional issues not be needlessly confronted, but also 
recognizes that Congress, like this Court, is bound by and 
swears an oath to uphold the Constitution. The courts will 
therefore not lightly assume that Congress intended to 
infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp power 
constitutionally forbidden it.” (Citations and quotation 
marks omitted.) 

As the Court put it in Immigration & Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr, 
533 U.S. 289, 300 (2001), where an alternative to a constitutionally 
problematic interpretation “is fairly possible, … we are obligated to 
construe the statute to avoid such problems.” (Citations and quotation 
marks omitted.) 

Two cases arising under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (known as 
“FACA”), 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 1 et seq., illustrate the lengths to which courts 
will go to avoid constitutional problems. In Public Citizen v. United States 
Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989), the Court held that the Justice 
Department did not “utilize” within the meaning of FACA an American Bar 
Association committee that reported to the Department on federal judicial 
nominees and rated their qualifications. Taking its lead from Public 
Citizen, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held in 
Association of American Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Clinton, 997 F.2d 
898 (D.C. Cir. 1993), that the First Lady was a full-time officer or employee 
of the federal government within the meaning of the Act. Therefore, a task 
force she chaired was exempt from FACA under a provision of the Act that 
excluded “any committee which is composed wholly of full-time officers or 
employees of the Federal Government.” The constitutional issue in both 
Public Citizen and Association of American Physicians & Surgeons was 
whether application of FACA to the advisory committees involved in those 
cases would violate separation of powers by

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

infringing upon the President’s ability to obtain advice in the performance 
of his constitutional responsibilities.81 

However, there are outer limits to interpretations designed to avoid 
constitutional problems. See Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. 
Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998) (“[t]hat doctrine [of avoidance] enters in 
only ‘where a statute is susceptible of two constructions’”); Plaut v. 
Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 216 (1995) (“[t]o avoid a 
constitutional question by holding that Congress enacted, and the 
President approved, a blank sheet of paper would indeed constitute 
‘disingenuous evasion’”). 

6. Legislative History 
a. Uses and Limitations The term “legislative history” refers to, and is comprised of, the body of 
congressionally generated written documents relating to a bill from the 
time of introduction to the time of enactment. As we will discuss, there are 
at least two basic ways to use legislative history. One is to examine the 
documents that make up the legislative history in order to determine what 
they say about the meaning and intent of the legislation. The other is to 
examine the evolution of the bill’s language through the legislative process. 
Changes made to a bill during its consideration are often instructive in 
determining its final meaning. 
Legislative history is always relevant in the sense that it is never “wrong” to 
look at it. Thus, as previously noted, most cases purporting to apply the 
plain meaning rule also review legislative history—if for no other reason 
than to establish that nothing in that history contradicts the court’s view of 
what the plain meaning is. The converse of the plain meaning rule is that it 
is legitimate and proper to resort to legislative history when the meaning of 
the statutory language is not plain on its face. Again, we start with an early 

81 The majority opinion in Association of American Physicians & Surgeons placed heavy 
reliance on Public Citizen, noting that “[t]he Court adopted, we think it is fair to say, an 
extremely strained construction of the word ‘utilized’ in order to avoid the constitutional 
question.” 997 F.2d at 906. Both Public Citizen and Association of American Physicians & 
Surgeons drew strongly worded concurring opinions along the same lines. The 
concurrences maintained that FACA clearly applied by its plain terms to the respective 
groups, but that its application was unconstitutional as so applied. 

Page 2-96 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Supreme Court passage, this one a famous statement by Chief Justice John 
Marshall:

 “Where the mind labours to discover the design of the 
legislature, it seizes every thing from which aid can be 
derived … .” 

United States v. Fisher, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 358, 386 (1805). See also United 
States v. Donruss Co., 393 U.S. 297, 302–03 (1969); Caminetti v. United 
States, 242 U.S. 470, 490 (1917) (legislative history “may aid the courts in 
reaching the true meaning of the legislature in cases of doubtful 
interpretation”). 

It is entirely proper to use legislative history to seek guidance on the 
purpose of a statute (to see, for example, what kinds of problems Congress 
wanted to address), or to confirm the apparent plain meaning, or to resolve 
ambiguities. A classic example of the latter is a statute using the words 
“science” or “scientific.” Either term, without more, does not tell you 
whether the statute applies to the social sciences as well as the physical 
sciences. E.g., American Kennel Club, Inc. v. Hoey, 148 F.2d 920, 922 
(2nd Cir. 1945); B-181142, Aug. 5, 1974 (GAO recommended that the term 
“science and technology” in a bill be defined to avoid this ambiguity). If the 
statute does not include a definition, you would look next to the legislative 
history. 

The use becomes improper when the line is crossed from using legislative 
history to resolve things that are not clear in the statutory language to using 
it to rewrite the statute. E.g., Shannon v. United States, 512 U.S. 573, 583 
(1994) (declining to give effect to “a single passage of legislative history 
that is in no way anchored in the text of the statute”); Ratzlaf v. United 
States, 510 U.S. 135, 147–148 (1994) (declining to “resort to legislative 
history to cloud a statutory text that is clear”). The Comptroller General 
put it this way:

 “[A]s a general proposition, there is a distinction to be made 
between utilizing legislative history for the purpose of 
illuminating the intent underlying language used in a statute 
and resorting to that history for the purpose of writing into 
the law that which is not there.” 

55 Comp. Gen. 307, 325 (1975).

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

b. Components and Their 
Relative Weight 
A recent Comptroller General decision illustrates this point. An 
appropriation rider sponsored by Senator McCain prohibited the Air Force 
from using funds to lease certain aircraft “under any contract entered into 
under any procurement procedures other than pursuant to” the 
Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), Pub. L. No. 98-369, 98 Stat. 1175 
(July 18, 1984), classified generally to 41 U.S.C. §§ 251 et seq. In a floor 
statement on the bill, Senator McCain said that his language would require 
“full and open competition” for the aircraft and preclude a “sole source” 
award. However, CICA clearly does not require full and open competition 
or prohibit sole-source awards. Therefore, the Comptroller General upheld 
the Air Force’s award of a sole-source contract: 

“Since section 8147, by its plain terms, only requires 
compliance with CICA, and does not provide that 
competitive procedures must be used for the Boeing 
transport/VIP aircraft procurement, we find no basis for 
reading such a requirement into the provision.” 

B-291805, Mar. 26, 2003. 

In discussing legislative history, we will first consider use of the 
explanatory documents that go into it. These documents fall generally into 
three categories: committee reports, floor debates, and hearings. For 
probative purposes, they bear an established relationship to one another. 
Let us emphasize before proceeding, however, that listing items of 
legislative history in an “order of persuasiveness” is merely a guideline. The 
evidentiary value of any piece of legislative history depends on its 
relationship to other available legislative history and, most importantly, to 
the language of the statute. 

(1) Committee reports 
The most authoritative single source of legislative history is the conference 
report. E.g., United States v. Commonwealth Energy System & 
Subsidiary Cos., 235 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2000); Resolution Trust Corp. v. 
Gallagher, 10 F.3d 416, 421 (7th Cir. 1993); Squillacote v. United States, 
739 F.2d 1208, 1218 (7th Cir. 1984); B-142011, Apr. 30, 1971. See also Bay 
View, Inc. v. United States, 278 F.3d 1259, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cert. 
denied, 537 U.S. 826 (2002). This is especially true if the statutory language 
in question was drafted by the conference committee. The reason the 
conference report occupies the highest rung on the ladder is that it must be 
voted on and adopted by both houses of Congress and thus is the only 

Page 2-98 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

legislative history document that can be said to reflect the will of both 
houses.Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Acker, 361 U.S. 87, 94 (1959) 
(Frankfurter, J., dissenting). 

Next in sequence are the reports of the legislative committees that 
considered the bill and reported it out to their respective houses. The 
Supreme Court has consistently been willing to rely on committee reports 
when otherwise appropriate. E.g., Demore v. Hyung Joon Kim, 
538 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 1708, 1714–1716 (2003); Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. 
Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 543–544 (2001); Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 
254 U.S. 443, 474 (1921); United States v. St. Paul, Minneapolis & 
Manitoba Railway Co., 247 U.S. 310, 318 (1918); Lapina v. Williams, 
232 U.S. 78, 90 (1914). 

However, material in committee reports, even a conference report, will 
ordinarily not be used to controvert clear statutory language. Squillacote, 
739 F.2d at 1218; Hart v. United States, 585 F.2d 1025 (Ct. Cl. 1978); 

B-278121, Nov. 7, 1997; B-33911, B-62187, July 15, 1948. 

The following excerpt from a colloquy between Senators Armstrong and 
Dole demonstrates why committee reports must be used with caution:

 “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, did members of the 
Finance Committee vote on the committee report?

 “Mr. DOLE. No.

 “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, the reason I raise the 
issue is not perhaps apparent on the surface… . The report 
itself is not considered by the Committee on Finance. It was 
not subject to amendment by the Committee on Finance. It 
is not subject to amendment now by the Senate.

 …

 “I only wish the record to reflect that this is not statutory 
language. It is not before us. If there were matter within this 
report which was disagreed to by the Senator from 
Colorado or even by a majority of all Senators, there would 
be no way for us to change the report. I could not offer an 
amendment tonight to amend the committee report. 

Page 2-99 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

 “… [F]or any jurist, administrator, bureaucrat, tax 
practitioner, or others who might chance upon the written 
record of this proceeding, let me just make the point that 
this is not the law, it was not voted on, it is not subject to 
amendment, and we should discipline ourselves to the task 
of expressing congressional intent in the statute.”82 

Notwithstanding the imperfections of the system, in those cases where 
there is a need to resort to legislative history, committee reports remain 
generally recognized as the best source. In this regard, Sutherland 
observes: 

“Increasingly, courts have turned to reports of standing 
committees for aid in interpretation. This movement has 
coincided with an improvement in the preparation of 
reports by standing committees and their counsel.” 

2A Sutherland, § 48:06 at 445. 

(2) Floor debates 
Proceeding downward on the ladder, after committee reports come floor 
debates. Statements made in the course of floor debates have traditionally 
been regarded as suspect in that they are “expressive of the views and 
motives of individual members.” Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 
254 U.S. 443, 474 (1921). In addition— 

“[I]t is impossible to determine with certainty what 
construction was put upon an act by the members of a 
legislative body that passed it by resorting to the speeches 
of individual members thereof. Those who did not speak 
may not have agreed with those who did, and those who 
spoke might differ from each other… ” 

United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass’n, 166 U.S. 290, 318 (1897). 
Some of the earlier cases, such as Trans-Missouri Freight, indicate that 
floor debates should never be taken into consideration. Under the more

The Legal Framework 

modern view, however, they may be considered, the real question being the 
weight they should receive in various circumstances. 

Floor debates are less authoritative than committee reports. Garcia v. 
United States, 469 U.S. 70, 76 (1984); Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.S. 168, 186 
(1969); United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 385 (1968); United States v. 
United Automobile Workers, 352 U.S. 567, 585 (1957); Bay View, Inc. v. 
United States, 278 F.3d 1259, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 
826 (2002). It follows that they will not be regarded as persuasive if they 
conflict with explicit statements in more authoritative portions of 
legislative history such as committee reports. United States v. Wrightwood 
Dairy Co., 315 U.S. 110, 125 (1942); B-114829, June 27, 1975. Conversely, 
they will carry more weight if they are mutually reenforcing. National Data 
Corp. & Subsidiaries v. United States, 50 Fed. Cl. 24, 32, n.14 (2001), aff’d, 
291 F.3d 1381 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1045 (2002).83 

Debates will carry considerably more weight when they are the only 
available legislative history as, for example, in the case of a post-report 
floor amendment. Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, 472 U.S. 159, 169–70 (1985); Preterm, Inc. v. 
Dukakis, 591 F.2d 121, 128 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 952 (1979). 
Indeed, the Preterm court suggested that “heated and lengthy debates” in 
which “the views expressed were those of a wide spectrum” of Members 
might be more valuable in discerning congressional intent than committee 
reports, “which represent merely the views of [the committee’s] members 
and may never have come to the attention of Congress as a whole.” 
Preterm, 591 F.2d at 133. 

The weight to be given statements made in floor debates varies with the 
identity of the speaker. Thus, statements by legislators in charge of a bill, 
such as the pertinent committee chairperson, have been regarded as “in the 
nature of a supplementary report” and receive somewhat more weight. 
United States v. St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Co., 247 U.S. 
310, 318 (1918). See also McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., 283 U.S. 488, 
493–94 (1931) (statements by Members “who were not in charge of the bill” 
were “without weight”); Duplex v. Deering, 254 U.S. at 474–75; 

83 “Here … we are faced not with a single, idle [Member] statement, but rather a pattern of 
statements—and one that is consistent not only with the Conference Committee Report’s 
emphasis … but also the statute’s language itself.” Id.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

NLRB v. Thompson Products, Inc., 141 F.2d 794, 798 (9th Cir. 1944). The 
Supreme Court’s statement in St. Paul Railway Co. gave rise to the entirely 
legitimate practice of “making” legislative history by preparing questions 
and answers in advance, to be presented on the floor and answered by the 
Member in charge of the bill.84 

Statements by the sponsor of a bill are also entitled to somewhat more 
weight. E.g., Schwegmann Brothers v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 
384, 394–95 (1951); Ex Parte Kawato, 317 U.S. 69, 77 (1942); Bedroc 
Limited v. United States, 50 F. Supp.2d 1001, 1006 (D. Nev. 1999), aff’d, 
314 F.3d 1080 (9th Cir. 2002). However, they are not controlling. Chrysler 
Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 311 (1979). 

Statements by the opponents of a bill expressing their “fears and doubts” 
generally receive little, if any, weight. Shell Oil Co. v. Iowa Department of 
Revenue, 488 U.S. 19, 29 (1988); Schwegmann, 341 U.S. at 394. However, 
even the statements of opponents may be “relevant and useful,” although 
not authoritative, in certain circumstances, such as where the supporters of 
a bill make no response to opponents’ criticisms. Arizona v. California, 
373 U.S. 546, 583 n.85 (1963); Parlane Sportswear Co. v. Weinberger, 
513 F.2d 835, 837 (1st Cir. 1975); Bentley v. Arlee Home Fashions, Inc., 
861 F. Supp. 65, 67 (E.D. Ark. 1994). 

Where Senate and House floor debates suggest conflicting interpretations 
and there is no more authoritative source of legislative history available, it 
is legitimate to give weight to such factors as which house originated the 
provision in question and which house has the more detailed and “clear 
cut” history. Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U.S. 247, 254 (1956); 49 Comp. 
Gen. 411 (1970). 

(3) Hearings 
Hearings occupy the bottom rung on the ladder. They are valuable for many 
reasons: they help define the problem Congress is addressing; they present 
opposing viewpoints for Congress to consider; and they provide the 
opportunity for public participation in the lawmaking process. As 
legislative history, however, they are the least persuasive form. The reason 
is that they reflect only the personal opinion and motives of the witness. It 

84 The origin and use of this device were explained in a floor statement by former 
Senator Morse on March 26, 1964. See 110 Cong. Rec. 6423 (1964).

c. Post-enactment Statements 
Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

is more often than not impossible to attribute these opinions and motives 
to anyone in Congress, let alone Congress as a whole, unless more 
authoritative forms of legislative history expressly adopt them. As one 
court has stated, an isolated excerpt from the statement of a witness at 
hearings “is not entitled to consideration in determining legislative intent.” 
Pacific Insurance Co. v. United States, 188 F.2d 571, 572 (9th Cir. 1951). “It 
would indeed be absurd,” said another court, “to suppose that the 
testimony of a witness by itself could be used to interpret an act of 
Congress.” SEC v. Collier, 76 F.2d 939, 941 (2nd Cir. 1935). 

There is one significant exception. Testimony by the government agency 
that recommended the bill or amendment in question, and which often 
helped draft it, is entitled to special weight. Shapiro v. United States, 
335 U.S. 1, 12 n.13 (1948); SEC v. Collier, 76 F.2d at 941. 

Also, testimony at hearings can be more valuable as legislative history if it 
can be demonstrated that the language of a bill was revised in direct 
response to that testimony. Relevant factors include the presence or 
absence of statements in more authoritative history linking the change to 
the testimony; the proximity in time of the change to the testimony; and the 
precise language of the change as compared to what was offered in the 
testimony. See Premachandra v. Mitts, 753 F.2d 635, 640–41 (8th Cir. 1985). 
See also Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 566–68 (1969); 
SEC v. Collier, 76 F.2d at 940, 941. 

Observers of the often difficult task of discerning congressional intent 
occasionally ask, isn’t there an easier way to do this? Why don’t you just 
call the sponsor or the committee and ask what they had in mind? The 
answer is that post-enactment statements have virtually no weight in 
determining prior congressional intent. The objective of statutory 
construction is to ascertain a collective intent, not an individual’s intent or, 
worse yet, an individual’s characterization of the collective intent. It is 
impossible to demonstrate that the substance of a post hoc statement 
reflects the intent of the pre-enactment Congress, unless it can be 
corroborated by pre-enactment statements, in which event it would be 
unnecessary. Or, as the Supreme Court has said:

 “Since such statements cannot possibly have informed the 
vote of the legislators who earlier enacted the law, there is 
no more basis for considering them than there is to conduct 
postenactment polls of the original legislators.”

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 488 U.S. 105, 118–19 (1988). See also 
Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 580 (1995) (“If legislative history is to 
be considered, it is preferable to consult the documents prepared by 
Congress when deliberating.”); 2A Sutherland, § 48:04 (to be considered 
legislative history, material should be generally available to legislators and 
relied on by them in passing the bill). 

In expressing their unwillingness to consider post-enactment statements, 
courts have not viewed the identity of the speaker (sponsor, committee, 
committee chairman, etc.) or the form of the statement (report, floor 
statement, letter, affidavit, etc.) to be relevant. There are numerous cases in 
which the courts, and particularly the Supreme Court, have expressed the 
unwillingness to give weight to post-enactment statements. See, e.g., Bread 
Political Action Committee v. Federal Election Commission, 455 U.S. 577, 
582 n.3 (1982); Quern v. Mandley, 436 U.S. 725, 736 n.10 (1978); Regional 
Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 132 (1974); United States v. 
Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S. 157, 170 (1968); Haynes v. United States, 
390 U.S. 85, 87 n.4 (1968). See also General Instrument Corp. v. FCC, 
213 F.3d 724, 733 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (referring to post-enactment statements 
as “legislative future” rather than legislative history); Cavallo v. Utica-
Watertown Health Insurance Co., 3 F. Supp. 2d 223, 230 (N.D. N.Y. 1998). 

Courts have not found expressions of intent concerning previously enacted 
legislation that are made in committee reports or floor statements during 
the consideration of subsequent legislation to be relevant either. E.g., 
O’Gilvie v. United States, 519 U.S. 79, 90 (1996) (“the view of a later 
Congress cannot control the interpretation of an earlier enacted statute”); 
Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management, 263 F.3d 1341, 1354 (Fed. 
Cir. 2001) (post-enactment statements made in the legislative history of the 
1994 amendments have no bearing in determining the legislative intent of 
the drafters of the 1978 and 1989 legislation). 

GAO naturally follows the principle that post-enactment statements do not 
constitute legislative history. E.g., 72 Comp. Gen. 317 (1993); 54 Comp. 
Gen. 819, 822 (1975). Likewise, the Office of Legal Counsel has virtually 
conceded that presidential signing statements fall within the realm of post-

Page 2-104 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

d. Development of the 
Statutory Language 
enactment statements that carry no weight as legislative history. See 17 Op. 
Off. Legal Counsel 131 (1993).85 

As with all other principles relating to statutory interpretation, the rule 
against consideration of post-enactment statements is not absolute. Even 
post-enactment material may be taken into consideration, despite its very 
limited value, when there is absolutely nothing else. See B-169491, June 16, 
1980. 

As previously noted, examination of legislative history includes not only 
what the drafters of a bill said about it, but also what they did to it as the 
bill progressed through the enactment process. Changes made to a bill may 
provide insight into what the final language means. For example, the 
deletion from the final version of language that was in the original bill may 
suggest an intent to reject what was covered by that language. See 
generally 2A Sutherland, § 48:04. The same is true of language offered in an 
amendment that was defeated. Id., § 48:18. 

The courts consider the evolution of legislative language in different 
contexts. See, for example: 

• Chickasaw Nation v. United States, 534 U.S. 84, 91 (2001): The original 
Senate bill applied both to taxation and to reporting and withholding. 
The final version applied only to reporting and withholding, thereby 
suggesting that a cross-reference to another law dealing with taxation 
was left in by error. 

• Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 255–256 (1994): The 
President vetoed a 1990 version of a civil rights bill in part because he 
objected to the bill’s broad retroactivity provisions. This indicates that 
the absence of comparable retroactivity provisions in the version of the 
bill enacted in 1991 was not an oversight, but rather part of a political 
compromise. 

See also Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gallagher, 10 F.3d 416 423 (7th Cir. 1993); 
Davis v. United States, 46 Fed. Cl. 421 (2000). 

85 While this opinion stopped short of attempting “finally to decide” the matter, it presented 
several powerful arguments against the validity of signing statements as legislative history 
but no arguments in favor of their use for this purpose.

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

As always, care must be exercised when interpreting language changes in a 
bill, particularly when the accompanying documents do not discuss them. 
Unless the legislative history explains the reason for the omission or 
deletion or the reason is clear from the context, drawing conclusions is 
inherently speculative. Perhaps Congress did not want that particular 
provision; perhaps Congress felt it was already covered in the same or 
other legislation. Absent an explanation, the effect of such an omission or 
deletion is inconclusive. Fox v. Standard Oil Co., 294 U.S. 87, 96 (1935); 
Southern Packaging & Storage Co. v. United States, 588 F. Supp. 532, 549 

(D.S.C. 1984); 63 Comp. Gen. 498, 501–02 (1984); 63 Comp. Gen. 470, 472 
(1984). 
7. Presumptions and 
“Clear Statement” Rules 
a. Presumption in Favor of 
Judicial Review 
In a perhaps growing number of specific areas, courts apply extra scrutiny 
in construing statutes that they regard as departing from traditional norms 
of legislation. In these areas, the courts require a greater than usual 
showing that Congress did, in fact, mean to depart from the norm. 
Typically, the courts will raise the bar by imposing a “presumption” that 
must be overcome in order to establish that Congress intended the 
departure. Alternatively but to the same effect, courts sometimes require a 
“clear statement” by Congress that it intended the departure. 

Such presumptions and clear statement rules have been described as 
“substantive canons” as opposed to “linguistic canons” since, rather than 
aiding in the interpretation of statutory language per se, they are designed 
to protect “substantive values drawn from the common law, federal 
statutes, or the United States Constitution.”86 A few examples are given 
below. 

There is a “strong presumption” in favor of judicial review of administrative 
actions. E.g., Demore v. Hyung Joon Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 1708 
(2003); Immigration & Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 
(2001); McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U.S. 479 (1991); 
Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667 (1986). 
In Bowen, the Court stated the presumption as follows: 

86 William N. Eskridge, Jr., and Philip P. Frickey, Quasi-Constitutional Law: Clear 
Statement Rules As Constitutional Lawmaking, 45 Vand. L. Rev. 593 (1992). 

Page 2-106 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

“We begin with the strong presumption that Congress 
intends judicial review of administrative action. From the 
beginning, ‘our cases [have established] that judicial review 
of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be 
cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such 
was the purpose of Congress.’” 

476 U.S. at 670, quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 
(1967). 

The Court in Bowen went on to note that the presumption of reviewability 
can be rebutted: 

“Subject to constitutional constraints, Congress can, of 
course, make exceptions to the historic practice whereby 
courts review agency action. The presumption of judicial 
review is, after all, a presumption, and like all presumptions 
used in interpreting statutes, may be overcome by, inter 
alia, specific language or specific legislative history that is a 
reliable indicator of congressional intent or a specific 
congressional intent to preclude judicial review that is fairly 
discernable in the detail of the legislative scheme.” 

Id. at 672–673 (quotation marks omitted). 

Later decisions indicate that a particularly strong showing is required to 
establish a congressional intent to preclude judicial review of 
constitutional claims through habeas corpus petitions. See Demore and St. 
Cyr, supra. Thus, the Court observed in St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 299: 

“Implications from statutory text or legislative history are 
not sufficient to repeal habeas jurisdiction; instead, 
Congress must articulate specific and unambiguous 
statutory directives to effect repeal.” 

Finally, it is important to note one area in which the usual presumption in 
favor of judicial review becomes a presumption against judicial review: 
exercises of discretion by the President. In Franklin v. Massachusetts, 
505 U.S. 788 (1992), the Supreme Court held that the President is not an 
“agency” for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); 
therefore, presidential actions are not subject to judicial review under the 

Page 2-107 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

b. Presumption against 
Retroactivity 
APA. The Court recognized that the general definition of “agency” in the 
APA (5 U.S.C. § 551(1)) covered “each authority of the Government of the 
United States” and that the President was not explicitly excluded from this 
definition. However, the Court held: 

“Out of respect for the separation of powers and the unique 
constitutional position of the President, we find that textual 
silence is not enough to subject the President to the 
provisions of the APA. We would require an express 
statement by Congress before assuming it intended the 
President’s performance of his statutory duties to be 
reviewed for abuse of discretion.” 

505 U.S. at 800–801 (emphasis supplied). 

Several subsequent cases have followed and extended Franklin. See 
Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994); Tulare County v. Bush, 185 F. Supp. 
2d 18 (D.D.C. 2001), aff’d, 306 F.3d 1138 (D.C. Cir. 2002), reh’g en banc 
denied, 317 F.3d 227 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, ____ U.S. ___, 71 U.S.L.Week 
3724 (Oct. 6, 2003).87 

As noted previously, statutes and amendments to statutes generally are 
construed to apply prospectively only (that is, from their date of enactment 
or other effective date if one is specified). However, while Congress 
generally has the power to enact retroactive statutes, 88 the Supreme Court 
has held: 

“Retroactivity is not favored in the law. Thus, congressional 
enactments … will not be construed to have retroactive 
effect unless their language requires this result.” 

Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988). 

87 The “express statement” rule does not, however, extend to judicial review of the 
constitutionality of presidential actions. Dalton, 511 U.S. at 469, 473–474; Franklin, 505 U.S. 
at 801. 

88 One exception is the Constitution’s prohibition against “ex post facto” laws (U.S. Const. 
art. I, § 9, cl. 3), which precludes penal statutes from operating retroactively. Another 
exception, based on separation of powers considerations, prevents Congress from enacting 
laws that have the effect of requiring federal courts to reopen final judgments. Plaut v. 
Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 (1995). 

Page 2-108 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

The Court reaffirmed the presumption against retroactivity of statutes in 
several recent decisions. E.g., Immigration & Naturalization Service v. 
St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001); Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343 (1999); Lindh v. 
Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997); Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 
(1994). In Landgraf, the Court elaborated on the policies supporting the 
presumption against retroactivity: 

“Because it accords with widely held intuitions about how 
statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against 
retroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and 
public expectations. Requiring clear intent assures that 
Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential 
unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it 
is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits. 
Such a requirement allocates to Congress responsibility for 
fundamental policy judgments concerning the proper 
temporal reach of statutes, and has the additional virtue of 
giving legislators a predictable background rule against 
which to legislate.” 

511 U.S. at 272–273. 

Landgraf also resolved the “apparent tension” between the presumption 
against retroactivity in its Bowen line of decisions and another decision, 
Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U.S. 696 (1974), which held that 
when a law changes subsequent to the judgment of a lower court, an 
appellate court must apply the new law, that is, the law in effect when it 
renders its decision, unless applying the new law would produce “manifest 
injustice” or unless there is statutory direction or legislative history to the 
contrary.89 It affirmed that the presumption embraces statutes that have 
“genuinely” retroactive effect, by which it meant statutes that apply new 

89 Previously, the Court had acknowledged but left unresolved the “apparent tension” 
between Bradley and Bowen. See Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 
494 U.S. 827, 837 (1990).

Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

standards “affecting substantive rights, liabilities, or duties” to conduct that 
occurred prior to their enactment. 511 U.S. at 277–278.90 

By way of summary, the Supreme Court in Landgraf set forth the following 
test for determining whether the presumption against retroactivity applies: 

“When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the 
events in suit, the court’s first task is to determine whether 
Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper 
reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need 
to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the 
statute contains no such express command, the court must 
determine whether the new statute would have retroactive 
effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed 
when he acted, increase a party’s liability for past conduct, 
or impose new duties with respect to transactions already 
completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our 
traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern 
absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.” 

Id. at 280. 

The Comptroller General also applies the traditional rule that statutes are 
not construed to apply retroactively unless a retroactive construction is 
required by their express language or by necessary implication or unless it 
is demonstrated that this is what Congress clearly intended. 64 Comp. 
Gen. 493 (1985); 38 Comp. Gen. 103 (1958); 34 Comp. Gen. 404 (1955); 
28 Comp. Gen. 162 (1948); 16 Comp. Gen. 1051 (1937); 7 Comp. Gen. 266 
(1927); 5 Comp. Gen. 381 (1925); 2 Comp. Gen. 267 (1922); 26 Comp. 
Dec. 40 (1919); B-205180, Nov. 27, 1981; B-191190, Feb. 13, 1980; B-162208, 
Aug. 28, 1967. 

90 Specifically, the Court held that a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 that created a 
new cause of action for certain civil rights violations could not be added to a lawsuit 
pending at the time the 1991 Act was signed into law since the conduct involved in that 
lawsuit occurred before the 1991 Act was enacted. On the other hand, “procedural” changes, 
such as provisions for jury trials in certain civil rights actions, ordinarily could apply to 
lawsuits pending at the time of enactment. (In this case, however, the provision for jury trial 
would not apply since it was limited to the newly created cause of action.) 

Page 2-110 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


c. Federalism Presumptions 
Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

This rule was recently applied to a statute (Pub. L. No. 107-103, § 605, 
115 Stat. 976, 1000 (Dec. 27, 2001)) that authorized the United States Court 
of Appeals for Veterans Claims to reimburse its employees for a portion of 
their professional liability insurance payments. Since nothing in the statute 
or its legislative history indicated that the statute was to have retroactive 
effect, the Comptroller General held that the statute did not authorize 
reimbursement for insurance payments made prior to December 27, 2001. 

B-300866, May 30, 2003. 

Another line of cases has dealt with a different aspect of retroactivity. GAO 
is reluctant to construe a statute to retroactively abolish or diminish rights 
that had accrued before its enactment unless this was clearly the legislative 
intent. For example, the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 authorized $50 “special 
payments” to certain taxpayers. Legislation in 1977 abolished the special 
payments as of its date of enactment. GAO held in B-190751, Apr. 11, 1978, 
that payments could be made where payment vouchers were validly issued 
before the cutoff date but lost in the mail. Similarly, payments could be 
made to eligible claimants whose claims had been erroneously denied 
before the cutoff but were later found valid. B-190751, Sept. 26, 1980. 

Under the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2), 
Congress, when acting within the scope of its own assigned constitutional 
authority, can preempt state and local laws. As the Court noted in 
Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U.S. 597, 604 (1991), “[t]he 
ways in which federal law may pre-empt state law are well established and 
in the first instance turn on congressional intent.” Specifically, Congress 
may preempt either by an explicit statutory provision or by establishing a 
federal statutory scheme that is so pervasive as to leave no room for 
supplementation by the states. In either event, however, the Court stated: 

“When considering pre-emption, ‘we start with the 
assumption that the historic police powers of the States 
were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that 
was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.’” 

501 U.S. at 605, quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 
(1947). 

The Court continues to apply the “clear and manifest purpose” test to 
preemption cases. See City of Columbus v. Ours Garage and Wrecker 
Service, Inc., 536 U.S. 424 (2002). In City of Columbus, the Court 
construed a statute that included an explicit preemption provision; the 

Page 2-111 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 2 
The Legal Framework 

issue concerned its scope. Acknowledging that the language could be read 
to preempt safety regulation by local governments, the Court refused to 
find preemption: 

“[R]eading [the statute’s] set of exceptions in combination, 
and with a view to the basic tenets of our federal system 
pivotal in Mortier, we conclude that the statute does not 
provide the requisite ‘clear and manifest indication that 
Congress sought to supplant local authority.’” 

536 U.S. at 434. 

There also is a presumption against construing federal statutes to abrogate 
the immunity from suit that states enjoy under the Eleventh Amendment to 
the United States Constitution. Congress must make its intent to abrogate 
such immunity “unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.” See 
Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, ___ U.S. ___, 123 S. Ct. 
1972, 1976 (2003); Hoffman v. Connecticut Department of Income 
Maintenance, 492 U.S. 96, 101 (1989) and cases cited. The necessary 
unmistakable intent to preempt was supplied by the express language of 
the statute in Hibbs, but such intent was found lacking in Hoffman. 

Finally, the Court fashioned a “plain statement” rule based on federalism 
principles in considering whether the federal Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., superseded a state 
constitutional provision for the mandatory retirement of judges at age 70. 
Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991). The Act’s definition of “employer” 
included state and local governments;91 however, its definition of 
“employee” excluded an “appointee at the policymaking level.” The Court 
held that this exclusion covered judges and, therefore, they were not 
subject to the Act. Recognizing that the Act’s language was at best 
ambiguous on this point, the Court reasoned: 

“‘[A]ppointee at the policymaking level,’ particularly in the 
context of the other exceptions that surround it, is an odd 
way for Congress to exclude judges; a plain statement that 
judges are not ‘employees’ would seem the most efficient 

91 The Supreme Court has since held that the ADEA does not validly abrogate the states’ 
sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. Raygor v. Regents of the University of 
Minnesota, 534 U.S. 533 (2002); Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000).

d. Presumption against Waiver 
of Sovereign Immunity 
phrasing. But in this case we are not looking for a plain 
statement that judges are excluded. We will not read the 
ADEA to cover state judges unless Congress has made it 
clear that judges are included.” 

501 U.S. at 467 (emphasis in original). 

There is a strong presumption against waiver of the federal government’s 
immunity from suit. The courts have repeatedly held that waivers of 
sovereign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed.” E.g., United 
States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30 (1992); Shoshone Indian Tribe of 
the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming v. United States, 51 Fed. Cl. 60 
(2001) and cases cited. Legislative history does not help for this purpose. 
The relevant statutory language in Nordic Village was ambiguous and could 
have been read, evidently with the support of the legislative history, to 
impose monetary liability on the United States. The Court rejected such a 
reading, applying instead the same approach as described above in its 
federalism jurisprudence: 

“[L]egislative history has no bearing on the ambiguity point. 
As in the Eleventh Amendment context, see Hoffman, 
supra, … the ‘unequivocal expression’ of elimination of 
sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an expression in 
statutory text. If clarity does not exist there, it cannot be 
supplied by a committee report.” 

503 U.S. at 37.

Chapter 3 

Agency Regulations and Administrative 
Discretion 

This chapter deals with certain topics in administrative law that, strictly 
speaking, are not “appropriations law” or “fiscal law.” Nevertheless, the 
material covered is so pervasive in all areas of federal law, appropriations 
law included, that a brief treatment in this publication is warranted. We 
caution that it is not our purpose to present an administrative law treatise, 
but rather to highlight some important “crosscutting” principles that appear 
in various contexts in many other chapters. The case citations should be 
viewed as an illustrative sampling. 

As a conceptual starting point, agency regulations fall into three broad 

A. Agency Regulations 
categories. First, every agency head has the authority, largely inherent but 
also authorized generally by 5 U.S.C. § 301,1 to issue regulations to govern 
the internal affairs of the agency. Regulations in this category may include 
such subjects as conflicts of interest, employee travel, and delegations to 
organizational components. This statute is nothing more than a grant of 
authority for what are called “housekeeping” regulations. Chrysler Corp. v. 
Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 309 (1979); Smith v. Cromer, 159 F.3d 875, 878 (4th Cir. 
1998), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 826 (1999); NLRB v. Capitol Fish Co., 294 F.2d 
868, 875 (5th Cir. 1961). It confers “administrative power only.” United 
States v. George, 228 U.S. 14, 20 (1913); 54 Comp. Gen. 624, 626 (1975). 
Thus, the statute merely grants agencies authority to issue regulations that 
govern their own internal affairs; it does not authorize rulemaking that 
creates substantive legal rights. Schism v. United States, 316 F.3d 1259, 
1278–1284 (Fed. Cir. 2002), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 123 S. Ct. 2246 
(2003). 

Second, agencies also have inherent authority to issue procedural rules to 
govern their internal processes as well as “interpretive” rules that express 
the agency’s policy positions or views in a way that does not bind outside 
parties or the agency itself. See Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law 
Treatise § 6.2 at 306 (4th ed. 2000), citing Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 
134 (1944) and other cases. 

1 “The head of an Executive department or military department may prescribe regulations 
for the government of his department, the conduct of its employees, the distribution and 
performance of its business, and the custody, use, and preservation of its records, papers, 
and property….” 

Page 3-2 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

The third category consists of so-called “legislative” or “statutory” 
regulations. Regulations in this category, which can only be issued 
pursuant to a specific statutory grant of authority, create rights and 
obligations and address other substantive matters in ways that have the 
force and effect of law. 2 In effect, these regulations constitute the exercise 
of authority delegated to the agency by law to further “legislate” by fleshing 
out the underlying statute that the agency is charged with implementing. As 
discussed in section B of this chapter, the scope and specificity of such a 
congressional delegation of legislative authority to an agency will often 
determine how much deference the courts will accord to the agency’s 
regulations and to the agency’s interpretation of the laws it implements. 

It is not unusual for Congress to grant agencies statutory authority to issue 
such regulations. When Congress enacts a new program statute, it typically 
does not prescribe every detail of the statute’s implementation but leaves it 
to the administering agency to “fill in the gaps” by regulation. Chevron, 
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843–844 (1984); 
Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974). There are many reasons for this. It 
is often not possible to foresee in advance every detail that ought to be 
covered. In other cases, there may be a need for flexibility in 
implementation that is simply not practical to detail in the legislation. In 
many cases, Congress prefers to legislate a policy in terms of broad 
standards, leaving the details of implementation to the agency with 
program expertise. Finally, it is much easier for an agency to amend a 
regulation to reflect changing circumstances than it would be for Congress 
to have to go back and amend the basic legislation. Thus, agency legislative 
regulations have become an increasingly vital element of federal law. 

1. The Administrative The key statute governing the issuance of agency regulations is the 
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), originally enacted in 1946 and now 
Procedure Act 

codified in Title 5 of the United States Code, primarily sections 551–559 

2 Legislative or statutory regulations of this type have traditionally been called “statutory 
regulations,” as distinguished from “administrative regulations,” such as those issued under 
5 U.S.C. § 301. E.g., 21 Comp. Dec. 482 (1915). While the legislative/statutory versus 
administrative terminology may be convenient shorthand in some contexts, its significance 
has been largely superseded by the Administrative Procedure Act. 

Page 3-3 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

a. The Informal Rulemaking 
Process 
(administrative procedure) and 701–706 (judicial review).3 The APA deals 
with two broad categories of administrative action: rulemaking and 
adjudication. Our concern here is solely with the rulemaking portions. 

The APA uses the term “rule” rather than “regulation.” In the context of the 
APA, the issuance of a regulation is called “rulemaking.” The term “rule” is 
given a very broad definition in 5 U.S.C. § 551(4):

 “ ‘[R]ule’ means the whole or a part of an agency statement 
of general or particular applicability and future effect 
designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy 
or describing the organization, procedure, or practice 
requirements of an agency ….” 

It is apparent from this definition that a great many agency issuances, 
regardless of what the agency chooses to call them, are rules. 

The APA prescribes two types of rulemaking, which have come to be 
known as “formal” and “informal.” Formal rulemaking under the APA 
involves a trial-type hearing (witnesses, depositions, transcript, etc.) and is 
governed by 5 U.S.C. §§ 556 and 557. This more rigorous, and today 
relatively uncommon, procedure is required only where the governing 
statute requires that the proceeding be “on the record.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(c); 
United States v. Florida East Coast Railway Co., 410 U.S. 224 (1973). 

Most agency regulations are the product of informal rulemaking—the notice 
and comment procedures prescribed by 5 U.S.C. § 553. The first step in this 
process is the publication of a proposed regulation in the Federal Register. 
The Federal Register is a daily publication printed and distributed by the 
Government Printing Office. 44 U.S.C. § 1504.4 Publication of a document in 
the Federal Register constitutes legal notice of its contents. 44 U.S.C. 

3 For an excellent summary of the APA, together with a useful bibliography, see Federal 
Administrative Procedure Sourcebook (3rd ed. 2000), published by the American Bar 
Association’s Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice. The Sourcebook is 
particularly useful because it reprints in full the 1947 Attorney General’s Manual on the 
Administrative Procedure Act, which has been called the government’s “most authoritative 
interpretation of the APA.” Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 218 
(1988) (Justice Scalia, concurring). 

4 Indispensable though it may be, the Federal Register has been termed “voluminous and 
dull.” Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 387 (1947) (Justice Jackson, 
dissenting). 

Page 3-4 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

§ 1507; Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380 (1947); 
63 Comp. Gen. 293 (1984); B-242329.2, Mar. 12, 1991.5 

The agency then allows a period of time during which interested parties 
may participate in the process, usually by submitting written comments, 
although oral presentations are sometimes permitted. Next, the agency 
considers and evaluates the comments submitted, and determines the 
content of the final regulation, which is also published in the Federal 
Register, generally at least 30 days prior to its effective date. 5 U.S.C. 
§§ 553(b)–(d). 

The agency is also required to publish a “concise general statement” of the 
basis and purpose of the regulation. 5 U.S.C. § 553(c). This is commonly 
known as the preamble, the substance of which appears in the Federal 
Register under the heading “Supplementary Information.” 

The preamble is extremely important since it is the primary means for a 
reviewing court to evaluate compliance with section 553. The courts have 
cautioned not to read the terms “concise” and “general” too literally. 
Automotive Parts & Accessories Ass’n v. Boyd, 407 F.2d 330, 338 (D.C. Cir. 
1968). Rather, the preamble must be adequate—

 “to respond in a reasoned manner to the comments 
received, to explain how the agency resolved any significant 
problems raised by the comments, and to show how that 
resolution led the agency to the ultimate rule.” 

Rodway v. Department of Agriculture, 514 F.2d 809, 817 (D.C. Cir. 1975). 
See also Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, 567 F.2d 9, 36 (D.C. Cir.), cert. 
denied, 434 U.S. 829 (1977); Automotive Parts, 407 F.2d at 338. As one 
court stated, “the agencies do not have quite the prerogative of 
obscurantism reserved to the legislatures.” United States v. Nova Scotia 
Food Products Corp., 568 F.2d 240, 252 (2nd Cir. 1977). The preamble does 
not have to address every item included in the comments. Id.; Automotive 
Parts, 407 F.2d at 338. However, Professor Pierce cautions that, over time, 
the courts have come to focus increasing scrutiny on the preamble as the 
venue for agencies to demonstrate that their regulations are not “arbitrary 
and capricious”: 

5 Internet notice is not an acceptable substitute for publication in the Federal Register. 
Utility Solid Waste Activities Group v. EPA, 236 F.3d 749, 763 (D.C. Cir. 2001).

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

“No court today would uphold a major agency rule that 
incorporates only a ‘concise and general statement of basis 
and purpose.’ To have any reasonable prospect of obtaining 
judicial affirmance of a major rule, an agency must set forth 
the basis and purpose of the rule in a detailed statement, 
often several hundred pages long, in which the agency 
refers to the evidentiary basis for all factual predicates, 
explains its method of reasoning from factual predicates to 
the expected effects of the rule, relates the factual 
predicates and expected effects of the rule to each of the 
statutory goals or purposes the agency is required to further 
or to consider, responds to all major criticisms contained in 
the comments on its proposed rule, and explains why it has 
rejected at least some of the most plausible alternatives to 
the rule it has adopted. Failure to fulfill one of these 
judicially prescribed requirements of a ‘concise general 
statement of basis and purpose’ has become the most 
frequent basis for reversal of agency rules.” 

Richard J. Pierce, Jr.,Administrative Law Treatise, § 7.4 at 442 (4th ed. 
2000) (citations omitted). 

As discussed later in this section, Congress and the President also have 
increasingly imposed requirements governing the development of agency 
regulations that must be addressed in the preamble. 

The preamble normally accompanies publication of the final regulation, 
although this is not required as long as it is sufficiently close in time to 
make clear that it is in fact contemporaneous and not a “post hoc 
rationalization.” Action on Smoking & Health v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 
713 F.2d 795, 799 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Tabor v. Joint Board for Enrollment of 
Actuaries, 566 F.2d 705, 711 n. 14 (D.C. Cir. 1977). 

Apart from questions of judicial review, the preamble serves another highly 
important function. It provides, as its title in the Federal Register indicates, 
useful supplementary information. Viewed from this perspective, 

Page 3-6 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

the preamble serves much the same purpose with respect to a regulation as 
legislative history does with respect to a statute.6 

Codifications of agency regulations are issued in bound and permanent 
form in the Code of Federal Regulations. The “C.F.R.” is supplemented or 
republished at least once a year. 44 U.S.C. § 1510. Unfortunately, with rare 
exceptions, the preamble does not accompany the regulations into the 
C.F.R., but is found only in the original Federal Register issuance. The 

C.F.R. does, however, give the appropriate Federal Register citation. 
Regulations on the use of the Federal Register and the C.F.R. are found in 
1 C.F.R. ch. I. 
Agencies may supplement the APA procedures, but are not required to 
unless directed by statute. The Supreme Court has admonished that a court 
should:

 “not stray beyond the judicial province to explore the 
procedural format or to impose upon the agency its own 
notion of which procedures are ‘best’ or most likely to 
further some vague, undefined public good.” 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense 
Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 549 (1978). The Court repeated its caution the 
following year in Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 312–13 (1979). 

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in Home Box 
Office, Inc. v. FCC, provided the following summary of the APA’s informal 
rulemaking requirements:

 “The APA sets out three procedural requirements: notice of 
the proposed rulemaking, an opportunity for interested 
persons to comment, and ‘a concise general statement of 
(the) basis and purpose’ of the rules ultimately adopted…. 
As interpreted by recent decisions of this court, these 
procedural requirements are intended to assist judicial 
review as well as to provide fair treatment for persons 
affected by a rule…. To this end there must be an exchange 

6 The “legislative history” analogy may be extended to unpublished agency documents used 
in the preparation of a regulation, which may be relevant in resolving ambiguities in the 
regulation. See Deluxe Check Printers, Inc. v. United States, 5 Cl. Ct. 498, 500–01 (1984). 

Page 3-7 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

of views, information and criticism between interested 
persons and the agency…. Consequently, the notice 
required by the APA, or information subsequently supplied 
to the public, must disclose in detail the thinking that has 
animated the form of a proposed rule and the data upon 
which that rule is based…. Moreover, a dialogue is a two-
way street: the opportunity to comment is meaningless 
unless the agency responds to significant points raised by 
the public….” 

567 F.2d at 35–36 (emphasis added). 

In the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-648, 104 Stat. 
4969 (Nov. 29, 1990), codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 561–570a, Congress enacted a 
framework for agencies to consult with interested parties in the 
development of regulations.7 Under this legislation, a proposed regulation 
is drafted by a committee composed of representatives of the agency and 
other interested parties. An agency may use this procedure if it determines, 
among other things, that there are a limited number of identifiable interests 
that will be significantly affected by the regulation, and that there is a 
reasonable likelihood that a committee can reach a consensus without 
unreasonably delaying the rulemaking process. Once the proposed 
regulation is developed in this manner, it remains subject to the APA’s 
notice and comment requirements. The negotiated rulemaking procedure is 
optional; an agency’s decision to use or not use it is not subject to judicial 
review. Furthermore, use of the procedure does not entitle the regulation to 
any greater deference than it would otherwise receive. 5 U.S.C. § 570; see 
also Center for Law & Education v. United States Department of 
Education, 209 F. Supp. 2d 102, 106–107 (D.D.C. 2002). 

Whatever form they take, consultations with interested parties in the 
development of regulations cannot undercut the notice and comment 
procedures of the APA. The Comptroller General has found that an 
agreement to issue, with specified content, a regulation otherwise subject 
to the APA not only violates the APA but is invalid as contrary to public 

7 Congress originally provided, in section 5 of Public Law 101-648, for the Negotiated 
Rulemaking Act to expire 6 years after its date of enactment. However, the Administrative 
Dispute Resolution Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-320, § 11, 110 Stat. 3870, 3873–3874 (Oct. 19, 
1996), repealed section 5 and made the Act permanent. Public Law 104-320 also required the 
President to designate an agency or interagency committee to encourage and facilitate 
negotiated rulemaking.

b. Informal Rulemaking: When 
Required 
policy. B-212529, May 31, 1984. In effect, a promise to issue a regulation 
with specified content amounts to a promise to disregard any adverse 
public comments received, clearly a violation of the APA. Likewise, in USA 
Group Loan Services, Inc. v. Riley, 82 F.3d 708, 714 (7th Cir. 1996), the court 
held that agreements reached between interested parties and agency 
officials through consultations pursuant to the Negotiated Rulemaking Act 
are not legally binding, since to enforce them would “extinguish notice and 
comment rulemaking.” 

A great many things are required by one statute or another to be published 
in the Federal Register. One example is “substantive rules of general 
applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy 
or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the 
agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1)(D). Privacy Act notices are another example. 
5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(4). Other items required or authorized to be published in 
the Federal Register are specified in 44 U.S.C. § 1505. However, the mere 
requirement to publish something in the Federal Register is not, by itself, a 
requirement to use APA procedures. 

As a starting point, anything that falls within the definition of a “rule” in 
5 U.S.C. § 551(4) and for which formal rulemaking is not required, is 
subject to the informal rulemaking procedures of 5 U.S.C. § 553 unless 
exempt. This statement is not as encompassing as it may seem, since 
section 553 itself provides several very significant exemptions. These 
exemptions, according to a line of decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit, will be “narrowly construed and only 
reluctantly countenanced.” Utility Solid Waste Activities Group v. EPA, 
236 F.3d 749, 754 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Asiana Airlines v. Federal Aviation 
Administration, 134 F.3d 393, 396–397 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Tennessee Gas 
Pipeline Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 969 F.2d 1141, 
1144 (D.C. Cir. 1992); New Jersey Department of Environmental 
Protection v. EPA, 626 F.2d 1038, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 1980).8 Be that as it may, 
they appear in the statute and cannot be disregarded. For example, 
section 553 does not apply to matters “relating to agency management or 

8 In Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, the court held that the “good cause” exemption in 
section 553(b) does not allow an agency to forego notice and comment when correcting a 
technical error in a regulation. 236 F.3d at 754–55. Likewise, the court held that agencies 
have no “inherent power” to correct such technical errors outside of the APA procedures.

personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.” 
5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2). 

Several agencies have published in the Federal Register a statement 
committing themselves to follow APA procedures with respect to matters 
that would otherwise be exempt from APA rulemaking. To the extent an 
agency has done this, it has voluntarily waived the benefit of the exemption 
and must follow the APA. E.g., Flagstaff Medical Center, Inc. v. Sullivan, 
962 F.2d 879, 886 (9th Cir. 1992); Alcaraz v. Block, 746 F.2d 593 (9th Cir. 
1984); Humana of South Carolina, Inc. v. Califano, 590 F.2d 1070 

(D.C. Cir. 1978); Rodway v. Department of Agriculture, 514 F.2d 809 (D.C. 
Cir. 1975); Abbs v. Sullivan, 756 F. Supp. 1172, 1188 (W.D. Wis. 1990); 
Herron v. Heckler, 576 F. Supp. 218 (N.D. Cal. 1983); Ngou v. Schweiker, 
535 F. Supp. 1214 (D. D.C. 1982); B-202568, Sept. 11, 1981.9 If an agency has 
not waived its exemption with respect to the specified matters, it need not 
follow the APA. California v. EPA, 689 F.2d 217 (D.C. Cir. 1982); City of 
Grand Rapids v. Richardson, 429 F. Supp. 1087 (W.D. Mich. 1977).10 
Another significant exemption, found in 5 U.S.C. § 553(b), is for 
“interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency 
organization, procedure, or practice.” Again, much litigation has ensued 
over whether a given regulation is “substantive” or “legislative,” in which 
event section 553 applies, or whether it is “interpretative,” in which event it 
does not. See, e.g., ANR Pipeline Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, 205 F.3d 403 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Caruso v. Blockbuster-Sony 
Music Entertainment Centre at the Waterfront, 193 F.3d 730 (3rd Cir. 1999); 
Paralyzed Veterans of America v. District of Columbia Arena L.P., 
117 F.3d 579 (D.C. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1003 (1998); Hoctor v. 
Department of Agriculture, 82 F.3d 165 (7th Cir. 1996); Health 

9 An agency does not, however, waive the benefit of APA exemptions simply by following an 
informal practice of voluntarily issuing otherwise exempt regulations through APA notice 
and comment procedures. Such a practice does not estop the agency from later invoking the 
exemption. See, e.g., Malek-Marzban v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 653 F.2d 
113 (4th Cir. 1981), discussed in section A.5 of this chapter. 

10 The exemption may be unavailable to particular agencies or programs, in whole or in part, 
by virtue of some other statute. For example, Congress has required the Department of 
Energy to follow the APA with respect to public property, loans, grants, or contracts, 
although the Department of Energy may waive notice and comment upon finding that strict 
compliance is likely to cause serious harm to the public health, safety, or welfare. 42 U.S.C. 
§§ 7191(b)(3), (e).

Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

Insurance Association of America, Inc. v. Shalala, 23 F.3d 412 (D.C. Cir. 
1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1147 (1995); American Mining Congress v. 
Mine Safety & Health Administration, 995 F.2d 1106 (D.C. Cir. 1993). 

The agency’s own characterization of a regulation is the “starting point” for 
the analysis. Professionals & Patients for Customized Care v. Shalala, 
56 F.3d 592, 596 (5th Cir. 1995); Metropolitan School District of Wayne 
Township, Marion County, Indiana v. Davila, 969 F.2d 485, 489 (7th Cir. 
1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 949 (1993). However, the agency’s 
characterization, while relevant, is not controlling. E.g., Davila; General 
Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus, 742 F.2d 1561 (D.C. Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 
471 U.S. 1074 (1985); American Frozen Food Institute, Inc. v. United 
States, 855 F. Supp. 388, 396 (C.I.T. 1994) (“The court must focus on the 
intended legal effect of the rule adopted, not the stated intent of the agency, 
to determine whether a rule is legislative or interpretive.”). 

The case law is not entirely consistent in the criteria used to determine 
whether a regulation is legislative or interpretive. Professor Pierce points 
to the District of Columbia Circuit’s decision in American Mining 
Congress, cited above, as an exemplary opinion that has been followed in 
several other circuits. Based largely on American Mining Congress, he 
recommends a test consisting of the following four questions: 

“(1) whether in the absence of the rule there would not be 
an adequate legislative basis for enforcement action or 
other agency action to confer benefits or ensure the 
performance of duties; 

(2) whether the legislative rule the agency is claiming to 
interpret is too vague or open-ended to support the 
interpretative rule; 
(3) whether the agency had explicitly invoked its legislative 
authority; or 
(4) whether the rule effectively amends a prior legislative 
rule.” 
Page 3-11 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

If the answer to any of these questions is yes, the rule is legislative rather 
than interpretative. Richard J. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise, § 6.4 
at 345 (4th ed. 2000).11 

While contests over the applicability of 5 U.S.C. § 553 frequently center on 
whether a regulation is legislative or interpretive, they can arise in many 
other contexts as well. Agency issuances may be called many things 
besides regulations: manuals, handbooks, instruction memoranda, etc. For 
purposes of determining applicability of the APA, the test is the substance 
and effect of the document rather than what the agency chooses to call it. 
E.g., Guardian Federal Savings & Loan Ass’n v. Federal Savings & Loan 
Insurance Corp., 589 F.2d 658, 666 (D.C. Cir. 1978); Herron v. Heckler, 
576 F. Supp. at 230; Saint Francis Memorial Hospital v. Weinberger, 413 F. 
Supp. 323, 327 (N.D. Cal. 1976). As we will discuss later in this section and 
in section B of this chapter, a functional analysis of the nature of these 
varied agency issuances not only dictates whether APA rulemaking 
procedures apply to them, but also determines their legal effects on the 
agency and outside parties as well as the extent to which courts will defer 
to any statutory interpretations that they embody. 

A regulation that is subject to 5 U.S.C. § 553, but which is issued in violation 
of the required procedures (including a nonexistent or inadequate 
preamble), stands an excellent chance of being invalidated. If so, the court 
may simply declare the regulation invalid, or “void.” E.g., Chemical 
Manufacturers Ass’n v. EPA, 28 F.3d 1259 (D.C. Cir. 1994); W.C. v. Bowen, 
807 F.2d 1502 (9th Cir. 1987); National Nutritional Foods Ass’n v. Mathews, 
557 F.2d 325, 338 (2nd Cir. 1977). In the alternative, the court may “vacate” 
the regulation and remand it to the agency for further proceedings in 
compliance with the APA, the extent of the further proceedings depending 
on the degree of noncompliance. E.g., Tabor v. Joint Board for Enrollment 
of Actuaries, 566 F.2d 705, 712 (D.C. Cir. 1977); Rodway v. Department of 
Agriculture, 514 F.2d 809, 817 (D.C. Cir. 1975); Detroit Edison Co. v. EPA, 
496 F.2d 244, 249 (6th Cir. 1974). 

11 Originally, Judge Stephen F. Williams, author of the American Mining Congress opinion, 
had included as an additional factor whether the rule was published in the C.F.R. However, 
Professor Pierce notes that Judge Williams greatly downplayed this factor in a subsequent 
opinion, noting that publication in the C.F.R. provides only a “snippet of evidence” that a 
rule is legislative. See Health Insurance Association of America, Inc., 23 F.3d at 423. 
Professor Pierce likewise discounts this factor since many interpretative rules are published 
in the C.F.R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise, § 6.4 at 344–345.

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

c. Additional Requirements 
for Rulemaking 
Increasingly, however, courts decline to vacate defective regulations on 
remand if they conclude that the agency can fairly readily correct the 
deficiency or if other considerations militate against nullifying the 
regulation. E.g., Idaho Farm Bureau Federation v. Babbitt, 58 F.3d 1392 
(9th Cir. 1995); American Medical Ass’n v. Reno, 57 F.3d 1129 (D.C. Cir. 
1995); Allied Signal, Inc. v. United States Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, 988 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1993); Independent United States 
Tanker Owners Committee v. Dole, 809 F.2d 847 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 
484 U.S. 819 (1987).12 Finally, a court may sever the invalid portions of a 
regulation on remand and leave intact the portions of the regulation that 
are not affected by the reversal. E.g., Davis County Solid Waste 
Management v. EPA, 108 F.3d 1454 (D.C. Cir. 1997). 

Within the context of APA rulemaking, Congress and the President have 
imposed a series of requirements that, in effect, regulate the regulators. For 
the most part, these requirements do not limit or otherwise affect the 
application of the APA.13 Rather, they seek primarily to ensure that certain 
consequences of agency regulations—such as costs, benefits, and other 
impacts—are fully considered and explained as part of the normal APA 
rulemaking process. 

The following are examples of some of these statutory requirements: 

• The National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq., 

requires agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement for 

“major Federal actions [including regulations] significantly affecting 

the quality of the human environment . . .” 

• The Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq., generally 
requires agencies to provide 60 days advance notice and obtain 

12 Three recent cases illustrate the considerations courts apply in deciding what remedy is 
appropriate in the case of regulations found to be defective: American Bioscience, Inc. v. 
Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, 1086 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (rule vacated); National Organization of 
Veterans’ Advocates, Inc. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 260 F.3d 1365, 1380–81 (Fed. Cir. 
2001) (rule not vacated); Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC, 280 F.3d 1027, 1047–53 (D.C. 
Cir. 2002) (one rule before the court vacated; another not vacated). 

13 There are, however, a number of so-called “hybrid rulemaking” statutes that do directly 
affect the APA by imposing additional (or different) substantive or procedural requirements 
for certain regulations. Some of these statutes are listed in Pierce, Administrative Law 
Treatise § 7.7 at 486. They include the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer 
Product Safety Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1977.

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

approval from the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs for regulations that involve the 
collection of information (including recordkeeping requirements) from 
10 or more nonfederal persons. The Act requires the agency to 
demonstrate that the collection of information is needed for 
performance of the agency’s functions and is not unnecessarily 
duplicative or burdensome. 

• The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601–612, requires agencies 
to conduct a “regulatory flexibility analysis” of proposed regulations 
that would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
of “small entities,” for example, small businesses. The analysis must 
consider, among other things, alternative ways of accomplishing the 
objective of the regulation in a way that would minimize its impact on 
small entities.14 

• Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, 2 U.S.C. §§ 1531–1538, 
generally requires agencies to prepare a written assessment of the 
impact of a regulation containing a federal mandate that may impose 
costs in excess of $100 million per year on state, local, or tribal 
governments, or on the private sector. 

• The so-called “Congressional Review Act” (CRA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 801–808, 
requires agencies to submit a report on each final rule to Congress and 
to the Comptroller General before the rule takes effect.15 The report is 
to include: a copy of the rule; a copy of any cost-benefit analysis of the 
rule; an explanation of any actions the agency has taken with respect to 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, 
discussed above; and any actions the agency has taken with respect to 
other relevant statutes or relevant executive orders (some of which are 
mentioned hereafter). The Act defines “major rules” as, among other 
things, those having an annual economic impact of $100 million or 

14 The Act, originally enacted in 1980, was amended in 1996 to make certain agency actions 
subject to judicial review. See 5 U.S.C. § 611. 

15 The CRA, 5 U.S.C. § 804(3), generally applies the broad APA definition of rule in 5 U.S.C. 
§ 551, and, therefore, is not limited to regulations that are subject to rulemaking under the 
APA. However, the CRA definition has its own exceptions, which are similar to some of the 
exemptions from rulemaking under the APA. For illustrative opinions on what agency 
issuances are or are not “rules” covered by the CRA, see B-292045, May 19, 2003, and 
B-281575, Jan. 20, 1999. The CRA also exempts from its coverage Federal Reserve System 
rules concerning monetary policy. 5 U.S.C. § 807. 

Page 3-14 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

more. 5 U.S.C. § 804(2). In the case of major rules, the agency generally 
must delay the effective date of the rule for 60 days pending 
congressional review. The Comptroller General must report to 
Congress on the agency’s compliance with applicable procedural 
requirements with respect to each major rule. The CRA further 
provides expedited procedures whereby Congress may reject a rule 
submitted to it by enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval.16 

Like Congress, Presidents have also imposed additional requirements 
governing various aspects of the rulemaking process, primarily by the use 
of executive orders. The following list is illustrative but by no means 
exhaustive:17 

• Executive Order No. 12630 (“Governmental Actions and Interference 
with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights”) prescribes policies 
and procedures to ensure that actions potentially impacting property 
rights in a manner requiring compensation under the Fifth Amendment 
are undertaken on a well-reasoned basis. 53 Fed. Reg. 8859 (Mar. 15, 
1988), 5 U.S.C. § 601 note. 

• Executive Order No. 12866 (“Regulatory Planning and Review”) 
establishes a number of procedural and analytical requirements 
governing agency rulemaking, including review of certain rules by the 
Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs. 58 Fed. Reg. 51735 (Sept. 30, 1993), as amended by 
Exec. Order No. 13258, 67 Fed. Reg. 9385 (Feb. 28, 2002), 5 U.S.C. § 601 
note. 

• Executive Order No. 12988 (“Civil Justice Reform”) promotes clear 
drafting of rules with respect to a number of legal issues in order to 
avoid burdening the courts with litigation over unnecessary 
ambiguities. For example, section 3(b)(2) of the order requires that 
rules specify in clear language what, if any, preemptive and retroactive 

16 The CRA’s joint resolution disapproval mechanism, which requires either the President’s 
signature or enactment over a presidential veto, has been used only once—to nullify, early in 
the George W. Bush Administration, an ergonomics regulation that was promulgated during 
the waning days of the Clinton Administration. See Pub. L. No. 107-5, 115 Stat. 7 (Mar. 20, 
2001). 

17 This list includes several executive orders currently in effect that apply to broad 
categories of agency regulations. Other executive orders (and statutes) govern regulations 
in more discrete subject areas.

effects the rules should be given. It also requires that rules provide a 
clear legal standard of conduct for affected parties. 61 Fed. Reg. 4729 
(Feb. 7, 1996), 28 U.S.C. § 519 note. 

• Executive Order No. 13132 (“Federalism”) sets policies and 
procedural requirements for regulations (and other agency actions) 
that have significant implications in relation to state and local 
governments. 64 Fed. Reg. 43255 (Aug. 10, 1999), 5 U.S.C. § 601 note. 

• Executive Order No. 13272 (“Proper Consideration of Small Entities 
in Agency Rulemaking”) establishes policies and procedures to 
facilitate compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, discussed 
above. 67 Fed. Reg. 53461 (Aug. 16, 2002), 5 U.S.C. § 601 note. 

2. Regulations May Not 
Exceed Statutory 
Authority 
It is a fundamental proposition that agency regulations are bound by the 
limits of the agency’s statutory and organic authority. An often quoted 
statement of the principle appears in the Supreme Court’s decision in 
Manhattan General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 
297 U.S. 129, 134 (1936):

 “The power of an administrative officer or board to 
administer a federal statute and to prescribe rules and 
regulations to that end is not the power to make law—for no 
such power can be delegated by Congress—but the power 
to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress 
as expressed by the statute. A regulation which does not do 
this, but operates to create a rule out of harmony with the 
statute, is a mere nullity.” 

This truism is reflected in a host of subsequent judicial and administrative 
decisions. E.g., Health Insurance Ass’n of America, Inc. v. Shalala, 23 F.3d 
412, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Killip v. Office of Personnel Management, 
991 F.2d 1564, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 1993), and cases cited. Thus, as the Killip 
court put it: 

“Though an agency may promulgate rules or regulations 
pursuant to authority granted by Congress, no such rule or 

Page 3-16 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

regulation can confer on the agency any greater authority 
than that conferred under the governing statute.”18 

To take an example of particular relevance to this publication, an agency 
may not expend public funds or incur a liability to do so based on a 
regulation, unless the regulation is implementing authority given to the 
agency by law. A regulation purporting to create a liability on the part of the 
government not supported by statutory authority is invalid and not binding 
on the government. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Co. v. United 
States, 55 Ct. Cl. 339 (1920); Holland-America Line v. United States, 53 Ct. 
Cl. 522 (1918), rev’d on other grounds, 254 U.S. 148 (1920); Illinois Central 
Railroad Co. v. United States, 52 Ct. Cl. 53 (1917). See also B-201054, 
Apr. 27, 1981, discussed below. In other words, the authority to obligate or 
expend public funds cannot be created by regulation; Congress must 
confer that basic authority. See also Harris v. Lynn, 555 F.2d 1357 (8th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 434 U.S. 927 (1977) (agency cannot extend benefits by 
regulation to a class of persons not included within the authorizing 
statute); Tullock v. State Highway Commission of Missouri, 507 F.2d 712, 
716–17 (8th Cir. 1974); Pender Peanut Corp. v. United States, 20 Cl. Ct. 447, 
455 (1990) (monetary penalty not authorized by statute cannot be imposed 
by regulation). 

Further illustrations may be found in the following decisions of the 
Comptroller General: 

• Where the program statute provided that federal grants “shall be” a 

specified percentage of project construction costs, the grantor agency 

could not issue regulations providing a mechanism for reducing the 

grants below the specified percentage. 53 Comp. Gen. 547 (1974). 

• Where a statute provided that administrative costs could not exceed a 
specified percentage of funds distributed to states under an allotment 

18 Obviously, this principle applies as well to agency issuances that do not even rise to the 
level of legislative regulations. If agency in-house publications are inconsistent with 
“governing statutes and regulations of the highest or higher dignity, e.g., regulations 
published in the Federal Register, they do not bind the government, and persons relying on 
them do so at their peril.” Fiorentino v. United States, 607 F.2d 963, 968 (Ct. Cl. 1979), cert. 
denied, 444 U.S. 1083 (1980). It is equally obvious that publishing an agency manual in 
accordance with the requirements of the APA cannot enhance the agency’s status so as to 
permit it to create substantive rights in violation of a statute. Hamlet v. United States, 
63 F.3d 1097, 1104–05 (Fed. Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1155 (1996).

formula, the administering agency could not amend its regulations to 
relieve states of liability for over expenditures or to raise the ceiling. 
B-178564, July 19, 1977, aff’d 57 Comp. Gen. 163 (1977). 

• Absent a clear statutory basis, an agency may not issue regulations 
establishing procedures to accept government liability or to forgive 
indebtedness based on what it deems to be fair or equitable. B-201054, 
supra. See also B-118653, July 15, 1969. 

See also B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003 (agencies should not incur obligations for 
food and light refreshments in reliance on a General Services 
Administration (GSA) travel regulation for which GSA has no authority); 

62 Comp. Gen. 116 (1983); 56 Comp. Gen. 943 (1977); B-201706, Mar. 17, 
1981. 

3. “Force and Effect of 
Law” 
A very long line of decisions holds that legislative or statutory regulations 
that are otherwise valid (i.e., within the bounds of the agency’s statutory 
authority) have the force and effect of law. E.g., 53 Comp. Gen. 364 (1973); 
43 Comp. Gen. 31 (1963); 37 Comp. Gen. 820 (1958); 33 Comp. Gen. 174 
(1953); 31 Comp. Gen. 193 (1951); 22 Comp. Gen. 895 (1943); 15 Comp. 
Gen. 869 (1936); 2 Comp. Gen. 342 (1922); 21 Comp. Dec. 482 (1915); 
B-248439 et al., Oct. 22, 1992. The thrust of these decisions is that the 
regulations are binding on all concerned, the issuing agency included, and 
that the agency cannot waive their application on an ad hoc or situational 
basis. 

In Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281 (1979), the Supreme Court 
provided detailed instruction as to when an agency regulation is entitled to 
the force and effect of law. The regulation “must have certain substantive 
characteristics and be the product of certain procedural requisites.” 
441 U.S. at 301. Specifically, the Court listed three tests that must be met: 

Page 3-18 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

• The regulation must be a substantive or legislative regulation affecting 
individual rights or obligations. Regulations that are interpretative only 
generally will not qualify.19 

• The regulation must be issued pursuant to, and subject to any 
limitations of, a statutory grant of authority. For purposes of this test, 
5 U.S.C. § 301 does not constitute a sufficient grant of authority. 
441 U.S. at 309–11. 

• The regulation must be issued in compliance with any procedural 
requirements imposed by Congress. This generally means the APA, 
unless the regulation falls within one of the exemptions previously 
discussed.20 

A regulation that meets these three tests will be given the force and effect 
of law. A regulation with the force and effect of law is “binding on courts in 
a manner akin to statutes” (Chrysler Corp., 441 U.S. at 308); it has the same 
legal effect “as if [it] had been enacted by Congress directly” (Federal Crop 
Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 385 (1947)); it “is as binding on a 
court as if it were part of the statute” (Joseph v. United States Civil Service 
Commission, 554 F.2d at 1153); it is “as binding on the courts as any statute 
enacted by Congress” (Production Tool Corp. v. Employment & Training 
Administration, 688 F.2d at 1165). See also Stinson v. United States, 508 
U.S. 36, 40–42 (1993). 

This is strong language. It cautions a reviewing court (or reviewing 
administrative agency) not to substitute its own judgment for that of the 

19 This of course is the same distinction discussed earlier with respect to the applicability of 
informal rulemaking procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). It has been 
pointed out that the term “legislative” is preferable to “substantive” because the latter can 
become confused with another distinction occasionally encountered, substantive versus 
procedural, which has little value in the present context. A legislative rule may be 
procedural, and an interpretative rule may be substantive in the sense that it does not deal 
with an issue of procedure. See Joseph v. United States Civil Service Commission, 554 F.2d 
1140, 1153 n.24 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Whichever term is used, the terminology can be misleading, 
as pointed out in Production Tool Corp. v. Employment & Training Administration, 
688 F.2d 1161, 1166 (7th Cir. 1982). Indeed, any attempt to force fit the wide range of agency 
issuances into neat categories by using such labels appears problematic. See generally 
Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise § 6.1 (“What is a Rule”) (4th ed. 2000). 

20 See, for example, B-226499, Apr. 1, 1987, holding that an unpublished notice purporting to 
amend a published regulation did not have the force and effect of law.

Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

agency, and not to invalidate a regulation merely because it would have 
interpreted the law differently. A regulation with the force and effect of law 
is controlling, subject to the “arbitrary and capricious” standard of the APA 
(5 U.S.C. § 706). Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425–26 (1977); Georgia 
Pacific Corp. v. Occupational Safety & Health Administration, 25 F.3d 
999, 1003–1004 (11th Cir. 1994); Metropolitan School District of Wayne 
Township, Marion County, Indiana v. Davila, 969 F.2d 485, 490 (7th Cir. 
1992); Guardian Federal Savings & Loan Ass’n v. Federal Savings & 
Loan Insurance Corp., 589 F.2d 658, 664–65 (D.C. Cir. 1978). 

A regulation will generally be found arbitrary and capricious—

 “if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not 
intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an 
important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for 
its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the 
agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a 
difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” 

Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass’n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile 
Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). 

For cases applying the Chrysler standards in determining that various 
regulations do or do not have the force and effect of law, see Qwest 
Communications International, Inc. v. FCC, 229 F.3d 1172, 1180 (D.C. Cir. 
2000); United States v. Alameda Gateway Ltd., 213 F.3d 1161, 1168 (9th Cir. 
2000); Horner v. Jeffrey, 823 F.2d 1521 (Fed. Cir. 1987); St. Mary’s Hospital, 
Inc. v. Harris, 604 F.2d 407 (5th Cir. 1979); Intermountain Forest Industry 
Ass’n v. Lyng, 683 F. Supp. 1330 (D. Wyo. 1988). 

4. Waiver of Regulations When you ask whether an agency can waive a regulation, you are really 
asking to what extent an agency is bound by its own regulations. If a given 
regulation binds the issuing agency, then the agency should not be able to 
grant ad hoc waivers, unless the governing statute has given it that 
authority and the agency has built it into the regulation. 
As discussed previously, a legislative regulation with the force and effect of 
law that was issued in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA) and the statute it implements clearly binds the issuing agency. The 
courts treat such a regulation essentially the same as a statute; thus, the 
agency cannot waive the regulation any more than it could waive the 

Page 3-20 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

statute. See section A.3 of this chapter and cases cited. The underlying 
philosophy—still valid—was expressed as follows in a 1958 GAO decision:

 “Regulations must contain a guide or standard alike to all 
individuals similarly situated, so that anyone interested may 
determine his own rights or exemptions thereunder. The 
administrative agency may not exercise discretion to 
enforce them against some and to refuse to enforce them 
against others.” 

37 Comp. Gen. 820, 821 (1958); see also B-243283.2, Sept. 27, 1991.21 

Sometimes legislative regulations or the statutes they implement do 
explicitly authorize “waivers” in certain circumstances. Here, of course, the 
waiver authority is an integral part of the underlying statutory or regulatory 
scheme. Accordingly, courts give effect to such waiver provisions and, 
indeed, they may even hold that an agency’s failure to consider or permit 
waiver is an abuse of discretion. However, the courts usually accord 
considerable deference to agency decisions on whether or not to grant 
discretionary waivers. For illustrative cases, see People of the State of New 
York & Public Service Commission of the State of New York v. FCC, 
267 F.3d 91 (2nd Cir. 2001); BellSouth Corporation v. FCC, 162 F.3d 1215 

(D.C. Cir. 1999); Rauenhorst v. United States Department of 
Transportation, 95 F.3d 715 (8th Cir. 1996). 
21 Of course, the government has “prosecutorial discretion” in deciding whether and how to 
pursue enforcement actions. See section B.4 of this chapter. This is different from the point 
being made in the text, which is that an agency cannot follow its regulation when it feels like 
it and not follow it when it does not feel like it. 

Page 3-21 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

While duly promulgated legislative regulations are almost always22 held to 
be binding absent a statutory or regulatory provision for waiver, the results 
are much less definitive when one enters the realm of “nonlegislative” 
regulations and other agency issuances. As discussed previously, these may 
include regulations that were published in the Federal Register under APA 
procedures but which are classified as interpretative. They also include a 
variety of non-Federal Register documents, such as manuals, handbooks, 
and internal agency products, some of which may not amount to 
“regulations” in any obvious sense. 

As a general proposition, nonlegislative regulations and other agency 
products do not impose legally binding obligations on the agencies that 
issue them any more than they impose legally enforceable rights or 
obligations on parties outside of the agency. This makes sense since, at 
least conceptually, nonlegislative products—in contrast to legislative 
regulations—by definition do not carry the force and effect of law. See 
generally Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise §§ 6.1 and 6.6. 

Nonlegislative regulations are particularly open to waiver where the 
regulations are for the primary benefit of the agency and failure to follow 
them would not adversely affect private parties. See, e.g., 60 Comp. 
Gen. 208, 210 (1981) (an agency could waive its internal guidelines 
prescribing the specific evidence required to demonstrate a grantee’s 
financial responsibility when the agency was otherwise satisfied that the 
government’s interests were adequately protected). An interesting variation 
occurred in Health Systems Agency of Oklahoma, Inc. v. Norman, 589 F.2d 
486 (10th Cir. 1978). An application for designation as a health systems 
agency was submitted to the then Department of Health, 

22 American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, 397 U.S. 532 (1970), is occasionally 
cited (and criticized) as an aberrant case in which the Supreme Court permitted an agency 
to ignore a legislative regulation. See Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise, 
§ 6.6 at 355 (4th ed. 2000). In American Farm Lines, the Court upheld the Interstate 
Commerce Commission’s grant of an application for temporary operating authority 
notwithstanding that the application did not include all the specific information items 
required by the agency’s regulations. However, it is not clear that the Court viewed the 
regulations as legislative or substantive in nature. Rather, the Court observed that the 
regulations were “not intended primarily to confer important procedural benefits upon 
individuals,” but were “mere aids to the exercise of the agency’s independent discretion.” 
397 U.S. at 538–39. The Court added that “there is no reason to exempt this case from the 
general principle that ‘[i]t is always within the discretion of a court or an administrative 
agency to relax or modify its procedural rules adopted for the orderly transaction of 
business before it when in a given case the ends of justice require it.’” Id. at 539 (citations 
omitted).

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

Education, and Welfare (HEW) 55 minutes past the deadline announced in 
the Federal Register, because the applicant’s representative overslept. 
HEW refused to accept the application. Finding that the deadline was not 
statutory, that its purpose was the orderly transaction of business, and that 
internal HEW guidelines permitted some discretion in waiving the deadline, 
the court held HEW’s refusal to be an abuse of discretion. 

On the other hand, there is a substantial body of case law holding that 
agencies are bound by certain nonlegislative rules. The most significant 
line of cases here—United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 
260 (1954), and its progeny—are discussed later in this chapter.23 These 
cases generally hold that agencies are bound by procedural requirements 
that they voluntarily impose on themselves when noncompliance with 
those requirements could prejudice individuals who are facing potential 
adverse action by the agency. 

Beyond the Accardi line of cases, courts seem to assess the binding effect 
(if any) of nonlegislative pronouncements more generally in terms of 
whether the pronouncement amounts to a “regulation” by which the agency 
“intends” to be bound. Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 
268 (1969); New England Tank Industries of New Hampshire, Inc. v. 
United States, 861 F.2d 685 (Fed. Cir. 1988); Fairington Apartments of 
Lafayette v. United States, 7 Cl. Ct. 647 (1985).24 Intent to be bound is 
ascertained by examining “the provision’s language, its context, and any 
available extrinsic evidence.” Chiron Corp. & PerSeptive Biosystems, 
Inc. v. National Transportation Safety Board, 198 F.3d 935, 944 (D.C. Cir. 
1999); Doe v. Hampton, 566 F.2d 265, 281 (D.C. Cir. 1977). The Comptroller 
General likewise has rejected a “form over substance” approach that turns 
on what an agency chooses to call its regulation. As stated in one GAO 
decision:

 “That the Bureau’s policy and procedure memoranda were 
never intended as ‘regulations’ is of no particular import 

23 See section C.4 of this chapter entitled “Regulations May Limit Discretion.” 

24 In this specific context, the answer to that question determines only whether the 
pronouncement is binding on the agency. It does not necessarily follow that something 
found to be a regulation should have been published under APA procedures or that it has the 
force and effect of law on parties outside the agency. These are separate (although related) 
questions that have their own tests and standards. 

Page 3-23 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

since whether or not they are such must be determined by 
their operative nature.” 

43 Comp. Gen. 31, 34 (1963). 

In assessing the binding nature of a nonlegislative regulation or other 
agency document, the language of the document itself is obviously an 
important starting point. Brock v. Cathedral Bluffs Shale Oil Co., 796 F.2d 
533, 537–38 (D.C. Cir. 1986); City of Williams v. Dombeck, 151 F. Supp. 2d 9 

(D.D.C. 2001). Other factors that may provide some indication of intent, 
although they are not dispositive, are whether the item has been published 
in the Federal Register (failure to do so suggests an intent that the item be 
nonbinding), and, more significantly, whether it has been published in the 
Code of Federal Regulations (under 44 U.S.C. § 1510, the C.F.R. is supposed 
to contain only documents with “legal effect”). Brock, 796 F.2d at 538–39. 
For further reading on this interesting and still evolving topic of what 
agency products have binding effect, see: William R. Anderson, Informal 
Agency Advice—Graphing the Critical Analysis, 54 Admin. L. Rev. 595 
(2002); Robert A. Anthony, “Interpretive” Rules, “Legislative” Rules and

Other Misconduct, 44 Admin. L. Rev. 653 (1992); Peter Raven-Hansen, 
Regulatory Estoppel: When Agencies Break Their Own ‘Laws,’ 64 Tex. 

L. Rev. 1 (1985); and Note, Violations by Agencies of Their Own 
Regulations, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 629 (1974). 
5. Amendment of 
Regulations 
It has long been recognized that the authority to issue regulations includes 
the authority to amend or revoke those regulations, at least prospectively. 
E.g., 21 Comp. Dec. 482, 484 (1915). This commonsense proposition is 
reflected in the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) definition of 
rulemaking as the “agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing 
a rule.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(5). An amendment to a regulation, like the parent 
regulation itself, must of course remain within the bounds of the agency’s 
statutory authority. B-221779, Mar. 24, 1986; B-202568, Sept. 11, 1981. 

As the APA’s definition of rulemaking makes clear, an amendment to a 
regulation is subject to the APA to the same extent as the parent regulation. 
Thus, if a regulation is required to follow the notice and comment 

Page 3-24 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

procedures of 5 U.S.C. § 553, an amendment or repeal of that regulation 
must generally follow the same procedures. Utility Solid Waste Activities 
Group v. EPA, 236 F.3d 749 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Consumer Energy Council of 
America v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 673 F.2d 425, 446 

(D.C. Cir. 1982), aff’d and cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1216 (1983); Detroit 
Edison Co. v. EPA, 496 F.2d 244 (6th Cir. 1974); Citibank, Federal Savings 
Bank v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 836 F. Supp. 3, 7 (D.D.C. 1993); 
B-221779, supra. 
If a regulation is subject to the APA’s informal rulemaking requirements, an 
unpublished agency document that purports to amend that regulation is 
invalid. Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, 236 F.3d at 754; Fiorentino v. 
United States, 607 F.2d 963, 968 (Ct. Cl. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1083 
(1980); 65 Comp. Gen. 439 (1986); B-226499, Apr. 1, 1987. 

It is possible to have a regulation subject to 5 U.S.C. § 553 with an 
amendment to that regulation that falls within one of the exemptions, in 
which event the amendment need not comply with the APA procedures. See 
Detroit Edison, 496 F.2d at 245, 249; B-202568, Sept. 11, 1981; 5 Op. Off. 
Legal Counsel 104 (1981). 

If a parent regulation is exempt from compliance with the APA but the 
agency has, without formally waiving the exemption, published it under 
APA procedures anyway, the voluntary compliance will not operate as a 
waiver. The agency may subsequently amend or repeal the regulation 
without following the APA. Baylor University Medical Center v. Heckler, 
758 F.2d 1052 (5th Cir. 1985); Malek-Marzban v. Immigration & 
Naturalization Service, 653 F.2d 113 (4th Cir. 1981); Washington Hospital 
Center v. Heckler, 581 F. Supp. 195 (D.D.C. 1984). Thus, in Malek-Marzban 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had issued a regulation 
without advance notice and comment, citing the “foreign affairs” exception 
from APA rulemaking requirements in 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(1). The court held 
that the agency was not bound to follow APA rulemaking procedures in this 
case even though it had voluntarily used such procedures for past 
regulations that were likewise subject to the foreign affairs exception: 

“We are not persuaded by the petitioners’ argument that the 
INS is estopped from asserting the foreign affairs exception 
because it has routinely complied with the APA rulemaking 
requirements in the past. Voluntarily submitting a policy 
decision involving a foreign affairs function to rulemaking 

Page 3-25 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

procedures is commendable, but it does not restrict an 
agency’s prerogatives when circumstances require swift 
action.” 

653 F.2d at 116.25 

6. Retroactivity A number of decisions have pointed out that amendments to regulations 
should be prospective only. E.g., 35 Comp. Gen. 187 (1955); 32 Comp. 
Gen. 315 (1953); 2 Comp. Gen. 342 (1922); 21 Comp. Dec. 482 (1915). The 
theory is that amendments should not affect rights or reliance accruing 
under the old regulation. While these are still crucial concerns, the law is 
not quite that simple. 
At the outset, it may be useful to understand the difference between 
“primary” and “secondary” retroactivity. Primary retroactivity changes the 
past legal consequences of past actions. Secondary retroactivity changes 
the future legal consequences of past actions. See generally Bowen v. 
Georgetown University Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 219–20 (1988) (Justice 
Scalia, concurring). 

To take a concrete illustration, when Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) 
were first authorized, most people could take an income tax deduction for 
amounts deposited into an IRA, up to a statutory ceiling. A few years later, 
Congress changed the law to eliminate the deduction for persons covered 
by certain types of retirement plans. This is an example of secondary 
retroactivity. Persons affected by the amendment could no longer deduct 
IRA contributions in the future, but the deductions they had taken in the 
past were not affected. (A purely prospective amendment would have 
applied only to new IRAs opened on or after the effective date of the 
amendment.) If Congress had attempted to invalidate deductions taken 
prior to the amendment, this would have been primary retroactivity. 

Although statutes are generally presumed to operate prospectively, 
Congress has the authority to make its laws retroactive (in both the 
primary and the secondary sense) subject, of course, to such constitutional 
limitations as due process, the impairment of contracts, and the prohibition 

25 Cases such as Malek-Marzban are distinguishable from those discussed previously in 
section A.1.b of this chapter. The section A.1.b cases involve situations in which an agency 
formally waived the benefit of APA exemptions for its regulations. 

Page 3-26 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

against “ex post facto” laws.26 The same cannot be said of agency 
regulations. 

There is no blanket prohibition on secondary retroactivity in agency 
regulations, subject to the “arbitrary or capricious” standard of the APA. 
See Bowen, 488 U.S. at 220; Celtronix Telemetry v. FCC, 272 F.3d 585 (D.C. 
Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 923 (2002); United States Airwaves, Inc. v. 
FCC, 232 F.3d 227 (D.C. Cir. 2000). With respect to primary retroactivity, 
however, the Bowen Court held that:

 “[A] statutory grant of legislative rulemaking authority will 
not, as a general matter, be understood to encompass the 
power to promulgate retroactive rules unless that power is 
conveyed by Congress in express terms.” 

Id. at 208. See also Orrego v. 833 West Buena Joint Venture, 943 F.2d 730, 
736 (7th Cir. 1991). 

The Bowen decision has been criticized, but it has never been overruled. 
See Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise § 6.7 (4th ed. 2000 & 
2003 Supp.). Thus, agencies generally cannot engage in rulemaking that 
involves primary retroactivity without specific statutory authority. There 
may be some room for exceptions even from the strict proscription of the 
Bowen rule, based on a balancing of interests in a particular case. See 
Bowen, 488 U.S. at 224–25; Citizens to Save Spencer County v. EPA, 
600 F.2d 844, 879–81 (D.C. Cir. 1979); Saint Francis Memorial Hospital v. 
Weinberger, 413 F. Supp. 323, 332–33 (N.D. Cal. 1976). Reduced stringency 
may also be appropriate in the case of a policy statement,27 or certain 
interpretative rules.28 Furthermore, rules that are held to merely clarify 
prior rules do not run afoul of the Bowen prohibition against retroactivity. 
See Clay v. Johnson, 264 F.3d 744 (7th Cir. 2001). 

26 See Chapter 2, section D.5 for a discussion of retroactivity with respect to statutes. 

27 E.g., Iowa Power & Light Co. v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 647 F.2d 796, 812 (8th Cir. 
1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 907 (1982). 

28 E.g., Farmers Telephone Co. v. FCC, 184 F.3d 1241 (10th Cir. 1999); Caterpillar Tractor 
Co. v. United States, 589 F.2d 1040, 1043 (Ct. Cl. 1978); but see Health Insurance Ass’n of 
America v. Shalala, 23 F.3d 412 (D.C. Cir. 1994). 

Page 3-27 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

The prohibition on retroactivity in rulemaking does not apply to 
adjudication. Bowen, 488 U.S. at 220–21 (concurring opinion). In the 
context of adjudication, retroactivity is measured against a standard of 
reasonableness and a balancing of interests. E.g., Laborers’ International 
Union of North America, AFL-CIO v. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp., 
26 F.3d 375 386–395 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 946 (1994); Tennessee 
Gas Pipeline Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 606 F.2d 
1094, 1116 n.77 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 920 (1980) and 
447 U.S. 922 (1980); NLRB v. Majestic Weaving Co., 355 F.2d 854 (2nd Cir. 
1966); Shell Oil Co. v. Kleppe, 426 F. Supp. 894, 908 (D. Colo. 1977). As 
suggested above, the extent to which a balancing approach might justify 
exceptions from the Bowen rule with respect to regulations remains to be 
determined. 

B. Agency 
Administrative 
Interpretations 
“There is more ado to interpret interpretations than to 
interpret the things, and more books upon books than upon 
all other subjects; we do nothing but comment upon one 
another.” 

Michel Eyquem, seigneur de Montaigne, Book iii, Chap. xiii, Of 
Experience. 

“We begin our analysis with the language of the exemption 
itself which, at the critical part, is as clear as mud.” 

In re Whalen, 73 B.R. 986, 988 (C.D. Ill. 1987). 

1. Interpretation of 
Statutes 
The interpretation of a statute, by regulation or otherwise, by the agency 
Congress has charged with the responsibility for administering it, is 
entitled to considerable weight. This principle is really a matter of common 
sense. An agency that works with a program from day to day develops an 
expertise that should not be lightly disregarded. Even when dealing with a 
new law, Congress does not entrust administration to a particular agency 
without reason, and this decision merits respect. This, in addition to 

Page 3-28 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

fundamental fairness, is why GAO considers it important to obtain agency 
comments wherever possible before rendering a decision.29 

In the often-cited case of Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16 (1965), the 
Supreme Court stated the principle this way: 

“When faced with a problem of statutory construction, this 
Court shows great deference to the interpretation given the 
statute by the officers or agency charged with its 
administration.” 

In what is now recognized as one of the key cases in determining how 
much “deference” is due an agency interpretation, Chevron, Inc. v. Natural 
Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), the Court formulated its 
approach to deference in terms of two questions. The first question is 
“whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.” Id. 
at 842. If it has, the agency must of course comply with clear congressional 
intent, and regulations to the contrary will be invalidated. Thus, before you 
ever get to questions of deference, it must first be determined that the 
regulation is not contrary to the statute, a question of delegated authority 
rather than deference. “If a court, employing traditional tools of statutory 
construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise 
question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.” Id. 
at 843 n.9. 

Once you cross this threshold, that is, once you determine that “the statute 
is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,” the question 
becomes “whether the agency’s answer is based on a permissible 
construction of the statute.” Id. at 843. The Court went on to say: 

“If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, 
there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to 
elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation. 

29 GAO’s desire for agency comments applies to audit reports as well as legal decisions. 
However, in view of the fundamental differences between the two products, the process 
differs. For GAO’s policy for audit reports, see U.S. General Accounting Office, GAO’s 
Agency Protocols, GAO-03-232SP (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 2, 2002). For a legal decision, 
GAO’s typical practice is to solicit the agency’s position on the legal issue(s) involved before 
a draft is ever written. A “development letter” is used to document facts, refine legal issues, 
and obtain the agency’s perspective on the law and its implementation. Accordingly, draft 
legal decisions are not submitted for comment. 

Page 3-29 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

Such legislative regulations are given controlling weight 
unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary 
to the statute. Sometimes the legislative delegation to an 
agency on a particular question is implicit rather than 
explicit. In such a case, a court may not substitute its own 
construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable 
interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.” 

Id. at 843–44 (footnotes omitted). 

Reiterating the traditional deference concept, the Court then said that the 
proper standard of review is not whether the agency’s construction is 
“inappropriate,” but merely whether it is “a reasonable one.” Id. at 844–45. 

When the agency’s interpretation is in the form of a regulation with the 
force and effect of law, the deference, as we have seen, is at its highest.30 
The agency’s position is entitled to Chevron deference and should be 
upheld unless it is arbitrary or capricious. There should be no question of 
substitution of judgment. If the agency position can be said to be 
reasonable or to have a rational basis within the statutory grant of 
authority, it should stand, even though the reviewing body finds some other 
position preferable. See Yellow Transportation, Inc. v. Michigan, 537 U.S. 
36 (2002); Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 
20–21 (2000); American Telephone & Telegraph Corp. v. Iowa Utility 
Board, 525 U.S. 366 (1999). Chevron deference is also given to authoritative 
agency positions in formal adjudication. See Immigration & 
Naturalization Service v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415 (1999) (holding 
that a Bureau of Indian Affairs statutory interpretation developed in caseby-
case formal adjudication should be accorded Chevron deference). For 
an extensive list of Supreme Court cases giving Chevron deference to 
agency statutory interpretations found in rulemaking or formal 
adjudication, see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 231 at n.12 
(2001). 

When the agency’s interpretation is in the form of an interpretative 
regulation, manual, handbook, etc.—anything short of a regulation with the

delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by 
regulation,’ and any ensuing regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally 
defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.” United 
States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 227 (2001), quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843–44.

force and effect of law or formal adjudication—the standard of review has 
traditionally been somewhat lessened, and it is here that the question of 
deference really comes into play. In the past, deference in this context has 
not been a fixed concept, but has been variable, depending on the interplay 
of several factors.31The Supreme Court explained the approach as follows 
in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944): 

“We consider that the rulings, interpretations and opinions 
of the Administrator under this Act, while not controlling 
upon the courts by reason of their authority [i.e., the 
statements in question were not regulations with the force 
and effect of law], do constitute a body of experience and 
informed judgment to which courts and litigants may 
properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment 
in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness 
evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its 
consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all 
those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking 
power to control.” 

Courts have found that the degree of weight to be given an agency 
administrative interpretation varies with several factors: 

• The nature and degree of expertise possessed by the agency. 
Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212 (2002); Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 
at 425 n.9; NLRB v. Oklahoma Fixture Co., 332 F.3d 1284 (10th Cir. 
2003); Schuetz v. Banc One Mortgage Corp., 292 F.3d 1004, 1012 (9th Cir. 
2002); Herman v. Springfield Massachusetts Area, Local 497, 
American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, 201 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000). 

31 The basic premise that an agency interpretation is entitled to some largely undefined 
degree of deference had consistently been espoused by the Supreme Court for well over a 
century and a half. See, e.g., Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 315 (1979); Batterton v. 
Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 424–25 (1977); General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 141 
(1976) (referring to the quoted passage from Skidmore, infra text, as the “most 
comprehensive statement of the role of interpretative rulings”); United States v. Philbrick, 
120 U.S. 52, 59 (1887); Hahn v. United States, 107 U.S. 402, 406 (1882); United States v. 
Pugh, 99 U.S. 265, 269 (1878); United States v. Moore, 95 U.S. 760, 763 (1877); Edwards’ 
Lessee v. Darby, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 206, 210 (1827).

• The duration and consistency of the interpretation. Good Samaritan 
Hospital v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 417 (1993); Chrysler Corp., 441 U.S. 
at 315; Batterton, 432 U.S. at 425 n.9; Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140;

692–93 (1994); B-284610, Mar. 3, 2000. While consistency may not 
always be a virtue, inconsistency will not help your case in court. See 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Arabian American 
Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244 (1991) (superseded by statute); Immigration & 
Naturalization Service v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 446 n.30 
(1987). 

• The soundness and thoroughness of reasoning underlying the position.

305 F.3d 1228, 1239 (11th Cir. 2002). 

• Evidence (or lack thereof) of congressional awareness of, and 
acquiescence in, the administrative position. United States v. 
American Trucking Ass’n, 310 U.S. 534, 549–50 (1940); Helvering v. 
Winmill, 305 U.S. 79, 82–3 (1938); Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v.

“[I]ncreasingly muddled” Supreme Court decisions on the scope of Chevron 
have left unclear the amount of deference due less formal pronouncements 
like interpretive rules and informal adjudications.32 In 2000, the Supreme 
Court appeared to resolve the issue of how much deference was due these 
less formal pronouncements. The Court distinguished less formal 
pronouncements that “lack the force of law” from statutory interpretations 
in legislative rules and formal adjudications, holding that actions other than 
orders that are issued through use of the notice and comment procedure are 
only entitled to Skidmore deference. Christensen v. Harris County, 
529 U.S. 576 (2000). However, the Supreme Court later retreated from this 
position in Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, holding that Chevron deference may

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

extend to statutory interpretations beyond those contained in legislative 
rules and adjudications where there is “a comparable congressional intent” 
to give such interpretations the force of law. 

More recent decisions further indicate that Chevron deference may extend 
beyond legislative rules and formal adjudications. Most notably, the 
Supreme Court observed in dicta in Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. at 222, 
that Mead Corp. “denied [any] suggestion” in Christensen that Chevron 
deference was limited to interpretations adopted through formal 
rulemaking. The Barnhart opinion went on to say that: 

“In this case, the interstitial nature of the legal question, the 
related expertise of the Agency, the importance of the 
question to the administration of the statute, the complexity 
of that administration, and the careful consideration the 
Agency has given the question over a long period of time all 
indicate that Chevron provides the appropriate legal lens 
through which to view the legality of the Agency 
interpretation here at issue.” 

Id. at 222.33 

At least one court has viewed this passage from Barnhart as suggesting a 
merger between Chevron deference and the Skidmore approach of varying 
the deference an agency receives based on a number of factors. See 
Krzalic v. Republic Title Co., 314 F.3d 875, 878–79 (7th Cir. 2002), cert. 
denied, ___ U.S. ___, 123 S. Ct. 2641 (2003). 

Circuit court decisions have added to the confusion. See James v. Von 
Zemenszky, 301 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (ignoring Barnhart factors 
because the agency statutory interpretation contained in a directive and 
handbook “f[e]ll within the class of informal agency interpretations that do 
not ordinarily merit Chevron deference”); Federal Election 
Commission v. National Rifle Ass’n, 254 F.3d 173 (D.C. Cir. 2001) 
(holding that Federal Election Committee (FEC) advisory opinions are 
entitled to Chevron deference); Matz v. Household International Tax 

33 Justice Scalia, in his separate opinion in Barnhart, and other commentators have 
criticized this statement as unnecessary and indicated that this statement may pose a new 
but imprecise test for the applicability of Chevron. See Barnhart, 535 U.S. at 226 (Scalia, J., 
concurring); Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise, at 8.

Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

Reduction Investment Plan, 265 F.3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001) (holding that an 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) statutory interpretation in an amicus brief, 
supported by an IRS Revenue Ruling and agency manual, was not entitled 
to Chevron deference); Klinedinst v. Swift Investments, Inc., 260 F.3d 
1251 (11th Cir. 2001) (holding that a Department of Labor handbook was not 
due Chevron deference); Teambank v. McClure, 279 F.3d 614 (8th Cir. 2001) 
(holding that Office of the Controller of the Currency informal 
adjudications are due Chevron deference); In re Sealed Case, 223 F.3d 775 

(D.C. Cir. 2000) (holding that FEC’s probable cause determinations are 
entitled to Chevron deference). As Professor Pierce notes: 
“After Mead, it is possible to know only that legislative rules 
and formal adjudications are always entitled to Chevron 
deference, while less formal pronouncements like 
interpretative rules and informal adjudications may or may 
not be entitled to Chevron deference. The deference due a 
less formal pronouncement seems to depend on the results 
of judicial application of an apparently open-ended list of 
factors that arguably qualify as ‘other indication[s] of a 
comparable congressional intent’ to give a particular type of 
agency pronouncement the force of law.”34 

For illustrations of how GAO has applied the deference principle in recent 
decisions, see: 

• 69 Comp. Gen. 274 (1990) (holding that the Defense Personnel Support 
Center’s long-standing interpretation of a Department of Defense 
appropriation act provision is entitled to deference). 

• B-290744, Sept. 13, 2002 (declining to apply Chevron or Skidmore 
deference to the Federal Highway Administration’s interpretation of a 
statute because the interpretation was not a reasonable construction of 
the statute). 

• B-288658, Nov. 30, 2001 (finding that neither Chevron nor Skidmore 
deference was due a Department of Agriculture interpretation of a 
statute because the agency interpretation did not derive from a 
rulemaking or adjudication and generally lacked “persuasive weight”). 

34 Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise, at 6–7. 

Page 3-34 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

• B-286800, Feb. 21, 2001 (finding that a Department of Defense 
interpretation of its regulation deserves great weight, that the agency’s 
interpretation of its regulations was reasonable, and viewing as 
significant the fact that the agency was consistent in its interpretation). 

• B-286661, Jan. 19, 2001 (declining to apply principle of deference to a 
Department of Energy statutory interpretation because it was not 
based on a reasonable interpretation of the statute). 

• B-286026, June 12, 2001 (applying Chevron deference to Office of 
Personnel Management’s guidance on the Government Employees 
Training Act). 

• B-285066.2, Aug. 9, 2000 (applying Chevron deference to Department of 
Housing and Urban Development’s interpretation of the Operation Safe 
Home appropriation as making funds available for gun buybacks). 

In the past, an agency’s litigating position was not accorded any deference 
unless that position was also expressed in the regulations, rulings, or 
administrative practice of the agency. Bowen v. Georgetown University 
Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 212 (1988). Some recent cases, however, have given 
some deference to an agency’s statutory interpretation developed only in 
the course of litigation. For example, in Brown v. United States, 327 F.3d 
1198 (D.C. Cir. 2003), the court did not reach the question of whether an 
agency’s statutory interpretation developed in the course of litigation was 
due Chevron deference, holding that the interpretation prevailed under 
Skidmore. See also Vernazza v. SEC, 327 F.3d 851 (9th Cir. 2003) (agency’s 
statutory interpretation advanced in enforcement action is not entitled to 
Chevron deference, but is entitled to Skidmore deference); Chao v. Russell 

P. Le Frois Builder, Inc., 291 F.3d 219 (2nd Cir. 2002) (holding that the 
Secretary of Labor’s statutory interpretation set forth only in litigation was 
not due Chevron deference, but merited Skidmore deference). 
The deference principle does not apply to an agency’s interpretation of a 
statute that is not part of its program or enabling legislation or is a statute 
of general applicability. See Adams v. SEC, 287 F.3d 183 (D.C. Cir. 2002); 
Contractor’s Sand & Gravel v. Federal Mine Safety & Health 
Commission, 199 F.3d 1335 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Association of Civilian 
Technicians v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 200 F.3d 590 (9th Cir. 
2000).

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

As noted above, a regulation with the force and effect of law merits 
Chevron deference. In this connection, it is necessary to elaborate 
somewhat on one of the tests in Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281 
(1979)—that the regulation be issued pursuant to a statutory grant of 
‘legislative’ (i.e., rulemaking) authority. How specific must the statutory 
delegation be? Chrysler itself provides somewhat conflicting signals. In 
one place, in the course of listing the three tests for determining if a 
regulation has the force and effect of law, the Court gives as an example the 
proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Chrysler, 
441 U.S. at 302–03. These are issued under the explicit delegation of 
15 U.S.C. § 78n, which authorizes the SEC to issue proxy rules. Yet in 
another place, the Court said: 

“This is not to say that any grant of legislative authority to a 
federal agency by Congress must be specific before 
regulations promulgated pursuant to it can be binding on 
courts in a manner akin to statutes. What is important is that 
the reviewing court reasonably be able to conclude that the 
grant of authority contemplates the regulations issued.” 

Chrysler, 441 U.S. at 308. 

While a court is certainly more likely to find that Chevron deference is due 
when the delegation of authority is specific, courts have also found that 
more general delegations are entitled to Chevron deference. See United 
States v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380 (1999) (holding that Chevron 
deference was due to a Customs Service regulation interpreting a statute 
that required the Court of International Trade to “reach the correct 
decision” in determining the proper classification of goods). A good 
example is the deference that courts have accorded to IRS regulations. The 
Secretary of the Treasury has general authority to “prescribe all needful 
rules and regulations” to administer the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 
§ 7805. In addition, various other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code 
authorize the issuance of regulations dealing with specific topics. 
Regulations issued under the general authority of 26 U.S.C. § 7805— 
statutory though they may be—are not given the force and effect of law, 
and have often been accorded less deference than regulations issued under 
one of the more specific provisions. See United States v. Vogel Fertilizer 
Co., 455 U.S. 16, 24 (1982); Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U.S. 247, 252– 
53 (1981); E. Norman Peterson Marital Trust v. Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue, 78 F.3d 795, 798 (2nd Cir. 1996); Nalle v. Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue, 997 F.2d 1134, 1138 (5th Cir. 1993); McDonald v.

(N.D. Cal. 1987); Lima Surgical Associates, Inc. v. United States, 20 Cl. Ct. 
674, 679 n.8 (1990). In some recent cases, however, courts have given 
Chevron deference to IRS regulations issued through notice and comment 
rulemaking under the general authority of section 7805. Atlantic Mutual 
Insurance Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 523 U.S. 382 (1998); 
Kikalos v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 190 F.3d 791 (7th Cir. 1999);

Tate & Lyle, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 87 F.3d 99 (3rd Cir. 
1996). 
We began this chapter by noting the increasing role of agency regulations in 
the overall scheme of federal law. We conclude this discussion with the 
observation that this enhanced role makes continued litigation on the 
issues we have outlined inevitable. The proliferation and complexity of 
case law perhaps lends credence to Professor Davis’s mild cynicism: 

“Unquestionably one of the most important factors in each 
decision on what weight to give an interpretative rule is the 
degree of judicial agreement or disagreement with the 
rule.”35 

2. Interpretation of 
Agency’s Own 
Regulations 
The principle of giving considerable deference to the administering 
agency’s interpretation of a statute applies at least with equal force to an 
agency's interpretation of its own regulations. The Udall v. Tallman Court, 
after making the statement quoted at the beginning of this section, went on 
to state that “[w]hen the construction of an administrative regulation rather 
than a statute is in issue, deference is even more clearly in order.” Udall v. 
Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16 (1965). 

Perhaps the strongest statement is found in a 1945 Supreme Court decision, 
Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 413–14: 

“Since this involves an interpretation of an administrative 
regulation a court must necessarily look to the 

35 2 Administrative Law Treatise § 7:13 (2nd ed. 1979). 

Page 3-37 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning 
of the words used is in doubt. The intention of Congress or 
the principles of the Constitution in some situations may be 
relevant in the first instance in choosing between various 
constructions. But the ultimate criterion is the 
administrative interpretation, which becomes of controlling 
weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the 
regulation.”36 

A good illustration of how all of this can work is found in B-222666, Jan. 11, 
1988. The Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) is responsible for 
issuing instructions and procedures for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) 
transactions. These appear in the Security Assistance Management Manual. 
A disagreement arose between DSAA and an Army operating command as 
to whether certain “reports of discrepancy,” representing charges for 
nonreceipt by customers, should be charged to the FMS trust fund (which 
would effectively pass the losses on to all FMS customers) or to Army 
appropriated funds. DSAA took the latter position. GAO reviewed the 
regulation in question, and found it far from clear on this point. The 
decision noted that “both of the conflicting interpretations in this case 
appear to have merit, and both derive support from portions of the 
regulation.” However, while the regulation may have been complex, the 
solution to the problem was fairly simple. DSAA wrote the regulation and 
GAO, citing the standard from the Bowles case, could not conclude that 
DSAA’s position was plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. 
Therefore, DSAA’s interpretation must prevail. See Shalala v. Guernsey 
Memorial Hospital, 514 U.S. 87 (1995); Thomas Jefferson University v. 
Shalala, 512 U.S. 504 (1994); Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36 (1993); 
Williams v. United States, 503 U.S. 193 (1992); Immigration & 
Naturalization Service v. Stanisic, 395 U.S. 62, 72 (1969); Navarro-
Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672 (5th Cir. 2003); Tozzi v. Department of 
Health & Human Services, 271 F.3d 301 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Legal

2001); 72 Comp. Gen. 241 (1993); 57 Comp. Gen. 347 (1978); 56 Comp. 
Gen. 160 (1976); B-279250 (May 26, 1998). See also McLean Hospital 
Corp. v. United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 1144 (1992) (holding that an agency 

36 While this determines the controlling interpretation, the propriety of that interpretation 
does not automatically follow. As the Court went on to caution in the very next sentence, 
“[t]he legality of the result reached by this process, of course, is quite a different matter.” 
Bowles, 325 U.S. at 414.

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

interpretation of a regulation is not entitled to deference when it violates 
the plain meaning of the regulation). 

Just as with the interpretation of statutes, inconsistency in the application 
of a regulation will significantly diminish the deference courts are likely to 
give the agency’s position. E.g., Western States Petroleum Ass’n v. EPA, 
87 F.3d 280 (9th Cir. 1996); Murphy v. United States, 22 Cl. Ct. 147, 154 
(1990). 

Several recent court decisions have held that agency interpretations of 
regulations are subject to some degree of deference even if they derive 
from “mere litigating positions” rather than formal rules or adjudications. 
See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997); Bigelow v. Department of 
Defense, 217 F.3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 971 (2001); 
National Wildlife Federation v. Browner, 127 F.3d 1126 (D.C. Cir. 1997); 
Bradberry v. Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation, Department of 
Labor, 117 F.3d 1361 (11th Cir. 1997). In this context, some courts have 
begun to refer to “Auer deference.” See Christensen v. Harris County, 
529 U.S. 576, 577 (2000); Moore v. Hannon Food Service, 317 F.3d 489, 494– 
95 (5th Cir. 2003); League of Wilderness Defenders/Blue Mountain 
Biodiversity Project v. Forsgren, 309 F.3d 1181, 1189 (9th Cir. 2002); 
Drake v. Federal Aviation Administration, 291 F.3d 59, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2002). 
See also Wells Fargo Bank of Texas v. James, 321 F.3d 488, 494 (5th Cir. 
2003) (“Auer v. Robbins offer[s] the standard to be used where an agency 
interprets its own regulation.”). In order to warrant Auer deference, the 
text of a regulation must fairly support the agency’s interpretation. See 
Christiansen, 529 U.S. at 577; Drake, 291 F.3d at 68; Wells Fargo Bank of 
Texas v. James, 321 F.3d at 494; Ashtabula County Medical Center v. 
Thompson, 191 F. Supp. 2d 884, 888 (N.D. Ohio 2002). Thus, Auer will not 
apply if the plain and unambiguous language of the regulation is at odds 
with the agency’s interpretation. In such a case, the agency’s 
“interpretation” really amounts to a de facto amendment of the regulation. 

In limited contexts, some recent court decisions have suggested that a 
somewhat lesser degree of deference than that in Bowles applies to agency 
interpretations of their regulations. For example, a series of decisions have 
applied a lesser degree of deference to ambiguous agency regulations. See 
Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, Department of 
Labor v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267 (1994); Mission Group 
Kansas, Inc. v. Riley, 146 F.3d 775 (10th Cir. 1998). Another line of circuit 
court decisions accords less deference to agency interpretations of 
regulations that impose penalties. See Walker Stone Co. v. Secretary of

1. Introduction Throughout this publication, the reader will encounter frequent references 
to administrative discretion. The concept of discretion implies choice or 
freedom of judgment, and appears in a variety of contexts. There are many 
things an agency does every day that involve making choices and 
exercising discretion. 
One type of discretion commonly occurs in the context of purpose 
availability. A decision may conclude that an appropriation is legally 
available for a particular expenditure if the agency, in its discretion, 
determines that the expenditure is a suitable means of accomplishing an 
authorized end. 
To put this another way, there is often more than one way to do something, 
and reasonable minds may differ as to which way is the best. The thing to 
keep in mind from the legal perspective is that if a given choice is within 
the actor’s legitimate range of discretion, then, whatever else it may be, it is 
not illegal. For example, as we will see in Chapter 4, an agency has 
discretionary authority to provide refreshments at award ceremonies under 
the Government Employees Incentive Awards Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 4501–4507. 
Agency A may choose to do so while agency B chooses not to. Under this 
type of discretion, agency B’s reasons are irrelevant. It may simply not want 
to spend the money. As a matter of law, both agencies are correct. 
Another type of discretion is implicit in all of the preceding discussions of 
agency regulations. This type occurs when Congress charges an agency 
with responsibility for implementing a program or statute, but leaves much 
of the detail to the agency. In the course of carrying out the program or

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

statute, the agency may be required to make various decisions, some of 
which may be expressly committed to agency discretion by the governing 
statute. Subject to certain fundamental concepts of administrative law, the 
agency is free to make those decisions in accordance with the sound 
exercise of discretion. See Chevron, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense 
Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843–844, 865–66 (1984). 

Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), action that is “committed 
to agency discretion by law” is not subject to judicial review. 5 U.S.C. 
§ 701(a)(2). As the Supreme Court has pointed out, this is a “very narrow 
exception” applicable in “rare instances” where, quoting from the APA’s 
legislative history, “statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given 
case there is no law to apply.” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. 
Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971). As noted, the “no law to apply” exception is 
uncommon, and most exercises of discretion will be found reviewable at 
least to some extent.37 See Drake v. Federal Aviation Administration, 
291 F.3d 59 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC, 280 F.3d 
1027 (D.C. Cir. 2002); City of Los Angeles v. Department of Commerce, 
307 F.3d 859 (9th Cir. 2002); Diebold v. United States, 947 F.2d 787 (6th Cir. 
1992). 

This being said, however, the presumption of reviewability is at its 
strongest in constitutional and habeas corpus matters. As Professor Pierce 
has noted, Overton Park is the “high water mark of the Court’s presumption 
of reviewability” and “[s]ubsequent decisions have both weakened the 
presumption where it continues to exist and narrowed the scope of the 
presumption.”38 For demonstrations of the weakening of the presumption 
of reviewability, see: 

• Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1 (2000) 

(debating whether there is a “presumption in favor of preenforcement 

review” or a presumption against preclusion of all review); 

37 However, agency inaction in declining to initiate enforcement or other regulatory action is 
subject to “a presumption of unreviewability,” although that presumption is rebuttable. 
Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985). Another obvious exception is if a statute explicitly 
precludes judicial review. See Jordan Hospital, Inc. v. Shalala, 276 F.3d 72 (1st Cir. 2002); 
National Coalition to Save Our Mall v. Norton, 269 F.3d 1092 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (construction 
of World War II memorial); Ismailov v. Reno, 263 F.3d 851 (8th Cir. 2001) (refusal to extend 
deadline for asylum application).

Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act revealed a congressional 
intent to preclude judicial review);

aircraft is committed to agency discretion by law and nonreviewable

time for any reason the Administrator considers appropriate”). 
At this point, we should emphasize that these introductory comments are 
largely oversimplified; they are intended merely to lay a foundation for a 
discussion of the principles that follow. 

2. Discretion Is Not 
Unlimited 
To say that an agency has freedom of choice in a given matter does not 
mean that there are no limits to that freedom. Discretion is not unbridled 
license. The decisions have frequently pointed out that discretion means 
legal discretion, not unlimited discretion. The point was stated as follows in 
18 Comp. Gen. 285, 292 (1938): 

“Generally, the Congress in making appropriations leaves 
largely to administrative discretion the choice of ways and 
means to accomplish the objects of the appropriation, but, 
of course, administrative discretion may not transcend the 
statutes, nor be exercised in conflict with law, nor for the 
accomplishment of purposes unauthorized by the 
appropriation ….”

Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

See also 72 Comp. Gen. 310, 311 (1993); 35 Comp. Gen. 615, 618 (1956); 
4 Comp. Gen. 19, 20 (1924); 7 Comp. Dec. 31 (1900); 5 Comp. Dec. 151 
(1898); B-253338, Nov. 23, 1993; B-130288, Feb. 27, 1957; B-49169, May 5, 
1945; A-24916, Nov. 5, 1928. 

In Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993), the Supreme Court concluded that, 
absent statutory elaboration, decisions about how to allocate funds within 
a lump-sum appropriation are committed to agency discretion by law. The 
Court noted that “the very point of a lump-sum appropriation is to give an 
agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its 
statutory responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or desirable 
way.” Id. at 191. Therefore, the Court held that judicial review of the 
agency’s decision to discontinue a program that had been previously 
funded through a lump-sum appropriation was precluded. (See Chapter 6 
for a more detailed discussion of the availability of appropriations.) See 
also 55 Comp. Gen. 307 (1975); B-278121, Nov. 7, 1997. 

Discretion must be exercised before the obligation is incurred. Approval 
after the fact is merely a condoning of what has already been done and 
does not constitute the exercise of discretion. 22 Comp. Gen. 1083 (1943); 
14 Comp. Gen. 698 (1935); A-57964, Jan. 30, 1935. (This point should not be 
confused with an agency’s occasional ability to ratify an otherwise 
unauthorized act. See, for example, the discussion of quantum meruit 
claims in Chapter 12 in Volume III of the second edition of Principles of 
Federal Appropriations Law.) 

One way to illustrate the concept of “legal discretion” is to visualize a 
person standing in the center of a circle. The circumference of the circle 
represents the limits of discretion, imposed either by law or by the difficult 
to define but nonetheless real concept of “public policy.”39 The person is 
free to move in any direction, to stay near the center or to venture close to 
the perimeter, even to brush against it, but must stay within the circle. If 
our actor crosses the line of the circumference, he has exceeded or, to use 
the legal term, “abused” his discretion. 

When GAO is performing its audit function, it may criticize a particular 
exercise of discretion as ill-conceived, inefficient, or perhaps wasteful. 

39See, e.g., L’Orange v. Medical Protective Co., 394 F.2d 57 (6th Cir. 1968) (court may 
invalidate an act as “contrary to public policy” in the sense of being “injurious to the public,” 
even where the act may not be expressly prohibited by statute). 

Page 3-43 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

From the legal standpoint, however, there is no illegal expenditure as long 
as the actor remains within the circle. We may also note that the size of the 
circle may vary. For example, as we will see in Chapter 14 (Volume III of 
the third edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations Law), 
government corporations frequently have a broader range of discretion 
than noncorporate agencies. 

When Congress wishes to confer discretion unrestrained by other law, its 
practice has been to include the words “notwithstanding the provisions of 
any other law” or similar language. 14 Comp. Gen. 578 (1935). Even this is 
not totally unfettered, however. For example, even this broad authority 
would not, at least as a general proposition, be sufficient to permit violation 
of the criminal laws. Also, agency power to act is always bound by the 
Constitution. Short of an amendment to the Constitution itself, no statute, 
however explicit, can be construed to authorize constitutional violations. 

In addition, depending on the context and circumstances, federal laws of 
general applicability may be found to remain applicable. See District of 
Columbia Federation of Civic Ass’ns v. Volpe, 459 F.2d 1231, 1265 (D.C. 
Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1030 (1972) (provision of Federal-Aid 
Highway Act directing construction of a bridge “notwithstanding any other 
provision of law” did not render inapplicable certain federal statutes 
regarding protection of historic sites); B-290125.2, B-290125.3, Dec. 18, 
2002 (finding that statutory directions governing certain aspects of an 
agency procurement “notwithstanding any other provision of law” do not 
override GAO’s bid protest jurisdiction under the Competition in 
Contracting Act). 

An example of a statute permitting action without regard to other laws is 
50 U.S.C. § 1431, under which the President may authorize an agency with 
national defense functions to enter into or modify contracts “without 
regard to other provisions of law relating to the making, performance, 
amendment, or modification of contracts, whenever he deems that such 
action would facilitate the national defense.” Provisions of this type are not 
self-executing but contemplate specific administrative determinations in 
advance of the proposed action. In other words, the “other provisions of 
law” continue to apply unless and until waived by an authorized official. 
35 Comp. Gen. 545 (1956). See also 22 Comp. Gen. 400 (1942).

3. Failure or Refusal to 
Exercise Discretion 
Where a particular action or decision is committed to agency discretion by 
law, the agency is under a legal duty to actually exercise that discretion. In 
one line of cases, the principle has evolved that the failure or refusal to 
exercise discretion committed by law to the agency is itself an abuse of 
discretion. As the following cases demonstrate, the fact of exercising 
discretion and the particular results of that exercise are two very different 
things. 

We start with a Supreme Court decision, Work v. United States ex rel. 
Rives, 267 U.S. 175 (1925). That case involved section 5 of the Dent Act, 
ch. 94, 40 Stat. 1272, 1274 (Mar. 2, 1919), under which Congress authorized 
the Secretary of the Interior to compensate a class of people who incurred 
losses in furnishing supplies or services to the government during World 
War I. The Secretary’s determinations on particular claims were to be final 
and conclusive. The statute “was a gratuity based on equitable and moral 
considerations” (id. at 181), vesting the Secretary with the ultimate power 
to determine which losses should be compensated. 

The plaintiff in Rives had sought mandamus to compel the Secretary to 
consider and allow a claim for a specific loss incurred as a result of the 
plaintiff’s obtaining a release from a contract to buy land. The Secretary 
had previously denied the claim because he had interpreted the statute as 
not embracing money spent on real estate. In holding that the Secretary 
had done all that was required by law, the Court cited and distinguished a 
line of cases— 

“in which a relator in mandamus has successfully sought to 
compel action by an officer who has discretion concededly 
conferred on him by law. The relator [plaintiff] in such cases 
does not ask for a decision any particular way but only that 
it be made one way or the other.” 

Id. at 184. 

The Secretary had made a decision on the claim, had articulated reasons 
for it, and had not exceeded the bounds of his statutory authority. That was 
enough. A court could compel the Secretary to actually exercise his 
discretion, that is, to act on a claim one way or the other, but could not 
compel him to exercise that discretion to achieve a particular result. 

Page 3-45 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

In Simpkins v. Davidson, 302 F. Supp. 456 (S.D. N.Y. 1969), the plaintiff 
sued to compel the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make a loan to 
him. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to submit an 
application, and to have the SBA consider that application and reach a 
decision on whether or not to grant the loan. However, he had no right to 
the loan itself, and the court could not compel the SBA to exercise its 
discretion to achieve a specific result. A very similar case on this point is 
Dubrow v. Small Business Administration, 345 F. Supp. 4 (C.D. Cal. 1972). 
See also B-226121-O.M., Feb. 9, 1988, citing and applying these cases. 

Another case involved a provision of the Farm and Rural Development Act 
that authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to forgo foreclosure on certain 
delinquent loans. The plaintiffs were a group of farmers who alleged that 
the Secretary had refused to consider their requests. The district court held 
that the Secretary was required to consider the requests. Matzke v. Block, 
542 F. Supp. 1107 (D. Kans. 1982). “When discretion is vested in an 
administrative agency, the refusal to exercise that discretion is itself an 
abuse of discretion.” Id. at 1115. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit 
affirmed that portion of the decision in Matzke v. Block, 732 F.2d 799 
(10th Cir. 1984), stating at page 801: 

“The word ‘may,’ the Secretary ‘may’ permit deferral, is, in 
our view, a reference to the discretion of the Secretary to 
grant the deferral upon a showing by a borrower. It does not 
mean as the Secretary argues that he has the discretion 
whether or not to implement the Act at all and not to 
consider any ‘requests’ under the statutory standards.” 

The Comptroller General applied these principles in 62 Comp. Gen. 641 
(1983). The Military Personnel and Civilian Employees’ Claims Act of 1964, 
31 U.S.C. § 3721, gives agencies discretionary authority to consider and 
settle certain employee personal property claims. An agency asked whether 
it had discretion to adopt a policy of refusing all claims submitted to it under 
the Act. No, the concept of administrative discretion does not extend that 
far, replied the Comptroller. While GAO would not purport to tell another 
agency which claims it should or should not consider—that part was 
discretionary—the decision noted that “a blanket refusal to consider all 
claims is, in our opinion, not the exercise of discretion” (id. at 643), and held 
“that an agency has the duty to actually exercise its discretion and that this 
duty is not satisfied by a policy of refusing to consider all claims” (id. 
at 645). Thus, for example, an agency would be within its discretion to 
make and announce a policy decision not to consider claims of certain 

Page 3-46 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

types, such as claims for stolen cash, or to impose monetary ceilings on 
certain types of property, or to establish a minimum amount for the filing of 
claims. What it cannot do is disregard the statute in its entirety. 

Additional cases illustrating this concept are California v. Settle, 708 F.2d 
1380 (9th Cir. 1983); Rockbridge v. Lincoln, 449 F.2d 567 (9th Cir. 1971); and 
Jacoby v. Schuman, 568 F. Supp. 843 (E.D. Mo. 1983). 

Several other cases, however, have suggested that the refusal of an agency 
to consider the exercise of its discretion will be subject to judicial review 
only where that refusal stems from a legal error by the agency (e.g., the 
agency wrongly concludes that it lacks jurisdiction or authority to exercise 
discretion) or where its refusal to exercise discretion can be tied to a 
statutory or constitutional violation. See Immigration & Naturalization 
Service v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 307 (2001); Gutierrez-Chavez v. 
Immigration & Naturalization Service, 298 F.3d 824 (9th Cir. 2002); 
Byrd v. Moore, 252 F. Supp. 2d 293 (W.D. N.C. 2003). 

4. Regulations May Limit 
Discretion 
By issuing regulations, an agency may voluntarily (and perhaps even 
inadvertently) limit its own discretion. A number of cases have held that an 
agency must comply with its own regulations, even if the action is 
discretionary by statute. 

The leading case is United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 
260 (1954). The Attorney General had been given statutory discretion to 
suspend the deportation of aliens under certain circumstances, and had, by 
regulation, given this discretion to the Board of Immigration Appeals. The 
Supreme Court held that, regardless of what the situation would have been 
if the regulations did not exist, the Board was required under the 
regulations to exercise its own judgment, and it was improper for the 
Attorney General to attempt to influence that judgment, in this case, by 
issuing a list of “unsavory characters” he wanted to have deported. “In 
short, as long as the regulations remain operative, the Attorney General 
denies himself the right to sidestep the Board or dictate its decision in any 
manner.” Id. at 267. Of course, the Attorney General could always amend 
his regulations, but an amendment could operate prospectively only. 

Awards under the Government Employees Incentive Awards Act, 5 U.S.C. 
§§ 4501–4507, as we will discuss in Chapter 4, are wholly discretionary. In a 
1982 decision, GAO reviewed Army regulations which provided that 
“awards will be granted” if certain specified criteria were met, and noted 

Page 3-47 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

that the Army had circumscribed its own discretion by committing itself to 
make an award if those conditions were met. B-202039, May 7, 1982. 
Reviewing Air Force regulations under similar legislation applicable to 
military personnel, the Court of Claims noted in Griffin v. United States, 
215 Ct. Cl. 710, 714 (1978): 

“Thus, we think that the Secretary may have originally had 
uncontrolled and unreviewable discretion … but as he 
published procedures and guidelines, as he received 
responsive suggestions, as he implemented them and 
through his subordinates passed upon compensation 
claims, we think by his choices he surrendered some of his 
discretion, and the legal possibility of abuse of discretion 
came into the picture.” 

Another group of cases in this category are those, previously noted in 
section A.1 of this chapter, in which an agency has waived an exemption 
from the APA and was held bound by that waiver. 

For additional authority on the proposition that an agency can, by 
regulation, restrict otherwise discretionary action, see United States v. 
Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974); Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535 (1959); 
Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363 (1957); United States v. Morgan, 193 F.3d 
252 (4th Cir. 1999); Clarry v. United States, 85 F.3d 1041 (2nd Cir. 1996); 
Waldron v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 17 F.3d 511, 519 
(2nd Cir. 1994); Montilla v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 
926 F.2d 162 (2nd Cir. 1991); 67 Comp. Gen. 471 (1988). 

Recent case law has recognized a number of limits, caveats, and nuances to 
the Accardi doctrine. While there are occasional exceptions, the doctrine 
generally will not be applied to bind an agency by its informal rules, 
policies, or other issuances that the court concludes are intended to 
provide internal guidance rather than to confer rights or benefits on the 
public. See Farrell v. Department of the Interior, 314 F.3d 584, 591 (Fed. 
Cir. 2002) (holding that agency statement that was not formally promulgated 
is not binding on the agency unless the agency intended to be bound by it). 
Even if a court concludes that a rule, or policy document, is binding on the 
agency under Accardi, the court may not invalidate the agency action if it 
concludes that the departure from the rule was nonprejudicial or “harmless 
error.” See Wilkinson v. Legal Services Corp., 27 F. Supp. 2d 32 (D.D.C. 
1998). In addition, the courts are very reluctant to apply Accardi to  
criminal proceedings or exercises of prosecutorial-type discretion such as 

Page 3-48 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

an agency decision not to initiate an enforcement action. See Carranza v. 
Immigration & Naturalization Service, 277 F.3d 65, 68 (1st Cir. 2002); 
United States v. Lee, 274 F.3d 485 (8th Cir. 2001); United States v. Shakir, 
113 F. Supp. 2d 1182 (M.D. Tenn. 2000); United States v. Briscoe, 69 F. 
Supp. 2d 738, 747 (D. V.I. 1999), aff’d, 234 F.3d 1266 (3rd Cir. 2000); 
Nichols v. Reno, 931 F. Supp. 748 (D. Colo. 1996); Walker v. Reno, 925 F. 
Supp. 124 (N.D. N.Y. 1995). 

5. Insufficient Funds Congress occasionally legislates in such a manner as to restrict its own 
subsequent funding options. An example is contract authority, described in 
Chapter 2. Another example is entitlement legislation not contingent upon 
the availability of appropriations. A well-known example here is social 
security benefits. Where legislation creates, or authorizes the 
administrative creation of, binding legal obligations without regard to the 
availability of appropriations, a funding shortfall may delay actual payment 
but does not authorize the administering agency to alter or reduce the 
“entitlement.” 
In the far more typical situation, however, Congress merely enacts a 
program and authorizes appropriations. For any number of reasons— 
budgetary constraints, changes in political climate, etc.—the actual funding 
may fall short of original expectations. What is an agency to do when it 
finds that it does not have enough money to accommodate an entire class 
of beneficiaries? Obviously, it can ask Congress for more. However, as any 
program administrator knows, asking and getting are two different things. 
If the agency cannot get additional funding and the program legislation fails 
to provide guidance, there is solid authority for the proposition that the 
agency may, within its discretion, establish reasonable classifications, 
priorities, and/or eligibility requirements, as long as it does so on a rational 
and consistent basis.40 

The concept was explained by the Supreme Court in Morton v. Ruiz, 
415 U.S. 199, 230–31 (1974), a case involving an assistance program 
administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA): 

40 Even under an entitlement program, an agency could presumably meet a funding shortfall 
by such measures as making prorated payments, but such actions would be only temporary 
pending receipt of sufficient funds to honor the underlying obligation. The recipient would 
remain legally entitled to the balance. 

Page 3-49 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

“[I]t does not necessarily follow that the Secretary is 
without power to create reasonable classifications and 
eligibility requirements in order to allocate the limited funds 
available to him for this purpose. [Citations omitted.] Thus, 
if there were only enough funds appropriated to provide 
meaningfully for 10,000 needy Indian beneficiaries and the 
entire class of eligible beneficiaries numbered 20,000, it 
would be incumbent upon the BIA to develop an eligibility 
standard to deal with this problem, and the standard, if 
rational and proper, might leave some of the class otherwise 
encompassed by the appropriation without benefits. But in 
such a case the agency must, at a minimum, let the standard 
be generally known so as to assure that it is being applied 
consistently and so as to avoid both the reality and the 
appearance of arbitrary denial of benefits to potential 
beneficiaries.” 

In Suwannee River Finance, Inc. v. United States, 7 Cl. Ct. 556 (1985), the 
plaintiff sued for construction differential subsidy payments under the 
Merchant Marine Act, administered by the Maritime Administration 
(MarAd). In response to a sudden and severe budget reduction, MarAd had 
cut off all subsidies for nonessential changes after a specified date, and had 
notified the plaintiff to that effect. Noting that “[a]fter this budget cut, 
MarAd obviously could no longer be as generous in paying subsidies as it 
had been before,” the court held MarAd’s approach to be “a logical, 
effective and time-honored method for allocating the burdens of shrinking 
resources” and well within its administrative discretion. Id. at 561. 

Another illustration is Ramah Navajo School Board v. Babbitt, 87 F.3d 1338 

(D.C. Cir. 1996), concerning the Secretary of the Interior’s allocation of 
funds to Indian tribes where an appropriations shortfall prevented the full 
allocation contemplated by the authorizing statute. The court held that the 
Secretary’s determination of how to allocate funds in the face of a funding 
shortfall was subject to judicial review, reversing the district court’s 
opinion that had relied on Lincoln v. Vigil, and that the Secretary had 
exceeded his statutory authority. For additional case law on this point, see 
Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Thompson, 311 F.3d 1054 (10th Cir. 2002); 
Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation v. Secretary, 
Department of Health & Human Services, 279 F.3d 660 (9th Cir. 2002); 
Babbitt v. Oglala Sioux Tribal Public Safety Department, 194 F.3d 1374 
(Fed. Cir. 1999).

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

An illustration from the Comptroller General’s decisions is B-202568, 
Sept. 11, 1981. Due to a severe drought in the summer of 1980, the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) found that its appropriation was not 
sufficient to meet demand under the SBA’s disaster loan program. Rather 
than treating applicants on a “first come, first served” basis, SBA amended 
its regulations to impose several new restrictions, including a ceiling of 
60 percent of actual physical loss. GAO reviewed SBA’s actions and found 
them completely within the agency’s administrative discretion. 

In a 1958 case, Congress had, by statute, directed the Interior Department to 
transfer $2.5 million from one appropriation to another. Congress had 
apparently been under the impression that the “donor” account contained a 
sufficient unobligated balance. The donor account in fact had ample funds if 
both obligated and unobligated funds were counted, but had an unobligated 
balance of only $1.3 million. The Interior Department was in an impossible 
position. It could not liquidate obligations in both accounts. If it transferred 
the full $2.5 million, some valid obligations under the donor appropriation 
would have to wait; if it transferred only the unobligated balance, it could 
not satisfy the entire obligation under the receiving account. First, GAO 
advised that the transfer would not violate the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 
§ 1341) since it was not only authorized but directed by statute. As to which 
obligation should be liquidated first—that is, which could be paid 
immediately and which would have to await a supplemental 
appropriation—the best answer GAO could give was that “the question is 
primarily for determination administratively.” In other words, there was no 
legally mandated priority, and all the agency could do was use its best 
judgment. GAO added, however, that it might be a good idea to first seek 
some form of congressional clarification. 38 Comp. Gen. 93 (1958). 

An early case, 22 Comp. Dec. 37 (1915), considered the concept of 
prorating. Congress had appropriated a specific sum for the payment of a 
designated class of claims against the Interior Department. When all claims 
were filed and determined, the total amount of the allowed claims 
exceeded the amount of the appropriation. The question was whether the 
amount appropriated could be prorated among the claimants. 

The Comptroller of the Treasury declined to approve the prorating, 
concluding that “action should be suspended until Congress shall declare its 
wishes by directing a pro rata payment …or by appropriating the additional 
amount necessary to full payment.” Id. at 40. If the decision was saying 
merely that the agency should attempt to secure additional funds—or at 
least explore the possibility—before taking administrative action that would

Chapter 3 
Agency Regulations and Administrative Discretion 

reduce payments to individual claimants, then it is consistent with the 
more recent case law and remains valid to that extent. If, however, it was 
suggesting that the agency lacked authority to prorate without specific 
congressional sanction, then it is clearly superseded by Morton v. Ruiz and 
the other cases previously cited. There is no apparent reason why prorating 
should not be one of the discretionary options available to the agency along 
with the other options discussed in the various cases. It has one advantage 
in that each claimant will receive at least something. 

A conceptually related situation is a funding shortfall in an appropriation 
used to fund a number of programs. Again, the agency must allocate its 
available funds in some reasonable fashion. Mandatory programs take 
precedence over discretionary ones.41 Within the group of mandatory 
programs, more specific requirements should be funded first, such as those 
with specific time schedules, with remaining funds then applied to the 
more general requirements. B-159993, Sept. 1, 1977; B-177806, Feb. 24, 1978 
(nondecision letter). These principles apply equally, of course, to the 
allocation of funds between mandatory and nonmandatory expenditures 
within a single-program appropriation. E.g., 61 Comp. Gen. 661, 664 (1982). 

Other cases recognizing an agency’s discretion in coping with funding 
shortfalls are City of Los Angeles v. Adams, 556 F.2d 40, 49–50 (D.C. Cir. 
1977), and McCarey v. McNamara, 390 F.2d 601 (3rd Cir. 1968). 

41 A “mandatory program,” as we use the term here, should not be confused with the 
entitlement programs previously noted. A mandatory program is simply one that Congress 
directs (rather than merely authorizes) the agency to conduct, but within the limits of 
available funding. Entitlement programs would take precedence over these mandatory 
programs.

Chapter 4 

Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

A. General Principles 
1. Introduction: 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1301(a) 
This chapter introduces the concept of the “availability” of appropriations. 
The decisions are often stated in terms of whether appropriated funds are 
or are not “legally available” for a given obligation or expenditure. This is 
simply another way of saying that a given item is or is not a legal 
expenditure. Whether appropriated funds are legally available for 
something depends on three things: 

1. the purpose of the obligation or expenditure must be authorized; 
2. the obligation must occur within the time limits applicable to the 
appropriation; and 
3. the obligation and expenditure must be within the amounts Congress 
has established. 
Thus, there are three elements to the concept of availability: purpose, time, 
and amount. All three must be observed for the obligation or expenditure 
to be legal. Availability as to time and amount will be covered in Chapters 5 
and 6. This chapter discusses availability as to purpose. 

One of the fundamental statutes dealing with the use of appropriated funds 
is 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a): 

“Appropriations shall be applied only to the objects for 
which the appropriations were made except as otherwise 
provided by law.” 

Simple, concise, and direct, this statute was originally enacted in 1809 
(ch. 28, § 1, 2 Stat. 535, (Mar. 3, 1809)) and is one of the cornerstones of 
congressional control over the federal purse. Because money cannot be 
paid from the Treasury except under an appropriation (U.S. Const. art. I, 
§ 9, cl. 7), and because an appropriation must be derived from an act of 
Congress, it is for Congress to determine the purposes for which an 
appropriation may be used. Simply stated, 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) says that 
public funds may be used only for the purpose or purposes for which they 
were appropriated. It prohibits charging authorized items to the wrong 
appropriation, and unauthorized items to any appropriation. Anything less 

Page 4-6 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

would render congressional control largely meaningless. An earlier 
Treasury Comptroller was of the opinion that the statute did not make any 
new law, but merely codified what was already required under the 
Appropriations Clause of the Constitution. 4 Lawrence, First Comp. 
Dec. 137, 142 (1883). 

Administrative applications of the purpose statute can be traced back 
almost to the time the statute was enacted. See, for example, 36 Comp. 
Gen. 621, 622 (1957), which quotes part of a decision dated February 21, 
1821. In an 1898 decision captioned “Misapplication of Appropriations,” the 
Comptroller of the Treasury talked about 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) in these 
terms: 

“It is difficult to see how a legislative prohibition could be 
expressed in stronger terms. The law is plain, and any 
disbursing officer disregards it at his peril.” 

4 Comp. Dec. 569, 570 (1898). 

The starting point in applying 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) is that, absent a clear 
indication to the contrary, the common meaning of the words in the 
appropriation act and the program legislation it funds governs the purposes 
to which the appropriation may be applied. To illustrate, the Comptroller 
General held in 41 Comp. Gen. 255 (1961) that an appropriation available 
for the “replacement” of state roads damaged by nearby federal dam 
construction could be used only to restore those roads to their former 
condition, not for improvements such as widening. Similarly, funds 
provided for the modification of existing dams for safety purposes could 
not be used to construct a new dam, even as part of an overall safety 
strategy. B-215782, Apr. 7, 1986. 

If a proposed use of funds is inconsistent with the statutory language, the 
expenditure is improper, even if it would result in substantial savings or 
other benefits to the government. Thus, while the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) could construct its own roads needed for access to 
FAA facilities, it could not contribute a share for the improvement of 
county-owned roads, even though the latter undertaking would have been 
much less expensive. B-143536, Aug. 15, 1960. See also 39 Comp. Gen. 388 
(1959). 

The limitation in 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) applies to revolving funds. GAO has 
held that revolving funds are appropriations, and, accordingly, that the  


Page 4-7 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

legal principles governing appropriations also apply to revolving funds. See 
B-247348, June 22, 1992; B-240914, Aug. 14, 1991. See also 63 Comp. 
Gen. 110, 112 (1983), and decisions cited therein. 

The concept of purpose permeates much of this publication. Thus, many of 
the rules discussed in Chapter 2 relate to purpose. For example: 

• A specific appropriation must be used to the exclusion of a more 
general appropriation that might otherwise have been viewed as 
available for the particular item. Chapter 2, section B.2. 

• Transfer between appropriations is prohibited without specific 
statutory authority, even where reimbursement is contemplated. 
Chapter 2, section B.3. 

It follows that deliberately charging the wrong appropriation for purposes 
of expediency or administrative convenience, with the expectation of 
rectifying the situation by a subsequent transfer from the right 
appropriation, violates 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a). 36 Comp. Gen. 386 (1956); 
26 Comp. Gen. 902, 906 (1947); 19 Comp. Gen. 395 (1939); 14 Comp. 
Gen. 103 (1934); B-248284.2, Sept. 1, 1992; B-104135, Aug. 2, 1951; B-97772, 
May 18, 1951.1 The fact that the expenditure would be authorized under 
some other appropriation is irrelevant. Charging the “wrong” 
appropriation, unless authorized by some statute such as 31 U.S.C. § 1534, 
violates the purpose statute. For several examples, see U.S. General 
Accounting Office, Improper Accounting for Costs of Architect of the 
Capitol Projects, PLRD-81-4 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 13, 1981). 

The transfer rule illustrates the close relationship between 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1301(a) and statutes relating to amount such as the Antideficiency Act, 
31 U.S.C. § 1341. An unauthorized transfer violates 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) 
because the transferred funds would be used for a purpose other than that 
for which they were originally appropriated. B-279886, Apr. 28, 1998; 
B-278121, Nov. 7, 1997; B-248284.2, Sept. 1, 1992. If the receiving 
appropriation is exceeded, the Antideficiency Act is also violated. Further, 
informal congressional approval of an unauthorized transfer of funds 
between appropriation accounts does not have the force and effect of law. 
B-278121 and B-248284.2, supra. 

1The situation dealt with in B-97772 and B-104135, advances of travel expenses to 
government employees serving as witnesses, is now authorized by 5 U.S.C. § 5751. 

Page 4-8 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Although every violation of 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) is not automatically a 
violation of the Antideficiency Act, and every violation of the 
Antideficiency Act is not automatically a violation of 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a), 
cases frequently involve elements of both. Thus, an expenditure in excess 
of an available appropriation violates both statutes. The reason the purpose 
statute is violated is that, unless the disbursing officer used personal funds, 
he or she must necessarily have used money appropriated for other 
purposes. 4 Comp. Dec. 314, 317 (1897). The relationship between purpose 
violations and the Antideficiency Act is explored further in Chapter 6. 

Brief mention should also be made of the axiom that an agency cannot do 
indirectly what it is not permitted to do directly. Thus, an agency cannot 
use the device of a contract, grant, or agreement to accomplish a purpose it 
could not do by direct expenditure. See 18 Comp. Gen. 285 (1938) (contract 
stipulation to pay wages in excess of Davis-Bacon Act rates held 
unauthorized). See also B-259499, Aug. 22, 1995 (agreement to provide 
personal services to agency that is not authorized to contract for personal 
services is not authorized under the Economy Act). 

Similarly, a grant of funds for unspecified purposes would be improper. 
55 Comp. Gen. 1059, 1062 (1976). Settlements cannot include benefits that 
the agency does not have authority to provide. See B-247348, June 22, 1992 
(broad authority to provide remedies for claims arising under Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act does not permit an agency to provide unauthorized 
benefits). See also B-239592, Aug. 23, 1991. 

2. Determining Authorized 
Purposes 
a. Statement of Purpose Where does one look to find the authorized purposes of an appropriation? 
The first place, of course, is the appropriation act itself and its legislative 
history. If the appropriation is general, it may also be necessary to consult 
the legislation authorizing the appropriation, if any, and the underlying 
program or organic legislation, together with their legislative histories. 
The actual language of the appropriation act is always of paramount 
importance in determining the purpose of an appropriation. Every 
appropriation has one or more purposes in the sense that Congress does 
not provide money for an agency to do with as it pleases, although purposes 

Page 4-9 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

are stated with varying degrees of specificity. One end of the spectrum is 
illustrated by this old private relief act: 

“[T]he Secretary of the Treasury …is hereby, authorized and 
directed to pay to George H. Lott, a citizen of Mississippi, 
the sum of one hundred forty-eight dollars ….” 

Act of March 23, 1896, ch. 71, 29 Stat. 711. 

This is one extreme. There is no need to look beyond the language of the 
appropriation; it was available to pay $148 to George H. Lott, and for 
absolutely nothing else. Language this specific leaves no room for 
administrative discretion. For example, the Comptroller General has held 
that language of this type does not authorize reimbursement to an agency 
where the agency erroneously paid the individual before the private act had 
been passed. In this situation, the purpose for which the appropriation was 
made had ceased to exist. B-151114, Aug. 26, 1964. 

At the other extreme, smaller agencies may receive only one appropriation. 
The purpose of the appropriation will be to enable the agency to carry out 
all of its various authorized functions. For example, the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission receives but a single appropriation “for necessary 
expenses of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.”2 To determine 
permissible expenditures under this type of appropriation, it would be 
necessary to examine all of the agency’s substantive legislation, in 
conjunction with the “necessary expense” doctrine discussed later in this 
chapter. 

Between the two extremes are many variations. A common form of 
appropriation funds a single program. For example, the Interior 
Department receives a separate appropriation to carry out the Payments in 
Lieu of Taxes Act (PILT), 31 U.S.C. § 6901–6904.3 While the appropriation is 
specific in the sense that it is limited to PILT payments and associated 

2 E.g., Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and 
Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, div. K, 117 Stat. 11, 474, 
506 (Feb. 20, 2003). 

3 E.g., Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003, Pub. L. 
No. 108-7, div. F, title I, 117 Stat. 11, 216, 218 (Feb. 20, 2003) (“For expenses necessary to 
implement the Act of October 20, 1976 . . ., $220,000,000, of which not to exceed $400,000 
shall be available for administrative expenses.”).

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

administrative expenses, it is nevertheless necessary to look beyond the 
appropriation language and examine the PILT statute to determine 
authorized expenditures. 

Once the purposes have been determined by examining the various pieces 
of legislation, 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) comes into play to restrict the use of the 
appropriation to these purposes only, together with one final generic 
category of payments—payments authorized under general legislation 
applicable to all or a defined group of agencies and not requiring specific 
appropriations. For example, legislation enacted in 1982 amended 12 U.S.C. 
§ 1770 to authorize federal agencies to provide various services, including 
telephone service, to employee credit unions. Pub. L. No. 97-320, § 515, 
96 Stat. 1469, 1530 (Oct. 15, 1982). Prior to this legislation, an agency would 
have violated 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) by providing telephone service to a credit 
union, even on a reimbursable basis, because this was not an authorized 
purpose under any agency appropriation. 60 Comp. Gen. 653 (1981). The 
1982 amendment made the providing of special services to credit unions an 
authorized agency function, and hence an authorized purpose, which it 
could fund from unrestricted general operating appropriations. 66 Comp. 
Gen. 356 (1987). Similarly, a recently enacted statute gives agencies the 
discretion to use appropriated funds to pay the expenses their employees 
incur for obtaining professional credentials. 5 U.S.C. § 5757(a). See also 
B-289219, Oct. 29, 2002. Prior to this legislation, agencies could not use 
appropriated funds to pay fees incurred by their employees in obtaining 
professional credentials. See, e.g., 47 Comp. Gen. 116 (1967). Other 
examples are interest payments under the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 
§§ 3901-3907) and administrative settlements less than $2,500 under the 
Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. §§ 2671 et seq.). 

b. Specific Purpose Stated in 
Appropriation Act 
Where an appropriation specifies the purpose for which the funds are to be 
used, 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) applies in its purest form to restrict the use of the 
funds to the specified purpose. For example, an appropriation for 
topographical surveys in the United States was not available for 
topographical surveys in Puerto Rico. 5 Comp. Dec. 493 (1899). Similarly, 
an appropriation to install an electrical generating plant in the 
customhouse building in Baltimore could not be used to install the plant in 
a nearby post office building, even though the plant would serve both 
buildings and thereby reduce operating expenses. 11 Comp. Dec. 724 
(1905). An appropriation for the extension and remodeling of the State 
Department building was not available to construct a pneumatic tube 
delivery system between the State Department and the White House. 
42 Comp. Gen. 226 (1962). In another example involving a line-item 

Page 4-11 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

appropriation for a grant project, because the funds were made available 
for a specific grantee in a specific amount to accomplish a specific 
purpose, the agency could not grant less than Congress has directed by 
using some of the appropriation to pay its administrative costs. 72 Comp. 
Gen. 317 (1993); 69 Comp. Gen. 660, 662 (1990). And, as noted previously, 
an appropriation for the “replacement” of state roads could not be used to 
make improvements on them. 41 Comp. Gen. 255 (1961). 

It is well settled, but warrants repeating, that even an expenditure that may 
be reasonably related to a general appropriation may not be paid out of that 
appropriation where the expenditure falls specifically within the scope of 
another appropriation. 63 Comp. Gen. 422 (1984); B-300325, Dec. 13, 2002; 
B-290005, July 1, 2002. It is also well settled that when two appropriations 
are available for the same purpose, the agency must select which to use, 
and that once it has made an election, the agency must continue to use the 
same appropriation for that purpose unless the agency, at the beginning of 
the fiscal year, informs Congress of its intent to change for the next fiscal 
year. B-272191, Nov. 4, 1997. See also, 68 Comp. Gen. 337 (1989); 59 Comp. 
Gen. 518 (1980). An exception to this requirement is when Congress 
specifically authorizes the use of two appropriation accounts. B-272191, 
supra (statutory language makes clear that Congress intended that the 
“funds appropriated to the Secretary [of the Army] for operation and 
maintenance” in the fiscal year 1993 Defense Appropriations Act are “[i]n 
addition to …the funds specifically appropriated for real property 
maintenance under the heading [RPM,D]” in that appropriation act). 

The following cases will further illustrate the interpretation and application 
of appropriation acts denoting a specific purpose to which the funds are to 
be dedicated. In each of the examples, the appropriation in question was 
the U.S. Forest Service’s appropriation for the construction and 
maintenance of “Forest Roads and Trails.” 

In 37 Comp. Gen. 472 (1958), the Forest Service sought to construct 
airstrips on land in or adjacent to national forests. The issue was the extent 
to which the costs could be charged to the Roads and Trails appropriation 
as opposed to other Forest Service appropriations such as “Forest 
Protection and Utilization.” At hearings before the appropriations 
committees, Forest Service officials had announced their intent to charge 
most of the landing fields to the Roads and Trails appropriation. The 
appropriation act in question provided that “appropriations available to the 
Forest Service for the current fiscal year shall be available for” construction 
of the landing fields up to a specified dollar amount, but the item was not 

Page 4-12 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

mentioned in any of the individual appropriations. GAO concluded that the 
proposal to indiscriminately charge the landing fields to Roads and Trails 
would violate 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a). The Roads and Trails appropriation 
could be used for only those landing fields that were directly connected 
with and necessary to accomplishing the purposes of that appropriation. 
Landing fields not directly connected with the purposes of the Roads and 
Trails appropriation, for example, airstrips needed to assist in firefighting 
in remote areas, had to be charged to the appropriation to which they were 
related, such as Forest Protection and Utilization. The mere mention of 
intent at the hearings was not sufficient to alter the availability of the 
appropriations. 

Later, in 53 Comp Gen. 328 (1973), the Comptroller General held that the 
Forest Roads and Trails appropriation could not be charged with the 
expense of closing roads or trails and returning them to their natural state, 
such activity being neither “construction” nor “maintenance.” 

Again, in B-164497(3), Feb. 6, 1979, GAO decided that the Forest Service 
could not use the Roads and Trails appropriation to maintain a part of a 
federally constructed scenic highway on Forest Service land in West 
Virginia, although the state was prevented from maintaining it because the 
scenic highway was closed to commercial traffic. The Roads and Trails 
account was improper to charge with the maintenance because the term 
“forest road” was statutorily defined as a service or access road “necessary 
for the protection, administration, and utilization of the [national forest] 
system and the use and development of its resources.” The highway, a 
scenic parkway reserved exclusively for recreational and passenger travel 
through a national forest, was not the type of forest road the appropriation 
was available to maintain. The decision further noted, however, that the 
Forest Protection and Utilization appropriation was somewhat broader and 
could be used for the contemplated maintenance. 

A 1955 case illustrates a type of expenditure that could properly be charged 
to the Roads and Trails account. Construction of a timber access road on a 
national forest uncovered a site of old Indian ruins. Since the road 
construction itself was properly chargeable to the Roads and Trails 
appropriation, the Forest Service could use the same appropriation to pay 
the cost of archaeological and exploratory work necessary to obtain and 
preserve historical data from the ruins before they were destroyed by the 

Page 4-13 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

construction. (Rerouting was apparently not possible.) B-125309, Dec. 6, 
1955.4 

In any case, an appropriation serves as a limitation, or more accurately, a 
series of limitations relating to time and amount in addition to purpose. In 
some situations, an appropriation is simultaneously a grant of authority. 
For example, 5 U.S.C. § 3109 authorizes agencies to procure the services of 
experts and consultants, but only “[w]hen authorized by an appropriation 
or other statute.” In contrast with the statute authorizing services for credit 
unions noted earlier, 5 U.S.C. § 3109 by itself does not authorize an agency 
to spend general operating appropriations to hire consultants. Unless an 
agency has received this authority somewhere in its permanent legislation, 
the hiring of consultants under section 3109 is an authorized purpose only 
if it is specified in the agency’s appropriation act. 

3. New or Additional 
Duties 
Appropriation acts tend to be bunched at certain times of the year while 
substantive legislation may be enacted any time. A frequently recurring 
situation is where a statute is passed imposing new duties on an agency but 
not providing any additional appropriations. The question is whether 
implementation of the new statute must wait until additional funds are 
appropriated, or whether the agency can use its existing appropriations to 
carry out the new function, either pending receipt of further funding 
through the normal budget process or in the absence of additional 
appropriations (assuming in either case the absence of contrary 
congressional intent). 

The rule is that existing agency appropriations that generally cover the type 
of expenditures involved are available to defray the expenses of new or 
additional duties imposed by proper legal authority. The test for availability 
is whether the duties imposed by the new law bear a sufficient relationship 
to the purposes for which the previously enacted appropriation was made 
so as to justify the use of that appropriation for the new duties. 

For example, in the earliest published decision cited for the rule, the 
Comptroller General held that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
could use its general operating appropriation for fiscal year 1936 to 
 


4 The protection of archaeological data is now provided by statute. See 16 U.S.C.§ 469a-1 and 
the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, 16 U.S.C. §§ 470aa et seq.

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

perform additional duties imposed on it by the later enacted Public Utility 
Holding Company Act of 1935 (49 Stat. 803 (Aug. 26, 1935)). 15 Comp. 
Gen. 167 (1935). 

Similarly, the Interior Department could use its 1979 “Departmental 
Management” appropriation to begin performing duties imposed by the 
Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978,5 and to provide 
reimbursable support costs for the Endangered Species Committee and 
Review Board created by the Endangered Species Act Amendments of 
1978.6 Both statutes were enacted after the Interior Department’s 1979 
appropriation. B-195007, July 15, 1980. 

The rule has also been applied to additional duties imposed by executive 
order. 32 Comp. Gen. 347 (1953); 30 Comp. Gen. 258 (1951). Additional 
cases are 30 Comp. Gen. 205 (1950); B-290011, Mar. 25, 2002; B-211306, 
June 6, 1983; B-153694, Oct. 23, 1964. 

A variation occurred in 54 Comp. Gen. 1093 (1975). The unexpended 
balance of a Commerce Department appropriation, which had been used to 
administer a loan guarantee program and to make collateral protection 
payments under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, 19 U.S.C. §§ 1901–1920 
(1970), was transferred to a similar but new program by the Trade Act of 
1974.7 The 1974 statute repealed the earlier provisions. This meant that the 
transferred funds could no longer be used for expenses under the 1962 
act—including payments on guarantee commitments—even though that 
was the purpose for which they were originally appropriated, unless the 
expenditures could also be viewed as relating to the Commerce 
Department’s functions under the 1974 act. Applying the rationale of the 
later-imposed duty cases, the Comptroller General concluded that the 
purposes of the two programs were sufficiently related so that the 
Commerce Department could continue to use the transferred funds to 
make collateral protection payments and to honor guarantees made under 
the 1962 act. 

A related question is the extent to which an agency may use current 
appropriations for preliminary administrative expenses in preparation for

implementing a new law, prior to the receipt of substantive appropriations 
for the new program. Again, the appropriation is available provided it is 
sufficiently broad to embrace expenditures of the type contemplated. Thus, 
the National Science Foundation could use its fiscal year 1967 
appropriations for preliminary expenses of implementing the National Sea 
Grant College and Program Act of 1966,8 enacted after the appropriation, 
since the purposes of the new act were basically similar to the purposes of 
the appropriation. 46 Comp. Gen. 604 (1967). The preliminary tasks in that 
case included such things as development of policies and plans, issuance of 
internal instructions, and the establishment of organizational units to 
administer the new program. 

Similarly, the Bureau of Land Management could use current 
appropriations to determine fair market value and to initiate negotiations 
with owners in connection with the acquisition of mineral interests under 
the Cranberry Wilderness Act,9 even though actual acquisitions could not 
be made until funding was provided in appropriation acts. B-211306, June 6, 
1983. See also B-153694, Oct. 23, 1964; B-153694, Sept. 2, 1964. 

Where Congress has not made a specific appropriation available to fund 
additional or new duties and an existing appropriation is used based upon a 
determination that the new duties bear a sufficient relationship to the 
purpose for which the existing appropriation was made, the agency may 
not reimburse the existing appropriation that was used once the new 
appropriation is available. 30 Comp. Gen. 258 (1951); B-290011, supra. The 
shifting of money from one appropriation to another in the absence of 
statutory authority is prohibited by 31 U.S.C. § 1532.10 Compare B-300673, 
July 3, 2003, where GAO concluded that the Chief Administrative Officer 
(CAO) for the House of Representatives was allowed to use the CAO fiscal 
year 2003 Salaries and Expenses appropriation to reimburse the House of 
Representatives Child Care Center revolving fund for certain payments 
incurred by the Center at the beginning of fiscal year 2003 during a period 
covered by a continuing resolution, before enactment of the fiscal year 2003 
appropriation. In this case, CAO’s fiscal year 2003 appropriation expressly

withdrawn from one appropriation account and credited to another …only when authorized 
by law.”

directed that it cover the Center director’s salary and employees’ training 
costs for fiscal year 2003 and thereafter. Under the plain meaning of the 
appropriation language, the CAO appropriation was the proper one to 
charge for all expenses incurred in fiscal year 2003. 

4. Termination of Program 
a. Termination Desired If Congress appropriates money to implement a program, can the agency 
use that money to terminate the program? (Expenses of terminating a 
program could include such things as contract termination costs and 
personnel reduction-in-force expenses.) If implementation of the program 
is mandatory, the answer is no. In 1973, for example, the administration 
attempted to terminate certain programs funded by the Office of Economic 
Opportunity (OEO), relying in part on the fact that it had not requested any 
funds for OEO for 1974. The programs in question were funded under a 
multiple year authorization that directed that the programs be carried out 
during the fiscal years covered by the authorization. The U.S. District Court 
for the District of Columbia held that funds appropriated to carry out the 
programs could not be used to terminate them. Local 2677, American 
Federation of Government Employees v. Phillips, 358 F. Supp. 60 (D.D.C. 
1973). The court cited 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) as one basis for its holding. Id. 
at 76 n.17. See also 63 Comp. Gen. 75, 78 (1983). 
Where the program is nonmandatory, the agency has more discretion, but 
there are still limits. In B-115398, Aug. 1, 1977, the Comptroller General 
advised that the Air Force could terminate B-1 bomber production, which 
had been funded under a lump-sum appropriation and was not mandated 
by any statute. Later cases have stated the rule that an agency may use 
funds appropriated for a program to terminate that program where (1) the 
program is nonmandatory and (2) the termination would not result in 
curtailment of the overall program to such an extent that it would no longer 
be consistent with the scheme of applicable program legislation. 61 Comp. 
Gen. 482 (1982) (Department of Energy could use funds appropriated for 
fossil energy research and development to terminate certain fossil energy 
programs); B-203074, Aug. 6, 1981. Several years earlier, GAO had held that 
the closing of all Public Health Service hospitals would exceed the Surgeon 
General’s discretionary authority because a major portion of the Public 
Health Service Act would effectively be inoperable without the Public 
Health Service hospital system. B-156510, Feb. 23, 1971; B-156510, June 7, 
1965.

The concepts are further illustrated in a series of cases involving the Clinch 
River Nuclear Breeder Reactor. In 1977, the administration proposed using 
funds appropriated for the design, development, construction, and 
operation of the reactor to terminate the project. Construction of a breeder 
reactor had been authorized, but not explicitly mandated, by statute. As 
contemplated by the program legislation, the Energy Research and 
Development Administration, the predecessor of the Department of 
Energy, had submitted program criteria for congressional approval. GAO 
reviewed the statutory scheme, found that the approved program criteria 
were “as much a part of [the authorizing statute] as if they were explicitly 
stated in the statutory language itself,” and concluded that use of program 
funds for termination was unauthorized. B-115398, June 23, 1977.11 Two 
subsequent opinions reached the same conclusion, supported further by a 
provision in a 1978 supplemental appropriation act that specifically 
earmarked funds for the reactor. B-164105, Mar. 10, 1978; B-164105, Dec. 5, 
1977. 

By 1983 the situation had changed. Congressional support for the reactor 
had eroded considerably, no funds were designated for it for fiscal year 
1984, and it became apparent that further funding for the project was 
unlikely. In light of these circumstances, GAO revisited the termination 
question and concluded that the Department of Energy now had a legal 
basis to use 1983 funds to terminate the project in accordance with the 
project justification data that provided for termination in the event of 
insufficient funds to permit effective continuation. 63 Comp. Gen. 75 
(1983). 

b. Reauthorization Pending Another variation occurs when an entity’s enabling legislation is set to 
expire and Congress shows signs of extending or reauthorizing the entity, 
but has not yet provided funds or authority to continue. For example, the 
U.S.Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) was 
statutorily authorized to give continuing attention to intergovernmental 
problems. In 1995, ACIR was statutorily terminated effective September 30, 
1996. About 2 months before ACIR was to terminate, Congress enacted 
legislation giving ACIR a new responsibility to provide research and a 
report under a contract with the National Gambling Impact Study 
Commission. Although Congress continued ACIR’s existence beyond fiscal 
year 1996 for the limited purpose of providing research for the Gambling 
11GAO reached this conclusion prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Immigration & 
Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983). 

Page 4-18 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Commission, Congress appropriated no funds for fiscal year 1997. ACIR 
had separate statutory authority, 42 U.S.C. § 4279, to receive and expend 
unrestricted contributions made to ACIR from state governments. In 
B-274855, Jan. 23, 1997, GAO held that this statute constituted an 
appropriation (a permanent, indefinite appropriation12) separate from 
ACIR’s annually enacted fiscal year appropriation, and that from October 1, 
1996, until such time as ACIR was awarded the research contract, ACIR 
could use its unconditional state government contributions. 

Another situation may occur when an entity’s authorizing legislation is set 
to terminate and Congress provides an appropriation but does not 
reauthorize the entity until months later. In 71 Comp. Gen. 378 (1992), the 

U.S.Commission on Civil Rights was set to terminate by operation of law 
on September 30, 1991. The Commission was not reauthorized until 
November 26, 1991. However, during the interim and prior to the expiration 
date, Congress provided the Commission with appropriations for fiscal 
year 1992. Once a termination or sunset provision for an entity becomes 
effective, the agency ceases to exist and no new obligations may be 
incurred after the termination date.13 However, when Congress desires to 
extend, amend, suspend, or repeal a statute, it can accomplish its purpose 
by including the requisite language in an appropriations or other act of 
Congress. After viewing the legislative actions, in their entirety, on the 
Commission’s reauthorization and appropriation bills, GAO determined 
that Congress clearly intended for the Commission to continue to operate 
after September 30, 1991. GAO held that the specific appropriation 
provided to the Commission served to suspend its termination until the 
Commission was reauthorized. 
B. The “Necessary 
Expense” Doctrine 
1. The Theory The preceding discussion establishes the primacy of 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) in 
any discussion of purpose availability. The next point to emphasize is that 
12 See Chapter 2 for a discussion of permanent, indefinite appropriations. 

13 71 Comp. Gen. at 380 n.7, citing inter alia B-182081, Jan. 26, 1977, aff’d upon 
reconsideration, B-182081, Feb. 14, 1979.

31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) does not require, nor would it be reasonably possible, 
that every item of expenditure be specified in the appropriation act. While 
the statute is strict, it is applied with reason. 

The spending agency has reasonable discretion in determining how to carry 
out the objects of the appropriation. This concept, known as the “necessary 
expense doctrine,” has been around almost as long as the statute itself. An 
early statement of the rule is contained in 6 Comp. Gen. 619, 621 (1927): 

“It is a well-settled rule of statutory construction that where 
an appropriation is made for a particular object, by 
implication it confers authority to incur expenses which are 
necessary or proper or incident to the proper execution of 
the object, unless there is another appropriation which 
makes more specific provision for such expenditures, or 
unless they are prohibited by law, or unless it is manifestly 
evident from various precedent appropriation acts that 
Congress has specifically legislated for certain expenses of 
the Government creating the implication that such 
expenditures should not be incurred except by its express 
authority.” 

The necessary expense rule is really a combination of two slightly different 
but closely related concepts: 

1. An appropriation made for a specific object is available for expenses 
necessarily incident to accomplishing that object unless prohibited by 
law or otherwise provided for. For example, an appropriation to erect a 
monument at the birthplace of George Washington could be used to 
construct an iron fence around the monument where administratively 
deemed necessary to protect the monument. 2 Comp. Dec. 492 (1896). 
Likewise, an appropriation to purchase bison for consumption covers 
the slaughtering and processing of the bison as well as the actual 
purchase. B-288658, Nov. 30, 2001. 
2. Appropriations, even for broad categories such as salaries, frequently 
use the term “necessary expenses.” As used in this context, the term 
refers to “current or running expenses of a miscellaneous character 
arising out of and directly related to the agency’s work.” 38 Comp. 
Gen. 758, 762 (1959); 4 Comp. Gen. 1063, 1065 (1925). 
Page 4-20 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Although the theory is identical in both situations, the difference is that 
expenditures in the second category relate to somewhat broader objects. 

The Comptroller General has never established a precise formula for 
determining the application of the necessary expense rule. In view of the 
vast differences among agencies, any such formula would almost certainly 
be unworkable. Rather, the determination must be made essentially on a 
case-by-case basis. 

In addition to recognizing the differences among agencies when applying 
the necessary expense rule, we act to maintain a vigorous body of case law 
responsive to the changing needs of government. In this regard, our 
decisions indicate a willingness to consider changes in societal 
expectations regarding what constitutes a necessary expense. This 
flexibility is evident, for example, in our analysis of whether an expenditure 
constitutes a personal or an official expense. As will be discussed more 
fully later in the chapter, use of appropriations for such an expenditure is 
determined by continually weighing the benefit to the agency, such as the 
recruitment and retention of a dynamic workforce and other 
considerations enabling efficient, effective, and responsible government. 
We recognize, however, that these factors can change over time. B-286026, 
June 12, 2001 (overruling GAO’s earlier decisions based on reassessment of 
the training opportunities afforded by examination review courses); 
B-280759, Nov. 5, 1998 (overruling GAO’s earlier decisions on the purchase 
of business cards). See also 71 Comp. Gen. 527 (1992) (eldercare is not a 
typical employee benefit provided to the nonfederal workforce and not one 
that the federal workforce should expect); B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003 (GAO 
explained it remained “willing to reexamine our case law” regarding light 
refreshments if it is shown to frustrate efficient, effective, and responsible 
government). 

When applying the necessary expense rule, an expenditure can be justified 
after meeting a three-part test: 

1. The expenditure must bear a logical relationship to the appropriation 
sought to be charged. In other words, it must make a direct 
contribution to carrying out either a specific appropriation or an 
authorized agency function for which more general appropriations are 
available. 
2. The expenditure must not be prohibited by law. 
Page 4-21 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

a. Relationship to the 
Appropriation 
3. The expenditure must not be otherwise provided for, that is, it must not 
be an item that falls within the scope of some other appropriation or 
statutory funding scheme. 
E.g., 63 Comp. Gen. 422, 427–28 (1984); B-240365.2, Mar. 14, 1996; 
B-230304, Mar. 18, 1988. 

The first test—the relationship of the expenditure to the appropriation—is 
the one that generates by far the lion’s share of questions. On the one hand, 
the rule does not require that a given expenditure be “necessary” in the 
strict sense that the object of the appropriation could not possibly be 
fulfilled without it. Thus, the expenditure does not have to be the only way 
to accomplish a given object, nor does it have to reflect GAO’s perception 
of the best way to do it. Yet on the other hand, it has to be more than merely 
desirable or even important. E.g., 34 Comp. Gen. 599 (1955); B-42439, 
July 8, 1944. An expenditure cannot be justified merely because some 
agency official thinks it is a good idea, nor can it be justified simply 
because it is a practice engaged in by private business. See B-288266, 
Jan. 27, 2003. 

The important thing is not the significance of the proposed expenditure 
itself or its value to the government or to some social purpose in abstract 
terms, but the extent to which it will contribute to accomplishing the 
purposes of the appropriation the agency wishes to charge. For example, 
the Forest Service can use its appropriation for “Forest Protection and 
Utilization” to buy plastic litterbags for use in a national forest. 50 Comp. 
Gen. 534 (1971). See also 72 Comp. Gen. 73 (1992) (the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) can purchase buttons promoting indoor air 
quality for its conference since the message conveyed is related to EPA’s 
mission); 71 Comp. Gen. 28 (1991) (the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can 
cover cost of its employees filing electronic tax returns because it trains 
employees); B-257488, Nov. 6, 1995 (the Food and Drug Administration is 
permitted to purchase “No Red Tape” buttons to promote employee 
efficiency and effectiveness and thereby the agency’s purpose). However, 
operating appropriations of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) are not available to pay IRS the taxes due on 
judgment proceeds recovered by EEOC in an enforcement action. While 
the payment would further a purpose of the IRS, it would not contribute to 
fulfilling the 

Page 4-22 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

purposes of the EEOC appropriation. 65 Comp. Gen. 800 (1986).14 See also 
70 Comp. Gen. 248 (1991) (purchasing T-shirts for Combined Federal 
Campaign (CFC) contributors is not permitted because T-shirts are not 
essential to achieving the authorized purpose of CFC). 

If the basic test is the relationship of the expenditure to the appropriation 
sought to be charged, it should be apparent that the “necessary expense” 
concept is a relative one. As stated in 65 Comp. Gen. 738, 740 (1986): 

“We have dealt with the concept of ‘necessary expenses’ in a 
vast number of decisions over the decades. If one lesson 
emerges, it is that the concept is a relative one: it is 
measured not by reference to an expenditure in a vacuum, 
but by assessing the relationship of the expenditure to the 
specific appropriation to be charged or, in the case of 
several programs funded by a lump-sum appropriation, to 
the specific program to be served. It should thus be 
apparent that an item that can be justified under one 
program or appropriation might be entirely inappropriate 
under another, depending on the circumstances and 
statutory authorities involved.” 

The evident difficulty in stating a precise rule emphasizes the role and 
importance of agency discretion. It is in the first instance up to the 
administrative agency to determine that a given item is reasonably 
necessary to accomplishing an authorized purpose. Once the agency makes 
this determination, GAO will normally not substitute its own judgment for 
that of the agency. In other words, the agency’s administrative 
determination of necessity will be given considerable deference. 

Generally, the interpretation of a statute by the agency that Congress has 
charged with the responsibility for administering it is entitled to 
considerable weight. This discretion, however, is not without limits. The 
agency’s interpretation must be reasonable and must be based on a 
permissible construction of the statute. United States v. Mead Corp., 
533 U.S. 218, 226–238 (2001); Chevron, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense 
Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). See also B-286661, Jan. 19, 2001 (expansive 

14 It should be noted, however, that settlement payments in discrimination suits could be 
paid from an agency’s general operating funds when the suit and settlement are incident to 
the agency’s operation. B-257334, June 30, 1995.

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

definition exceeds the bounds of the Privatization Act and violates the 
requirement of 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a)). 

The standard GAO uses in evaluating purpose availability is summarized in 
the following passage from B-223608, Dec. 19, 1988: 

“When we review an expenditure with reference to its 
availability for the purpose at issue, the question is not 
whether we would have exercised that discretion in the 
same manner. Rather, the question is whether the 
expenditure falls within the agency’s legitimate range of 
discretion, or whether its relationship to an authorized 
purpose or function is so attenuated as to take it beyond 
that range.” 

A decision on a “necessary expense” question therefore involves 

(1) analyzing the agency’s appropriations and other statutory authority to 
determine whether the purpose is authorized and (2) evaluating the 
adequacy of the administrative justification, to decide whether the agency 
has properly exercised, or exceeded, its discretion. 
The role of discretion in purpose availability is further complicated by the 
fact that not all federal establishments have the same range of discretion. 
For example, a government corporation with the authority to determine the 
character and necessity of its expenditures has, by virtue of its legal status, 
a broader measure of discretion than a “regular” agency. But even this 
discretion is not unlimited and is bound at least by considerations of sound 
public policy. See 14 Comp. Gen. 755 (1935), aff’d upon reconsideration, 
A-60467, June 24, 1936. 

Two decisions involving the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) will 
illustrate. In 1951, the Interior Department asked whether funds 
appropriated to BPA could be used to enter into a contract to conduct a 
survey to determine the feasibility of “artificial nucleation and cloud 
modification” (artificial rainmaking in English) for a portion of the 
Columbia River drainage basin. If the amount of rainfall during the dry 
season could be significantly increased by this method, the amount of 
marketable power for the region would be enhanced. Naturally, BPA did 
not have an appropriation specifically available for rainmaking. However, 
in view of BPA’s statutory role in the sale and disposition of electric power 
in the region, GAO concluded that the expenditure was authorized. 
B-104463, July 23, 1951. 

Page 4-24 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

The Interior Department then asked whether, assuming the survey results 
were favorable, BPA could contract with the rainmakers. GAO thought this 
was going too far and questioned whether BPA’s statutory authority to 
encourage the widest possible use of electric energy really contemplated 
artificial rainmaking. GAO emphasized that the expenditure would be 
improper for a department or agency with the “ordinary authority usually 
granted” to federal agencies. However, the legislative history of BPA’s 
enabling statute indicated that Congress intended that it have a degree of 
freedom similar to public corporations and that it be largely free from “the 
requirements and restrictions ordinarily applicable to the conduct of 
Government business.” Therefore, while the Comptroller General expressly 
refused to “approve” the rainmaking contract, he felt compelled to hold 
that BPA’s funds were legally available for it. B-105397, Sept. 21, 1951. 

For the typical federal department or agency, the range of discretion will be 
essentially the same, with variations in the kinds of things justifiable under 
the necessary expense umbrella stemming from program differences. For 
example, necessary expenses for an agency with law enforcement 
responsibilities may include items directly related to that authority, which 
would be inappropriate for agencies without law enforcement functions. 
Thus, the Immigration and Naturalization Service could use its Salaries and 
Expenses appropriation to purchase and install lights, automatic warning 
devices, and observation towers along the boundary between the United 
States and Mexico. 29 Comp. Gen. 419 (1950). See also 7 Comp. Dec. 712 
(1901). Similarly, in B-204486, Jan. 19, 1982, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation could buy insurance on an undercover business not so much 
to insure the property, but to enhance the credibility of the operation. 

The procurement of evidence is also authorized as a necessary expense for 
an agency with law enforcement responsibilities. For example, Forest 
Service appropriations could be used to pay towing and storage charges for 
a truck seized as evidence of criminal activities in a national forest. 
B-186365, Mar. 8, 1977. See also 27 Comp. Gen. 516 (1948); 26 Comp. 
Dec. 780, 783 (1920); B-56866, Apr. 22, 1946. Also, the Customs Service 
could use its operating appropriations to cover the cost of extending its 
psychological assessment and referral services to its employees’ family 
members adversely affected by work-related incidents arising from law 
enforcement activities involving death or serious injury to its employee in 
the line of duty. B-270446, Feb. 11, 1997. 

Cases involving fairs and expositions provide further illustration. For the 
most part, when Congress desires federal participation in fairs or 

Page 4-25 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

expositions, it has been authorized by specific legislation. See, e.g., 
B-160493, Jan. 16, 1967 (legislation authorized federal participation in 
HemisFair 1968 in San Antonio). For another example, United States 
participation in the 1927 International Exposition in Seville, Spain, was 
specifically authorized by statute. See 10 Comp. Gen. 563, 564 (1931). 

However, specific statutory authority is not essential. If participation is 
directly connected with and is in furtherance of the purposes for which a 
particular appropriation has been made, and an appropriate administrative 
determination is made to that effect, the appropriation is available for the 
expenditure. B-290900, Mar. 18, 2003 (Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 
may use its appropriated funds to pay its share of the cost to produce a 
brochure that educates the public regarding lighthouse preservation 
because the brochure supports BLM in meeting its responsibility under its 
lighthouse preservation program); B-286457, Jan. 29, 2001 (demolition of 
old air traffic control tower that would obstruct the view from the new one 
is directly connected with and in furtherance of the construction of a new 
tower such that the demolition expenses are covered by Federal Aviation 
Administrations appropriation act for tower construction); B-280440, 
Feb. 26, 1999 (Immigration and Naturalization Service’s (INS) Salaries and 
Expenses appropriation is available to purchase medals to be worn by 
uniformed employees of the Border Patrol division of INS to commemorate 
the division’s 75th anniversary). See also 16 Comp. Gen. 53 (1936); 10 Comp. 
Gen. 282 (1930); 7 Comp. Gen. 357 (1927); 4 Comp. Gen. 457 (1924).15 
Authority to disseminate information will generally provide adequate 
justification. E.g., 7 Comp. Gen. 357; 4 Comp. Gen. 457. In addition, an 
agency may use appropriated funds to provide prizes to individuals to 
further the collection of information necessary to accomplish the agency’s 
statutory mandate.16 See, e.g., 70 Comp. Gen. 720 (1991); B-286536, Nov. 17, 
2000; B-230062, Dec. 22, 1988. 

In the absence of either statutory authority or an adequate justification 
under the necessary expense doctrine, the expenditure, like any other 
expenditure, is illegal. Thus, the Department of Housing and Urban 

15 A few early cases purporting to require specific authority, such as 2 Comp. Gen. 581 
(1923), must be regarded as implicitly modified by the later cases. 

16 GAO cases cautioned that when the award of prizes contained elements of a lottery, which 
may be prohibited by certain federal statutes, state laws, and regulations, the agency should 
consult with the Department of Justice to ensure that its proposal is not a prohibited lottery 
before spending any appropriated funds.

Development (HUD) had no authority to finance participation at a trade 
exhibition in the Soviet Union where HUD’s primary purpose was to 
enhance business opportunities for American companies. 68 Comp. 
Gen. 226 (1989); B-229732, Dec. 22, 1988. Regardless of whether it may or 
may not have been a good idea, commercial trade promotion is not one of 
the purposes for which Congress appropriates money to HUD. 

No discussion would be complete without some mention of the “marauding 
woodpecker” case. It appears that in 1951, marauding woodpeckers were 
causing considerable damage to government-owned transmission lines and 
the Southwestern Power Administration, Interior Department (Interior) 
wanted to buy guns with which to shoot the woodpeckers. Interior first 
went to the Army, but the Army advised that the types of guns and 
ammunition desired were not available, so Interior next came to GAO. The 
Comptroller General held that, if administratively determined to be 
necessary to protect the transmission lines, Interior could buy the guns and 
ammunition from the Southwestern Power Administration’s construction 
appropriation. The views of the woodpeckers were not solicited. B-105977, 
Dec. 3, 1951. Actually, this was not a totally novel issue. Several years 
earlier, GAO had approved the use of an Interior Department “maintenance 
of range improvements” appropriation for the control of coyotes, rodents, 
and other “predatory animals.” A-82570, Dec. 30, 1936. See also A-82570, 
B-120739, Aug. 21, 1957.17 

The second test under the necessary expense doctrine is that the 
expenditure must not be prohibited by law. As a general proposition, 
neither a necessary expense rationale nor the “necessary expense” language 

17 Everyone loves a good animal case. Unfortunately, the animals in most GAO decisions are 
dead or, as in the cases cited in the text, soon to become dead. Readers interested more in 
amusement than precedent might also check out 7 Comp. Gen. 304 (1927) (removal of a 
horse “found dead lying on its back in a hole”); 18 Comp. Gen. 109 (1938) (another dead 
horse); B-86211, July 26, 1949 (death of hogs allegedly caused by being fed garbage 
purchased from Navy installation; it was pointed out that other hogs had eaten the same 
government-furnished garbage and managed to survive);; B-47255, Feb. 6, 1945 (burial of 
three dead bulls); B-37205, Oct. 19, 1943 (mule fell off cable swing bridge); A-92649, Apr. 22, 
1938 (still another dead horse); B-115434-O.M., June 19, 1953 (agency borrowed a bull from 
another agency for breeding purposes, then had it slaughtered when it became vicious). 
These cases are being memorialized here because they will probably never be cited 
anywhere else. Insects do not escape either. See 34 Comp. Gen. 236 (1954) (grasshopper 
control in national forests). With the third edition of this volume, GAO is pleased to report 
our first fish case. See 70 Comp. Gen. 720 (1991) (rate of fish migration measured by 
fisherman returning government fish tags from fish presumed dead or to have at least had a 
very bad day).

in an appropriation act can be used to overcome a statutory prohibition. 
E.g., B-277905, Mar. 17, 1998 (expenditure for installation and maintenance 
of water pipelines to support a military base golf course not permissible 
because such expenditure is specifically prohibited by 10 U.S.C. § 2246, 
which prohibit the use of appropriated funds to “equip, operate, or 
maintain” a golf course); B-247348, June 22, 1992 (detail of Government 
Printing Office employee to Library of Congress not permissible because 
44 U.S.C. § 316 prohibits details for “duties not pertaining to the work of 
public printing and binding”). In 38 Comp. Gen. 758 (1959) and 4 Comp. 
Gen. 1063 (1925), the Comptroller General held that the necessary expense 
language did not overcome the prohibition in 41 U.S.C. § 12 against 
contracting for public buildings or public improvements in excess of 
appropriations for the specific purpose. In large measure, this is little more 
than an application of the rule against repeal by implication discussed in 
Chapter 2, section C.2.h. 

There are exceptions where applying the rule would make it impossible to 
carry out a specific appropriation. A very small group of cases stands for 
the proposition that, where a specific appropriation is made for a specific 
purpose, an expenditure that is “absolutely essential” to accomplishing the 
specific object may be incurred even though the expenditure would 
otherwise be prohibited. In order for this exception to apply, the 
expenditure must literally be absolutely essential in the sense that the 
object of the appropriation could not be accomplished without it. Also, the 
rule would not apply to the use of a more general appropriation. 

For example, in 2 Comp. Gen. 133 (1922), modifying 2 Comp. Gen. 14 
(1922), an appropriation to provide airmail service between New York, 
Chicago, and San Francisco was held available to construct hangars and 
related facilities at a landing field in Chicago notwithstanding the 
requirement for a specific appropriation in 41 U.S.C. § 12. The reason was 
that it would have been impossible to provide the service, and hence, to 
accomplish the purpose of the appropriation, without erecting the 
facilities. See also 17 Comp. Gen. 636 (1938) and 22 Comp. Dec. 317 (1916). 
(The 1938 decision cites the rule but the decision itself is an ordinary 
necessary expense case.) 

An 1899 case, 6 Comp. Dec. 75, provides another good illustration of the 
concept. The building housing the Department of Justice (Justice) had 
become unsafe and overcrowded. Congress enacted legislation to authorize 
and fund the construction of a new building. The statute specifically 
provided that the new building be constructed on the site of the old 

Page 4-28 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

c. Expenditure Otherwise 
Provided For 
building, but did not address the question of how Justice would function 
during the construction period. The obvious solution was to rent another 
building until the new one was ready, but 40 U.S.C. § 34 prohibited the 
rental of space in the District of Columbia except under an appropriation 
specifically available for that purpose, and Justice had no such 
appropriation. On the grounds that any other result would be absurd, the 
Comptroller of the Treasury held that Justice could rent interim space 
notwithstanding the statutory prohibition. While the decision was not 
couched in terms of the expenditure being “absolutely essential,” it said 
basically the same thing. Since Justice could not cease to function during 
the construction period, the appropriation for construction of the new 
building could not be fulfilled without the expenditure for interim space. 

The third test is that an expenditure cannot be authorized under a 
necessary expense theory if it is otherwise provided for under a more 
specific appropriation or statutory funding mechanism. It is well settled 
that even an expenditure that may be reasonably related to a general 
appropriation may not be paid out of that appropriation where the 
expenditure falls specifically within the scope of another appropriation. 
See, e.g., B-291241, Oct. 8, 2002; B-290005, July 1, 2002; B-289209, May 31, 
2002. 

The fact that the more specific appropriation may be exhausted is 
immaterial. Thus, in B-139510, May 13, 1959, the Navy could not use its 
shipbuilding appropriation to deepen a channel in the Singing River near 
Pascagoula, Mississippi, to permit submarines then under construction to 
move to deeper water. The reason was that this was a function for which 
funds were traditionally appropriated to the Corps of Engineers, not the 
Navy. The fact that appropriations had not been made in this particular 
instance was irrelevant. 

Similarly, the Navy could not use appropriations made for the construction 
or procurement of vessels and aircraft to provide housing for civilian 
employees engaged in defense production activities because funds for that 
purpose were otherwise available. 20 Comp. Gen. 102 (1940). 

In another case, Federal Prison Industries could use its revolving fund to 
build industrial facilities incident to a federal prison, or to build a 
residential camp for prisoners employed in federal public works projects, 
but could not use that fund to construct other prison facilities because such 
construction was statutorily provided for elsewhere. B-230304, Mar. 18, 
1988.

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

In these cases, the existence of a more specific source of funds, or a more 
specific statutory mechanism for getting them, is the governing factor and 
overrides the “necessary expense” considerations. 

2. General Operating An illustration of how the necessary expense concept works common to all 
Expenses agencies is the range of expenditures permissible under general operating 
appropriations. All agencies, regardless of program differences, have 
certain things in common. Specifically, they all have employees, occupy 
space in buildings, and maintain an office environment. To support these 
functions, they incur a variety of administrative expenditures. Some are 
specifically authorized by statute; others flow logically from the 
requirements of maintaining a workforce. 
All agencies receive general operating appropriations for these 
administrative expenses. Depending largely on the size of the agency, they 
may be separate lump-sum appropriations or may be combined with 
program funds. The most common (but not the only) form of general 
operating appropriation is entitled “Salaries and Expenses (S&E).” 
Although an S&E appropriation may contain earmarks, for the most part it 
does not specify the types of “expenses” for which it is available. Employee 
salaries, together with related items such as agency contributions to health 
insurance and retirement, of course, comprise the bulk of an S&E 
appropriation. This section summarizes some of the other items chargeable 
to S&E funds as necessary expenses of running the agency that are not 
covered elsewhere in this chapter. 
a. Training Training of government employees is governed by the Government 
Employees Training Act, 5 U.S.C. chapter 41, aspects of which are 
discussed in several places in this chapter. The authority of the 
Government Employees Training Act is broad, but it is not unlimited. For 
example, tryouts for the U.S. Olympic Shooting Team do not constitute 
training under the Act. 68 Comp. Gen. 721 (1989). Nor do routine meetings, 
however formally structured, qualify as training. 68 Comp. Gen. 606 (1989). 
See also 68 Comp. Gen. 604 (1989); B-272280, May 29, 1997 (examination 
expenses that substitute for a college course are covered where the 
skipped course is part of an approved training program for which the 
agency would otherwise pay). 
For an entity not covered by the definition of “agency” in the Act, the 
authority to conduct training is limited. The particular training program 
must be (1) necessary to carry out the purpose for which the appropriation 

Page 4-30 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

is made, (2) for a period of brief duration, and (3) special in nature. 
36 Comp. Gen. 621 (1957) (including extensive citations to earlier 
decisions). See also 68 Comp. Gen. 127 (1988). 

Training of nonfederal personnel, where necessary to the implementation 
of a federal program, is a straightforward “necessary expense” question 
under the relevant program appropriation. E.g., 18 Comp. Gen. 842 (1939). 

In B-148826, July 23, 1962, the Comptroller General held that the Defense 
Department could pay $1 each to students participating in a civil defense 
training course as consideration for a release from liability. 

b. Travel Reimbursement for travel expenses incurred on official travel is now 
authorized by statute. E.g., 5 U.S.C. § 5702. However, even before the 
legislation was enacted, expenses incurred on authorized official travel 
were reimbursable as a necessary expense. 4 Comp. Dec. 475 (1898). 
Of course there are limits, and expenses are reimbursable only to the 
extent authorized by statute and implementing regulations. Thus, in an 
early case, expenses of a groom and valet incurred by an Army officer in 
Belgium could not be regarded as necessary travel expenses and therefore 
could not be reimbursed from Army appropriations. 21 Comp. Dec. 627 
(1915). 

Senior-level officials frequently travel for political purposes. As the Justice 
Department has pointed out, it is often impossible to neatly categorize 
travel as either purely business or purely political. To the extent it is 
possible to distinguish, appropriated funds should not be used for political 
travel. 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 214 (1982). GAO has conducted occasional 
reviews in this area, and has commented on the lack of legally binding 
guidelines against which to evaluate particular expenditures. E.g., U.S. 
General Accounting Office, Review of White House and Executive Agency 
Expenditures for Selected Travel, Entertainment, and Personnel Costs, 
AFMD-81-36 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 6, 1981); Review of the Propriety of 
White House and Executive Agency Expenditures for Selected Travel, 
Entertainment, and Personnel Costs, FGMSD-81-13 (Washington, D.C.: 
Oct. 20, 1980). 

Finally, there are situations in which expenses of congressional travel may 
be charged to the appropriations of other agencies. Under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1108(g): 

Page 4-31 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

“Amounts available under law are available for field 
examinations of appropriation estimates. The use of the 
amounts is subject only to regulations prescribed by the 
appropriate standing committees of Congress.” 

Thus, travel expenses of congressional committee members and staff 
incident to “field examinations” of appropriation requests may be charged 
to the agency whose programs and budget are being examined. B-214611, 
Apr. 17, 1984; B-129650, Jan. 2, 1957. Before the above provision was 
enacted as permanent legislation, similar provisions had appeared for 
many years in various appropriation acts. See 6 Comp. Gen. 836 (1927); 
23 Comp. Dec. 493 (1917). 

Travel expenses of congressional spouses (Members and staff) may not be 
paid from appropriated funds. B-204877, Nov. 27, 1981. 

Federal employees may retain promotional travel benefits, including 
frequent flyer miles or upgrades, when the benefits are earned as a result of 
official travel and if the promotional item is obtained under the same terms 
as those offered the general public and at no additional cost to the 
government. Pub. L. No. 107-107, div. A, title XI, § 1116, 115 Stat. 1012, 1241 
(Dec. 28, 2001). 

c. Postage Expenses Agencies are required to reimburse the Postal Service for mail sent by or to 
them as penalty mail.18 Reimbursement is to be made “out of any 
appropriations or funds available to them.” 39 U.S.C. § 3206(a). This statute 
amounts to an exception to the general purpose statute, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1301(a), in that the expenditure may be charged to any appropriation 
available to the agency. Penalty mail costs do not have to be charged to the 
particular bureau or activity that generated the cost. 33 Comp. Gen. 206 
(1953). By virtue of this statutory authority, the use of appropriations for 
one component of an agency to pay penalty mail costs of another 
component funded under a separate appropriation does not constitute an 
unauthorized transfer of appropriations. 33 Comp. Gen. 216 (1953). The 
same principle applies to reimbursement for registry fees. 36 Comp. 
Gen. 239 (1956). 
18 Penalty mail means official mail, other than franked mail, which is authorized by law to be 
transmitted in the mail without prepayment of postage. 32 U.S.C. § 3201(1).

d. Books and Periodicals Expenditures for books and periodicals are evaluated under the necessary 
expense rule. Thus, the American Battle Monuments Commission could 
use its Salaries and Expenses (S&E) appropriation to buy books on military 
leaders to help it decide what people and events to memorialize. 27 Comp. 
Gen. 746 (1948).19 
The National Science Foundation could subscribe to a publication called 
“Supervisory Management” to be used as training material in a supervisory 
training program under the Government Employees Training Act. If 
determined necessary to the course, the subscription could be paid from 
the Foundations S&E appropriation. 39 Comp. Gen. 320 (1959). Similarly, 
the Interior Department’s Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration 
could subscribe to the “Federal Employees News Digest” if determined to 
be necessary in carrying out the agency’s statutory functions. 55 Comp. 
Gen. 1076 (1976). 
Subsequently, when the Federal Employees News Digest came under some 
criticism, it became necessary to explain that a decision such as 55 Comp. 
Gen. 1076 is neither an endorsement of a particular publication nor an 
exhortation for agencies to buy it. It is merely a determination that the 
purchase is legally authorized. B-185591, Feb. 7, 1985. 
In B-171856, Mar. 3, 1971, the Interior Department was permitted to 
purchase newspapers to send to a number of Inuit families in Alaska. 
Members of the families had been transported to Washington state to help 
in fighting a huge fire, and the newspapers were seen as necessary to keep 
the families advised of the status of the operation and also as a measure to 
encourage future volunteerism. 
e. Miscellaneous Items We have viewed certain civic, charitable, and similar community support 
Incident to the Federal activities involving limited use of agency resources and employee time as 
Workplace permissible expenses. For instance, agencies may spend their 
appropriations, within reason, to cooperate with government-sanctioned 
charitable fund-raising campaigns, including such things as permitting 
solicitation during working hours, preparing campaign instructions, and 
distributing campaign materials. 67 Comp. Gen. 254 (1988) (Combined 
Federal Campaign). See also B-155667, Jan. 21, 1965; B-154456, Aug. 11, 

19 Decisions in this area prior to 1946 applying a stricter standard, such as 21 Comp. Gen. 339 
(1941) and 22 Comp. Dec. 317 (1916), should be disregarded as they reflected prohibitory 
legislation enacted on March 15, 1898 (30 Stat. 316) and repealed in 1946.

1964; B-119740, July 29, 1954. Similarly, some use of employee time and 
agency equipment can occur to carry out limited National Guard and 
Reserve functions or to assist with adopt-a-school programs. 71 Comp. 
Gen. 469 (1992); B-277678, Jan. 4, 1999. This authority, however, does not 
extend to giving T-shirts to Combined Federal Campaign contributors. 
70 Comp. Gen. 248 (1991). 

An agency may use its general operating appropriations to fund limited 
amounts of promotional material in support of the United States savings 
bond campaign. B-225006, June 1, 1987. 

Support that agencies are authorized by law to provide to federal credit 
unions may, if administratively determined to be necessary, include 
automatic teller machines. 66 Comp. Gen. 356 (1987). The justification was 
adequate in that case because the facility in question operated on three 
shifts 7 days a week and the credit union could not remain open to 
accommodate workers on all shifts. 

The Salaries and Expenses appropriation of the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) could be used to procure credit bureau reports if administratively 
determined to be necessary in connection with investigating applicants for 
employment with IRS. B-117975, Dec. 29, 1953. 

IRS was authorized to undertake employee counseling and referral 
programs related to eldercare. The expenditure was justified under 5 U.S.C. 
§ 7901, which authorized “preventative programs related to health.” 
71 Comp. Gen. 527 (1992). Similar mental health referrals are discussed at 
length in section C.13 of this chapter addressing personal expenses. 

Outplacement assistance to employees may be regarded as a legitimate 
matter of agency personnel administration if the expenditures are found to 
benefit the agency and are reasonable in amount. 68 Comp. Gen. 127 
(1988); B-272040, Oct. 29, 1997. The Government Employees Training Act 
authorizes training in preparation for placement in another federal agency 
under conditions specified in the statute. 5 U.S.C. § 4103(b). 

Otherwise unrestricted operating appropriations are available to protect a 
government official who has been threatened or is otherwise in danger, if 
the agency determines that the risk impairs the official’s ability to carry out 
his or her duties and hence adversely affects the efficient functioning of the 
agency. For example, the U.S. Customs Service may use appropriated funds 
to purchase home and automobile security devices for agents stationed in 

Page 4-34 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands where they are needed as a result of 
the agent’s law enforcement activities. B-251710, July 7, 1993. See also 
71 Comp. Gen. 4 (1991). Also, certain officials, specified in 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3056(a), are entitled to Secret Service protection. 54 Comp. Gen. 624 
(1975), modified by 55 Comp. Gen. 578 (1975). 

Payment of an honorarium to an invited guest speaker (other than a 
government employee) is permissible under a necessary expense rationale. 
See A-69906, Mar. 16, 1936 (payment of an honorarium by an agency of the 
District of Columbia government was found to be an allowable 
administrative expense). See also B-20517, Sept. 24, 1941. 

Fees for the notarization of documents are properly payable from 
appropriated funds where no government notary is available. B-33846, 
Apr. 27, 1943. 

An agency’s appropriations are not available to reimburse the Civil Service 
Retirement Fund for losses due to overpayments to a retired employee 
resulting from the agency’s erroneous processing of information. 54 Comp. 
Gen. 205 (1974). 

The Federal Reserve Board could not match employee contributions to an 
employee savings plan established by the Board. B-174174, Sept. 24, 1971. 

C. Specific Purpose 
Authorities and 
Limitations 
1. Introduction This section will explore a number of specific topics concerning purpose 
availability. Sections C.2 through C.16 cover areas that have generated 
considerable activity over the years and require a somewhat detailed 
presentation. While our topic selection is designed to highlight certain 
restrictions, our objective is to describe what is authorized as well as what 
is unauthorized. Most of the topics are a mixture of both. 
Restrictions on the purposes for which appropriated funds may be spent 
come from a variety of sources. Some may stem from the Constitution 
itself. An example is the prohibition on paying certain state and local taxes, 

Page 4-35 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

discussed in section C.15. Others are found in permanent legislation, such 
as the restrictions on residential and long distance telephone service 
discussed in section C.16. 

A common source of purpose restrictions is the appropriation act itself. 
Restrictions are often included as provisos to the appropriating language or 
as general provisions or “riders.” For example, B-202716, Oct. 29, 1981, 
construes an appropriation act restriction prohibiting the use of Legal 
Services Corporation funds for the representation of illegal aliens. Another 
example is the restriction on “publicity and propaganda” expenditures 
found in some appropriation acts, discussed in section C.11. 

Finally, a number of restrictions have evolved from decisions of the 
Comptroller General and his predecessor, the Comptroller of the Treasury. 
An example is the government’s policy on self-insurance, section C.10. The 
restrictions that have evolved administratively usually date back to the 
nineteenth century, are firmly embedded in appropriations law, and for the 
most part have been recognized by Congress at least implicitly by the 
practice of legislating the occasional exception. 

Purpose restrictions will commonly prohibit the use of funds for an item 
except “under specific statutory authority,” or except under “an 
appropriation specifically available therefore,” or similar language. The 
“specific authority” needed to create an exception in these situations need 
not be found in the appropriation act itself, but may be contained in 
authorizing or enabling legislation as long as it is clearly applicable to the 
appropriation sought to be charged. 23 Comp. Gen. 859 (1944); 16 Comp. 
Gen. 773 (1937). 

2. Attendance at Meetings 
and Conventions 
Meetings have become a way of life in contemporary American society and 
the federal bureaucracy is no exception. It seems that there are meetings 
on just about everything. Quite often they can be very useful. They can also 
be expensive. It is no surprise that lots of meetings are held in places like 
Honolulu and San Francisco. This section will explore when appropriated 
funds may be used to send people, government employees and others, to 
meetings. Congress has passed a number of statutes in this area and the 
cases usually involve the interpretation and application of the various 
statutory provisions. For purposes of this discussion, the term “meeting” 
includes other designations such as conference, congress, convention, 
seminar, symposium, and workshop; what the particular gathering is called 
is irrelevant.

Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

(1) Statutory framework 
To understand the law in this area, it is necessary to understand the 
interrelationship of several statutes. Listed in the order of their enactment, 
they are: 5 U.S.C. § 5946, 31 U.S.C. § 1345, 5 U.S.C. § 4109, and 5 U.S.C. 
§ 4110. This interrelationship is best seen by outlining the statutory 
evolution. 

The first piece of legislation was enacted in 1912. As relevant here, 
section 8 of the Act of June 26, 1912 (Pub. L. No. 201, ch. 182, 37 Stat. 139, 
184), prohibited the payment, without specific statutory authority, of the 
expenses of attendance of an individual at meetings or conventions of 
members of a society or association. With exceptions to be noted below, 
this statute is now found at 5 U.S.C. § 5946. For the most part, it has always 
been viewed as applying to attendance by federal employees at 
nonfederally sponsored meetings. See, e.g., B-140912, Nov. 24, 1959. 

There were many early cases under the 1912 statute. Since the prohibition 
is directed at meetings of a “society or association,” other types of meetings 
were not covered. Thus, the Federal Power Commission could, if 
determined to be in the furtherance of authorized activities, send a 
representative to the World Power Conference (in Basle, Switzerland) 
since it was not a meeting of a “society or association.” 5 Comp. Gen. 834 
(1926). Similarly, the statute did not prohibit travel by U.S. Attorneys “to 
attend a conference of attorneys not banded together into a society or 
association, but called together for one meeting only for conference in a 
matter bearing directly on their official duties.” 1 Comp. Gen. 546 (1922). 

However, if a given gathering was viewed as a meeting or convention of a 
society or association, the expenses were consistently disallowed. E.g., 
16 Comp. Gen. 252 (1936); 5 Comp. Gen. 599 (1926), aff’d, 5 Comp. 
Gen. 746 (1926); 3 Comp. Gen. 883 (1924). GAO often told agencies in those 
days that if they thought attendance would be in the interest of the 
government, they should present the matter to Congress. E.g., 5 Comp. 
Gen. at 747. In fact Congress granted specific authority to a number of 
agencies (for an example, see B-136324, Aug. 1, 1958), and later, as will be 
seen below, enacted general legislation that renders 5 U.S.C. § 5946, as it 
relates to attendance at meetings, of very limited applicability. 

The next congressional venture in this field was Public Resolution No. 2, 
74th Congress, ch. 4, 49 Stat. 19 (Feb. 2, 1935), aimed primarily at restricting 
the use of appropriated funds to pay expenses of nongovernment persons 

Page 4-37 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

at conventions. This statute, now codified at 31 U.S.C. § 1345, provides in 
relevant part: 

“Except as specifically provided by law, an appropriation 
may not be used for travel, transportation, and subsistence 
expenses for a meeting. This section does not prohibit— 

“(1) an agency from paying the expenses of an officer or 
employee of the United States Government carrying out an 
official duty; . . .” 

Significantly, 31 U.S.C. § 1345 does not apply to government employees in 
the discharge of official duties. Thus, as of 1935, attendance by private 
parties at government expense was prohibited by 31 U.S.C. § 1345; 
attendance by government employees was prohibited by the 1912 statute 
for meetings of a society or association (regardless of the relationship to 
official duties), and by 31 U.S.C. § 1345 for other types of meetings unless 
attendance was in the discharge of official duties. 

The next relevant legislative action came in 1958 with two provisions of the 
Government Employees Training Act, Pub. L. No. 85-507, 72 Stat. 327 
(July 7, 1958). Section 10 of the Act, 5 U.S.C. § 4109, authorizes payment of 
certain expenses in connection with authorized training. Section 19(b) of 
the Act, 5 U.S.C. § 4110, makes travel appropriations available for expenses 
of attendance at meetings, “which are concerned with the functions or 
activities for which the appropriation is made or which will contribute to 
improved conduct, supervision, or management of the functions or 
activities.” When Title 5 of the United States Code was recodified in 1966, 
qualifying language was added to 5 U.S.C. § 5946 to make it clear that the 
requirement for specific statutory authority no longer applied to the extent 
payment was authorized by 5 U.S.C. § 4109 or § 4110. See 38 Comp. 
Gen. 800 (1959). 

With this statutory framework as background, it is now possible to attempt 
to state some rules. 

A government employee may attend a nongovernment-sponsored meeting 
at government expense (1) if it is part of an authorized training program 
under 5 U.S.C. § 4109 or (2) if it is related to agency functions or 
management under 5 U.S.C. § 4110.

For example, the Labor Department could use its Salaries and Expenses 
appropriation to pay the attendance fees of its Director of Personnel at a 
conference of the American Society of Training Directors since the meeting 
qualified under the broad authority of 5 U.S.C. § 4110. 38 Comp. Gen. 26 
(1958). The expenses of attendance may not be paid if the employing 
agency refuses to authorize attendance, even if authorization would have 
been permissible under the statute. B-164372, June 12, 1968. (This was sort 
of an odd case. An employee wanted to attend a conference in Tokyo, 
Japan. The agency refused authorization because the employee had 
announced his intention to resign after the conference. The employee went 
anyway, and for some reason filed a claim for his expenses. GAO said no.) 
Where attendance is authorized, the fact that the sponsor is a profit-making 
organization is immaterial. B-161777, July 11, 1967. 

The express inclusion of “management” in 5 U.S.C. § 4110 is significant. 
Before the Government Employees Training Act, GAO had strictly 
construed grants of statutory authority for attendance at meetings as 
excluding meetings concerning general problems such as management that 
are common to all agencies. 37 Comp. Gen. 335 (1957). This type of meeting 
is now expressly authorized. 

If neither 5 U.S.C. § 4109 nor 5 U.S.C. § 4110 applies and the meeting is a 
meeting of a “society or association,” then it is subject to the prohibition of 
5 U.S.C. § 5946. 

The continuing viability of 5 U.S.C. § 5946 requires further elaboration. 
GAO held in 38 Comp. Gen. 800 (1959) that the Government Employees 
Training Act repealed section 5946 by implication to the extent that the two 
statutes were incompatible. While this is true, some of the language in that 
decision has generated some confusion. The decision stated that the 
restriction in section 5946 “is inapplicable so far as agencies and personnel 
covered by the Government Employees Training Act are concerned,” and 
that those agencies no longer need to obtain specific appropriation 
provisions to authorize attendance at meetings. Of course this statement is 
based on the premise that an agency is not likely to seek, nor is Congress 
likely to grant, specific appropriation authority for an agency to send its 
employees to meetings which have nothing to do with agency business. 
Thus, it is not accurate to say that section 5946 simply no longer applies to 
civilian employees of the government. It does apply, except that its scope is 
considerably reduced by virtue of the broad authority of the Government 
Employees Training Act. If attendance cannot be authorized under either of 
the Acts provisions, 5 U.S.C. § 5946 still applies. This relationship is 

Page 4-39 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4

correctly stated in 55 Comp. Gen. 1332, 1335–36 (1976). For cases where 
expenses were disallowed because they could not be justified under these 
standards, see B-202028, May 14, 1981; B-195045, Feb. 8, 1980; and 
B-166560, May 27, 1969. 

It is also possible for 31 U.S.C. § 1345 to apply to government employees, 
although it would be the rare case. As noted above, 31 U.S.C. § 1345 does 
not apply to government employees in the discharge of official duties. A 
number of earlier cases will be found that cite the statute in passing for this 
proposition. E.g., 27 Comp. Gen. 627 (1948); 26 Comp. Gen. 53 (1946); 
22 Comp. Gen. 315 (1942); B-117137, Sept. 25, 1953; B-87691, Aug. 2, 1949; 
B-80621, Oct. 8, 1948; B-77404, June 29, 1948; B-77613, June 23, 1948; 
B-13888, Dec. 10, 1940.20 

Since the exception for government employees in 31 U.S.C. § 1345 is 
limited to the discharge of official duties, the statutory prohibition applies 
to government employees to the extent that a given meeting is not part of 
the discharge of official duties. If a meeting is not part of authorized 
training under 5 U.S.C. § 4109 and cannot qualify as related to agency 
functions under 5 U.S.C. § 4110, it would certainly not be within the 
exception in 31 U.S.C. § 1345 for the discharge of official duties. If the 
meeting is a meeting of a “society or association,” it is, as noted above, 
subject to 5 U.S.C. § 5946. If the meeting is not a meeting of a society or 
association and is not within the exception for the discharge of official 
duties, 31 U.S.C. § 1345 would apply. An example of a situation in which 
this rationale might apply is B-195045, Feb. 8, 1980, in which attendance 
expenses at an executive board meeting of the Combined Federal 
Campaign were disallowed. (The case was decided on the basis of 
regulations and prior decisions.) 

(2) Inability to attend 
If an employee is scheduled to participate in a meeting or conference and is 
unable to attend, the government may be liable for attendance fees in 
certain situations. Two cases will illustrate. 

20 All of these cases also involve the pre-Government Employees Training Act version of 
5 U.S.C. § 5946 and may no longer be valid to that extent. The editors have made no attempt 
to examine each of the cases from this perspective. Thus, while the pre-1958 cases remain 
valid to the limited extent that they involve 31 U.S.C. § 1345, the results in those cases may 
no longer apply in view of the subsequent enactment of 5 U.S.C. §§ 4109 and 4110.

In B-159059, June 28, 1966, an Interior Department employee had been 
accepted to attend an energy seminar. The seminar announcement 
provided a cutoff date for cancellation of reservations but permitted 
substitutions. Due to the press of other necessary work, the employee did 
not attend the seminar, nor did he send a substitute or request cancellation 
before the cutoff date. GAO found that the sponsors acceptance of the 
employees application, which had been duly approved (in this particular 
case, the applicant was also the approving official), obligated the 
government to pay the seminar fee subject to timely cancellation. Since the 
agency failed to give timely notice of cancellation, it was liable for the 
seminar fee. 

In another 1966 case, a Defense Department employee was scheduled to 
attend a training seminar in New York but a severe snowstorm prevented 
him from leaving Washington. (By Washington standards, this could have 
been 2 inches.) Since the employee’s nonattendance was in no way 
attributable to the organization conducting the seminar, GAO concluded 
(citing B-159059) that the seminar fee should be paid. GAO rejected a 
contention that the government’s obligation should be excused on the 
grounds of impossibility (the employee’s nonattendance resulted from 
natural forces) since the arrangement permitted substitution of personnel. 

B-159820, Sept. 30, 1966. 

(3) Federally sponsored meetings 
Federally sponsored meetings for employees (intra-agency or interagency), 
such as management or planning seminars, are not prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5946 since they are not meetings of a “society or association,” nor are 
they prohibited by 31 U.S.C. § 1345 because they concern the discharge of 
official duties. The authority for this type of meeting is essentially a 
“necessary expense” question. 

An increasingly common type of agency meeting is the “retreat type” 
conference. In this situation, some agency official with authority to do so 
determines that the participants should get away from their normal work 
environment and its associated interruptions such as telephones. 
Frequently, they need to get just far enough away to justify the payment of 
per diem allowances. While this type of meeting may be criticized as 
extravagant, it is within the agency’s administrative discretion under the 
necessary expense rule and therefore not illegal. See B-193137, July 23, 
1979.

Agency meetings at or near the participant’s normal duty station may 
present special problems with respect to reimbursement for meals. In 
many cases, meals or snacks will be unauthorized even though there is 
nothing improper about conducting the meeting itself. This area is 
discussed in detail in this chapter, section C.5. 

(4) Rental of space in District of Columbia 
Originally enacted in 1877 (Act of March 2, 1877, ch. 106, 19 Stat. 370), 
40 U.S.C. § 8141 now provides: 

“A contract shall not be made for the rent of a building, or 
part of a building, to be used for the purposes of the Federal 
Government in the District of Columbia until Congress 
enacts an appropriation for the rent. This section is deemed 
to be notice to all contractors or lessors of the building or a 
part of a building.” 

The statute does not prohibit the procurement of short-term conference 
facilities if otherwise proper. 54 Comp. Gen. 1055 (1975). In rendering this 
decision, which overruled several earlier cases, the Comptroller General 
relied heavily on the Federal Property Management Regulations, in which 
the General Services Administration construed the procurement of short-
term conference facilities as a service contract rather than a rental 
contract. 

However, the statute does prohibit the procurement of lodging 
accommodations in the District of Columbia in connection with a meeting 
or conference without specific statutory authority. 56 Comp. Gen. 572 
(1977), modified and aff’d, B-159633, Sept. 10, 1974; 49 Comp. Gen. 305 
(1969).21 In 56 Comp. Gen. 572, GAO approved payment to the hotel of the 
difference between full per diem and the reduced per diem actually paid to 
the participating employees. This is because the agency could, without 
violating the statute, have paid full per diem to the employees if they had 
made the arrangements themselves on an individual basis. Thus, the 
difference represented a cost the agency would have properly incurred had 
it not procured the accommodations directly. 

21 One of the decisions listed as overruled in 54 Comp. Gen. 1055 was 49 Comp. Gen. 305. 
However, the overruling action was later recognized to be erroneous and 49 Comp. Gen. 305 
was reinstated in 56 Comp. Gen. 572, 574.

(5) Military personnel 
Attendance at meetings by military personnel is governed by 37 U.S.C. 
§ 412: 

“Appropriations of the Department of Defense that are 
available for travel may not, without the approval of the 
Secretary concerned or his designee, be used for expenses 
incident to attendance of a member of an armed force under 
that department at a meeting of a technical, scientific, 
professional, or similar organization.” 

This statute, designed to provide a broad exception for the Defense 
Department from 5 U.S.C. § 5946, originated as an appropriation act rider in 
the mid-1940s and was enacted as permanent legislation by section 605 of 
the Department of Defense Appropriation Act for 1954, 67 Stat. 349 (Aug. 1, 
1953). 

The Government Employees Training Act, enacted in 1958 and discussed 
above, applies to civilian employees of the military departments but not to 
members of the uniformed services. 38 Comp. Gen. 312 (1958). 
Accordingly, the Comptroller General held in 1959 that the administrative 
approval specified in 37 U.S.C. § 412 was no longer required for civilian 
employees covered by the Government Employees Training Act. However, 
the requirement of 37 U.S.C. § 412 remains applicable to members of the 
uniformed services. 38 Comp. Gen. 800 (1959). See also 55 Comp. 
Gen. 1332, 1335 (1976). The recodification of Title 37 of the United States 
Code in 1962 recognized this distinction and reworded the statute to its 
present form so it would apply only to members of the armed forces. 

The administrative approval required by the statute is a prerequisite to the 
availability of the appropriation, and has the effect of removing the 
appropriation from the prohibition of 5 U.S.C. § 5946 to the extent of such 
approval. 34 Comp. Gen. 573, 575 (1955). Oral approval, if satisfactorily 
established by the record, is sufficient to meet the requirement of the 
statute. B-140082, Aug. 19, 1959. However, where implementing 
departmental regulations establish more stringent requirements, such as 
advance approval in writing, the regulations will control. B-139173, June 2, 
1959.

The administrative approval requirement of 37 U.S.C. § 412 does not apply 
to meetings sponsored by a federal department or agency. 50 Comp. 
Gen. 527 (1971). 

(1) 31 U.S.C. § 1345 

Quoted previously, 31 U.S.C. § 1345 prohibits the payment of travel, 
transportation, or subsistence expenses of private parties at meetings 
without specific statutory authority. 

The Comptroller General set the tone for GAO’s approach to 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1345 in two cases decided shortly after the statute was enacted. In 
14 Comp. Gen. 638 (1935), the Comptroller held that the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) could not pay the travel and lodging expenses for 
attendance at meetings of private citizens who were cooperating with the 
FHA in a campaign to encourage the repair and modernization of real 
estate. GAO had no difficulty in finding that the statute barred payment: 

“There seems very little if any room for doubt as to the 
reasonable meaning and legal effect of [31 U.S.C. § 1345]. 
Simply stated, it is that no convention or other form of 
assemblage or gathering may be lodged, fed, conveyed, or 
furnished transportation at Government expense unless 
authority therefor is specifically granted by law.” 

Id. at 640 (explanatory language provided). 

A few months later, relying on 14 Comp. Gen. 638, the Comptroller General 
held similarly that 31 U.S.C. § 1345 prohibited the American Battle 
Monuments Commission from providing transportation and refreshments 
for private individuals at monument dedication ceremonies in Europe. 
14 Comp. Gen. 851 (1935). Other early decisions applying the statutory 
prohibition are 15 Comp. Gen. 1081 (1936); B-53554, Nov. 6, 1945; B-27441, 
Aug. 25, 1942; and A-66869, Jan. 31, 1936. 

Some more recent cases in which GAO found expenditures prohibited by 
31 U.S.C. § 1345 are summarized below: 

• The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could not pay the 
transportation and lodging expenses of state officials attending a 
National Solid Waste Management Association Convention. B-166506, 
July 15, 1975, aff’d, 55 Comp. Gen. 750 (1976). 

Page 4-44 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

• The Mine Safety and Health Administration, Department of Labor, 
could not pay travel and subsistence expenses of miners and mine 
operators attending safety and health training seminars. B-193644, 
July 2, 1979. 

• Maritime Administration could not pay transportation and subsistence 

expenses of nonfederal participants in a 2-week seminar for general 

publication maritime writers. B-168627, May 26, 1970. 

• Navy could not pay for a dinner and cocktail party for nongovernment 
minority group leaders. B-176806-O.M., Sept. 18, 1972. 

• National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not pay travel 

and lodging expenses of state officials at a workshop on odometer 

fraud. 62 Comp. Gen. 531 (1983). 

GAO has not attempted to define precisely what types of gatherings are 
within the scope of the statutory prohibition. The determination is made on 
a case-by-case basis. The statutory language is broad and could presumably 
be construed to cover any situation where two or more persons are 
gathered together in one place. However, GAO has never adopted such a 
rigid view. For example, in 45 Comp. Gen. 476 (1966), a certifying officer of 
the Department of Agriculture asked whether he could “properly certify for 
payment a voucher covering payment for rental of a chartered bus for the 
transportation of female guests from Albuquerque to Grants, New Mexico, 
and return, for purposes of providing social and recreational services to 
Job Corps enrollees.” (This is what the case says. The editors are not 
making it up.) The Comptroller General found that this was simply not the 
kind of “meeting” 31 U.S.C. § 1345 was intended to prohibit. Further, there 
was statutory authority for providing “recreational services” for the 
enrollees. Therefore, the expenditure was not illegal. The decision does not 
specify precisely what “social and recreational services” the women were 
bused in to provide. See also 72 Comp. Gen. 229 (1993) (the Department of 
Defense (DOD) may pay for travel expenses from the United States to 
Germany for recruiters from public schools to attend job fairs for teachers 
at DOD Dependent schools (DODDS) because job fairs and one-on-one 
interviews between recruiters and DODDS teachers are not the type of 
“meeting” covered by section 1345). 

As noted, the prohibition of 31 U.S.C. § 1345 can be overcome by specific 
statutory authority. An example of such authority is language in an 
appropriation act making the appropriation available for “expenses of 

Page 4-45 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

attendance at meetings” or similar language.22 See 72 Comp. Gen. 146 
(1993); 34 Comp. Gen. 321 (1955); 24 Comp. Gen. 86 (1944); 17 Comp. 
Gen. 838 (1938); 16 Comp. Gen. 839 (1937); B-117137, Sept. 25, 1953. (This 
is the same language used before enactment of the Government Employees 
Training Act to grant exceptions from 5 U.S.C. § 5946.) 

In one case, less-than-specific authority was found adequate. In 35 Comp. 
Gen. 129 (1955), GAO considered a statute that (1) provided for a “White 
House Conference on Education,” (2) specified that the conference be 
broadly representative of educators and other interested persons from all 
parts of the United States, and (3) authorized appropriations necessary for 
the “administration” of the act. The decision held this sufficient to make the 
ensuing appropriations available for the travel costs of the invitees. While 
the decision does not mention 31 U.S.C. § 1345, the distinction is readily 
apparent. Here, holding the conference was more than merely a legitimate 
means of implementing the enabling statute; it was the very purpose of the 
statute and hence the only means. See also 35 Comp. Gen. 198 (1955) 
(discussing other funding issues under the same legislation). A more recent 
case applying 35 Comp. Gen. 129 to a similar situation is B-242880, Mar. 27, 
1991 (Commission on Interstate Child Support could pay lodging costs for 
core nonfederal invitees at a statutorily mandated National Conference on 
Interstate Child Support where the core invitees were essential to assist the 
Commission in its statutory duties). 

However, general statutory authority to disseminate information to the 
public, or to promote or encourage cooperation with the private sector, or 
to provide technical assistance or education to specified segments of the 
private sector, is not sufficiently specific to overcome 31 U.S.C. § 1345. See 
62 Comp. Gen. 531 (1983); B-193644, July 2, 1979; B-166506, July 15, 1975; 
B-168627, May 26, 1970. 

A distinction must be drawn between the authority to sponsor a meeting 
and the authority to pay the types of expenses prohibited by 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1345. An agency may be able to do the former but not the latter. Thus, in 
B-166506, July 15, 1975, GAO pointed out that EPA could hold a solid waste 
management convention as a legitimate means of implementing its 

22 In some cases, the authority has been made permanent. An example is 31 U.S.C. § 326(a) 
for the Treasury Department, construed in 37 Comp. Gen. 708 (1958). Another example is 
subsection (2) of 31 U.S.C. § 1345 concerning meetings of 4-H Clubs, noted in B-166506, 
July 15, 1975. 

Page 4-46 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

functions under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. What it could not do without 
more specific statutory authority was pay the travel and lodging expenses 
of the state participants. Sponsoring the meeting itself is essentially a 
“necessary expense” question. See also 62 Comp. Gen. 531 (1983); 
B-239856, Apr. 29, 1991. Cf. 45 Comp. Gen. 333 (1965); B-147552, Nov. 29, 
1961. 

Thus, depending on the agency’s statutory authority, it may be authorized 
to incur such expenses as renting conference facilities, financing the 
participation of its own employees, bringing in guest speakers, both federal 
and nonfederal, and preparing and disseminating literature. The prohibition 
of 31 U.S.C. § 1345 comes into play only when the agency purports to pay 
the travel, transportation, or subsistence expenses of nonfederal attendees. 

Another thing the agency may be able to do is permit the use of government 
facilities for the meeting. For example, in B-168627, May 26, 1970, while the 
Maritime Administration could not pick up the tab for the participation of 
nongovernment persons at a seminar, it could permit the seminar to be held 
at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. The rule, stated in that decision, is 
that an agency has authority to grant to a private individual or business a 
“revocable license” to use government property, subject to termination at 
any time at the will of the government, provided that such use does not 
injure the property in question and serves some purpose useful or 
beneficial to the government. 

(2) Invitational travel 
Another statute we should note is 5 U.S.C. § 5703, which provides: 

“An employee serving intermittently in the Government 
service as an expert or consultant …or serving without pay 
or at $1 a year, may be allowed travel or transportation 
expenses, under this subchapter, while away from his home 
or regular place of business and at the place of employment 
or service.” 

This statute originated as an appropriation act rider in 1945 and was 
enacted as permanent legislation the following year as section 5 of the 
Administrative Expenses Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 600, ch. 744, 60 Stat. 806 
(Aug. 2, 1946). To the extent it authorizes payment in the so-called 
“invitational travel” situation—a private party called upon by the 

Page 4-47 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

government to confer or advise on government business—it represents a 
limited exception to 31 U.S.C. § 1345. 

Even before 5 U.S.C. § 5703 was enacted, GAO had recognized that a 
private individual “invited” by the government to confer on official business 
was entitled to reimbursement of travel expenses if specified in the request 
and justified as a necessary expense. 8 Comp. Gen. 465 (1929); 4 Comp. 
Gen. 281 (1924); A-41751, Apr. 15, 1932. 

The enactment of 31 U.S.C. § 1345 in 1935 did not change this. Thus, the 
Comptroller General recognized in 15 Comp. Gen. 91, 92 (1935) that while 
the statute might prohibit the payment of expenses of private individuals 
called together as a group, it would not apply to “individuals called to 
Washington or elsewhere for consultation as individuals.” See also A-81080, 
Oct. 27, 1936. Viewed in this light, the 1946 enactment of 5 U.S.C. § 5703 in 
large measure merely gave express congressional sanction to a rule that 
had already developed in the decisions. 

Although GAO did not directly address the relationship between 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5703 and 31 U.S.C. § 1345 until 1976 (55 Comp. Gen. 750 (1976), discussed 
below), the relevant principles were established in several earlier cases. In 
one of GAO’s earliest decisions under 5 U.S.C. § 5703, the Comptroller 
General held that persons who are not government officers or employees 
may, “when requested by a proper officer to travel for the purpose of 
conferring upon official Government matters,” be regarded as persons 
serving without pay and therefore entitled to travel expenses under 
5 U.S.C. § 5703. 27 Comp. Gen. 183, 184 (1947). See also 39 Comp. Gen. 55 
(1959). Thus, the rule of 8 Comp. Gen. 465 now had a statutory basis. A 
critical prerequisite is this: in order to qualify under 5 U.S.C. § 5703, the 
individual must be performing a direct service for the government. 

37 Comp. Gen. 349 (1957). 

Once the proposition of 27 Comp. Gen. 183 is accepted, it is but a short step 
to recognizing that a private individual called upon to advise on 
government business may be called upon to do so in the form of making a 
presentation at a meeting or conference. See, for example, B-111310, 
Sept. 4, 1952, and 33 Comp. Gen. 39 (1953), in which payment under 
5 U.S.C. § 5703 was authorized. The statute could not reasonably be limited 
to “one-on-one” consultations. As stated in B-196088, Nov. 1, 1979: 

“It is not unusual for the Government to invite an individual 
with a particular expertise to attend a meeting and to share 

Page 4-48 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

the benefit of his views without compensation other than by 
way of reimbursement for his travel and transportation 
expenses.” 

Thus, travel expenses of private individuals “invited” to participate in 
meetings sponsored by the National Center for Productivity and Quality of 
Working Life were properly paid under 5 U.S.C. § 5703. B-192734, Nov. 24, 
1978. Similarly, the Internal Revenue Service could invoke 5 U.S.C. § 5703 
to buy lunches for guest speakers invited to participate in a ceremony 
observing National Black History Month since the ceremony was an 
authorized part of the agency’s formal program to advance equal 
opportunity objectives. 60 Comp. Gen. 303 (1981). 

There is a limit to this rationale and a point at which 5 U.S.C. § 5703 
collides head-on with 31 U.S.C. § 1345. This point was discussed in 
55 Comp. Gen. 750, supra, and reiterated in B-193644, July 2, 1979. In 1976, 
55 Comp. Gen. 750 affirmed B-166506, July 15, 1975, and held that 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1345 prohibited the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from paying 
travel and lodging expenses of state officials at a solid waste management 
convention; B-193644 reached the same result for safety and training 
seminars for miners and mine operators. In both cases, the Comptroller 
General rejected the suggestion that the expenses could somehow be 
authorized under the “invitational travel” statute. In neither case were the 
attendees providing a direct service for the government, even though in 
both cases the government may have derived some incidental benefit in 
terms of enhancement of program objectives. The following passage 
illustrates the “collision point”: 

“We thus do not believe that [5 U.S.C. § 5703] was ever 
intended to establish the proposition that anyone may be 
deemed a person serving without compensation merely 
because he or she is attending a meeting or convention, the 
subject matter of which is related to the official business of 
some Federal department or agency…. We believe that 
being called upon to confer with agency staff on official 
business is different from attending a meeting or convention 
in which a department or agency is also interested.” 

55 Comp. Gen. at 752–53 (explanatory information provided). Thus, 
5 U.S.C. § 5703 permits an agency to invite a private individual (or more 
than one) to a meeting or conference at government expense, if that 
individual is legitimately performing a direct service for the government 

Page 4-49 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

such as making a presentation or advising in an area of expertise. 
Invitational travel also encompasses private individuals whose travel is a 
necessary incident to the service that provides a direct benefit to the 
government. B-259620, Feb. 29, 1996 (cross-cultural training for spouses of 
Federal Aviation Administration employees living abroad directly benefits 
the agency). See also 71 Comp. Gen. 9 (1991); 71 Comp. Gen. 6 (1991). 
However, 5 U.S.C. § 5703 is not a device for circumventing 31 U.S.C. § 1345. 
The “direct service” test is not met merely because the agency is interested 
in the subject matter of the conference or because the conference will 
enhance the agency’s program objectives. B-251921, Apr. 14, 1993 (EPA 
cannot pay for participants who are not federal employees to attend a 
United Nations-sponsored conference on women’s contributions to solving 
environmental problems because EPA does not benefit directly from their 
attendance). In a somewhat unique set of circumstances, however, GAO 
held that the invitational travel statute permits a private individual, 
appointed by the government, to travel to participate in a state conference 
at government expense if the information imparted by the conference 
provides a direct service to the government. See B-260896, Oct. 17, 1996 
(DOD may pay for nongovernment school board members appointed by 
DOD pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 241(h) (authorizing assistance for local 
education agencies in areas affected by federal agencies, since repealed) to 
travel to participate in state school board conferences and workshops 
because the knowledge and information derived from participation 
provides a direct service for the government). 

(3) Use of grant funds 
One of the principles of grant law is that, where a grant is made for an 
authorized grant purpose, the grant funds in the hands of the grantee are 
not subject generally to many of the restrictions applicable to the direct 
expenditure of appropriations, unless there is a special condition of the 
grant to the contrary. B-153417, Feb. 17, 1964. One of those restrictions, 
which does not apply to grant funds in the hands of a grantee, is 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1345. 

For example, the American Law Institute could use funds provided by the 
Environmental Protection Agency in the form of a statutorily authorized 
training grant to defray transportation and subsistence expenses of law 
students and practicing environmental lawyers at an environmental law 
seminar. 55 Comp. Gen. 750 (1976). For this result to apply, the grant must 
be made for an authorized grant purpose and there must be no provision to 
the contrary in the grant agreement. Once these conditions are met, the 

Page 4-50 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

grantee’s use of the funds is not impaired by 31 U.S.C. § 1345. However, an 
agency may not use the grant mechanism for the sole purpose of 
circumventing 31 U.S.C. § 1345, that is, to do indirectly that which it could 
not do directly. In other words, if an agency makes a grant for an authorized 
purpose, and the grantee sponsors a meeting or conference as a means of 
implementing that purpose, the grantee’s use of the funds will not be 
restrained by 31 U.S.C. § 1345. However, unless otherwise authorized, the 
agency could not make the grant for the purpose of sponsoring the 
conference and thereby permitting payments it could not make by direct 
expenditure. 

Depending on the precise statutory authority involved, there may be 
situations in which sponsoring or helping to sponsor a conference is itself 
an authorized grant purpose. One example is B-83261, Feb. 10, 1949 (grant 
to American Cancer Society under Public Health Service Act). 

The treatment of grant funds described above does not apply to 
procurement contracts. 62 Comp. Gen. 531 (1983). See also B-262110, 
Mar. 19, 1997. 

3. Attorney’s Fees 
a. Introduction Questions on the availability of appropriated funds to pay attorney’s fees 
arise in many contexts. Attorney’s fees awarded by courts are discussed in 
Chapter 14 (Volume III of the second edition of Principles of Federal 
Appropriations Law). This section deals with administrative payments. 
Traditionally, the United States has followed what has come to be known as 
the “American Rule,” that each party in litigation or administrative 
proceedings is personally responsible for his or her own attorney’s fees. In 
other words, in the absence of statutory authority to the contrary, the 
losing party may not be forced to pay the winner’s attorney. E.g., 
Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department Of 
Health & Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001); Alyeska Pipeline 
Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240 (1975). 
One application of the American Rule is that a claimant who prosecutes an 
administrative claim against the United States is not entitled to 
reimbursement of legal fees unless authorized by statute. E.g., 57 Comp. 
Gen. 554 (1978); 49 Comp. Gen. 44 (1969); 37 Comp. Gen. 485, 487 (1958); 

Page 4-51 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

b. Hiring of Attorneys by 
Government Agencies 
B-189045, Jan. 26, 1979. To illustrate, a vendor who successfully filed a 
claim for the payment of goods sold and delivered to a Navy vessel was not 
entitled to reimbursement of attorney’s fees. B-187877, Apr. 14, 1977. 
Similarly nonreimbursable were legal fees incurred incident to prosecuting 
a claim for damages for breach of an oral agreement. B-188607, July 19, 
1977. “Fairness” and “decency,” however appealing, do not compensate for 
the lack of statutory authority. 67 Comp. Gen. 574, 576 (1988); 57 Comp. 
Gen. 856, 861 (1978). 

Payments to attorneys also arise in a number of situations that are, strictly 
speaking, not applications of the American Rule, that is, which do not 
involve payment of fees to a “prevailing party.” The approach in these cases 
is to look first for statutory authority and if express statutory authority 
does not exist, apply the various principles discussed throughout this 
publication, such as the necessary expense doctrine. 

For example, a private attorney sought reimbursement for out-of-pocket 
expenses he incurred incident to a “special proceeding” initiated by the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to investigate charges of 
misconduct raised by the attorney against NRC staff members and by the 
staff members against the attorney. There was no statutory authority to 
reimburse the attorney, nor could the payment be justified as a necessary 
expense since it was not reasonably necessary to carrying out NRC 
functions. Therefore, payment was unauthorized. B-192784, Jan. 10, 1979. 
In another case, the Small Business Administration (SBA) could not 
reimburse a bank for legal fees the bank incurred in protecting its interest 
in an SBA-guaranteed loan since SBA neither contracted with the attorney 
nor did it benefit from his services. B-187950, Apr. 26, 1977. 

The Justice Department has held that legal fees incurred by a Cabinet 
nominee in connection with Senate confirmation hearings, for services 
rendered before the nominating administration took office, could be paid 
either from Presidential Transition Act appropriations or from private 
sources. 5 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 126 (1981). 

The remainder of this section will discuss the situations that have been 
most commonly addressed in decisions of the Comptroller General. 

During the first century of the Republic, government agencies who needed 
lawyers either as counsellors or litigators simply went out and hired them. 
Not only was this system expensive (payments from the public treasury are 
not conducive to reduced fees), it resulted in inconsistencies in the 

Page 4-52 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

government’s legal position. Congress remedied the situation in 1870 by 
creating the Department of Justice, headed by the Attorney General. Act of 
June 22, 1870, ch. 150, 16 Stat. 162. 

To ensure that the objectives of the 1870 legislation would be achieved, 
Congress included section 17, which (a) prohibited executive agencies 
from employing attorneys at the expense of the United States and (b) 
prohibited payments to attorneys, except those employed by the Justice 
Department, unless the Attorney General certified that the services could 
not be performed by the Justice Department. The two parts of section 17 
subsequently became Revised Statutes §§ 189 and 365. 

As the federal government grew in size and complexity, it became apparent 
that the need for centralization of legal services within the Justice 
Department related primarily to the specialty of litigation. Thus, with 
congressional approval, federal agencies regularly employed attorneys to 
serve as legal advisers. (The term “Attorney-Adviser” is still commonly 
used to designate staff attorneys in many government agencies.) When Title 
5 of the United States Code was recodified in 1966, the successors of R.S. 
§§ 189 and 365 were combined into the new 5 U.S.C. § 3106. This statute, 
reflecting the evolved state of the law, prohibits agencies, unless otherwise 
authorized by law, from employing attorneys “for the conduct of litigation 
in which the United States, an agency, or employee thereof is a party, or is 
interested.” The agencies are required to refer such matters to the Justice 
Department.23 Thus, agencies routinely employ attorneys to provide legal 
services other than litigation, but may not employ attorneys as litigators 
unless they have statutory authority to conduct their own litigation or 
unless that authority has been delegated to them by the Attorney General. 

Normally, in view of the existence of the Justice Department and the 
agency’s own staff attorneys, the need for a federal agency to retain private 
counsel should rarely occur. Indeed, GAO has found it unauthorized for an 
agency to retain private counsel to provide legal opinions on matters within 
the Justice Department’s jurisdiction under statutes such as 28 U.S.C. 
§§ 511–514. 16 Comp. Gen. 1089 (1937). In limited situations, the 
Comptroller General has held that the retention of private attorneys as 

23 Many early decisions will be found dealing with R.S. §§ 189 and 365. E.g., 6 Comp. 
Gen. 517 (1927); 5 Comp. Gen. 382 (1925). For the most part they may be disregarded as 
applying statutory provisions that have since been significantly amended or repealed. 
However, decisions under R.S. §§ 189 and 365 remain valid to the extent they concern the 
elements of those statutes that survived into 5 U.S.C. § 3106. E.g., 32 Comp. Gen. 118 (1952).

experts or consultants under 5 U.S.C. § 3109 is authorized. For example, in 
B-192406, Oct. 12, 1978, GAO concluded that the then Civil Service 
Commission could hire a private law firm under 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to serve as 
“special counsel” to the Chairman to investigate alleged merit system 
abuses, since the matter was not covered by 5 U.S.C. § 3106 nor otherwise 
under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department. Similarly, the Navajo and 
Hopi Indian Relocation Commission could retain a private attorney under 
5 U.S.C. § 3109 as an independent contractor to handle matters beyond the 
Justice Department’s jurisdiction, where the workload was insufficient to 
justify hiring a full-time attorney. B-114868.18, Feb. 10, 1978. 

For similar holdings, see Boyle v. United States, 309 F.2d 399 (Ct. Cl. 1962) 
(retired government patent lawyer retained on part-time basis); 61 Comp. 
Gen. 69 (1981) (United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy 
could hire law firm to provide legal analysis of its authority and 
independence); B-210518, Jan. 18, 1984 (Environmental Protection Agency 
could retain private counsel to provide independent analysis of issues 
relating to congressional contempt citation of Administrator). See also 

B133381, July 22, 1977; B-141529, July 15, 1963. 

In B-289701, Feb. 27, 2002, GAO faced an unusual situation. A presidential 
appointee to the Civil Rights Commission had been prevented from taking 
his seat on the Commission when the appointee whose position he was to 
assume refused to give up her seat, arguing that her term had not expired. 
The Justice Department filed suit on behalf of the new appointee. The 
Commission retained private legal counsel to defend the previous 
appointee and argue her case before the court. Justice, citing 28 U.S.C. 
§ 516,24 challenged the Commission’s right to intervene in the litigation. 
Justice objected that neither the Commission nor its officers in their 
official capacity have a right to appear in litigation without the permission 
of the Attorney General, which had not been granted. The district court 
overrode those objections, and ruled in favor of the previous appointee 
(and the Commission). At this point, after the district court had acted but 
before the appeal was completed, GAO was asked whether appropriated 
funds were available to pay for outside counsel. GAO agreed with Justice— 
the Commission had no authority to use appropriated funds to retain counsel 
in order to intervene in the court case in opposition to Justice. In its 

24 “Except as otherwise authorized by law, the conduct of litigation in which the United 
States, an agency, or officer thereof is a party …is reserved to the officers of the Department 
of Justice, under the direction of the Attorney General.” 28 U.S.C. § 516.

decision, the appellate court overturned the district court’s order and held 
in favor of the new appointee. United States v. Wilson, 290 F.3d 347 (D.C. 
Cir. 2002). However, the circuit court did not address whether the 
Commission had authority to intervene. Id. at 352. The court explained: “As 
the United States has not raised this issue on appeal, …we do not decide 
whether this intervention was permissible.” Id. The effect of this was to let 
stand the district court’s order granting Commission intervention. 

Agencies may have specific authority to retain special counsel in addition 
to the lawyers on the regular payroll. For example, appropriations for the 
Federal Communications Commission have traditionally included “special 
counsel fees.” The Comptroller General has construed this authority as 
permitting contractual arrangements with former employees as retired 
annuitants to perform functions for which they were uniquely qualified. 
Since the appropriation provision constitutes independent authority, the 
contracts are not subject to the salary limitations of 5 U.S.C. § 3109. 
53 Comp. Gen. 702 (1974); B-180708, Jan. 30, 1976. However, the authority 
is limited to services of the legal profession and does not embrace 
“counsel” in a broader sense. B-180708, July 22, 1975. 

In B-290005, July 1, 2002, GAO reported that the Interior Department’s Fish 
and Wildlife Service (FWS) had contracted with outside lawyers to obtain 
legal services in connection with various issues of personnel, labor law, and 
discrimination allegations. By law, the Solicitor of the Interior Department 
is solely responsible for the legal work of the Interior Department, 
including the FWS. 43 U.S.C. § 1455. The Solicitor receives a separate 
annual appropriation to fund that work. FWS had not obtained the 
Solicitor’s approval for the legal services contracts, and the Solicitor had 
not exercised any supervisory control over them. GAO concluded that 

(1) FWS had no authority to contract for legal services; (2) FWS’s use of its 
fiscal year 2001 resource management appropriation for this purpose 
constituted a violation of the purpose statute, 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a); and 
(3) FWS had violated the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a). 
c. Suits Against Government 
Officers and Employees 
At one time, government employees were considered largely immune from 
being sued for actions they took while performing their official duties. This 
is no longer true. For a variety of reasons, it is no longer uncommon for a 
government employee to be sued in his individual capacity for something 
he did (or failed to do) while performing his job. For example, the Supreme 
Court held in 1978 that an executive official has only a “qualified immunity” 
for so-called “constitutional torts” (alleged violations of constitutional 
rights). Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478 (1978). In any event, regardless of 

Page 4-55 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

whether the employee ultimately wins or loses, he has to defend the suit 
and therefore will need professional legal representation. 

As a general proposition, GAO considers the hiring of an attorney to be a 
matter between the attorney and the client, and this is no less true when 
the client is a government officer or employee. E.g., 55 Comp. Gen. 1418, 
1419 (1976); B-242891, Sept. 13, 1991. However, the decisions have long 
recognized another principle as well: Where an officer of the United States 
is sued because of some official act done in the discharge of an official 
duty, the expense of defending the suit should be borne by the United 
States. E.g., 70 Comp. Gen. 647, 649 (1991); 6 Comp. Gen. 214 (1926). This 
section will discuss when appropriated funds may be used for attorney’s 
fees to defend a government officer or employee. 

Generally, when a present or former employee is sued for actions 
performed as part of his official duties, his defense is provided by the 
Justice Department. In order for a given case to be eligible for Justice 
Department representation, the Justice Department must determine that 
the employee’s action, which gave rise to the suit, was performed within 
the scope of federal employment, and that providing representation is in 
the interest of the United States. 

The role of the Justice Department derives from a number of statutory 
provisions: 28 U.S.C. §§ 515–519, 543, and 547. See also Exec. Order 
No. 6166, § 5 (1933). These provisions establish the Justice Department as 
the government’s litigator,25 which for the most part means representation 
by Justice Department attorneys.26 To reinforce these provisions, 5 U.S.C. 
§ 3106, previously noted, prohibits executive or military agencies from 
employing attorneys for the conduct of litigation in which the United States 
or one of its agencies or employees is a party or is interested. The agencies 
must refer such matters to the Justice Department. The Justice Department 
has also issued implementing regulations, found at 28 C.F.R. §§ 50.15 and 

50.16.27 This statutory and regulatory scheme is designed to encourage 
25 For a discussion of the historical evolution and current legal basis of the Attorney 
General’s role as “chief litigator,” see 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 47 (1982). 

26 In addition, an executive agency may call upon the Justice Department for help in 
performing the legal investigation of any claim pending in that agency. 28 U.S.C. § 514. 

27 For situations where the Federal Tort Claims Act is the exclusive remedy, see 28 C.F.R. 
pt. 15.

employees to vigorously carry out their duties by assuring them of an 
adequate defense at no cost if they should be sued in the course of 
executing their responsibilities. Cf. Bontkowski v. Smith, 305 F.3d 757, 760 
(7th Cir. 2002) (“It would be absurd to require law enforcement officers to 
defend at their own expense against likely groundless spite suits by the 
people whom they have arrested or investigated.”). 

However, the Attorney General’s decision to provide or not provide counsel 
to an individual employee sued for official actions is discretionary and not 
subject to judicial review. E.g., Turner v. Schultz, 187 F. Supp. 2d 1288, 
1292–97 (D. Colo. 2002); Falkowski v. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, 783 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1014 (1986). 
Cf. Hall v. Clinton, 143 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2001) (Justice Department 
decision to represent a party—as opposed to withholding representation— 
might be reviewable). The Attorney General may take into consideration 
“how blameworthy or litigation-prone the employee seeking representation 
may be.” Falkowski, 783 F.2d at 254. 

In addition, the Comptroller General has recognized that the statutes cited 
above authorize the Justice Department to retain private counsel, payable 
from Justice Department appropriations, if determined necessary and in 
the interest of the United States. E.g., 56 Comp. Gen. 615, 623 (1977); 
B-22494, Jan. 10, 1942. For example, the Justice Department generally will 
not provide representation if the employee is the target of a criminal 
investigation,28 but may authorize private counsel at Justice Department 
expense if a decision to seek an indictment has not yet been made. The 
Justice Department may also authorize private counsel if it perceives a 
conflict of interest between the legal or factual positions of different 
government defendants in the same case. 28 C.F.R. §§ 50.15 and 50.16. See 

28 E.g., B-251141, May 3, 1993 (although no criminal charges or disciplinary actions were 
taken and the matters at issue did concern the performance of agency functions, Food and 
Drug Administration’s request to use its appropriations to reimburse private attorney fees 
incurred by several employees incident to a federal criminal investigation of possible insider 
trader activities should be referred to Justice for consideration); B-242891, Sept. 13, 1991 
(Army may not use appropriated funds to reimburse private legal fees incurred by civilian 
officers of the U.S. Army Chemical Research, Development and Engineering Center 
convicted of multiple criminal environmental protection violations committed in the course 
of pursuing their otherwise official duties relating to the development of chemical warfare 
systems), quoting United States v. Dee, 912 F.2d 741, 744 (4th Cir. 1990), quoting United 
States v. Isaacs, 493 F.2d 1124, 1142–44 (7th Cir. 1974) (“Criminal conduct is not part of the 
necessary functions performed by public officials.”).

1978. 

Thus, an employee who learns that he is being sued should first explore the 
possibility of obtaining representation through the Justice Department. 
Procedures for requesting representation are found in 28 C.F.R. § 50.15(a). 
The importance of this step must be emphasized. If the employee fails to 
immediately seek Justice Department representation, he may find, as 
discussed below, that he is stuck footing the bill for his attorney’s fees even 
in cases where the expense might otherwise have been paid by the 
government. 

If Justice Department representation is unavailable, there are limited 
situations in which appropriations of the employing agency may be 
available to retain private counsel. Generally, before an agency can 
consider using its own funds, Justice Department representation must first 
have been sought and must be appropriate but unavailable, and 
representation must be in the interest of the United States. E.g., B-251141, 
supra. The employee’s personal interest in the outcome does not 
automatically preempt a legitimate government interest. The two may exist 
side-by-side. 

One case, 53 Comp. Gen. 301 (1973), dealt with suits against federal judges 
and other judicial officers.30 The suits arise in a variety of contexts, often 
involving collateral attacks on the judges rulings in original actions. While 
many of the suits are frivolous, some sort of defense, even if only a pro 
forma submission, is almost always necessary. In many cases, such as 
actions where no personal relief is sought against the judicial officer, or in 
potential conflict of interest situations, the Justice Department has 
determined that it cannot or will not provide representation. The 
Comptroller General held that judiciary appropriations are available to pay 
the costs of litigation, including “minimal fees” to private attorneys, if 

29 The decision in 56 Comp. Gen. 615 dealt with civil actions against employees under a prior 
version of section 7217 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. § 7217) for improper 
disclosure of tax returns. The prior version of section 7217 has since been repealed (and 
another statute has been inserted in its place). The remedy is now a suit for damages against 
the United States under 26 U.S.C. § 7431. 

30 Subject to the same kinds of exceptions applied to legal representation of other federal 
employees, the Justice Department is statutorily required to defend federal judges. E.g., 
Bryan v. Murphy, 243 F. Supp. 2d 1375, 1381 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 516).

determined to be in the best interest of the United States and necessary to 
carry out the purposes of the appropriation. However, the Comptroller 
General added that (1) the Justice Department must have declined 
representation, although individual requests are not required for cases 
falling within the Attorney General’s stated policy; (2) the determination of 
necessity cannot be made by the individual defendant but must be made by 
the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts; and (3) the Administrative 
Office should make full disclosure to the appropriate congressional 
committees. Under similar circumstances, appropriations for the public 
defender service are available to defend federal public defenders appointed 
under the Criminal Justice Act who are sued for actions taken within the 
scope of their duties. Id. at 306. 

Nine years after GAO’s ruling in 53 Comp. Gen. 301, a statute was added to 
Title 28 of the United States Code authorizing the Administrative Office of 
the United States Courts to pay the costs (including attorney fees) of 
defending a Chief Justice, justice, judge, officer, or employee of any United 
States court who is “sued in his official capacity, or is otherwise required to 
defend acts taken or omissions made in his official capacity, and the 
services of an attorney for the Government are not reasonably available 
pursuant to chapter 31 of this title.” Pub. L. No. 97-164, title I, § 116(a), 
96 Stat. 25, 32 (Apr. 2, 1982), codified at 28 U.S.C. § 463. This statute was 
intended to address those situations where the Justice Department 
declines to provide representation to a judicial officer or employee on 
grounds of conflict of interest or other ethical reasons. McBryde v. United 
States, 299 F.3d 1357, 1362–63, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting S. Rep. No. 97275, 
at 16). Generally speaking, this provision does not authorize 
reimbursement where the judicial officer or employee was engaged in 
“offensive” rather than “defensive” litigation. Id. at 1365–1367. Regulations 
issued by the Administrative Office to implement 28 U.S.C. § 463 provide 
that the decision to reimburse expenses associated with legal 
representation by private counsel “will be guided by the opinion of the 
Comptroller General in 53 Comp. Gen. 301.” McBryde v. United States, 
50 Fed. Cl. 261, 266 (2001), citing The Guide to Judiciary Policies and 
Procedures, vol. I, ch. XI, pt. D, § 3C (reissued April 2001). 

In 55 Comp. Gen. 408 (1975), the U.S. Attorney had agreed to defend a 
former Small Business Administration (SBA) employee who was sued for 
acts performed within the scope of his employment. The U.S. Attorney later 
withdrew from the case even though the government’s interest in defending 
the former employee continued. In order to protect his own interests, the 
employee retained the services of a private attorney. Since the Justice 

Page 4-59 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Department had determined that it was in the interest of the United States 
to defend the employee and had undertaken to provide him with legal 
representation, the Comptroller General held that SBA could reimburse the 
employee for legal fees incurred as a result of his obtaining private counsel 
when representation by the United States subsequently became 
unavailable. See also B-251141, supra (“In limited circumstances, where 
Justice determines that representation of a federal employee is appropriate 
but is unable to provide representation, agency appropriations may be used 
to pay for legal work that Justice determines to be in the government’s 
interest.”). 

While 53 Comp. Gen. 301 and 55 Comp. Gen. 408 are widely viewed as 
establishing the concept that, in appropriate circumstances, agency 
appropriations may be available to pay private attorney’s fees to defend an 
employee, several later cases established some of the limits on the concept. 

If the employee fails to request Justice Department representation in a 
timely fashion, the employee may be forced to bear the expense of any 
private legal fees incurred. In B-195314, June 23, 1980, an employee of the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was sued for improper disclosure of 
confidential information. The employee requested Justice Department 
representation, but not until after she had hired a private attorney to file an 
answer in order to avoid a default judgment. The Justice Department 
agreed to provide representation, but declined to pay the private legal fees 
since the case was not within either of the situations permitted under the 
Justice Department regulations. Since the facts could not support a finding 
that Justice Department representation was appropriate but unavailable, 
IRS appropriations could not be used either. The need to take prompt 
action to avoid a default judgment makes no difference since the 
regulations expressly provide for provisional representation on the basis of 
telephone contact. 

If the actions giving rise to the suit are not within the scope of the 
employee’s official duties, even though related, there is no entitlement to 
government representation and hence no legal basis to reimburse 
attorney’s fees. For example, in 57 Comp. Gen. 444 (1978), a Department of 
Agriculture employee was sued for libel by his supervisor because of 
allegations contained in letters the employee had written to various public 
officials. At the employee’s insistence, Agriculture wrote to the Justice 
Department to request representation. However, Agriculture concluded 
that, while some of the employee’s actions had been within the scope of his 
official duties, others—such as writing letters to the President and to a 

Page 4-60 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Senator—were not. Before the Justice Department reached its decision, the 
employee retained private counsel and was successful in having the suit 
dismissed. Subsequently, the Justice Department determined that the 
employee would not have been eligible for representation since Agriculture 
had been unwilling to say that all of the employee’s actions were within the 
scope of his official duties. On this basis, GAO found no entitlement to 
government representation and disallowed the employee’s claim for 
reimbursement of his legal fees. 

Similarly, GAO denied a claim for legal fees where an Army Reserve 
member on inactive duty was arrested by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), charged with larceny of government property, and the 
charge was later dismissed. The government property involved consisted of 
service weapons and ammunition. The member had been authorized to 
retain weapons and ammunition in his personal possession, although it is 
not clear from the decision how this authority justified the possession of 
seven guns and over 100,000 rounds of ammunition, which is what the FBI 
found. In any event, the member’s actions did not result from the 
performance of required official duties but were at best permissible under 
existing regulations. Therefore, there was no entitlement to either 
government-furnished or government-financed representation. B-185612, 
Aug. 12, 1976. 

A related situation is where an employee incurs legal fees defending against 
a fine. In section C.6 of this chapter on Fines and Penalties, a distinction is 
drawn between an action that is a necessary part of an employee’s official 
duties and an action which, although taken in the course of performing 
official duties, is not a necessary part of them. By logical application of this 
reasoning, where the fine itself is not reimbursable, related legal fees are 
similarly nonreimbursable. Thus, in 57 Comp. Gen. 270 (1978), the 
Comptroller General held that the employing agency could not pay legal 
fees incurred by one of its employees defending against a reckless driving 
charge, where the Justice Department had declined to provide 
representation or to authorize retention of private counsel. See also 
B-192880, Feb. 27, 1979 (nondecision letter); 15 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 57, 
63 (1991). 

In 70 Comp. Gen. 647, supra, the Smithsonian Institution used federal 
funds to provide legal services to an Interior Department employee (on 
detail at the Smithsonian) who became the subject of federal civil and 
criminal investigations. After a big-game hunt in China, some hunters and 
the Interior Department employee (whom the hunters had paid to serve as 

Page 4-61 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

their game advisor) were charged with violating the Endangered Species 
Act. The Interior Department employee was also charged with conflicts of 
interest in his financial arrangements. GAO held that the Smithsonian 
lacked authority to use appropriated funds to pay the employee’s attorney. 
Id. at 652. GAO explained: 

“Our cases do not support and were not intended to allow 
agencies to pursue their own litigative policies. Instead, they 
recognize the availability of agency appropriations, where 
otherwise proper and necessary, for uses consistent with 
the litigative policies established for the United States by 
the Attorney General…. To allow the use of appropriated 
funds [to defend a government employee against a federal 
criminal investigation and prosecution] would seriously 
undermine the litigative posture of the Attorney General 
[and contradict] the clearly expressed intent of the 
Congress to centralize control of government litigation 
under the Attorney General, and to restrict the availability 
of appropriations in order to reinforce that policy.” 

Id. at 650–651 (citation omitted). 

Sometimes, agencies chafe under the maxim (noted above) that agency 
appropriations are available, where otherwise proper and necessary, for 
uses consistent with the litigative policies established for the United States 
by the Attorney General. The decision in 73 Comp. Gen. 90 (1994) offers a 
case in point. The United States Information Agency (USIA) was caught up 
in a sex discrimination class action. The Justice Department was defending 
the lawsuit, and required USIA to support its effort by providing a secure 
suite of offices, office supplies and equipment, and four to six attorneys, 
the same number of paralegal/document specialists, along with other 
support staff, all on a full-time basis. Normally, USIA’s General Counsel 
staff included only eight attorneys. For its part, the Justice Department 
dedicated two full-time attorneys and one full-time paralegal to the task 
force. Justice refused to allow USIA to contract-out for the additional staff, 
insisting instead that USIA hire them under temporary appointments. Id. 
at 90–91. 

USIA asked GAO to require Justice to reimburse USIA for its expenses, 
which USIA estimated at $4.6 million over fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1994. 
Since Justice gets annual appropriations to cover litigative expenses, USIA 

Page 4-62 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

argued, Justice’s annual appropriations had been improperly augmented. 
73 Comp. Gen. at 91–92. 

GAO replied, “[T]here is no legal or equitable requirement that litigation 
support costs be shared equally, or even proportionately, between Justice 
and its client agencies.” Id. at 94. The expenses at issue represented “no 
more than the cost to USIA of gathering and presenting to Justice the facts 
and agency perspectives necessary to allow Justice to represent USIA in 
court, a typical example of agency support for Justice litigators.” Id. GAO 
explained: 

“The limitations on the use of agency appropriations to 
provide litigative services originated as part of the 
provisions that created the Justice Department and invested 
it with general responsibility to act as the government’s 
litigator…These provisions were intended to reinforce 
Justice’s control of the conduct of litigation involving the 
United States, not to bar agencies from using their 
appropriations to assist in the defense of litigation. Our 
cases ‘recognize the availability of agency appropriations, 
where otherwise proper and necessary, for uses consistent 
with the litigative policies established for the United States 
by the Attorney General.’” 

Id. at 93–94, quoting 70 Comp. Gen. at 650–51 (citing 39 Comp. Gen. 643 
at 646–47 (1960)). 

Of course, every rule has its exceptions. In B-289288, July 3, 2002, a 
Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DODDS) employee, who 
worked at a DODDS school in Japan, had been arrested, charged, and 
eventually convicted of criminal violations of Japanese law involving the 
importation and possession of marijuana. Under 10 U.S.C. § 1037, local 
counsel was retained to defend the employee in the Japanese courts. Read 
together, the plain terms of section 1037 and the regulations implementing 
it required DOD to provide legal services to persons “employed by or 
accompanying [U.S.] armed forces in an area outside the United States,” 
even when the matter is unrelated to and wholly beyond the scope of the 
employee’s official duties. 10 U.S.C. § 1037(a). Funding is to come from 
“[a]ppropriations available to the military department concerned …for the 
pay of persons under its jurisdiction.” 10 U.S.C. § 1037(c). The statute 
leaves no role for the Justice Department in these matters.

Questions over reimbursement of legal fees also arise in a number of 
nonjudicial contexts. In B-193712, May 24, 1979, GAO concluded that the 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could reimburse a staff psychiatrist, who 
had been directed to prepare a psychological profile of Daniel Ellsberg as 
part of his official duties, for the cost of legal representation before 
congressional investigating committees and professional organizations. 
While the Justice Department regulations authorize representation at 
congressional proceedings on the same basis as in lawsuits (28 C.F.R. 
§ 50.15(a)), this is not an area within Justice Department’s exclusive 
representation authority. Therefore, while it may be desirable to first 
request Justice Department representation, failure to do so in this case did 
not preclude the use of CIA appropriations, based on an administrative 
determination that the psychiatrist’s activities were necessary to carry out 
authorized CIA functions. As in the judicial context, payment is generally 
unauthorized where it is not in furtherance of an official agency interest. 
See U.S. General Accounting Office, Postal Service: Board of Governors 
Contract for Legal Services, GAO/GGD-87-12 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 10, 
1987) (questioning propriety of payment of legal fees of Board member 
incident to congressional investigation of prenomination activities). 

The Justice Department will not provide representation in administrative 
disciplinary proceedings because of the potential conflict in the event the 
employee later sues the government. In one case, GAO concluded that the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) could retain private counsel to 
represent two NRC staff members at a disciplinary proceeding where the 
agency determined that the employees had been acting within the scope of 
their authority. B-127945, Apr. 5, 1979. See also B-192784, Jan. 10, 1979. 

In another case, however, 58 Comp. Gen. 613 (1979), the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) could not reimburse the legal fees of an SEC 
employee at a disciplinary hearing even though the proceeding was 
ultimately resolved in the employee’s favor. The distinction is that in the 
NRC case, the misconduct charge had been raised and pursued by a third 
party, whereas in the SEC case, while the charge was initially raised by an 
outside party, it was pursued based on the SEC’s independent 
determination to investigate the allegation. The point of this distinction is 
that, once the agency determines to investigate the employee, its interests 
and those of the employee are no longer “aligned.” E.g., B-245648.2, July 24, 
1992 (even though the administrative investigation was precipitated by a 
congressional subcommittee, since the IRS conducted it, IRS’s interests 
were no longer aligned with those of its employee, and the attorney fees 
incurred by the employee as a result of the investigation could not be 

Page 4-64 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

reimbursed); B-245712.3, May 20, 1992 (Department of Agriculture 
employee, subject to an Inspector General investigation instigated by a 
third party, may not be reimbursed for the attorney fees he incurred since 
the agency, having decided to investigate the employee, no longer had a 
common interest with him). In other words, the interests of the agency and 
employee have diverged and it is no longer possible to justify providing 
representation to the employee as a necessary and appropriate expense of 
the agency. Also, the determination to provide legal representation must be 
made at the outset of the proceedings and not at the end based on the 
outcome. GAO reached the same result in 70 Comp. Gen. 628 (1991) 
(Forest Service investigative report leading to criminal trial ending in 
acquittal on all charges), and in B-212487, Apr. 17, 1984 (Inspector General 
misconduct investigation). 

An agency may use its appropriated funds to provide legal representation 
for an employee brought before the Merit Systems Protection Board 
(MSPB) on a complaint by the MSPB Special Counsel, if the agency 
determines that the employee’s conduct was in furtherance of or incident 
to carrying out his or her official duties, and that providing representation 
would be in the government’s interest. 67 Comp. Gen. 37 (1987); 61 Comp. 
Gen. 515 (1982). Of course, this principle is not limited to cases pending 
before MSPB. See, e.g., B-251141, supra (federal criminal investigation). If 
the agency makes the required determinations, the expenditure is viewed 
as a “necessary expense” of the agency or function. While the necessary 
expense theory is the legal basis, the underlying policy is expressed in the 
following excerpt: 

“Surely federal employees must be answerable for illegal 
conduct. Yet it can be in the interest of neither the 
government as a whole nor the taxpayers we serve to have 
employees afraid to function out of fear of being bankrupted 
by a lawsuit arising out of the good faith performance of 
their jobs.” 

67 Comp. Gen. at 37–38. Similarly, see, for example, 15 Op. Off. Legal 
Counsel, supra, at 62–63. 

Appropriated funds may not be used to pay legal fees incurred by an 
“alleged discriminating official” in a discrimination complaint. 61 Comp. 
Gen. 411 (1982); B-201183, Feb. 1, 1985. 

Page 4-65 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Government-financed legal counsel was also held improper at a grievance 
hearing where the legal liability of the employee was not an issue and the 
purpose of the hearing was solely to develop facts. 55 Comp. Gen. 1418. 

Where reimbursement of legal fees under the above principles is 
authorized, it is a discretionary payment and not a legal entitlement of the 
employee. The agency’s responsibilities and discretion are summarized in 
the following paragraph from 67 Comp. Gen. at 38: 

“[I]t should be understood that payment in this type of case 
is not a legal liability on the part of the agency, but is 
essentially a discretionary payment. As such, an agency is 
not required to pay the entire amount of the fees actually 
charged in any given case. The controlling concept under 
fee-shifting statutes is a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee, and 
there is a vast body of judicial precedent applying this 
concept under statutes such as the Back Pay Act and Title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act. This body of precedent is 
available to provide guidance to agencies in evaluating the 
reasonableness of claims. Also, since payment is 
discretionary, an agency is free to formulate administrative 
policies with respect to treatment of claims of this type. Of 
course, any such policies should be applied fairly and 
consistently.” 

The preceding cases have all involved legal fees incurred for representation 
of the employee. A different situation occurred in 59 Comp. Gen. 489 
(1980). In 1969, local police raided a Chicago apartment housing members 
of the Black Panther Party. The raid erupted into violence and two of the 
occupants were killed. Subsequently, the surviving occupants and the 
estates of the deceased sued state law enforcement officials and several 
agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), alleging violations of 
civil rights and the Illinois wrongful death statute. The Justice Department 
represented the federal defendants, who were being sued in their individual 
capacities. 

As the litigation progressed, a possibility emerged that the court might 
grant the plaintiffs an award of attorney’s fees, in part against the FBI 
agents. The Justice Department asked whether FBI appropriations would 
be available to reimburse such an award. In the past, the Comptroller 
General has at times declined to render decisions on questions that are 
premature and essentially hypothetical. Here, however, in view of the legal 

Page 4-66 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

d. Suits Unrelated to Federal 
Employees 
strategy proposed by the Justice Department (the case also involved issues 
raising the potential liability of the United States), it was important to know 
if the fees could be reimbursed because if they could not, it might be 
necessary for the defendants to retain private counsel to represent their 
interests. The Comptroller General resolved the question by applying the 
necessary expense doctrine. If the FBI made an administrative 
determination, supported by substantial evidence, that the actions giving 
rise to the award constituted officially authorized conduct and were taken 
as a necessary part of the defendant’s official duties, it could reimburse the 
award from its Salaries and Expenses appropriation. 

Finally, the concept of using agency appropriations for legal fees when 
Justice Department representation is unavailable has arisen in a couple of 
contexts that are unrelated to suits against government employees. Under 
25 U.S.C. § 175, the U.S. Attorneys will generally represent Indian tribes, 
and under 25 U.S.C. § 13, the Bureau of Indian Affairs may spend money 
appropriated for the benefit of Indians for general and incidental expenses 
relating to the administration of Indian affairs. Construing these provisions, 
the Comptroller General has held that the Bureau of Indian Affairs could 
use appropriated funds to pay legal fees incurred by Indian tribes in judicial 
litigation, including intervention actions and cases where the tribe is the 
plaintiff, when conflict of interest makes Justice Department 
representation unavailable. However, the Bureau must first give the Justice 
Department the option of providing or declining to provide representation. 
The Bureau may also use appropriated funds for legal fees of Indian tribes 
in administrative proceedings in which the Justice Department does not 
participate. 56 Comp. Gen. 123 (1976). 

The courts have recognized that this authority carries with it substantial 
discretion. For example, in Hopi Tribe v. United States, 55 Fed. Cl. 81 
(2002), suit was brought to recover legal fees and expenses incurred in 
litigation pursuant to the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act of 1974. The court 
held that, under 25 U.S.C. §§ 13, 175, Justice and the Bureau both have 
broad discretion in determining whether to provide legal services or 
reimbursement for the costs of obtaining them elsewhere. Among other 
things, the court explained that because Congress appropriates lump sums 
to Justice and the Bureau for these purposes, the question of how best to 
use those sums is committed to agency discretion. Hopi Tribe, 55 Fed. Cl. 
at 97–98, quoting Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192–195 (1993), quoting 
both 55 Comp. Gen. 307, 319 (1975), and Principles of Federal

(1) Discrimination proceedings 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, made applicable to the federal 
government by the Equal Employment Opportunity Amendments of 1972, 
broadly prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, 
sex, or national origin. Two statutory provisions are relevant to the 
awarding of attorney’s fees. Judicial awards, covered in Chapter 14 
(Volume III of the second edition of the Principles of Federal 
Appropriations Law), are governed by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k), which 
authorizes courts to award reasonable attorney’s fees to nonfederal 
prevailing parties. In addition, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(b) directs the former 
Civil Service Commission to enforce Title VII in the federal government 
“through appropriate remedies …as will effectuate the policies of this 
section.” The enforcement function was transferred to the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1978. 

The concept of administrative fee awards developed largely as the result of 
a series of court decisions. First, the courts held that a court can award 
attorney’s fees to include compensation for services performed in related 
administrative proceedings as well as the lawsuit itself. Parker v. Califano, 
561 F.2d 320 (D.C. Cir. 1977); Johnson v. United States, 554 F.2d 632 (4th 
Cir. 1977). Then, the District Court for the District of Columbia held that 
Title VII authorized the administrative awarding of attorney’s fees. 
Patton v. Andrus, 459 F. Supp. 1189 (D.D.C. 1978); Smith v. Califano, 
446 F. Supp. 530 (D.D.C. 1978). However, this view was not unanimous. The 
court in Noble v. Claytor, 448 F. Supp. 1242 (D.D.C. 1978), held that there 
was no authority for administrative awards and that only the court could 
award fees. 

31 The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has wrestled with a related issue: whether the Justice 
Department may defend tribes or tribal employees against suits for constitutional torts. OLC 
concluded that the 1990 amendments to the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act of 1975 cover only those torts for which the Federal Tort Claims Act waives 
the sovereign immunity of the United States and do not authorize or otherwise address 
representation of tribes or tribal employees who are sued in their individual capacities for 
constitutional torts. Opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, for the Assistant Attorney 
General Civil Division, Coverage Issues Under The Indian Self-Determination Act, Apr. 22, 
1998.

GAO was initially inclined toward the view expressed in the Noble decision. 
See B-167015, Apr. 7, 1978. However, GAO reconsidered its position and 
subsequently announced that it would not object to the issuance of 
regulations by the EEOC to include the awarding of attorney’s fees at the 
administrative level. B-193144, Nov. 3, 1978; B-167015, Sept. 12, 1978; 
B-167015, May 16, 1978 (all nondecision letters). 

EEOC issued interim regulations on April 9, 1980 (45 Fed. Reg. 24130), and 
subsequently finalized them. The regulations, found at 29 C.F.R. § 1613.271, 
provide for awards of reasonable attorney’s fees both by EEOC and by the 
agencies themselves. With the issuance of these regulations, federal 
agencies now have the requisite authority. B-199291, June 19, 1981; 
B-195544, May 7, 1980 (nondecision letter). 

Attorney’s fees awarded under the EEOC regulations are payable from the 
employing agency’s operating appropriations and not from the permanent 
judgment appropriation established by 31 U.S.C. § 1304.32 64 Comp. 
Gen. 349, 354 (1985); B-199291, supra. Cf. B-257334, June 30, 1995 (except 
as specifically provided by law, the permanent judgment appropriation is 
not available to pay administrative awards, including administrative 
settlements for compensatory damages under Title VII). 

32 As noted above, this chapter does not address the payment of litigative awards, which is 
covered in Chapter 14. Accordingly, the text here is speaking only about the payment of 
administrative awards. 

We note in passing, however, that a recently enacted law has changed the payment process 
for litigative attorney fees and other litigative awards rendered against certain federal 
agencies (including “executive agencies” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 105) arising from claims of 
discrimination or whistle-blowing retaliation against federal employees, former federal 
employees, or applicants for federal employment. Under the new law, known as the 
“Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002” (or 
“NoFEAR,” for short), these litigative awards will now be paid initially from the permanent, 
indefinite Judgment Fund appropriation. Within a reasonable time thereafter, the federal 
agency involved must reimburse the Judgment Fund from its operating appropriations. See 
Pub. L. No. 107-174, § 1(a), 116 Stat. 566 (May 15, 2002), to be codified at 5 U.S.C. § 2301 
note. As a result of this law, all awards against federal agencies for discrimination or 
whistle-blowing retaliation against federal employees, former federal employees, or 
applicants for federal employment (including associated attorney fee awards)—whether 
litigative or administrative—will ultimately be paid from agency operating appropriations, 
which is one of the main goals Congress intended the new law to accomplish S. Rep. No. 
107-143, at 1–3, 7–8 (2002).

GAO will not review awards of, nor consider claims for, attorney’s fees 
under Title VII. 69 Comp. Gen. 134 (1989); 61 Comp. Gen. 326 (1982); 
B-259632, June 12, 1995. 

Title VII is not the only statute prohibiting discrimination in federal 
employment. Discrimination based on age or handicap is prohibited, 
respectively, by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. 
§§ 621 et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. 
The EEOC has enforcement responsibility for federal employment under 
these statutes as well as Title VII.33 

Initially, GAO had held that the EEOC could provide by regulation for the 
awarding of attorney’s fees at the administrative level under the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act and the Rehabilitation Act, just as in the 
Title VII situation. 59 Comp. Gen. 728 (1980). Subsequently, the courts held 
that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act did not authorize fees at 
the administrative level, and GAO partially overruled 59 Comp. Gen. 728 in 
64 Comp. Gen. 349 (1985). However, that portion of 59 Comp. Gen. 728 
dealing with the Rehabilitation Act remains valid. See also B-204156, 
Sept. 13, 1982. This treatment is consistent with the EEOC regulations, 
which authorize administrative fee awards under Title VII and the 
Rehabilitation Act, but not the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. See 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(e) (formerly codified at § 1613.271(d)). 

The situation may become more complicated where an employee alleges 
discrimination on more than one ground. In 69 Comp. Gen. 469 (1990), an 
agency settled a complaint in which the employee had alleged both age and 
sex discrimination. Based on the agency’s assertion that the result would 
have been the same if the employee had pursued only the sex 
discrimination charge, GAO concluded that the agency was not required to 
“apportion” the attorney’s fee claim between the two charges and that the 
entire fee claim could be paid. 

(2) Other employee claims 
Prior to October 1978, there was no authority to award attorney’s fees to 
federal employees in connection with claims, grievances, or administrative 

33 EEOC is not responsible for the entire Rehabilitation Act. The Architectural and 
Transportation Barriers Compliance Board is responsible for insuring compliance with the 
standards prescribed in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. 29 U.S.C. § 792.

proceedings involving back pay, adverse personnel actions, or other 
personnel matters. During this time period, GAO consistently denied claims 
for attorney’s fees based on the general rule barring the payment of legal 
fees in the absence of statutory authority. E.g., 52 Comp. Gen. 859 (1973) 
(administrative grievance proceeding); B-167461, Aug. 9, 1978 (unfair labor 
practice proceeding); B-184200, Apr. 13, 1976 (reduction in grade); 
B-183038, May 9, 1975 (improper removal for disciplinary reasons). 

In October 1978, the Civil Service Reform Act added two attorney’s fee 
provisions as part of its general overhaul of the system. 

First, it authorized the Merit Systems Protection Board to require the 
employing agency to pay reasonable attorney’s fees if the employee is the 
prevailing party and the Board determines that the fee award is “warranted 
in the interest of justice.” 5 U.S.C. § 7701(g). Fees awarded under this 
provision are payable directly to the attorney, not the party. Jensen v. 
Department of Transportation, 858 F.2d 721 (Fed. Cir. 1988).34 

Second, it added an attorney’s fee provision to the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5596. Now, if an employee, based on a timely appeal or an administrative 
determination, including grievance or unfair labor practice proceedings, is 
found by “appropriate authority”35 to have suffered a loss or reduction of 
pay as a result of an “unjustified or unwarranted personnel action,” the 
employee is entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to 
back pay. Id. § 5596(b). See generally B-258290, June 26, 1995; B-231813, 
Aug. 22, 1989. 

Regulations to implement the Back Pay Act are issued by the Office of 
Personnel Management and are found at 5 C.F.R. pt. 550, subpt. H. Under 
the regulations, fees may be awarded only if the “appropriate authority” 
determines that payment is in the interest of justice, applying standards 
established by the Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 U.S.C. § 7701. 
5 C.F.R. § 550.807(c)(1). The standards are set forth in Allen v. United 

34 Of course, different statutes often dictate different results with respect to who should 
receive payment. Cf., e.g., Heston v. Secretary of Health & Human Services, 41 Fed. Cl. 41, 
45–46 (1998) (distinguishing the result in Jensen, supra.) 

35 The term “appropriate authority” includes the head of the employing agency, a court, the 
Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board (but not the MSPB 
Special Counsel, 59 Comp. Gen. 107 (1979)), the Comptroller General (see, e.g., 63 Comp. 
Gen. 170 (1984) and 62 Comp. Gen. 464 (1983)), the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, plus a few others. 5 C.F.R. § 550.803.

States Postal Service, 2 M.S.P.R. 420 (1980), and discussed in Sterner v. 
Department of the Army, 711 F.2d 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1983), and in 62 Comp. 
Gen. 464. For “[a] review of the case law,” see Abramson v. United States, 
45 Fed. Cl. 149, 151–152 (1999). 

GAO will not review decisions awarding or declining to award, nor 
consider claims for, fees under 5 U.S.C. § 7701. B-257593, Aug. 15, 1994 
(GAO has no authority to review any MSPB decision, citing, among others, 
61 Comp. Gen. 578 (1982)—disavowing authority to review fee awards 
under section 7701); 63 Comp. Gen. at 174; 61 Comp. Gen. 290 (1982). The 
Back Pay Act regulations provide for review of fee determinations only “if 
provided for by statute or regulation.” 5 C.F.R. § 550.8067(g) (formerly at 
5 C.F.R. § 550.06(g)). Thus, absent some statute or regulation to the 
contrary, GAO will similarly decline to review fee determinations under 
5 U.S.C. § 5596 where the “appropriate authority” is someone other than 
the Comptroller General. 61 Comp. Gen. 290. 

While GAO will not “review” such matters, it may provide its opinion on 
them, when requested by the agency or the accountable officer. For 
example, in B-253507, Jan. 11, 1994, the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA) asked GAO if it could pay attorney fees as part of 
an administrative settlement, even though NARA had not determined that 
an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action had occurred. NARA 
argued that because the employee could have appealed to the Merit 
Systems Protection Board and possibly obtained attorney fees (as 
discussed in the following paragraph), NARA had implied authority to 
award attorney fees as part of its settlement. GAO disagreed. NARA had no 
statutory authority to pay attorney fees under the facts and laws applicable 
to the case. The fact that the employee could have appealed and might have 
won did not authorize NARA and the employee to behave as if the 
employee actually had appealed and won. Id. See also B-258290, supra 
(advance decision, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3529, disapproved payment of 
attorney fees and other amounts arising from a grievance hearing wherein 
the agency declined to find an unjustified or unwarranted personnel 
action); B-257893, June 1, 1995 (certifying officer granted relief from 
liability, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3528(b)(1)(B), for the erroneous payment, 
which was the subject of B-253507, supra). 

Under a provision added in 1989, if an employee, former employee, or 
applicant for employment is the prevailing party before the Merit Systems 
Protection Board (MSPB), and MSPB’s decision is based on a finding of a 
“prohibited personnel practice” (defined in 5 U.S.C. § 2302), “the agency

involved shall be liable” to the complainant for reasonable attorney’s fees. 
The same liability applies with respect to appeals from the Board, 
regardless of the basis of the decision. 5 U.S.C. § 1221(g), added by the 
Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16, 30 
(Apr. 10, 1989). 

Employee claims outside the scope of the Back Pay Act or the MSPB 
authority remain subject to the general rule prohibiting fee awards except 
under specific statutory authority. Thus, administrative claims for 
attorney’s fees were denied in the following situations: 

• Applicant for employment with Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
successfully challenged adverse information in security investigation 
file. B-194507, Aug. 20, 1979. 

• Nuclear Regulatory Commission employee detailed in violation of the 
Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), supra, as retaliation for the 
disclosure of government illegality, waste, and corruption. Although 
WPA does provide for attorney fees in certain circumstances, employee 
used agency grievance procedures not subject to WPA. 72 Comp. 
Gen. 289 (1993). 

• Employee obtained continuance in divorce proceedings. Continuance 
was necessitated by temporary duty assignment. B-197950, Sept. 30, 
1980. Cf. 70 Comp. Gen. 329 (1991) (legal fees incurred to search title, 
prepare abstracts, conveyances and other documents required in the 
chain of conveying property interest from seller to buyer that are 
normally reimbursable under Federal Travel Regulations (FTR), 
¶ 26.2c, but may not be reimbursed here as original court order was 
part of a divorce settlement; modification of divorce order constituted 
continuation of a litigated matter; litigation costs may not be 
reimbursed under the FTR); B-242154, Mar. 28, 1991 (FTR does not 
allow reimbursement of litigation costs, even though employee 
“sustained a loss that he would not have sustained had he not 
transferred in the interest of the government”). 

• A military member’s legal fees incident to custody proceedings, and 
medical insurance expenses for his adopted children are not “qualifying 
adoption expenses” under section 638 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989, Pub. L. No. 100-180, 
§ 638, 101 Stat. 1019, 1106–1108 (Dec. 4, 1987), as amended, and may 
not be reimbursed (but legal fees incident to the actual petition and

order of adoption, as well as the amendment of birth certificates for the 
member’s adopted children are reimbursable from agency funds under 
the Act). B-235606, Feb. 7, 1991. 

• Former employee successfully prosecuted administrative patent 
interference action against National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. B-193272, Aug. 21, 1981. 

• Fees incurred incident to prosecution of claim for relocation expenses. 
68 Comp. Gen. 456 (1989); B-186763, Mar. 28, 1977. 

• Employee, selling residence incident to transfer of duty station, 
incurred legal fees in excess of customary range of charges for services 
rendered. B-200207, Sept. 29, 1981 (legal fees within customary range of 
charges are reimbursable; see cases cited). Similarly, see B-252531, 
Aug. 13, 1993 (attorney fees claimed were duplicative of attorney fees 
already paid as part of the services provided by the relocation service 
company). 

• Administrative grievance proceeding involving neither an appeal to the 
Merit Systems Protection Board nor a reduction or denial of pay or 
allowances. B-253507 n.5, supra; 68 Comp. Gen. 366 (1989); 61 Comp. 
Gen. 411 (1982). 

The same rule applies to expert witness expenses incurred by an employee. 
They are reimbursable only under specific statutory authority. In 67 Comp. 
Gen. 574 (1988), a Department of Energy employee had requested an 
administrative hearing incident to a security clearance. The agency, due to 
the sudden unavailability of its witness, was forced to reschedule the 
hearing. The employee’s witness, a clinical psychologist, was unable to 
reschedule his patients to fill the now freed-up time slot, and charged the 
employee for the 3 hours he had set aside to testify. GAO found no 
authority to reimburse the employee. 

f. Criminal Justice Act The Criminal Justice Act (CJA), 18 U.S.C. § 3006A, was originally enacted 
in 1964 and substantially amended on several subsequent occasions. 
Reflecting a series of Supreme Court decisions on the right of a criminal 
defendant to counsel, the CJA establishes a system of government-financed 
counsel for indigent defendants in federal criminal cases. In general, any 
person charged with a felony or misdemeanor, including juvenile 
delinquency, and who is “financially unable to obtain adequate 
representation” is eligible for counsel under the CJA. Counsel is to be 
Page 4-74 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

provided at every stage of the proceeding, from the first appearance before 
a magistrate through appeal, including appropriate ancillary matters. As the 
Supreme Court has expanded the right to counsel to encompass every 
meaningful stage at which significant rights may be affected (see, e.g., 
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)), the right to counsel under the 
CJA has similarly expanded. 

The lawyers, who are court-appointed, may be private attorneys appointed 
on an individual basis or members of a Federal Public Defender 
Organization or Community Defender Organization established and funded 
under the Act. The attorneys are paid at rates of compensation specified in 
the statute. Appropriations are made to the Judiciary to carry out the Act 
CJA and payments are supervised by the Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts. 

(1) Types of actions covered 
Originally, GAO had held that the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) did not apply 
to probation revocation proceedings. 45 Comp. Gen. 780 (1966). 
Subsequently, following the Supreme Court’s holding in Mempa v. Rhay, 
389 U.S. 128 (1967), GAO modified the 1966 decision to recognize the 
applicability of the Act to probation proceedings coupled with deferred 
sentencing. However, GAO continued to hold the Act inapplicable to a 
“simple” probation revocation proceeding (one not involving deferred 
sentencing). 50 Comp. Gen. 128 (1970). Two months after the issuance of 
50 Comp. Gen. 128, Congress passed Public Law 91-447, substantially 
amending the CJA. Pub. L. No. 91-447, 84 Stat. 916 (Oct. 14, 1970). One of 
the changes made by these amendments was to expressly cover probation 
proceedings. The legislative history of Public Law 91-447 indicates that it 
was intended to recognize Mempa v. Rhay. H.R. Rep. No. 91-1546, at 7 
(1970). GAO has not had occasion to issue any further decisions on 
probation proceedings. 

Another change made by the 1970 amendments was to add parole 
revocation proceedings, with counsel to be provided at the discretion of 
the court or magistrate. Subsequent legislation made appointment of 
counsel mandatory, and the Comptroller General held that appropriations 
under the CJA are available to provide counsel for indigents at parole 
revocation and parole termination proceedings under the Parole 
Commission and Reorganization Act. B-156932, June 16, 1977. 

Page 4-75 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Representation may be provided, at the discretion of the court or 
magistrate, to an indigent prosecuting a writ of habeas corpus (28 U.S.C. 
§§ 2241, 2254, 2255). 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(a)(2). This authority does not 
extend to civil rights actions brought by indigent prisoners under 42 U.S.C. 
§ 1983. 53 Comp. Gen. 638 (1974); B-139703, June 19, 1975. 

In 51 Comp. Gen. 769 (1972), GAO held that the CJA applied to 
prosecutions brought in the name of the United States in the District of 
Columbia Superior Court and Court of Appeals. In 1974, Congress passed 
the District of Columbia Criminal Justice Act (Pub. L. No. 93-412, 88 Stat. 
1089 (Sept. 3, 1974)), which established a parallel criminal justice system 
for the District of Columbia patterned after 18 U.S.C. § 3006A. With the 
enactment of this legislation, the CJA was amended to remove the District 
of Columbia courts from its coverage. GAO considered the D.C. statute in 
61 Comp. Gen. 507 (1982) and construed it to include sentencing. The 
result should apply equally to the federal statute inasmuch as the language 
being construed is virtually identical in both laws. 

(2) Miscellaneous cases 
When a court appoints an attorney under the Criminal Justice Act (CJA), 
the government’s contractual obligation, and hence the obligation of 
appropriations, occurs at the time of the appointment and not when the 
court reviews the voucher for payment, even though the exact amount of 
the obligation is not determinable until the voucher is approved. Where 
fiscal year appropriations are involved, the Administrative Office of the 

U.S.Courts must record the obligation based on an estimate, and the 
payment is chargeable to the fiscal year in which the appointment was 
made. 50 Comp. Gen. 589 (1971). 
In B-283599, Sept. 15, 1999, the Executive Officer of the District of 
Columbia Courts told GAO that he anticipated fiscal year 1999 
appropriations for CJA claims would be exhausted on September 10, 1999. 
How, he asked, should the courts respond to CJA claims received during 
the remainder of fiscal year 1999? Should the courts suspend approving 
CJA vouchers in order to avoid violating the Antideficiency Act? GAO said, 
“No.” CJA representation is a mandatory expense. An overobligation 
entirely attributable to a mandatory spending program, like CJA, would be 
an overobligation authorized by law and, therefore, not a violation of the 
Antideficiency Act. See 31 U.S.C. §§ 1341(a)(1)(A) and (B). However, this 
did not mean that the vouchers could be paid immediately on approval. A 
legally available funding source would still be required before any 

Page 4-76 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


g. Equal Access to Justice Act 
Chapter 4

authorized overobligations could be liquidated. Fortunately, GAO noted, a 
bill then pending in Congress would provide funds for this purpose. 
B-283599, supra. See also U.S. General Accounting Office, D.C. Courts: 
Planning and Budgeting Difficulties During Fiscal Year 1998, 

GAO/AIMD/OGC-99-226, at 11–13 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 16, 1999). (For a 
full discussion of the law governing federal obligations, see Chapter 7.) 

An attorney appointed and paid under the CJA does not thereby enter into 
an employer-employee relationship with the United States for purposes of 
the dual compensation laws. 44 Comp. Gen. 605 (1965). (This decision 
predated the 1970 amendments to the CJA, which created the Federal 
Public Defender Organizations, and would presumably not apply to full-
time salaried attorneys employed by such organizations.) 

An attorney regularly employed by the federal government who is 
appointed by a court to represent an indigent defendant, in either federal or 
state cases, may not be excused from official duty without loss of pay or 
charge to annual leave. 61 Comp. Gen. 652 (1982); 44 Comp. Gen. 643 
(1965). 

An attorney appointed under the CJA is expected to use his or her usual 
secretarial resources. As a general proposition, secretarial and other 
overhead expenses are reflected in the statutory fee and are not separately 
reimbursable. However, there may be exceptional situations, and if the 
attorney can demonstrate to the court that extraordinary stenographic or 
other secretarial-type expenses are necessary, they may be reimbursed 
from Criminal Justice Act appropriations. 53 Comp. Gen. 638 (1974). 

A significant diminution of the American Rule occurred in 1980 with the 
enactment of the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which authorizes the 
awarding of attorney’s fees and expenses in a number of administrative and 
judicial situations where fee-shifting had not been previously authorized. 
This section describes the authority for administrative awards. 

The administrative portion of the EAJA is found in 5 U.S.C. § 504. There are 
four key elements to the statute: 

1. The administrative proceeding generating the fee request must be an 
“adversary adjudication,” defined as an adjudication under the 
Administrative Procedure Act in which the position of the United 
States is represented by counsel or otherwise. 5 U.S.C. §§ 504(a)(1), 
(b)(1)(C). The definition excludes adjudications to fix or establish a 
Page 4-77 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

rate or to grant or renew a license, but proceedings involving the 
suspension, annulment, withdrawal, limitation, amendment, 
modification, or conditioning of a license are covered if they otherwise 
qualify.36 (Application in the context of government procurement is 
discussed separately later.) 

2. The party seeking fees must be a “prevailing party other than the United 
States.” 5 U.S.C. § 504(a)(1). The meaning of “prevailing party” is to be 
determined by reference to case law under other fee-shifting statutes.37 
Of course before you can be a “prevailing party” you must first be a 
“party,” and the law prescribes financial and other eligibility criteria. 
5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(B). 
3. The law is not self-executing. The party must, within 30 days after final 
disposition of the adversary adjudication, submit an application to the 
agency showing that it is a prevailing party and meets the eligibility 
criteria, documenting the amount sought, and alleging that the position 
of the United States was not “substantially justified.” 5 U.S.C. 
§ 504(a)(2). If the United States appeals the underlying merits, action 
on the application must be deferred until final resolution of the appeal. 
Id. 

4. If the above criteria are met, the fee award is mandatory unless the 
agency adjudicative officer finds that “the position of the agency was 
substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award 
unjust.” 5 U.S.C. § 504(a)(1).38 Substantial justification or lack thereof is 
to be determined “on the basis of the administrative record as a whole, 
which is made in the adversary adjudication.” Id. The “position of the 
agency” includes the agency’s action or failure to act which generated 
the adjudication as well as the agency’s position in the adjudication 
itself. 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(E). A party who “unreasonably protracts” the 
proceedings risks reduction of the award. 5 U.S.C. § 504(a)(3). 
36 S. Rep. No. 96-253, at 17 (1979) (report of the Senate Judiciary Committee). 

37 S. Rep. No. 96-253, supra, at 7; H.R. Rep. No. 96-1418, at 11 (1980) (report of House 
Judiciary Committee). 

38 A position is “substantially justified” if it is “justified to a degree that could satisfy a 
reasonable person.” Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988). See also Immigration & 
Naturalization Service v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 157 n.6 (1990); Dantran, Inc. v. Department 
of Labor, 246 F.3d 36, 40–41 (1st Cir. 2001).

The award includes “fees and other expenses.” “Fees” means a reasonable 
attorney’s fee, generally capped at $125 per hour unless the agency 
determines by regulation that cost-of-living increases or other special 
factors justify a higher rate.39 “Other expenses” include such items as 
expert witness expenses and the necessary cost of studies, analyses, 
engineering reports, etc. 5 U.S.C. § 504(b)(1)(A). 

The statute requires agencies to establish, by regulation, uniform 
procedures for administering the statute, in consultation with the 
Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS). 5 U.S.C. 
§ 504(c)(1). In 1986, ACUS has published a set of nonbinding model rules., 
found at 51 Fed. Reg. 16659 (May 6, 1986) (formerly codified in 1 C.F.R. 
pt. 315). Among other things, the supplementary information statement for 
those rules, found at 51 Fed. Reg. 16659 (May 6, 1986), advised agencies 
that the statutory requirement to consult with ACUS will be met by simply 
notifying ACUS of the publication of proposed regulations, or by sending 
ACUS a pre-publication draft for review and comment. Id. There’s only one 
problem: ACUS was terminated in 1995 when its annual appropriation 
stipulated that funds for it were “available [only] for the purposes of [its] 
prompt and orderly termination.” Treasury, Postal Service, and General 
Government Appropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-52, title IV, 109 Stat. 
468, 480 (Nov. 19, 1995), codified at 5 U.S.C. § 591 (note preceding section). 
Although ACUS is now history, someone forgot to fix the statute. Compare 
5 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1) (requiring agencies to consult ACUS) and 5 U.S.C. 
§ 593–595 (establishing ACUS). 

Payment of administrative EAJA awards is addressed in 5 U.S.C. § 504(d): 

“Fees and other expenses awarded under this subsection 
shall be paid by any agency over which the party prevails 
from any funds made available to the agency by 
appropriation or otherwise.”40 

39 Pierce v. Underwood, supra, identified a number of factors that may not be used as 
“special factors” to justify exceeding the cap: novelty and difficulty of issues; undesirability 
of the case; work and ability of counsel (except for counsel with “distinctive knowledge or 
specialized skill” relevant to the case); results obtained; customary fees and awards in other 
cases; contingent nature of the fee. 487 U.S. at 571–74. See also, e.g., Hyatt v. Barnhart, 
315 F.3d 239, 249 (4th Cir. 2002). 

40 This provision was added in 1985. The payment provision in the original EAJA was 
complex and confusing. The amendment was designed to preclude payment under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1304, the permanent judgment appropriation.

As with judicial awards under 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d), 5 U.S.C. § 504 awards 
are payable from agency operating appropriations with no need for 
specific, line-item, or “earmarked” appropriations.41 

The obligation of the agency’s appropriations occurs when the agency 
issues its decision on the fee application. 62 Comp. Gen. 692, 699 (1983). 
This determines the fiscal year to be charged. Sometimes, the logic of this 
rule eludes an agency that is otherwise striving to be prudent and 
responsible in the management of its legal responsibilities and fiscal 
obligations. In B-255772, Aug. 22, 1995, the Justice Department and the 
National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) sought GAO’s guidance regarding 
whether the NEA could pay an EAJA attorney fee settlement using 
unobligated NEA appropriations from previous fiscal years. For several 
years, NEA had realized that a then pending case would eventually require 
NEA to pay EAJA attorney fees from its appropriations pursuant to 
28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(4). In anticipation of this, NEA began setting aside a 
portion of its annual appropriations across several fiscal years so that, 
when the time to pay finally arrived, NEA would have funds adequate to 
meet its obligations without adversely affecting other NEA operations. 
However, when the settlement was finally completed, questions arose 
about whether the funds NEA set aside could legally be used for this 
purpose. Of course, they could not. As a general principle, “[a] court or 
administrative award creates a new right in the successful claimant, giving 
rise to new government liability.” B-255772, quoting 63 Comp. Gen. 308, 310 
(1984). NEA had no obligation to pay the claims until the settlement 
agreement was final. In the absence of appropriate statutory authority, the 
funds NEA had set aside in previous fiscal years had expired, and were not 
legally available to liquidate the obligation of a later fiscal year—the year in 
which the settlement agreement became final. Id. See also B-257061, 
July 19, 1995 (except as otherwise provided by law, (a) FAA must use 
appropriations available at time of award to pay attorney fees from a Title 
VII discrimination complaint, and (b) had FAA set aside appropriations in a 
prior fiscal year, when the complaint was filed, they would not have been 
available for this purpose). 

Section 504 permits fee awards to intervenors who otherwise meet the 
statutory criteria. 62 Comp. Gen. at 693. As noted in that decision, the 

41 Authorities for this proposition are cited in Chapter 14 (Volume III of the second edition of 
Principles of Federal Appropriations Law) in our discussion of the judicial portion of 
EAJA, which has an identical payment provision.

Administrative Conference expressed the same position in the preamble to 
an earlier version of the model rules, although commenting further that 
intervenors would rarely be in a position to actually receive awards. Id. 
at 693–94. A specific appropriation act restriction on compensating 
intervenors will override the more general authority of 5 U.S.C. § 504. 
62 Comp. Gen. 692; Electrical District No. 1 v. Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, 813 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1987); Business & Professional 
People for the Public Interest v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 793 F.2d 
1366 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (court agreed with result in 62 Comp. Gen. 692, 
implicitly accepting premise that EAJA itself could apply to intervenors). 

We previously reviewed statutory authorities for awarding attorney’s fees 
in a variety of matters involving federal employees. Initially, the law in this 
area, especially with respect to EAJA, appeared unsettled. The Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that 5 U.S.C. § 504 does not 
authorize the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to award attorney’s 
fees in cases involving employee selection or tenure. Gavette v. Office of 
Personnel Management, 808 F.2d 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1986); Olsen v. 
Department of Commerce, Census Bureau, 735 F.2d 558 (Fed. Cir. 1984). 
This is was because the definition of “adversary adjudication” in section 
504 refers to 5 U.S.C. § 554 (part of the Administrative Procedure Act), 
which expressly excludes “the selection or tenure of an employee.” This 
was consistent with an earlier decision of the District of Columbia Circuit. 
Hoska v. Department of the Army, 694 F.2d 270 (D.C. Cir. 1982). However, 
the court in Miller v. United States, 753 F.2d 270 (3rd Cir. 1985), reached a 
contrary result. 

A review of the case law since Gavette suggests that it and its progeny may 
have quietly assumed the prevailing position in the circuits.42 Despite the 
passage of nearly two decades, the conflict does not appear to have been 
expressly addressed by the Supreme Court, and at least one commentator 
has concluded, “The Federal Circuit’s decision in Gavette resolve[d] the 
conflicts among the lower courts.” Nancy A. Streeff, Note, Gavette v. Office 
of Personnel Management: The Right To Attorney Fees Under The Equal 
Access To Justice Act, 36 Am. U. L. Rev. 1013, 1025 (1987). 

42 The First Circuit handed Gavette down later in time, and took advantage of the 
opportunity to comment on Miller. 808 F.2d at 1462–63. The Third Circuit has yet to reply, 
either with its analysis of Gavette, or with a renewal or a repudiation of its support for 
Miller.

Prior to Gavette, the MSPB had taken the position that the existence of 
other fee-shifting statutes made EAJA inapplicable. Social Security 
Administration v. Goodman, 28 M.S.P.R. 120, 126 (1985). However, in view 
of the implication of Gavette that EAJA might apply in cases not involving 
employee selection or tenure, the MSPB reopened the Goodman appeal, 
found that fees could be awarded in that case under 5 U.S.C. § 7701, and 
declined to comment further on the applicability of EAJA. Social Security 
Administration v. Goodman, 33 M.S.P.R. 325, 326–27 n.1 (1987). See also, 
e.g., NLRB v. Boyce, 51 M.S.P.R. 295, 300 n.4 (1991). 

GAO held in 68 Comp. Gen. 366 (1989) that EAJA did not authorize a fee 
award to an employee who prevailed in an agency grievance proceeding 
that did not meet the standard of an “adversary adjudication.” See also 
72 Comp. Gen. 289 (1993) (attorney fee provision of the Whistleblower 
Protection Act does not apply where employee uses informal agency 
grievance procedure). (This being the case, it was irrelevant whether or not 
the grievance involved selection or tenure.) 

Where a MSPB decision is appealed to the courts, including a decision 
involving selection or tenure, the majority view is that EAJA permits the 
court to award fees for the judicial proceedings, the relevant standard now 
being a “civil action” under 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d) rather than an “adversary 
adjudication” under 5 U.S.C. § 504. See Maritime Management, Inc. v. 
United States, 242 F.3d 1326, 1336 (11th Cir. 2001) (fees disallowed for bid 
protest proceedings before GAO, but allowed in associated civil action). 
See also Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Commission, 814 F.2d 
1564 (Fed. Cir. 1987); Gavette, 808 F.2d at 1462–65; Miller, 753 F.2d at 274– 
75; Olsen, 735 F.2d at 561. Here, however, the Hoska case is in 
disagreement. 

To the extent EAJA is inapplicable either to the MSPB or to a court 
reviewing a MSPB action, all is not necessarily lost to the fee applicant 
because EAJA is not exclusive in these situations. The MSPB and the 
courts both may award fees under the Back Pay Act in appropriate cases, 
and the MSPB additionally has 5 U.S.C. § 7701. Thus, for example, Hoska, 
while finding EAJA inapplicable, awarded fees under the Back Pay Act. 

(1) Bid protests 
Prior to 1984, attorney’s fees incurred by a bidder for a government 
contract in pursuing a bid protest with GAO were not compensable. 
57 Comp. Gen. 125, 127 (1977); B-197174, Aug. 25, 1980; B-192910, Apr. 11, 
1979. The question arose again upon enactment of the Equal Access to 

Page 4-82 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Justice Act (EAJA) in 1980. However, since a bid protest at GAO is not an 
adversary adjudication governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 
EAJA was equally unavailing. Maritime Management, Inc. v. United 
States, 242 F.3d 1326, 1336 (11th Cir. 2001) (fees disallowed for bid protest 
proceedings before GAO). See also 63 Comp. Gen. 541 (1984); 62 Comp. 
Gen. 86 (1982); B-251668, May 13, 1993; B-211105.2, Jan. 19, 1984. 

Under the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3554(c)(1), GAO may recommend that a protester be reimbursed the 
costs of filing and pursuing a protest, including reasonable attorney’s fees, 
where it finds that a solicitation or the award of a contract does not comply 
with statute or regulation. This is to relieve parties with valid claims of the 
burden of vindicating the public interests that Congress seeks to promote. 
68 Comp. Gen. 506, 508 (1989). The costs and fees are payable from the 
contracting agency’s procurement appropriations. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3554(c)(2) (contracting agency “shall …pay the costs promptly”). 

GAO’s approach under 31 U.S.C. § 3554(c) is to recommend that the 
contracting agency pay the protest costs and allow the protester and 
agency to negotiate the appropriate amount. If the parties cannot agree, 
GAO will determine the amount. 4 C.F.R. §§ 21.8(d), (e), and (f) (formerly at 
4 C.F.R. §§ 21.6(d) and (e)). A protester seeking to recover the costs of 
pursuing its protest must submit sufficient evidence to support its 
monetary claim; the amount claimed may be recovered to the extent that 
the claim is adequately documented and is shown to be reasonable. 
B-240327.3, Dec. 30, 1994. See, e.g., B-291657, Feb. 11, 2003. 

GAO’s bid protest authority is not exclusive. A protester may also seek 
resolution with the contracting agency, file a bid protest at the Court of 
Federal Claims after having its protest denied at GAO, or go directly to the 
Court of Federal Claims in lieu of filing a protest at GAO. 31 U.S.C. § 3556. 
Once a case is in court, 31 U.S.C. § 3554(c) is out of the picture, and the 
court may consider a fee application under the judicial portion of EAJA. 
E.g., Essex Electro Engineers, Inc. v. United States, 757 F.2d 247 (Fed. Cir. 
1985); Laboratory Supply Corp. of America v. United States, 5 Cl. Ct. 28 
(1984). 

Bid protest disputes often give rise to significant operational delays. 
Sometimes, rather than litigate the bid protest and then correct the flaws in 
its procurement, an agency will try to “buy off” a bid protester with a 
monetary settlement. This practice is known as “Fedmail.” Typically, the 
payment is for bid protest preparation expenses, including legal fees. In

U.S.General Accounting Office, ADP Bid Protests: Better Disclosure and 
Accountability of Settlements Needed, GAO/GGD-90-13 (Washington, D.C.: 
Mar. 30, 1990), at 31, GAO indicated that it would question the propriety of 
Fedmail payments, if and when it came across them. 71 Comp. Gen. 340, 
342 (1992). In 71 Comp. Gen. 340, a Fedmail arrangement went sour when 
the disbursing officers of the Defense Supply Service-Washington refused 
to make payment under the agreement. This was inopportune, to say the 
least, as the parties had already secured dismissal of the protest from the 
General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA)43 
pursuant to their Fedmail agreement. The GSBCA did not know about the 
Fedmail agreement when it ordered the dismissal. Once it learned of it, 
GSBCA declined to modify its dismissal order. Consequently, the agency 
asked GAO to issue an advance decision authorizing the payment. 
However, as it had threatened in GAO/GGD-90-13, GAO objected to the 
payment as improper and without legal authority: 
“We do not believe that in making appropriations available 
to an agency for the procurement of goods and services, 
Congress intended those funds to be available to allow the 
agency to obtain the withdrawal of a meritorious protest 
without taking appropriate corrective action. In addition, 
…[w]e are not aware of any statute that would permit the 
Army to pay attorney fees in the circumstances of this case.” 

71 Comp. Gen. at 342. 

(2) Contract disputes 
Under the original (1980) version of the Equal Access to Justice Act 
(EAJA), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that (1) a court, 
reviewing a decision of an agency board of contract appeals, could, under 
the judicial portion of EAJA, make a fee award covering services before 
both the board and the court, but that (2) boards of contract appeals were 
not authorized to independently make EAJA fee awards. Fidelity 
Construction Co. v. United States, 700 F.2d 1379 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 
464 U.S. 826 (1983). 

43 At that time, GSBCA was authorized to hear bid protests involving automatic data 
processing procurements under the so-called Brooks Act, formerly codified at 40 U.S.C. 
§ 759. The Brooks Act has since been repealed, Pub. L. No. 104-106, § 5101, 110 Stat. 186, 680 
(1996).

i. Public Participation in 
Administrative 
Proceedings: Funding of 
Intervenors 
The 1985 EAJA amendments legislatively overturned Fidelity to the extent 
it held 5 U.S.C. § 504 inapplicable to boards of contract appeals. E.g., 
Ardestani v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 502 U.S. 129, 138 
(1991); Dantran, Inc. v. Department of Labor, 246 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir. 
2001); Texas Instruments, Inc. v. United States, 991 F.2d 760, 767 (Fed. 
Cir. 1993). Specifically, the law amended the definition of “adversary 
adjudication” to expressly include appeals to boards of contract appeals 
under the Contract Disputes Act. The 1985 amendments also added 
language to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d) to make it clear that fee awards are 
authorized when a contractor appeals a contracting officers decision 
directly to a court instead of to a board of contract appeals, as authorized 
by the Contract Disputes Act. (As noted in the preceding paragraph, 
appeals to court from board decisions were already covered.) The fees 
recovered under this authority are limited to services provided after the 
contracting officers decision and do not include services provided in order 
to argue the matter before the contracting officer. See Levernier 
Construction, Inc. v. United States, 947 F.2d 497, 500–503 (Fed. Cir. 1991). 

A number of regulatory agencies conduct administrative proceedings and 
take actions that have a direct public impact. A prime example is licensing. 
An important concern has been that the agency may not receive a balanced 
presentation of viewpoints. The reason is that the industries being 
regulated usually have adequate resources to ensure representation of their 
interests, while lack of resources may preclude participation by various 
nonindustry “public interest” representatives. 

The Comptroller General has considered questions of intervenor funding. 
An “intervenor” in this context means someone who is not a direct party to 
the proceedings. Stated briefly, the rule is that an agency may use its 
appropriations to fund intervenor participation, including attorney’s fees, 
if— 

1. intervenor participation is authorized, either expressly by statute or by 
necessary implication derived from a regulatory or licensing function; 
2. the agency determines that the participation is reasonably necessary to 
a full and fair determination of the issues before it; and 
3. the intervenor could not otherwise afford to participate. 
Page 4-85 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

This is essentially an application of the “necessary expense” doctrine 
discussed previously in this chapter. Thus, intervenor funding does not 
require express statutory authority, but it must relate to accomplishing the 
objectives of the appropriation sought to be charged, and of course must 
not be otherwise prohibited. The agency must have authority to encourage 
or accept intervenor participation in connection with an authorized 
function for which its appropriations are available. In this sense, it may be 
said that intervenor funding must have a statutory foundation. 

Historically the concept of intervenor funding emerged in the early 1970s. 
In 1970, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) held that an indigent 
respondent in an FTC hearing was entitled to government-furnished 
counsel. American Chinchilla Corp., 1970 Trade Reg. Rep. ¶ 19059. 
Following the Chinchilla case, the FTC asked whether it could pay certain 
related expenses for the indigent respondent, such as transcript costs and 
attorney’s expenses. It also asked whether it could pay the same expenses 
when incurred by an indigent intervenor rather than the respondent. 

In the first of the intervenor cases, B-139703, July 24, 1972, GAO answered 
“yes” to both questions. Noting that FTC had statutory authority to grant 
intervention “upon good cause shown,” the Comptroller General responded 
to the intervenor question as follows: 

“Thus, if the Commission determines it necessary to allow a 
person to intervene in order to properly dispose of a matter 
before it, the Commission has the authority to do so. As in 
the case of an indigent respondent, and for the same 
reasons, appropriated funds of the Commission would be 
available to assure proper case preparation.” 

A few years later, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission asked whether it 
was authorized to provide financial assistance to participants in its 
adjudicatory and rulemaking proceedings. Finding that NRC had statutory 
authority to admit intervenors, the Comptroller General applied the 
“necessary expense” rationale of B-139703, and answered “yes.” B-92288, 
Feb. 19, 1976. 

Page 4-86 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

In this decision, GAO explained why the “American rule” as set forth in 
Alyeska Pipeline Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240 (1975),44 does not 
apply to bar the payment of attorney’s fees. The distinction is that the 
American rule limits the power of a court or an agency to require an 
unwilling defendant to pay the attorney’s fees of a prevailing plaintiff or 
intervenor. In cases like B-139703 and B-92288, an administrative body, 
exercising its rulemaking function, is attempting to encourage public 
participation in its proceedings. It does this by willingly assuming 
representation costs for intervenors who would otherwise be financially 
unable to participate, in order to obtain their input for a balanced 
rulemaking effort. Only by obtaining a balanced view can the agency 
perform its function of protecting the public interest. 

Next, in a letter to the Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations 
Subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign 
Commerce, GAO advised that the rationale of B-92288, supra, applied 
equally to nine agencies under the Subcommittees jurisdiction. The nine 
were: Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, 
Federal Power Commission, Interstate Commerce Commission, Consumer 
Product Safety Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Food 
and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. B-180224, May 10, 1976. 

GAO pointed out in the same letter that there were several possible ways of 
providing assistance to qualifying participants: 

1. Provision of funds directly to participants. 
2. Modification of agency procedural rules so as to ease the financial 
burdens of public participation. 
3. Provision of technical assistance by agency staff. (However, this cannot 
include assigning staff members to participants to help them with their 
advocacy positions.) 
4. Provision of legal assistance by agency staff, but again not as 
advocates. 
44 The Supreme Court reiterated the “American Rule” recently in Buckhannon Board & Care 
Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health & Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 602 
(2001). 

Page 4-87 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

5. Creation of an independent public counsel. (However, the public 
counsel cannot be beyond the agency’s jurisdiction and control.) 
6. Creation of a consumer assistance office, as long as it remains under 
the agency’s jurisdiction and control and does not act as an advocate. 
In subsequent decisions and opinions, GAO examined aspects of the 
programs of several specific agencies. In each case, GAO consistently 
applied the rationale of the earlier decisions. The cases are: 

• Environmental Protection Agency: 59 Comp. Gen. 424 (1980); B-180224, 
Apr. 5, 1977; 

• Federal Communications Commission: B-139703, Sept. 22, 1976; 

• Food and Drug Administration: 56 Comp. Gen. 111 (1976); 

• Nuclear Regulatory Commission: 59 Comp. Gen. 228 (1980); and 

• Economic Regulatory Administration (a component of the Department 

of Energy): B-192213-O.M., Aug. 29, 1978; U.S. General Accounting 

Office, Department of Energy’s Procedures in Funding Intervenors in 

Proceedings before the Economic Regulatory Administration, EMD


78-111 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 2, 1978). 

While the decisions have consistently upheld the legality of intervenor 
funding under the necessary expense theory, GAO has nevertheless 
emphasized the desirability of an agency’s seeking specific statutory 
authority to embark on a public participation program. E.g., B-180224, 
supra; B-92288, supra. Congress has acted in several instances, authorizing 
intervenor funding in some cases and prohibiting it in others. 

For example, the Environmental Protection Agency has intervenor funding 
authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2605(c), and 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission has such authority under the 
Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2056(c). Similarly, from 1975 
until recently, the Federal Trade Commission was given specific authority 
to fund intervenor participation in 1975 by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty– 
Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, formerly, 15 U.S.C. 

Page 4-88 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

§ 57a(h).45 Under this legislation, payments for legal services could not 
exceed the costs actually incurred, even though the participant used 
“house counsel” whose rate of pay was lower than prevailing rates. 
57 Comp. Gen. 610 (1978). 

Restrictions in appropriation acts have prohibited intervenor funding 
programs for several agencies. For example, a provision in the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commissions (NRC) 1981 appropriation prohibited the use of 
funds for the expenses of intervenors. The Comptroller General construed 
this restriction as prohibiting the NRC from adopting a “cost reduction 
program” of providing transcripts and other documents free to intervenors. 
B-200585, Dec. 3, 1980. However, NRC could reduce the number of copies 
of documents required to be filed. Id. Also, NRC could decide to provide 
free transcripts to all parties, intervenors included, without violating the 
restriction. B-200585, May 11, 1981. Other cases construing the NRC 
restriction, or successor versions, are Business & Professional People for 
the Public Interest v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 793 F.2d 1366 

(D.C. Cir. 1986); 67 Comp. Gen. 553 (1988); and 62 Comp. Gen. 692 (1983). 
Appropriation act restrictions have also prohibited intervenor funding by 
the Economic Regulatory Administration and the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC). A case involving the FERC prohibition is 

Electrical District No. 1 v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 

813 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In addition, the conference committee on the 
1980 appropriation for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
and the former Civil Aeronautics Board directed that no funds be allocated 
by these agencies for intervenor funding programs.46 

A restriction contained solely in legislative history and not carried into the 
statutory language itself is not legally binding on the agency. The history of 
the NRC prohibition will illustrate this. For fiscal year 1980, the prohibition 
was expressed in committee reports but not in the appropriation act itself. 
Accordingly, GAO told NRC that, while it would be well advised to 
postpone its program, the restriction was not legally binding. 59 Comp. 
Gen. 228 (1980). For fiscal year 1981, the prohibition was written into 
NRC’s appropriation act. Similarly, the restriction noted above for the 

45 Authority repealed by Pub. L. No. 103-312, § 3, 108 Stat. 1691 (Aug. 26, 1994).

transportation agencies later “graduated” to a general provision in the 
statute.47 

One court has disagreed with the GAO decisions. Greene County Planning 
Board v. Federal Power Commission (Greene County IV), 559 F.2d 1227 
(2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086 (1976).48 There, after several years of 
litigation, the plaintiff Board had finally prevailed in its attempt to compel 
relocation of a proposed high kilovolt power line through a scenic portion 
of the county. The only question remaining was the ability of the Federal 
Power Commission (FPC) to reimburse the plaintiff’s attorney’s fees. 
(Though not “indigent,” the counsel fees had drained a disproportionate 
amount of the county’s resources.) The FPC had denied reimbursement on 
the grounds that the Board was protecting its own, not the public, interest 
and because it thought it lacked authority to reimburse the fees. After first 
concluding that the issue should be remanded to the FPC so that it could 
determine the propriety of reimbursement in accordance with the 
Comptroller General’s decisions, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals 
granted a rehearing en banc. On rehearing, the majority opinion held that 
the FPC lacked authority to reimburse the attorney’s fees. Greene 
County IV, 559 F.2d at 1238. 

Subsequently, both GAO and the Justice Departments Office of Legal 
Counsel took the position that Greene County IV applied only to the former 
FPC, and not to other federal agencies or even to the agencies that 
succeeded to the FPC’s responsibilities. 59 Comp. Gen. 228; 2 Op. Off. Legal 
Counsel 60 (1978). In addition, the U.S. District Court for the District of 
Columbia has likewise determined that Greene County IV does not extend 
generally to all agencies. Chamber of Commerce v. United States 
Department of Agriculture, 459 F. Supp. 216 (D.D.C. 1978), upholding the 
authority of the Department of Agriculture to fund a consumer study on the 
impact of certain proposed rules. 

Thus, to determine whether a given agency has intervenor funding 
authority, it is necessary first to examine the legislation, including 
appropriation acts, applicable to that agency, as well as pertinent judicial 

47 E.g., Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990, Pub. 

L. No. 101-164, § 306, 103 Stat. 1069, 1092 (Nov. 21, 1989). 
48 The Greene County litigation produced several published decisions: 455 F.2d 412 (2nd Cir. 
1972), 490 F.2d 256 (2nd Cir. 1973), 528 F.2d 38 (2nd Cir. 1975), and the decision cited in the 
text, known as “Greene County IV.”

decisions. In the absence of statutory direction one way or the other, and if 
there are no judicial decisions on point, it is then appropriate to apply the 
necessary expense rationale of the GAO decisions. 

The later decisions somewhat refined the standards expressed in the 
earlier cases. For example, in order to constitute a “necessary expense,” 
the participation does not have to be absolutely indispensable in the sense 
that the issues could not be decided without it. It is sufficient for the 
agency to determine that a particular expenditure for participation can 
reasonably be expected to contribute substantially to a full and fair 
determination of the issues. 56 Comp. Gen. 111. This is consistent with the 
application of the necessary expense doctrine in other contexts as 
discussed throughout this chapter. Assuming the requisite statutory basis 
for intervention exists, the determination of necessity must be made by the 
administering agency itself, not by GAO. Id. See also B-92288, supra. 

The standard of the participant’s financial status was discussed in 59 Comp. 
Gen. 424 (1980). While the participant need not be literally indigent, the 
authority to fund intervenor participation extends only to individuals and 
organizations which could not afford to participate without the assistance. 
In making this determination, the agency should consider the income and 
expense statements, as well as the net assets, of an applicant. An applicant 
does not qualify for assistance merely because it cannot afford to 
participate in all activities it desires. The applicant is expected to choose 
those activities it considers most significant and to allocate its resources 
accordingly. 

Some of the earlier cases held that advance funding was prohibited by 
31 U.S.C. § 3324. 56 Comp. Gen. 111; B-139703, Sept. 22, 1976. However, in 
view of the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, an 
agency with statutory authority to extend financial assistance in the form 
of grants may be able to utilize advance funding in its public participation 
program. A 1980 decision, 59 Comp. Gen. 424, applied this concept to the 
program of the Environmental Protection Agency. 

The decisions have all dealt with participation in the agency’s own 
proceedings. There would generally be no authority to fund intervenor 
participation in someone else’s proceedings, for example, participation by a 
state agency in a state utility ratemaking proceeding. B-178278, Apr. 27, 
1973 (nondecision letter).

Finally, the GAO decisions in no way imply that an agency is compelled to 
fund intervenor participation. They hold merely that, if the various 
standards are met, an agency has the authority to do so if it wishes. See 
B-92288, supra. 

A summary and discussion of intervenor funding through early 1981 may be 
found in U.S. General Accounting Office, Review of Programs for 
Reimbursement for Public Participation in Federal Rulemaking 
Proceedings, PAD-81-30 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 4, 1981). See also Rollee H. 
Efros, “Payment of Intervenors Expenses in Agency Regulatory 
Proceedings,” Cases in Accountability: The Work of the GAO (Washington, 
D.C.: Westview Press,1979), pp. 171–181. 

4. Compensation 
Restrictions 
“If an officer is not satisfied with what the law gives him for 
his services, he may resign.” 

Embry v. United States, 100 U.S. 680, 685 (1879), quoted in Lincoln v. 
United States, 418 F. Supp. 1094, 1095 (N.D. Cal. 1976). 

As a general proposition, restrictions on the compensation of federal 
employees are regarded as matters of personnel law that are now under the 
jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management.49 However, 
compensation restrictions may also be viewed as limits on the “purpose 
availability” of appropriations. We specifically treat three compensation-
related topics in this chapter—the restrictions on dual compensation, the 
restrictions on employing aliens, and the statutes concerning forfeiture of 
retirement annuities and retired pay—as illustrations of the different ways 
in which Congress may exercise its constitutional role of controlling the 
public purse by prescribing the purposes for which appropriated funds may 
be used. The provision on aliens is a restriction appearing in annual 
appropriation acts. The dual compensation and forfeiture statutes are 

49 The 104th Congress enacted two laws, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1996, 
Pub. L. No. 104-53, § 211, 109 Stat. 514, 535 (Nov. 19, 1995), and the General Accounting 
Office Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 Stat. 3826 (Oct. 19, 1996), that transferred GAO’s 
authority over the settlement of claims and related advance decisions, waivers, and other 
functions (including judgment fund payments and transportation carriers appeals) to the 
Executive Branch. Federal employees’ claims for compensation and leave, and settlement of 
deceased employees’ accounts were assigned to Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 
Office of General Counsel, Claims Adjudication Unit. In April 2000, this function was 
transferred to OPM’s Office of Merit Systems Oversight and Effectiveness.

permanent provisions found in the United States Code; while not phrased 
in terms of appropriation restrictions, the effect is the same. 
a. Dual Compensation Section 5536 of title 5 of the United States Code prohibits a civilian 
employee or member of the uniformed services whose pay is fixed by 
statute or regulation from receiving additional pay from public money for 
any other service or duty, unless authorized by law.50 This is a purpose 
restriction on how an agency may spend its appropriation. For instance, 
GAO found that paying the actual cost of personal cell phone use for 
government business is permitted but not at a flat rate because an 
established fee per day is equivalent to an allowance in addition to salary, 
and, therefore, is prohibited by 5 U.S.C. § 5536. B-287524, Oct. 22, 2001. 
GAO has also held in several cases that the provision of free food while on 
duty violates the prohibition against dual compensation. See, e.g., 42 Comp. 
Gen. 149, 151 (1962); B-272985, Dec. 30, 1996. 
b. Employment of Aliens For many years, with minor variations from year to year, various 
appropriation acts have included provisions restricting the federal 
employment of aliens. The typical prohibition, with exceptions to be noted 
below, bars the use of appropriated funds to pay compensation to any 
officer or employee of the United States whose post of duty is in the 
continental United States unless that person is a U.S. citizen. In more 
recent years, the prohibition has appeared as a general provision in the 
Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government appropriation acts, 
applicable to funds contained “in this or any other act.”51 A recurring 
general provision in the Defense Department appropriation act exempts 
Defense Department personnel from the alien restriction.52 
The prohibition applies to all appropriated funds unless expressly provided 
otherwise. Therefore, it applies to the special deposit accounts established 
by statute for the Senate and House restaurants since these accounts 

50 We note in passing that there are other laws limiting the salaries paid to federal 
employees. E.g., 18 U.S.C. § 209 (salary of government employees payable only by United 
States). However, this discussion is limited to laws that constitute purpose restrictions on 
an agency’s use of appropriations to pay salaries. 

51 For example, the 2003 provision is found in Pub. L. No. 108-7, div. J, title VI, § 605, 117 Stat. 
11, 464 (Feb. 20, 2003) (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 3101 note). 

52 The 2003 provision is Pub. L. No. 107-248, title VIII, § 8002, 116 Stat. 1519, 1536 (Oct. 23, 
2002) (codified at 10 U.S.C. § 1584 note).

amount to permanent indefinite appropriations. 50 Comp. Gen. 323 (1970). 
It also applies to working capital funds. B-161976, Aug. 10, 1967.53 

There are a number of statutory exceptions to the restriction on 
compensating aliens. As noted, one significant exemption is for Defense 
Department personnel. See B-188507, Dec. 16, 1977; B-110831, Aug. 4, 1952. 
Others are 42 U.S.C. § 2473(c)(10) (National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, permanent legislation); 2 U.S.C. § 169 (Library of Congress, 
found in annual appropriation acts); 22 U.S.C. § 1474(1) (permanent 
authority for specific, activities within the United States Information 
Agency); and 22 U.S.C. § 2672 (permanent authority for specific activities 
within the State Department). Since appropriation act exceptions may 
appear, disappear, or vary from time to time, it is important to scrutinize 
the relevant appropriation act for any given year. Absent an applicable 
exception, the general prohibition will apply. For an illustration of the 
complexities that may arise when the provisions vary from year to year, see 
57 Comp. Gen. 172 (1977). GAO has supported enactment of the general 
restriction as permanent legislation. B-130733, Mar. 6, 1957. 

In addition to the agencywide exemptions noted above, the alien restriction 
itself contains a number of exceptions. Several of these are summarized 
below. 

Declaration of intention exception. The prohibition does not apply to a 
person in the federal service on the date of enactment of the appropriation 
act containing the prohibition who is actually residing in the United States, 
is eligible for citizenship, and has filed a declaration of intention to become 
a citizen. The employee must have filed the declaration prior to the date of 
enactment. Subsequent filing will not cure the disqualification. 17 Comp. 
Gen. 1104 (1938). A declaration timely filed but which had become void by 
operation of law due to lapse of time has also been held insufficient. 
B-138854, Apr. 1, 1959. 

Specific country exceptions. The statute typically exempts nationals of 
certain specified countries. The countries specified in any given 
 


53 The cited decision refers to the Naval Industrial Fund established under 10 U.S.C. § 2208. 
The decision makes no mention of the statutory exemption for the Defense Department, 
which was in effect in 1967. For purposes of this discussion, whether B-161976 could have 
been disposed of more simply based on the Department’s exemption is irrelevant. The 
decision is cited here merely for the proposition noted in the text.

appropriation act change from time to time according to the political 
climate. Dual citizenship will not negate the exception as long as one of the 
countries is within the exception, even where the individual has entered 
the United States from the nonexempt country. B-194929, June 20, 1979. 

Allied country exception. The prohibition does not apply to nationals of 
“countries allied with the United States in the current defense effort.” GAO 
will not decide whether a country meets this test. The determination is the 
responsibility of the employing agency, perhaps with the assistance of the 
State Department. GAO will not question a determination based on 
reasonable grounds. 35 Comp. Gen. 216 (1955); B-151064, Mar. 25, 1963; 
B-146142, June 22, 1961; B-139667, June 22, 1959. The reason for GAO’s 
position is that “it is not the responsibility nor the proper province of the 
accounting officers to initially determine political facts.” B-107288, Feb. 14, 
1952; B-107579, Feb. 14, 1952. 

Given the facts and circumstances at the time, GAO ventured an assertion 
in the more obvious cases. For instance, GAO has said that Britain meets 
the test. 73 Comp. Gen. 319 (1994). We have also opined that Canada and 
Japan meet the test. B-188852, July 19, 1977; B-133877, Oct. 16, 1957; 
B-113780, Mar. 4, 1953. Even in these cases, the determination, strictly 
speaking, is up to the employing agency. 

Allegiance exception. The prohibition does not apply to a person who 
“owes allegiance to the United States.” This means “absolute and 
permanent allegiance” as distinguished from “qualified and temporary 
allegiance.” 17 Comp. Gen. 1047 (1938); B-119760, Apr. 27, 1954. The 
exemption was apparently prompted by a concern for noncitizen 
inhabitants of U.S. territorial possessions; for example, “Filipinos in the 
service of the United States on March 28, 1938.” 17 Comp. Gen. at 1048. 

The allegiance exception includes a clause to the effect that a signed 
affidavit will be regarded as prima facie evidence of allegiance. This clause 
has been construed to apply to noncitizen nationals, that is, noncitizen 
inhabitants of U.S. territorial possessions and not to resident aliens. 
Yuen v. Internal Revenue Service, 497 F. Supp. 1023 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), aff’d, 
649 F.2d 163 (2nd Cir. 1981). The district court opinion includes an 
exhaustive review of legislative history. 

Emergency exception. The prohibition does not apply to “temporary 
employment in the field service …as a result of emergencies.” The term

c. Forfeiture of Annuities and 
Retired Pay 
“emergency” in this context means “flood, fire, or other catastrophe.” 
B-146142, June 22, 1961. See also 73 Comp. Gen. 319 (1994). 

An alien appointed in contravention of the statutory prohibition may not 
retain compensation already paid. 35 Comp. Gen. 216 (1955); 18 Comp. 
Gen. 815 (1939). (The statute expressly gives the United States the right to 
recover.) If there is no statutory bar—for example, if the employment 
would have qualified under the “allied country” exception but the agency 
failed to make the required determination—the alien may be paid as a “de 
facto employee.” Earlier decisions distinguished between appointments 
“void ab initio” and those that are merely “voidable.” E.g., 37 Comp. 
Gen. 483 (1958); 35 Comp. Gen. 216 (1955); B-188852, July 19, 1977; 
B-178882, Aug. 29, 1973. The distinction proved confusing and GAO has 
moved away from it. The current rule is stated in 58 Comp. Gen. 734 (1979). 

As a final note, the Supreme Court in 1976 invalidated a Civil Service 
Commission regulation requiring citizenship as a prerequisite to federal 
employment. Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88 (1976). The Court 
did not, however, invalidate the appropriation act restrictions. See 
B-188507, Dec. 16, 1977. The Yuen litigation cited earlier specifically upheld 
the restriction against a charge of violation of the Equal Protection clause. 

(1) General principles 
Under 5 U.S.C. § 8312 (the so-called “Hiss Act”), a civilian employee of the 
United States or a member of the uniformed services who is convicted of 
certain criminal offenses relating to the national security will forfeit his or 
her retirement annuity or retired pay. Further, the annuity or retired pay 
may not be paid to the convicted employees survivors or beneficiaries. The 
offenses that will result in forfeiture are specified in the statute. Examples 
are: gathering or delivering defense information to aid a foreign 
government; gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information; 
disclosure of classified information; espionage; sabotage; treason; rebellion 
or insurrection; seditious conspiracy; advocating the overthrow of the 
government; enlistment to serve in an armed force against the United 
States; and certain violations of the Atomic Energy Act. In addition, perjury 
by falsely denying the commission of one of the specified offenses is itself 
an offense for purposes of forfeiture. 

An employee for purposes of 5 U.S.C. § 8312 includes a Member of 
Congress and an individual employed by the government of the District of 
 


Page 4-96 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Columbia. 5 U.S.C. § 8311(1). The specific types of retirement annuities and 
retired pay subject to forfeiture are enumerated in 5 U.S.C. §§ 8311(2) and 
(3). 

Since 5 U.S.C. § 8312 imposes a forfeiture, it is penal in nature. Therefore, it 
must be strictly construed. GAO will not construe the statute as applicable 
to situations that are not expressly covered by its terms. 35 Comp. Gen. 302 
(1955). 

In the absence of an authoritative judicial decision to the contrary, the 
effective date of a conviction for stoppage of retired pay should be 
determined in a manner which will result in the least expenditure of public 
funds. Thus, the date a guilty verdict is returned should be considered the 
date of conviction rather than a later date when the judgment is ordered 
executed, and retired pay should be stopped the following day. 39 Comp. 
Gen. 741 (1960). Using the cited decision to illustrate: the jury returned a 
guilty verdict on December 2, 1959; judgment was entered on January 29, 
1960; the date of conviction is December 2, 1959, and retired pay should be 
stopped effective December 3. 

In the absence of an authoritative judicial decision to the contrary, a plea of 
“nolo contendere” should be regarded as a conviction for purposes of 
5 U.S.C. § 8312. 41 Comp. Gen. 62 (1961). 

(2) The Alger Hiss case 
The event that, more than any other single incident, gave rise to the original 
enactment of 5 U.S.C. § 8312, was the case of Alger Hiss. A former State 
Department employee, Hiss was convicted in 1950 of perjury stemming 
from testimony before a grand jury investigating alleged espionage 
violations. When Hiss was released from prison after serving his sentence, 
considerable public and congressional attention was directed at the fact 
that he was still entitled to receive his government pension. Given the 
political climate of the times, the result was the enactment of 5 U.S.C. 
§ 8312 in 1954 (Pub. L. No. 769, ch. 1214, 68 Stat. 1142 (Sept. 1, 1954)). 

Hiss applied for his pension in 1967 and the then Civil Service Commission 
denied the application based on 5 U.S.C. § 8312. He subsequently sued for 
restoration of his forfeited pension. In Hiss v. Hampton, 338 F. Supp. 1141 

(D.D.C. 1972), the court, finding that the statute had been aimed more at 
punishing Alger Hiss than regulating the federal service, held 5 U.S.C. 
§ 8312 to be an ex post facto law and therefore unconstitutional as it had 
Page 4-97 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

been applied to Hiss for conduct which occurred prior to the date of its 
enactment. Therefore, the court ordered the Civil Service Commission to 
pay Hiss his annuity retroactively with interest. 

The Hiss case gave rise to two GAO decisions—52 Comp. Gen. 175 (1972), 
aff’d, B-115505, Dec. 21, 1972—holding that the interest payable to Hiss, as 
with the annuity itself, must be paid from the Civil Service Retirement Fund 
rather than the permanent judgment appropriation, 31 U.S.C. § 1304. The 
court case and decisions are summarized in B-115505, May 15, 1973. 

(3) Types of offenses covered 
Under the original version of 5 U.S.C. § 8312, forfeiture was not strictly 
limited to national security offenses. An employee could lose his or her 
retirement annuity or retired pay simply by committing a felony “in the 
exercise of his authority, influence, power, or privileges as an officer or 
employee of the Government.” There were numerous examples of 
forfeitures for such infractions as falsifying a travel voucher or using a 
government-owned vehicle for personal purposes.54 

Recognizing that in many cases the punishment was too severe for the 
offense, especially in cases where the offense occurred after many years of 
government service, Congress amended the statute in 1961 (Pub. L. No. 87299, 
75 Stat. 640 (Sept. 26, 1961)) to limit it to offenses relating to national 
security and to “retroactively remove therefrom those provisions of the 
statute which prohibited payment of annuities and retired pay to persons 
who commit offenses, acts or omissions which do not involve the security 
of the United States.” 41 Comp. Gen. 399, 400 (1961). Thus, numerous 
offenses which would have caused forfeiture before 1961 no longer do. See, 
e.g., B-155823, Sept. 15, 1965 (conspiracy to embezzle government funds); 
B-155558, Nov. 25, 1964 (false statement). Of course, to the extent that the 
pre-1961 decisions establish principles apart from the specific offenses 
involved, such as the general principles noted above, they remain valid. 

The original 1954 enactment of 5 U.S.C. § 8312 did not expressly cover 
offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and this 
omission generated many GAO decisions prior to the 1961 amendment. 
E.g., 40 Comp. Gen. 601 (1961); 38 Comp. Gen. 310 (1958); 35 Comp. 
Gen. 302 (1955). The UCMJ decisions came to an abrupt halt with the 

54 See, e.g., 41 Comp. Gen. 114 (1961); 40 Comp. Gen. 364 (1960); 40 Comp. Gen. 176 (1960). 

Page 4-98 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

enactment of the 1961 amendment. The current version of 5 U.S.C. § 8312 
expressly covers UCMJ offenses, again limited to national security 
violations. Now, a conviction under the UCMJ will produce a forfeiture if 
the offense involves certain UCMJ articles specified in the statute, or if it 
involves any other article of the UCMJ where the charges and 
specifications describe a violation of certain of the United States Code 
offenses, and if the “executed sentence” includes death, dishonorable 
discharge, or dismissal from the service. 

(4) Related statutory provisions 
When a forfeiture is invoked under 5 U.S.C. § 8312, the individual is entitled 
to a refund of his contribution toward the annuity less any amounts already 
paid out or refunded. 5 U.S.C. § 8316. 

Forfeiture may not be invoked where an individual is convicted of an 
offense “as a result of proper compliance with orders issued, in a 
confidential relationship, by an agency or other authority” of the United 
States government or the District of Columbia government. 5 U.S.C. § 8320. 

If a payment of annuity or retired pay is made in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 8312 
“in due course and without fraud, collusion, or gross negligence,” the 
relevant accountable officer will not be held responsible. 5 U.S.C. § 8321. 

In addition to 5 U.S.C. § 8312, retirement annuities or retired pay may be 
forfeited for willful absence from the United States to avoid prosecution for 
a section 8312 offense (5 U.S.C. § 8313); refusal to testify in national 
security matters (5 U.S.C. § 8314);55 or knowingly falsifying certain national 
security-related aspects of a federal or District of Columbia employment 
application (5 U.S.C. § 8315).

5. Entertainment— 
Recreation—Morale 
and Welfare 
a. Introduction The concept to be explored in this section is the rule that appropriated 
funds may not be used for entertainment except when specifically 
authorized by statute and also authorized or approved by proper 
administrative officers. E.g., 69 Comp. Gen. 242 (1990); 43 Comp. Gen. 305 
(1963). The basis for the rule is that entertainment is essentially a personal 
expense even where it occurs in some business-related context. Except 
where specifically appropriated for, entertainment cannot normally be said 
to be necessary to carry out the purposes of an appropriation. 
The reader will readily note the sharp distinction between government 
practice and corporate practice in this regard. “Entertainment” as a 
business-related expense is an established practice in the corporate sector. 
No one questions that it can be equally business-related for a government 
agency. The difference—and the policy underlying the rule for the 
government—is summarized in the following passage from B-223678, June 
5, 1989: 
“The theory is not so much that these items can never be 
business-related, because sometimes they clearly are. 
Rather, what the decisions are really saying is that, because 
public confidence in the integrity of those who spend the 
taxpayers’ money is essential, certain items which may 
appear frivolous or wasteful—however legitimate they may 
in fact be in a specific context—should, if they are to be 
charged to public funds, be authorized specifically by the 
Congress.” 
Another way of expressing this idea is found in the following passage from 
B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003: 
“[R]eference to ‘common business practice’ is not in itself 
an adequate justification for spending public money on food 
or, for that matter, other objects. An expenditure of public 
funds must be anchored in existing law, not the practices 
and conventions of the private sector.”

(1) Application of the rule 
As a general proposition, the rule applies to all federal departments and 
agencies operating with appropriated funds. For example, in 1977 it was 
held applicable to the Alaska Railroad. B-124195-O.M., Aug. 8, 1977. 

The question in B-170938, Oct. 30, 1972, was whether the entertainment 
prohibition applied to the revolving fund of the National Credit Union 
Administration. The fund is derived from fees collected from federal credit 
unions and not from direct appropriations from the Treasury. Nevertheless, 
the authority to retain and use the collections constitutes a continuing 
appropriation since, but for that authority, the fees would have to be 
deposited in the Treasury and Congress would have to make annual 
appropriations for the agency’s expenses. Therefore, the revolving fund 
could not be used for entertainment. 

There are three situations in which the rule has not been applied. The first 
is certain government corporations. For example, the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting, since it was established as a private nonprofit 
corporation and is not an agency or establishment of the U.S. government 
(notwithstanding that it receives appropriations), could use its funds to 
hold a reception in the Cannon House Office Building. B-131935, July 16, 
1975. 

The rule has also been held not to apply to government corporations that 
are classed as government agencies but which have statutory authority to 
determine the character and necessity of their expenditures. B-127949, 
May 18, 1956 (Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation); B-35062, 
July 28, 1943. There are limits, however. See, e.g., B-45702, Nov. 22, 1944, 
disallowing the cost of a “luncheon meeting” of government employees. 

The second exception is donated funds where the recipient agency has 
statutory authority to accept and retain the gift. The availability of donated 
funds for entertainment is discussed further, with case citations, in 
Chapter 6. 

The third exception, infrequently applied, is for certain commissions with 
statutory authority to procure supplies, services, or property, and to make 
contracts, without regard to the laws and procedures applicable to federal 
agencies, and to exercise those powers that are necessary to enable the 
commission to carry out the purposes for which it was established 
efficiently and in the public interest. B-138969, Apr. 16, 1959 (Lincoln

Sesquicentennial Commission); B-138925, Apr. 15, 1959 (Civil War 
Centennial Commission); B-129102, Oct. 2, 1956 (Woodrow Wilson 
Foundation). 

(2) What is entertainment? 
The Comptroller General has not attempted a precise definition of the term 
“entertainment.” In one decision, GAO noted that one court had defined the 
term as “a source or means of amusement, a diverting performance, 
especially a public performance, as a concert, drama, or the like.” Another 
court said that entertainment “denotes that which serves for amusement 
and amusement is defined as a pleasurable occupation of the senses, or 
that which furnishes it, as dancing, sports, or music.” 58 Comp. Gen. 202, 
205 (1979),56 overruled on other grounds, 60 Comp. Gen. 303 (1981). 

For purposes of this discussion, the term entertainment, as used in 
decisions of the Comptroller General and Comptroller of the Treasury, is an 
“umbrella” term that includes: food and drink, either as formal meals or as 
snacks or refreshments; receptions, banquets, and the like; music, live or 
recorded; live artistic performances; and recreational facilities. Our 
treatment includes one other category that, even though not entertainment 
as such, is closely related to the entertainment cases: facilities for the 
welfare or morale of employees. 

Earlier decisions from time to time had occasion to address the 
components of entertainment. Can it include liquor? Responding to an 
inquiry from the Navy, a Comptroller of the Treasury, obviously not a 
teetotaler, said: “Entertainments …without wines, liquors or cigars, would 
be like the play of Hamlet with the melancholy Dane entirely left out of the 
lines.” 14 Comp. Dec. 344, 346 (1907).57 

In a 1941 decision (B-20085, Sept. 10, 1941), the Coordinator of Inter-
American Affairs asked whether authorized entertainment could include 
 


56 Citing, respectively, People v. Klaw, 106 N.Y.S. 341, 351 (Ct. Gen. Sess. 1907), and Young v. 
Board of Trustees of Broadwater County High School, 90 Mont. 576, 4 P.2d 725, 726 (1931). 

57 The Comptroller of the Treasury’s comments should not be confused with the rule that 
alcoholic beverages are not reimbursable as subsistence expenses. B-164366, Mar. 31, 1981; 
B-164366, Aug. 16, 1968; B-157312, May 23, 1966. The exclusion applies even against a claim 
that consumption of alcohol is required by religious beliefs. B-202124, July 17, 1981.

b. Food for Government 
Employees 
such items as cocktail parties, banquets and dinners, theater attendance, 
and sightseeing parties. The Comptroller General, recognizing that an 
appropriation for entertainment conferred considerable discretion, replied, 
in effect, “all of the above.” 

That’s entertainment. 

It may be stated as a general rule that appropriated funds are not available 
to pay subsistence or to provide free food to government employees at 
their official duty stations (“at headquarters”) unless specifically 
authorized by statute. In addition to the obvious reason that food is a 
personal expense and government salaries are presumed adequate to 
enable employees to eat regularly,58 furnishing free food might violate 
5 U.S.C. § 5536, which prohibits an employee from receiving compensation 
in addition to the pay and allowances fixed by law. See, e.g., 68 Comp. 
Gen. 46, 48 (1988); 42 Comp. Gen. 149, 151 (1962); B-272985, Dec. 30, 1996; 
see also the dual compensation discussion in this chapter, section C.4.a. 

The “free food” rule applies to snacks and refreshments as well as meals. 
For example, in 47 Comp. Gen. 657 (1968), the Comptroller General held 
that Internal Revenue Service appropriations were not available to serve 
coffee to either employees or private individuals at meetings. Similarly 
prohibited was the purchase of coffeemakers and cups. Although serving 
coffee or refreshments at meetings may be desirable, it generally is not 
considered a “necessary expense” in the context of appropriations 
availability. See also B-233807, Aug. 27, 1990; B-159633, May 20, 1974. 

The question of food for government employees arises in many contexts 
and there are certain well-defined exceptions. For example, the 
government may pay for the meals of civilian and military personnel in 
travel status because there is specific statutory authority to do so.59 The 
rule and exception are illustrated by 65 Comp. Gen. 16 (1985), in which the 
question was whether the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration could provide in-flight meals, at government expense, to 
persons on extended flights on government aircraft engaged in weather 
research. The answer was yes for government personnel in travel status, no 

58 “Feeding oneself is a personal expense which a Government employee is expected to bear 
from his or her salary.” 65 Comp. Gen. 738, 739 (1986); B-288536, Nov. 19, 2001. 

59 5 U.S.C. § 5702 (civilian employees); 37 U.S.C. § 404 (military personnel).

for anyone else, including government employees not in official travel 
status. See also B-256938, Sept. 21, 1995 (because the aircraft and its 
airbase were determined to be a U.S. Customs aircraft pilot’s permanent 
duty station, the pilot could be reimbursed only for meals purchased 
incident to duties performed away from the aircraft outside the limits of his 
official duty station). 

While feeding employees may not be regarded as a “necessary expense” as 
a general proposition, it may qualify when the agency is carrying out some 
particular statutory function where the necessary relationship can be 
established. Thus, in B-201186, Mar. 4, 1982, it was a permissible 
implementation of a statutory accident prevention program for the Marine 
Corps to set up rest stations on highways leading to a Marine base to serve 
coffee and doughnuts to Marines returning from certain holiday weekends. 
Another example is 65 Comp. Gen. 738 (1986) (refreshments at awards 
ceremonies), discussed later in this section. A related example is 
B-235163.11, Feb. 13, 1996, in which GAO determined that appropriated 
funds could be used to pay for the dinner of a nonfederal award recipient 
and her spouse at a National Science Foundation awards ceremony 
because of the statutory nature of the award. Exceptions of this type 
illustrate the relativity of the necessary expense doctrine pointed out 
earlier in our general discussion. 

We turn now to a discussion of the rule and its exceptions in several other 
contexts. 

(1) Working at official duty station under unusual conditions 
The well-settled rule is that, except in extreme emergencies that are 
explained below, the government may not furnish free food (the decisions 
sometimes get technical and use terms like “per diem” or “subsistence”) to 
employees at their official duty station, even when they are working under 
unusual circumstances.60 

An early illustration is 16 Comp. Gen. 158 (1936), in which the expense of 
meals was denied to an Internal Revenue investigator who was required to 
maintain a 24-hour surveillance. The reason payment was denied is that the 
investigator would presumably have eaten (and incurred the expense of) 

60 The cases under this heading obviously do not involve entertainment as most of us 
understand the term. The rule, however, fits under the same conceptual umbrella.

three meals a day even if he had not been required to work the 24-hour 
shift. A similar example is B-272985, Dec. 30, 1996, in which the expense of 
meals was denied to a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) security detail 
while providing 24-hour security to the Director or Deputy Director of the 
CIA. 

Payment was also denied in 42 Comp. Gen. 149 (1962), where a postal 
official had bought carry-out restaurant food for postal employees 
conducting an internal election who were required to remain on duty 
beyond regular working hours.61 

Similarly, the general rule was applied to deny reimbursement for food in 
the following situations: 

• Federal mediators required to conduct mediation sessions after regular 
hours. B-169235, Apr. 6, 1970; B-141142, Dec. 15, 1959. 

• District of Columbia police officers involved in clean-up work after a 
fire in a municipal building. B-118638.104, Feb. 5, 1979. 

• Geological Survey inspectors at offshore oil rigs who had little 

alternative than to buy lunch from private caterers at excessive prices. 

B-194798, Jan. 23, 1980. See also B-202104, July 2, 1981 (Secret Service 

agents on 24-hour-a-day assignment required to buy meals at high cost 

hotels). 

• Law enforcement personnel retained at staging area for security 

purposes prior to being dispatched to execute search warrants. 

B-234813, Nov. 9, 1989. 

• Air Force enlisted personnel assigned to a security detail at an off-base 
social event. B-232112, Mar. 8, 1990. 

An exception was permitted in 53 Comp. Gen. 71 (1973). In that case, the 
unauthorized occupation of a building in which the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
was located necessitated the assembling of a cadre of General Services 
Administration special police, who unexpectedly spent the whole  


61 This and several other cases cited in the text also involve the “voluntary creditor” rule, 
discussed in Chapter 12 (Volume III of the second edition of Principles of Federal 
Appropriations Law).

Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

night there in alert status until relieved the following morning. Agency 
officials purchased and brought in sandwiches and coffee for the cadre. 
GAO concluded that it would not question the agency’s determination that 
the expenditure was incidental to the protection of government property 
during an extreme emergency involving danger to human life and the 
destruction of federal property, and approved reimbursement. The decision 
emphasized, however, that it was an exception and that the rule still stands. 

A similar exception was permitted in B-189003, July 5, 1977, where agents 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had been forced to remain at 
their duty stations within the office during a severe blizzard in Buffalo, New 
York. The area was in a state of emergency and was later declared a 
national disaster area. GAO agreed with the agency’s determination that the 
situation presented a danger to human life of Buffalo citizens and that it 
was imperative for FBI employees to maintain the essential functions of the 
office during the emergency. 

The rationale of 53 Comp. Gen. 71 and B-189003 was applied in B-232487, 
Jan. 26, 1989, for government employees required to work continually for a 
24-hour period to evacuate and secure an area threatened by the derailment 
of a train carrying toxic liquids. 

The exception, however, is limited. The requirement to remain on duty for a 
24-hour period, standing alone, is not enough. In B-185159, Dec. 10, 1975, 
for example, the cost of meals was denied to Treasury Department agents 
required to work over 24 hours investigating a bombing of federal offices. 
The Comptroller General pointed out that dangerous conditions alone are 
not enough. Under the exception established in 53 Comp. Gen. 71, it is 
necessary to find that the situation involves imminent danger to human life 
or the destruction of federal property. Also, in that case, the agents were 
only investigating a dangerous situation that had already occurred and 
there was no suggestion that any further bombings were imminent. A 
similar case is B-217261, Apr. 1, 1985, involving a Customs Service official 
required to remain in a motel room for several days on a surveillance 
assignment. See also 16 Comp. Gen. 158 (1936); B-202104, July 2, 1981. 

Short of the emergency situation described in B-189003, July 5, 1977, 
inclement weather is not enough to support an exception. There are 
numerous cases in which employees have spent the night in motels rather 
than returning home in a snowstorm, in order to be able to get to work the 
following day. Reimbursement for meals has consistently been denied.

68 Comp. Gen. 46 (1988); 64 Comp. Gen. 70 (1984); B-226403, May 19, 1987; 
B-200779, Aug. 12, 1981; B-188985, Aug. 23, 1977. It makes no difference 
that the employee was directed by his or her supervisor to rent the room 
(B-226403 and B-188985),62 or that the federal government in Washington 
was shut down (68 Comp. Gen. 46).63 

Naturally, statutory authority will overcome the prohibition. Thus, where 
the Veterans Administration (VA) had statutory authority to accept 
uncompensated services and to contract for related “necessary services,” 
the VA could, upon an administrative determination of necessity, contract 
with local restaurants for meals to be furnished without charge to 
uncompensated volunteer workers at VA outpatient clinics when their 
scheduled assignment extended over a meal period. B-145430, May 9, 1961. 
Similarly, in B-241708, Sept. 27, 1991, the Comptroller General determined 
that because the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) hired emergency 
firefighters under special statutory authority, 43 U.S.C. § 1469, BIA’s 
practice of furnishing hot meals and snack lunches for emergency 
firefighters was legally permissible. There is also authority to make 
subsistence payments to law enforcement officials and members of their 
immediate families when threats to their lives force them to occupy 
temporary accommodations. 5 U.S.C. § 5706a.64 

(2) Government Employees Training Act 
The Government Employees Training Act (Training Act) authorizes 
agencies to “pay …for all or a part of the necessary expenses of training,” 
5 U.S.C. § 4109, and to pay “for expenses of attendance at meetings which 

62 A supervisor has no authority to do so. As noted in B-226403, such an erroneous exercise 
of authority does not bind the government. 

63 While the storm in 68 Comp. Gen. 46 was certainly more than flurries, it nevertheless 
remains the case that the government in Washington will be disrupted by storms that do not 
approach the severity of the Buffalo blizzard in B-189003. There is also a practical 
distinction. To feed and lodge a potentially large number of employees every time it snows 
in Washington is simply not realistic. 

64 Federal employees may not accept donations of food, except where the recipient agency 
has statutory authority to accept and retain the donation. One example of such authority is 
found in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002. The Act permits the 

U.S. Capitol Police to “accept contributions of meals and refreshments” during a period of 
emergency, as determined by the Capitol Police Board. Pub. L. No. 107-68, § 121, 115 Stat. 
560, 576 (Nov. 12, 2001), codified at 2 U.S.C. § 1971. The use of donations and contributions 
is discussed further in Chapter 6.

are concerned with the functions or activities for which the appropriation 
is made,” 5 U.S.C. § 4110, regardless of whether the event is held within the 
employees’ official duty station. The Comptroller General has interpreted 
and applied the Training Act to accommodate the day-to-day realities of 
governmental operations within the limits imposed by the statutes and has 
determined that the Training Act permits agencies to pay for the costs of 
meals and refreshments at meetings and training events under specific 
circumstances, which are outlined below. B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003; 
B-233807, Aug. 27, 1990. 

(a) Attendance at meetings and conferences 
In section C.2 of this chapter, we discuss when appropriated funds may be 
used to finance the attendance of government employees at meetings and 
conferences. This section addresses when the government may pay for 
meals at meetings and conferences when attendance is authorized under 
the principles and statutes set forth in section C.2. As the reader will 
discover from the discussion that follows, there are many authorities 
available to planners of meetings and conferences for this purpose, and 
planners should become familiar with them. For day-to-day routine 
business meetings, our case law has consistently held that the Training Act 
does not provide authority to use appropriations to supply food items. As 
our case law demonstrates, agencies appear to struggle with this rule. In 
this regard, our case law is not static nor inflexible. As recent history 
demonstrates, GAO is willing to reexamine its case law and to revise, to the 
extent permitted by law, rules that agency officials believe frustrate 
efficient, effective, and responsible government. B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003. 
Any revision, of course, must be founded on sound legal reasoning, and 
must include appropriate controls to prevent abuses and ensure public 
confidence in the integrity of those who spend the taxpayers money. 

For meetings sponsored by nongovernment organizations, the attendee will 
commonly be charged a fee, usually but not necessarily called a 
registration fee. If a single fee is charged covering both attendance and 
meals and no separate charge is made for meals, the government may pay 
the full fee, assuming of course that funds are otherwise available for the 
cost of attendance. 38 Comp. Gen. 134 (1958); B-249351, May 11, 1993; 
B-233807, Aug. 27, 1990; B-66978, Aug. 25, 1947. The same is true for an 
evening social event where the cost is a mandatory nonseparable element 
of the registration fee. 66 Comp. Gen. 350 (1987). 

Page 4-108 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

If a separate charge is made for meals, the government may pay for the 
meals if there is a showing that (1) the meals are incidental to the meeting; 

(2) attendance of the employee at the meals is necessary to full 
participation in the business of the conference; and (3) the employee is not 
free to take the meals elsewhere without being absent from essential 
formal discussions, lectures, or speeches concerning the purpose of the 
conference. B-233807, Aug. 27, 1990; B-160579, Apr. 26, 1978; B-166560, 
Feb. 3, 1970. Absent such a showing, the government may not pay for the 
meals. B-154912, Aug. 26, 1964; B-152924, Dec. 18, 1963; B-95413, June 7, 
1950; B-88258, Sept. 19, 1949. As an examination of the cited cases will 
reveal, these rules apply regardless of whether the conference takes place 
within the employees duty station area or someplace else. 
Where the government is authorized to pay for meals under the above 
principles, the employee normally cannot be reimbursed for purchasing 
alternate meals. See B-193504, Aug. 9, 1979; B-186820, Feb. 23, 1978. 
Personal taste is irrelevant. Thus, an employee who, for example, loathes 
broccoli will either have to eat it anyway, pay for a substitute meal from his 
or her own pocket, or go without. For an employee on travel or temporary 
duty status, which is where this rule usually manifests itself, per diem is 
reduced by the value of the meals provided. E.g., 60 Comp. Gen. 181, 183– 
84 (1981). The rule will not apply, however, where the employee is unable 
to eat the meal provided (and cannot arrange for an acceptable substitute) 
because of bona fide medical or religious reasons. B-231703, Oct. 31, 1989 
(per diem not required to be reduced where employee, an Orthodox Jew 
who could not obtain kosher meals at conference, purchased substitute 
meals elsewhere). 

The above rules will not apply to day-to-day routine agency-sponsored 
meetings. GAO has described “day-to-day” business meetings as meetings 
that involve discussions of the internal procedures or operations of the 
agency. See 68 Comp. Gen. 604, 605 (1989). Meetings or conferences that 
are not routine involve topical matters of general interest that might appeal 
to governmental and nongovernmental participants. Id. Attendance at 
routine agency-sponsored meetings will generally be subject to the 
prohibition on furnishing free food to employees at their official duty 
stations. Thus the cost of meals could not be provided at a conference of 
field examiners of the National Credit Union Administration. B-180806, 
Aug. 21, 1974. Use of appropriated funds was prohibited for coffee breaks 
at a management seminar, B-159633, May 20, 1974; meals served during 
“working sessions” at Department of Labor business meetings, B-168774, 
Jan. 23, 1970; and meals at monthly luncheon meetings for officials of law

enforcement agencies, B-198882, Mar. 25, 1981. Appropriated funds also 
could not be used for meals at quarterly managers meetings of the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, 72 Comp. Gen. 178 (1993), and meals and 
refreshments served to government employees attending Federal 
Communication Commission radio spectrum auctions. B-260692, Jan. 2, 
1996. See also 47 Comp. Gen. 657 (1968); B-45702, Nov. 22, 1944. 

In B-137999, Dec. 16, 1958, the commissioners of the Outdoor Recreation 
Resources Review Commission had statutory authority to be reimbursed 
for actual subsistence expenses. This was held to include the cost of 
lunches during meetings at a Washington hotel. However, the cost of 
lunches for staff members of the Commission could not be paid. 

Merely calling the cost of meals a “registration fee” will not avoid the 
prohibition. In a 1975 case, the cost of meals was disallowed for Army 
employees at an Army-sponsored “Operations and Maintenance Seminar.” 
The charge had been termed a registration fee but covered only luncheons, 
dinner, and coffee breaks. B-182527, Feb. 12, 1975. See also B-195045, 
Feb. 8, 1980. 

In B-187150, Oct. 14, 1976, grant funds provided to the government of the 
District of Columbia under the Social Security Act for personnel training 
and administrative expenses could not be used to pay for a luncheon at a 
4-hour conference of officials of the D.C. Department of Human Resources. 
The conference could not be reasonably characterized as training and did 
not qualify as an allowable administrative cost under the program 
regulations. 

While 5 U.S.C. § 4110 does not apply to a routine business meeting, in 
B-281063, Dec. 1, 1999, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) could 
pay an all-inclusive facility rental fee for a meeting to discuss internal 
matters, even though the fee resulted in food being served to NRC 
employees at their official duty stations. Because the fee would have 
remained the same for NRC whether or not it accepted and its employees 
ate the food, the harm that the general rule is meant to prevent (i.e., 
expenditure of federal funds on personal items) was not present. 

In January 2000, the General Services Administration (GSA) published an 
amendment to the Federal Travel Regulations to address “conference 
planning.” 41 C.F.R. pts. 301-11 and 4301-74, 65 Fed. Reg. 1326 (Jan. 10, 
2000). The amendment defined “conference” as “[a] meeting, retreat, 
seminar, symposium or event that involves attendee travel.” The 

Page 4-110 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

amendment included a provision permitting agencies to pay for light 
refreshments for agency employees at conferences. 41 C.F.R. § 301-74.11. In 
agency guidance explaining the regulation, GSA advised agencies that they 
could use appropriated funds to pay for refreshments for nontravelers at 
some conferences. In particular, GSA advised that if the majority of the 
attendees were in travel status, the agency could fund refreshments for all 
attendees. 

In a 2003 decision, GAO explained that GSA’s statutory basis for the light 
refreshment provision is 5 U.S.C. § 5702, which addresses the subsistence 
expenses of federal employees “when traveling on official business away 
from the employees designated post of duty”; therefore, while Congress has 
authorized GSA to prescribe regulations necessary for the administration 
of travel and subsistence expenses, GSA’s authority does not extend to 
employees who are not in travel status. B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003.65 
Accordingly, GAO held that the light refreshment provision of the travel 
regulation applies only to federal employees who are in travel status. Id.66 
The decision also clarified that although section 4110 generally applies only 
to meetings sponsored by nongovernmental organizations, the Comptroller 
General extended section 4110 to a government-sponsored meeting, 
regardless of whether an employee is in travel status or not, as long as the 
meeting satisfies the same conditions as required for nongovernmentsponsored 
meetings and the government-sponsored meeting is not an 
internal day-to-day business meeting. 

In response to this decision, GSA agreed that its authority extended only to 
employees in travel status and in its guidance would refer agencies to GAO 
decisions holding that section 4110 of the Training Act authorizes agencies 
to provide light refreshments to nontravelers at a government-sponsored 
meeting as long as the meeting meets the requirements of section 4110 and 
is not a “day-to-day” or “routine” business meeting. Letter from Raymond J. 
McNamara, General Counsel, GSA, to Anthony H. Gamboa, General 
Counsel, GAO, undated, received by GAO June 9, 2003. 

65 A brief mention should be made of the status of snacks and refreshments as subsistence. 
Over the years, applying GSA regulations, GAO objected to agencies reimbursing travelers 
for the actual expenses of various snacks or light refreshments consumed while in travel 
status. See, e.g., B-167820, Oct. 7, 1969. GSA now interprets subsistence to include the light 
refreshments identified in its conference planning travel regulation. GAO endorses this 
interpretation. B-288266, Jan. 27, 2003. 

66 When light refreshments are furnished at nominal or no cost by the government, no 
deduction of per diem is required. 41 C.F.R. § 301-74.21.

In 1980, the President’s Committee on Employment of the Handicapped 
held its annual meeting in the Washington Hilton Hotel. The affair was to 
last 3 days and included a luncheon and two banquets. There was no 
registration fee for the meeting but there were charges for the meals. GAO’s 
Equal Employment Opportunity Office planned to send three employees to 
the meeting and asked whether the agency could pick up the tab for the 
meals. The three employees were to make a presentation at the meeting 
and it seemed clear that attendance was authorized under 5 U.S.C. § 4110. 
Also, if a registration fee were involved, the prior decisions noted above 
would presumably have answered the question. The Comptroller General 
reviewed the precedents such as B-160579, Apr. 26, 1978, and B-166560, 
Feb. 3, 1970, and took the logical step of applying them to the situation at 
hand. Thus, GAO could pay for the meals if administrative determinations 
were made that (1) the meals were incidental to the meeting; 

(2) attendance at the meals was necessary for full participation at the 
meeting; and (3) the employees would miss essential formal discussions, 
lectures, or speeches concerning the purpose of the meeting if they took 
their meals elsewhere. B-198471, May 1, 1980.67 
This decision, so it seems, became perceived as the loophole through 
which the lunch wagon could be driven. So apparently compelling is the 
quest for free food that it became necessary to issue several additional 
decisions to clarify B-198471 and to explain precisely what the rationale of 
that decision does and does not authorize. 

In 64 Comp. Gen. 406 (1985), the Comptroller General held that the cost of 
meals could not be reimbursed for employees attending monthly meetings 
of the Federal Executive Association within their duty station area. The 
meetings were essentially luncheon meetings at which representatives of 
various government agencies could discuss matters of mutual interest. The 
decision stated: 

“What distinguishes [B-198471] …is that the President’s 
annual meeting was a 3-day affair with meals clearly 
incidental to the overall meeting, while in [the cases in 
which reimbursement has been denied] the only meetings 
which took place were the ones which took place during a 

67 This is a relatively rare instance of the Comptroller Generals issuing a formal decision to a 
GAO requester. Although it does not happen often, it will be done when the situation 
warrants it.

luncheon meal…. In order to meet the three-part test [of 
B-198471], a meal must be part of a formal meeting or 
conference that includes not only functions such as 
speeches or business carried out during a seating at a meal 
but also includes substantial functions that take place 
separate from the meal. [W]e are unwilling to conclude that 
a meeting which lasts no longer than the meal during which 
it is conducted qualifies for reimbursement.” 

Id. at 408 (explanatory information provided). 

A similar case the following year, 65 Comp. Gen. 508 (1986), reiterated that 
the above-quoted test of 64 Comp. Gen. 406 must precede the application of 
the three-part test of B-198471. The three-part test, and hence the authority 
to reimburse, relates to a meal that is incident to a meeting, not a meeting 
that is incident to a meal. 65 Comp. Gen. at 510; 64 Comp. Gen. at 408. See 
also B-249249, Dec. 17, 1992. 

Two 1989 decisions, 68 Comp. Gen. 604 and 68 Comp. Gen. 606, defined the 
rules further, holding that 5 U.S.C. § 4110 and B-198471 do not apply to 
purely internal business meetings or conferences sponsored by 
government agencies. See also 72 Comp. Gen. 178 (1993); B-247563, 
Dec. 11, 1996; B-270199, Aug. 6, 1996; and B-260692, Jan. 2, 1996. Noting 
that this result is consistent with the legislative history of 5 U.S.C. § 4110 as 
summarized in prior decisions,68 both decisions stated: 

“We think …that there is a clear distinction between the 
payment of meals incidental to formal conferences or 
meetings, typically externally organized or sponsored, 
involving topical matters of general interest to 
governmental and nongovernmental participants, and 
internal business or informational meetings primarily 
involving the day-to-day operations of government. With 
respect to the latter, 5 U.S.C. § 4110 has little bearing ….” 

68 Comp. Gen. at 605 and 608. One of the decisions went a step further and 
commented that the claim in 65 Comp. Gen. 508 “should have been 
summarily rejected based on the application of the general rule.” 68 Comp. 

68 E.g., 46 Comp. Gen. 135, 136–37 (1966); B-140912, Nov. 24, 1959.

Gen. at 609. Naturally, if the meeting or conference does not have the 
necessary connection with official agency business, the cost of meals may 
not be paid regardless of who sponsors the meeting or where it is held. 
Thus, a registration fee consisting primarily of the cost of a luncheon was 
disallowed for three Community Services Administration employees 
attending a Federal Executive Board meeting at which Combined Federal 
Campaign (CFC) awards were to be presented. B-195045, Feb. 8, 1980.69 
Similarly, an employee of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development could not be reimbursed for meals incident to meetings of a 
local business association. B-166560, May 27, 1969. 

In a 1981 case, the Internal Revenue Service bought tickets for several of its 
agents to attend the Fourth Annual Awards and Scholarship Dinner of the 
National Association of Black Accountants. The purposes of attending the 
banquet were to establish contacts for recruitment purposes and to 
demonstrate the commitment of the IRS to its equal employment 
opportunity program. However, attendance could not be authorized under 
either 5 U.S.C. § 4109 or 5 U.S.C. § 4110, and the expenditure was therefore 
prohibited by 5 U.S.C. § 5946. B-202028, May 14, 1981. 

However, in B-249249, Dec. 17, 1992, the Comptroller General held that the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) could reimburse an FBI agent for the 
cost of a retirement banquet. The agent represented the FBI at the banquet 
honoring a local police chief and presented him with a plaque and 
commendation letter from the FBI Director. “The agent’s attendance at the 
function was in furtherance of the agency’s functions or activities for which 
its appropriations were made and the meal was incidental to the retirement 
ceremony.” The Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, applying 
this decision, stated that “[w]e believe that the Comptroller General’s 
holding was correct and would be applicable to an employee of a United 
States Attorney’s Office attending the same kind of event under like 
circumstances.” 17 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 70 (1993). The Office of Legal 
Counsel cautioned, however, that the application of the ruling should be 
carefully limited to where the nature of the ceremonial event “provides 

69 A later decision, 67 Comp. Gen. 254 (1988), held that agencies may spend appropriated 
funds, within reason, to support efforts to solicit contributions to the CFC from their 
employees. While 67 Comp. Gen. 254 did not involve meals, it nevertheless raises the 
question of whether this aspect of B-195045 (insufficient relationship for purposes of 
5 U.S.C. § 4110) would still be followed. Either way, the disallowance in B-195045 was 
correct because the meeting was within the “duty station area” and the fee was little more 
than a disguised charge for the lunch.

good reason to believe that the official or employee’s attendance advances 
the offices authorized functions.” Id. 

Before we depart the topic of meals at meeting and conferences, two cases 
involving a different twist—payment for meals not eaten—deserve 
mention. In B-208729, May 24, 1983, the Army Missile Command sponsored 
a luncheon to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that was open to 
both government employees and members of the local community. 
Attendees were to be charged a fee for the lunch. In order to secure the 
necessary services, the Army contracted with a caterer (in this case the 
local Officers Club), guaranteeing a minimum revenue based on the 
anticipated number of guests. Bad weather on the day of the luncheon 
resulted in reduced attendance. Under the circumstances, GAO approved 
payment of the guaranteed minimum as a program expense. 

GAO similarly approved payment of a guaranteed minimum balance in 
B-230382, Dec. 22, 1989, this time involving the Army’s “World-Wide Audio 
Visual Conference.” As in B-208729, attendees were charged for the meal 
but attendance was less than expected. This case had two additional 
complications. First, the official who made the arrangements lacked the 
authority to do so. Payment could therefore be authorized only on a 
quantum meruit basis. Second, the arrangements also included a buffet, 
open bar, and several coffee breaks. Payment for these items could not be 
authorized, even under the quantum meruit concept, since they would not 
have been authorized had proper procurement procedures been followed. 

(b) Training 
Under the Government Employees Training Act (Training Act), an agency 
may pay, or reimburse an employee for, necessary expenses incident to an 
authorized training program. 5 U.S.C. § 4109. This applies whether the 
training is held through a nongovernment facility or by the federal 
government itself. 5 U.S.C. § 4105; B-258442, Apr. 19, 1995; B-244473, 
Jan. 13, 1992. The event, however, must comply with the Training Act’s 
definition of “training” in 5 U.S.C. § 4101(4). 72 Comp. Gen. 178 (1993). As 
with meetings, an agency may pay for the costs of meals and refreshments 
when they are included as an incidental and nonseparable portion of a 
training registration or attendance fee. 66 Comp. Gen. 350, 1987; B-288266, 
Jan. 27, 2003. If the cost of the food is not included in a registration or 
attendance fee, the Comptroller General has held that the government can 
provide meals or refreshments under this authority if the agency 
determines that providing meals or refreshments is necessary to achieve 

Page 4-115 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

the objectives of the training program. 48 Comp. Gen. 185 (1968); 39 Comp. 
Gen. 119 (1959); B-247966, June 16, 1993; B244473, Jan. 13, 1992; B-193955, 
Sept. 14, 1979. The government may also furnish meals to nongovernment 
speakers as an expense of conducting the training. 48 Comp. Gen. 185. 

In 50 Comp. Gen. 610 (1971), the Training Act was held to authorize the 
procurement of catering services for a Department of Agriculture training 
conference where government facilities were deemed inadequate in view of 
the nature of the program. 

The fact that an agency characterizes its meeting as “training” is not 
controlling. In other words, for purposes of authorizing the government to 
feed participants, something does not become training simply because it is 
called training. In B-168774, Sept. 2, 1970, headquarters employees of the 
then Department of Health, Education, and Welfare met with consultants in 
a nearby hotel at what the agency termed a “research training conference.” 
However, the conference consisted of little more than “working sessions” 
and included no employee training as defined in the Training Act. 
Therefore, the cost of meals could not be paid. See also 72 Comp. Gen. 178 
(1993); 68 Comp. Gen. 606 (1989); B-247563, Dec. 11, 1996; B-208527, 
Sept. 20, 1983; B-187150, Oct. 14, 1976; B-140912, Nov. 24, 1959. 

In 65 Comp. Gen. 143 (1985), GAO held that a Social Security 
Administration employee who had been invited as a guest speaker at the 
opening day luncheon of a legitimate agency training conference in the 
vicinity of her duty station could be reimbursed for the cost of the meal. 
The decision unfortunately confuses 5 U.S.C. §§ 4109 and 4110 by analyzing 
the case under section 4110 yet concluding that reimbursement is 
authorized “as a necessary training expense,” which is the standard under 
section 4109. 

(3) Award ceremonies 
General operating appropriations may be used to provide refreshments at 
award ceremonies under the Government Employees’ Incentive Awards 
Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 4501–4506. 65 Comp. Gen. 738 (1986); B-271551, Mar. 4, 
1997. This Act authorizes an agency to use its operating appropriations to 
cover the “necessary expense for the honorary recognition of” the 
employee or employees receiving the awards. 5 U.S.C. § 4503. The Act also 
directs the Office of Personnel Management to prescribe regulations and 
instructions to govern agency awards programs. 5 U.S.C. § 4506. 

Page 4-116 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

In 65 Comp. Gen. 738, the Social Security Administration asked whether it 
could use operating appropriations, apart from its limited entertainment 
appropriation, to provide refreshments at its annual awards ceremony. 
GAO observed that the Incentive Awards Act (5 U.S.C. § 4503) authorizes 
agencies to “pay a cash award to, and incur necessary expense for the 
honorary recognition of” employees. The decision reasoned that the 
concept of a necessary expense is, within limits, a relative one based on the 
relationship of the expenditure to the particular appropriation or program 
involved. Thus, while the necessary relationship does not exist with respect 
to an agency’s day-to-day operations, the agency would be within its 
legitimate discretion to determine that refreshments would materially 
enhance the effectiveness of a ceremonial function, specifically in this case 
an awards ceremony which is a valid component of the agency’s statutorily 
authorized awards program. 

The decision essentially followed B-167835, Nov. 18, 1969, which had 
concluded that the Incentive Awards Act authorized the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration to fund part of the cost of a banquet 
at which the President was to present the Medal of Freedom to the 
Apollo 11 astronauts. What made the fuller treatment in 65 Comp. Gen. 738 
necessary was that a 1974 decision, B-114827, Oct. 2, 1974, had found the 
cost of refreshments at an awards ceremony under the Incentive Awards 
Act payable only from specific entertainment appropriations. The 1986 
case partially modified B-114827 to the extent it had held that an 
entertainment appropriation was the only available funding source. Finally, 
65 Comp. Gen. 738 distinguished 43 Comp. Gen. 305 (1963), which had 
disallowed the cost of refreshments at an awards ceremony for persons 
who were not federal employees (and therefore not authorized under the 
Incentive Awards Act nor governed by the “necessary expense” language of 
that statute). 

GAO has emphasized that the purpose of awards ceremonies is to foster 
public recognition of employees’ meritorious performance and allow other 
employees to honor and congratulate their colleagues. 65 Comp. Gen. 
at 740. In B-247563, Dec. 11, 1996, the Comptroller General determined that 
the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center’s use of appropriated 
funds for a breakfast at which the Medical Center Director presented 
awards was improper because there was no public recognition of the 
award recipients. The record indicated that (1) only those employees 
specifically recognized and the Medical Center Director participated in the 
event and (2) the employees’ contributions were not otherwise publicized 
within the Medical Center community. 

Page 4-117 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

In this same decision, however, the Comptroller General did not find 
unauthorized the Medical Center’s use of its appropriation to purchase light 
refreshments for an annual picnic and Valentine’s Day Dance, at which the 
agency presented performance award certificates and years of service 
awards. The Comptroller General found that the Medical Center publicly 
recognized employees’ accomplishments at both events but cautioned that 
where an agency combines awards receptions with social events, “the 
expenditures should be subject to greater scrutiny than expenditures made 
in connection with more traditional awards ceremonies.” B-247563, supra. 

Recent Comptroller General decisions have permitted appropriated funds 
to be used to provide meals as well as refreshments at awards ceremonies. 
For example, in B-270327, Mar. 12, 1997, the Defense Reutilization and 
Marketing Service (DRMS) was permitted to pay luncheon expenses not to 
exceed $20 per employee at worldwide DRMS award ceremonies. The 
Comptroller General explained that Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) regulations purposely leave it up to the agencies to design their 
award programs, and that “we must respect and defer to OPM’s regulatory 
decisions and the implicit delegation of authority to agencies to make 
implementing decisions vis-à-vis their incentive awards programs so long 
as such decisions are consistent with the essential requirements of the 
Act.” Id. The Comptroller General found that the $20 per person maximum 
did not offend any OPM regulatory guidance or express provisions of the 
Government Employees’ Incentive Awards Act. Id. See also B-288536, 
Nov. 19, 2001 (Bureau of Indian Affairs was permitted to pay for the cost of 
a buffet luncheon at an incentive awards ceremony). 

The Government Employees’ Incentive Awards Act does not apply to 
members of the armed forces. However, the uniformed services have 
similar authority, including the identical “necessary expense” language, in 
10 U.S.C. § 1124. Therefore, 65 Comp. Gen. 738 applies equally to award 
ceremonies conducted under the authority of 10 U.S.C. § 1124. 65 Comp. 
Gen. at 739 n.2.

(4) Cafeterias and lunch facilities 
The government has no general responsibility to provide luncheon facilities 
for its employees. 10 Comp. Gen. 140 (1930).70 However, plans for the 
construction of a new government building may include provision for a 
lunch room or cafeteria, in which event the appropriation for construction 
of the building will be available for the lunch facility. 9 Comp. Gen. 217 
(1929). 

An agency may subsidize the operation of an employees’ cafeteria if the 
expenditure is administratively determined to be necessary to the 
efficiency of operations and a significant factor in the hiring and retaining 
of employees and in promoting employee morale. B-216943, Mar. 21, 1985; 
B-169141, Nov. 17, 1970; B169141, Mar. 23, 1970. See also B-204214, Jan. 8, 
1982 (temporarily providing paper napkins in new government cafeteria); 

U.S.General Accounting Office, Benefits GSA Provides by Operating 
Cafeterias in Washington, D.C., Federal Buildings, LCD-78-316 
(Washington, D.C.: May 5, 1978). 
The purchase of equipment for use in other than an established cafeteria 
may also be authorized in certain circumstances. In B-173149, Aug. 10, 
1971, GAO approved the purchase of a set of stainless steel cooking 
utensils for use by air traffic controllers to prepare food at a flight service 
station. There were no other readily accessible eating facilities and the 
employees were required to remain at their post of duty for a full 8-hour 
shift. Similar cases are: 

• B-180272, July 23, 1974: purchase of a sink and refrigerator to provide 

lunch facilities for the Occupational Safety and Health Review 

Commission where there was no government cafeteria on the premises. 

• B-210433, Apr. 15, 1983: purchase of microwave oven by Navy facility to 

replace nonworking stove. Facility was in operation 7 days a week, 

some employees had to remain at their duty stations for 24-hour shifts, 

and there were no readily accessible eating facilities in the area during 

nights and weekends. 

70 By way of contrast, it has long been conceded that drinking water is a necessity. See 
22 Comp. Dec. 31 (1915); 21 Comp. Dec. 739 (1915). However, an agency may not use 
appropriated funds for bottled drinking water for the use of employees where the public 
water supply of the locality is safe for drinking purposes. 17 Comp. Gen. 698 (1938).

c. Entertainment for 
Government Employees 
Other Than Food 
• B-276601, June 26, 1997: purchase of a refrigerator for personal food 

items of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employees. CIA 

headquarters facility was relatively distant from private eating 

establishments, the CIA did not permit delivery service to enter the 

facility due to security concerns, and the cafeteria served only 

breakfast and lunch. 

(1) Miscellaneous cases 
There have been relatively few cases in this area, probably because there 
are few situations in which entertainment for government employees could 
conceivably be authorized. 

An early decision held that 10 U.S.C. § 4302, which authorizes training for 
Army enlisted personnel “to increase their military efficiency and to enable 
them to return to civilian life better equipped for industrial, commercial, 
and business occupations,” did not include sending faculty members and 
students of the Army Music School to grand opera and symphony concerts. 
4 Comp. Gen. 169 (1924). Another decision found it improper to hire a boat 
and crew to send federal employees stationed in the Middle East on a 
recreational trip to the Red Sea. B-126374, Feb. 14, 1956. 

A 1970 decision deserves brief mention although its application will be 
extremely limited. Legislation in 1966 established the Wolf Trap Farm Park 
in Fairfax County, Virginia, as a park for the performing arts and directed 
the Interior Department to operate and maintain it. A certifying officer of 
the National Park Service asked whether he could certify a voucher for 
symphony, ballet, and theater tickets for Wolf Traps Artistic Director. The 
Comptroller General held that such payments could be made if an 
appropriate Park Service official determined that attendance was 
necessary for the performance of the Artistic Directors official duties. The 
justification was that the Artistic Director attended these functions not as 
personal entertainment but so that he could review the performances to 
determine which cultural and theatrical events were appropriate for 
booking at Wolf Trap. B-168149, Feb. 3, 1970. As noted, this case would 
seem to have little precedent value except for the Artistic Director at Wolf 
Trap. 

(2) Cultural awareness programs 
One area that has generated several decisions, and a change in GAO’s 
position, has been equal employment opportunity special emphasis or 

Page 4-120 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

cultural awareness programs. There are many areas in which the law 
undergoes refinement from time to time but remains essentially 
unchanged. There are other areas in which the law has changed to reflect 
changes in American society. This is one of those latter areas. 

The issue first arose in 58 Comp. Gen. 202 (1979). In that case, the Bureau 
of Mines, Interior Department, in conjunction with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, sponsored a program of live entertainment for 
National Hispanic Heritage Week. The program consisted of such items as a 
lecture and demonstration of South American folk music, a concert, a slide 
presentation, and an exhibit of Hispanic art and ceramics. The decision 
concluded that, while the Bureau’s Spanish-Speaking Program was a 
legitimate component of the agency’s overall Equal Employment 
Opportunity (EEO) program, appropriated funds could not be used to 
procure entertainment. This holding was followed in two more cases, 
B-194433, July 18, 1979, and B-199387, Aug. 22, 1980. 

In 1981, however, GAO reconsidered its position. The Internal Revenue 
Service asked whether it could certify a voucher covering payments for a 
performance by an African dance troupe and lunches for guest speakers at 
a ceremony observing National Black History Month. The Comptroller 
General held the expenditure proper in 60 Comp. Gen. 303 (1981). The 
decision stated: 

“[W]e now take the view that we will consider a live artistic 
performance as an authorized part of an agency’s EEO effort 
if, as in this case, it is part of a formal program determined 
by the agency to be intended to advance EEO objectives, 
and consists of a number of different types of presentations 
designed to promote EEO training objectives of making the 
audience aware of the culture or ethnic history being 
celebrated.” 

Id. at 306. Further, the lunches for the guest speakers could be paid under 
5 U.S.C. § 5703 if they were in fact away from their homes or regular places 
of business. The prior inconsistent decisions—58 Comp. Gen. 202, 
B-194433, and B-199387—were overruled. 

It should be emphasized that the prior decisions were overruled only to the 
extent inconsistent with the new holding. Two specific elements of 
58 Comp. Gen. 202 were not involved in the 1981 decision and remain valid. 
First, use of appropriated funds to serve meals or refreshments remains 

Page 4-121 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

improper except under specific statutory authority. 58 Comp. Gen. at 206.71 
Second, 58 Comp. Gen. 202 found the purchase of commercial insurance 
on art objects improper. Id. at 207. This portion also remains valid. The 
Comptroller General also determined that transportation costs of an 
employee participating in a cultural program are not authorized unless the 
employee is participating in the program as a performer or making some 
other type of direct contribution to the EEO event. B-243862, July 28, 1992. 

The decision at 60 Comp. Gen. 303 was expanded in B-199387, Mar. 23, 
1982, to include small “samples” of ethnic foods prepared and served 
during a formal ethnic awareness program as part of the agency’s equal 
employment opportunity program. In the particular program being 
considered, the attendees were to pay for their own lunches, with the 
ethnic food samples of minimal proportion provided as a separate event. 
Thus, the samples could be distinguished from meals or refreshments, 
which remain unauthorized. (The decision did not specify how many 
“samples” an individual might consume in order to develop a fuller 
appreciation.) 

In 1999, the Comptroller General clarified that 60 Comp. Gen. 303 does not 
require that a program or event have specific advance written approval in a 
formal agency issuance to be considered a formal Equal Employment 
Opportunity program for which funds are available. “What is required is 
that the agency through an authorized official determines that the planned 
performance advances EEO objectives.” B-278805, July 21, 1999. 

Although 60 Comp. Gen. 303 was not cast in precisely these terms, it is 
another example of the “theory of relativity” in purpose availability to 
which we have alluded in various places in this chapter. Equality in all 
aspects of federal employment is now a legal mandate. An agency is 
certainly within its discretion to determine that fostering racial and ethnic 
awareness is a valid—perhaps indispensable—means of advancing this 
objective. This being the case, it is not at all far-fetched to conclude that 
certain expenditures that might be wholly inappropriate in other contexts 
could reasonably relate to this purpose. Thus, hiring an African dance 
troupe could not be justified to further an objective of, for example, 
conducting a financial audit or constructing a building or procuring a tank, 

71 Compare B-208729, May 24, 1983, in which an Army unit sponsored a catered luncheon to 
commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but—properly—charged attendees for the meal.

but the relationship changes when the objective is promoting cultural 
awareness. 

Once the concept of the preceding paragraph is understood, it should be 
apparent why, in 64 Comp. Gen. 802 (1985), GAO distinguished the cultural 
awareness cases and concluded that the Army could not use appropriated 
funds to provide free meals for handicapped employees attending a 
luncheon in honor of National Employ the Handicapped Week. This is not 
to say that an agency’s EEO program should not embrace the 
handicapped—on the contrary, it can, should, and is required to—but 
merely that “[u]nlike ethnic and cultural minorities, handicapped persons 
do not possess a common cultural heritage” within the intended scope of 
the cultural awareness cases. Id. at 804 (quoting from the request for 
decision). 

d. Entertainment of 
Nongovernment Personnel 
Just as the entertainment of government personnel is generally 
unauthorized, the entertainment of nongovernment personnel is equally 
impermissible. The basic rule is the same regardless of who is being fed or 
entertained: Appropriated funds are not available for entertainment, 
including free food, except under specific statutory authority. 

Two of the most frequently cited decisions for this proposition are 5 Comp. 
Gen. 455 (1925) and 26 Comp. Gen. 281 (1946). In 5 Comp. Gen. 455, 
expenditures by two Army officers for entertaining officials of foreign 
governments while making arrangements for an around-the-world flight 
were disallowed. In 26 Comp. Gen. 281, appropriations were held 
unavailable for dinners and luncheons for “distinguished guests” given by a 
commissioner of the Philippine War Damage Commission. Other early 
decisions on point are: 5 Comp. Gen. 1018 (1926); B-85555, June 6, 1949; 
and A-10221, Oct. 8, 1925. A limited exception was recognized in B-22307, 
Dec. 23, 1941, to permit entertainment of officials of foreign governments 
incident to the gathering of intelligence for national security. 

As with the cases dealing with government employees, a large proportion 
of the decisions tend to involve food. In 43 Comp. Gen. 305 (1963), funds 
were not available to furnish food or refreshments at “recognition 
ceremonies” for volunteers at Veterans Administration field stations. The 
ceremonies had been designed as an inducement to the volunteers to 
continue rendering service. Naturally, the situation would be permissible 
under specific statutory authority. B-152331, Nov. 19, 1975. Other examples 
are 26 Comp. Gen. 281, cited above; B-236763, Jan. 10, 1990, disallowing 
costs for refreshments for college students at recruiting functions, unless 
the costs were included in a lump-sum bill with other room facility charges; 

Page 4-123 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

and B-138081, Jan. 13, 1959, disallowing the cost of a breakfast meeting 
with Canadian officials called at the initiative of the Chairman of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Several more recent decisions illustrate the continued application of the 
rule and some of the exceptions permitted by statute. In 68 Comp. Gen. 226 
(1989), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) used its 
research and technology appropriations for entertainment expenses 
incident to a trade show it sponsored in the Soviet Union. Since HUD had 
no authority to sponsor the show, the related expenditures were improper. 
The decision further pointed out that, even if the trade show itself had been 
authorized, the research and technology appropriations still would not 
have been available for entertainment, although HUD could then have used 
its “official reception and representation” funds. See also 65 Comp. Gen. 16 
(1985) (free in-flight meals during weather research flight unauthorized for 
nongovernment personnel). 

In 57 Comp. Gen. 806 (1978), the Comptroller General held that 
appropriations available to the judiciary for jury expenses could not be 
used to buy coffee and refreshments for jurors during recesses in trial 
proceedings. The situation was analogized to the cases prohibiting the 
purchase of food from appropriated funds for employees working under 
unusual conditions. The decision noted that statutory authority existed to 
pay actual subsistence expenses for jurors under sequestration, not an 
issue in the case at hand. The relevant appropriation language was 
subsequently amended to provide for refreshments, and the authority was 
made permanent in 1989.72 

In a 1979 decision, appropriations of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission were found not available to host a reception for Hispanic 
leaders in conjunction with a planning conference. B-193661, Jan. 19, 1979. 
The case fell squarely within the general rule. So did B-205292, June 2, 1982, 
involving a Fourth of July fireworks display by a Navy station, justified as a 
community relations measure. While good community relations may be 
desirable for all government agencies, fireworks are not necessary to the 
operation and maintenance of the Navy.

The propriety of using appropriated funds to furnish luncheons to public 
school officials in conjunction with Marine Corps recruiting programs was 
considered in B-162642, Aug. 9, 1976. A statute authorized reimbursement 
of necessary expenses incurred by recruiters, and applicable regulations 
permitted the reimbursement to include small amounts spent for 
occasional lunches, snacks, or nonalcoholic beverages. GAO, however, did 
not consider a planned luncheon involving a formal presentation with a 
guest speaker as within the intended scope of the statute or regulations. 
Since the statute and regulations were broadly worded, payment in that 
case was authorized. The decision cautioned, however, against incurring 
similar expenses in the future unless the regulations were first revised to 
provide adequate guidelines and limitations. 

The National Park Service has authority to provide for “interpretive 
demonstrations” at Park Service sites. 16 U.S.C. § 1a-2(g). GAO reviewed 
this authority and its legislative history in 68 Comp. Gen. 544 (1989), 
concluding that it could properly include some level of entertainment, as 
long as it was sufficiently related to the significance of the particular site. 
Thus, there was no objection to the 1988 Railroaders Festival at the Golden 
Spike National Historic Site, which included musical entertainment by a 
band specializing in railroad and nineteenth century western American 
music. (Golden Spike is the site of the completion of the first U.S. 
transcontinental railroad in 1869.) Similarly within this authority was the 
decoration of a historic ranch house at the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National 
Historic Site to “interpret” how the ranch celebrated Christmas during the 
frontier era. B-226781, Jan. 11, 1988. However, an “open house” with 
refreshments and a visit by Santa Claus had “too indirect and conjectural a 
bearing” on the Park Services mission and was therefore unauthorized. Id. 

GAO considered whether the National Science Foundation (NSF) could use 
appropriated funds to pay for dinner-related expenses for a nonfederal 
award recipient and her spouse pursuant to a statutorily established award 
called the Alan T. Waterman Award in B-235163.11, Feb. 13, 1996. GAO 
concluded that NSF could use appropriated funds for the dinner-related 
expenses because the dinner at which the awards were presented was the 
necessary vehicle to accomplish the statutory objectives of the Waterman 
Award. 

No discussion of entertainment would be complete without B-182357, 
Dec. 9, 1975. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 
§§ 2151 et seq. (1970), authorized funds for an informational program to 
give foreign military trainees a greater exposure to American culture. To 

Page 4-125 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

implement the program, the Department of Defense set up a program 
whereby officers would serve as escorts for foreign military trainees to 
impart to them an active appreciation of American values and ideals. The 
case involved a voucher submitted by a civilian employee of the Navy for 
expenses incurred as escort officer for a group of twelve senior foreign 
naval officers being trained in the United States. The voucher included 
visits to a variety of restaurants, night clubs, and bars. One of the items was 
a visit to the Boston Playboy Club. The claimant justified the visit as 
“symbolic of the United States” and “one of the most enjoyable 
experiences” the trainees had during their stay in America. Apparently to 
get more symbolism, the party returned for a second visit. In reviewing the 
case, the Comptroller General noted that, under the statutory program, the 
funds could have been given directly to the trainees to be spent as they 
desired, and the agency would therefore have considerable discretion in 
spending the money for the trainees. In addition, the regulations provided 
“no guidance whatsoever” on the limits of the program. Somewhat 
reluctantly, the Comptroller General was forced to conclude that “the lack 
of adequate guidance to the escort officer leaves us no alternative but to 
allow him credit for the expenses incurred.” 

e. Recreational and Welfare 
Facilities for Government 
Personnel 
(1) The rules: older cases and modern trends 
The basic rule for recreational facilities—which, as we shall see, has 
become more flexible—was established in early decisions: Appropriations 
are not available unless the expenditure is authorized by express statutory 
provision or by necessary implication. Thus, in 18 Comp. Gen. 147 (1938), 
appropriations for a river and harbor project on Midway Island were held 
not available to provide recreational facilities such as athletic facilities and 
motion pictures for the working force. Similarly, in 27 Comp. Gen. 679 
(1948), the Comptroller General advised that Navy appropriations were not 
available to hire full-time or part-time employees to develop and supervise 
recreational programs for civilian employees of the Navy. The reason in 
both cases was that the expenditure would have at best only an indirect 
bearing on the purposes for which the appropriations were made. 

Other early decisions applying the general rule are B-49169, May 5, 1945 
(rental of motion picture by Bonneville Power Administration); B-37344, 
Oct. 14, 1943 (footballs and basketballs for employees in Forest Service 
camps); and A-55035, May 19, 1934 (billiard tables for Tennessee Valley 
Authority employees). In B-49169, the Comptroller General pointed out that 
the Administrators authority to make such expenditures as he “may find 
necessary” does not mean anything he may approve, regardless of its 

Page 4-126 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

nature, but the expenditures must bear a direct relationship to the 
purposes to be accomplished under the particular legislation. 

It follows that, as a general proposition, appropriated funds may not be 
used to underwrite travel to or participation in sports or recreational 
events since this is not the performance of public business. 42 Comp. 
Gen. 233 (1962). For example, in 73 Comp. Gen. 169 (1994), appropriated 
funds were not available to the Department of Energy to pay the 
registration fees of employees participating in competitive fitness 
promotion, team activities, and sporting events. GAO concluded that these 
activities were not an essential part of a statutorily authorized physical 
fitness program and therefore were “generally personal, rather than 
official,” with costs to be “borne by the participating employees, not by the 
taxpayers.” Id. at 170. See also B-247563.3, Apr. 5, 1996 (Department of 
Veterans Affairs appropriations not available for registration fees for 
athletic contest “virtually indistinguishable” from contest in 73 Comp. 
Gen. 169). Similarly, in B-262008, Oct. 23, 1996, GAO found that the Army 
Corps of Engineers could not use appropriated funds to pay an entrance fee 
for Corps employees in a “Corporate Cup Run” sponsored by the American 
Lung Association. The fact that the employees were to participate as an 
agency-sponsored team, rather than as individuals, did not change the 
result. GAO cited the “absence of any justification to show that 
participation of employees in the run—a competitive athletic event—in any 
way supports the mission of the Corps.” 

Of course, the particular circumstances may warrant an exception. Thus, 
appropriations for “student athletic and related activities” at the Federal 
Law Enforcement Training Center may be used to provide limited off-site 
busing to shopping centers, recreational facilities, and places of worship in 
the nearest town several miles away. The students—government 
employees in travel status—must live at the Center for several weeks, most 
do not have cars, and there is no public transportation to the nearest town. 

B-214638, Aug. 13, 1984. 

One area in which recreational and welfare expenditures have been 
permitted with some regularity is where employees are located at a remote 
site, where such facilities would not otherwise be available. Expenditures 
were permitted in the following cases: 

• Purchase of ping pong paddles and balls by the Corps of Engineers to 
equip a recreation room on a seagoing dredge. B-61076, Feb. 25, 1947. 

Page 4-127 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

• Transportation of musical instruments, billiard and ping pong tables, 
and baseball equipment, obtained from surplus military stock, to 
isolated Weather Bureau installations in the Arctic. B-144237, Nov. 7, 
1960. 

• Purchase of playground equipment for children of employees living in a 
government-owned housing facility in connection with the operation of 
a dam on the Rio Grande River in an isolated area. 41 Comp. Gen. 264 
(1961). The agency in that case had statutory authority to provide 
recreational facilities for employees and the question was whether that 
authority extended to employees families as well. It did. 

• Use of an appropriation of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
for construction of “quarters and related accommodations” to provide 
tennis courts and playground facilities in an isolated sector of the 
Panama Canal Zone. B-173009, July 20, 1971. 

• Purchase of a television set and antenna for use by the crew on a ship 
owned by the Environmental Protection Agency. The ship was used to 
gather and evaluate water samples from the Great Lakes, and cruises 
lasted for up to 15 days. The alternative would have been to extend the 
length of the cruises to permit more frequent docking. 54 Comp. 
Gen. 1075 (1975). 

• Provision of television services for National Weather Service 
employees on a remote island in the Bering Sea. The agency was 
authorized to furnish recreational facilities by the Fur Seal Act of 1966, 
but the statute also required that the employees be charged a 
reasonable fee. B-186798, Sept. 16, 1976. 

• Use of government vehicles to transport FAA employees on temporary 
duty at a remote duty location permissible under applicable Federal 
Travel Regulations, subject to “reasonable limitations and safeguards.” 
B-254296, Nov. 23, 1993. The employees were on temporary duty 
assignments at a remote Alaskan station. 

In recent decades, the role of certain “employee welfare” activities in 
employee morale and productivity has been increasingly recognized. See 
71 Comp. Gen. 527, 529 (1992) (GAO has “accepted the retention of 
employees and promotion of employee morale, generally, as a justification 
for paying some expenses that, in many circumstances, would be viewed as 
personal in nature . . .”). In some instances, the recognition has been 

Page 4-128 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

accompanied by statutory authority. For example, the Defense Department 
has specific authority to use appropriated funds for welfare and recreation. 
This authority originated in general provisions contained in annual 
appropriation acts, was made permanent in 1983,73 and is now codified at 
10 U.S.C. § 2241. See also 10 U.S.C. § 2494 (Department of Defense funds 
available for morale, welfare, and recreation programs under certain 
circumstances “may be treated as nonappropriated funds and expended in 
accordance with laws applicable to the expenditure of nonappropriated 
funds.”).74 On the other hand, there are limits to congressional support for 
recreational funding. Congress has found it necessary to enact a specific 
statutory prohibition on the use of Defense appropriated funds to “equip, 
operate, or maintain” a golf course that is neither outside the United States 
nor at a “remote and isolated location” within the United States. 10 U.S.C. 
§ 2246. (Note that this statute does not restrict the use of nonappropriated 
funds for golf courses.) GAO interpreted section 2246 in B-277905, Mar. 17, 
1998, involving installation of irrigation pipelines for a golf course at Fort 
Sam Houston, Texas. GAO concluded that the explicit statutory prohibition 
of 10 U.S.C. § 2246 was not overcome by other statutes encouraging agency 
cooperation with state and local water conservation efforts, finding that “a 
statute that is clear and unambiguous on its face should be construed to 
mean what it says.” 

The civilian agencies generally do not have statutory authority comparable 
to that of the Department of Defense, and decisions must be made, for the 
most part, under 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) and the necessary expense doctrine. 
Even here, however, the rather strict rule of the early decisions has 
undergone some liberalization, even in nonremote locations. While the 
general rule expressed in 18 Comp. Gen. 147 and 27 Comp. Gen. 679 
remains as a bar to indiscriminate expenditures, it may now be said that an 
agency has reasonable discretion to spend its money for employee welfare 
purposes if the expenditure can be said to enhance employee morale and to 
be a significant factor in hiring and retention. The test remains one of 
necessity, but it is evaluated in terms of the agency’s legitimate interest in 
the welfare, morale, and productivity of its employees. Determinations 
must be made on a case-by-case basis. 

73 Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-212, § 735, 97 Stat. 1421, 
1444 (Dec. 8, 1983). 

74 See Chapter 14, section C, “Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities” (Volume III of the 
third edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations Law).

A good illustration of this evolution is the treatment of programmed 
“incentive music” (sometimes called “Muzak”75 or, by its detractors, 
“elevator music”). When GAO first visited the issue, it concluded that an 
agency could not, within its legitimate range of discretion, find this to be a 
necessary expense. B-86148, Nov. 8, 1950. The issue arose again 20 years 
later when the Bureau of the Public Debt, Treasury Department, asked if it 
could use its Salaries and Expenses appropriation to provide programmed 
incentive music for its employees. The system had been installed by a 
previous tenant and the speakers were located in central work areas rather 
than in private offices. The Bureau pointed out that private concerns had 
found that such music enhanced employee morale by “creating a pleasantly 
stimulating and efficient atmosphere during the workday” and helped to 
minimize employee boredom. GAO had rejected similar arguments in the 
1950 decision. This time, GAO concurred, accepting the Bureau’s 
justification that the expenditure would improve employee morale and 
increase productivity. 51 Comp. Gen. 797 (1972), overruling B-86148. In 
terms of the legal principle involved, whether GAO agreed with the 
justification or not was irrelevant; all that matters is that the determination 
is now viewed as a proper exercise of agency discretion. 

Another example of a permissible expenditure in this area is the 
subsidization of employee cafeterias, previously discussed. Still another is 
parking facilities, discussed later in the section on personal expenses. Two 
items covered in the section on health and medical care—physical fitness 
activities and smoking cessation programs—further illustrate evolving 
trends in the area of employee welfare and morale. A final example is our 
next topic, child care. 

(2) Child care76 

Like the cultural awareness programs previously discussed, child care is 
another example of evolution in the law to accommodate a changing 
society. Prior to 1985, there was no express statutory authority for using 

75 The name is derived from the MUZAK Company, one of the providers. 

76 The statutes and cases discussed in this section concern the use of appropriated funds for 
federal child care facilities. They do not concern child care expenses incurred by federal 
employees as travel costs. See, e.g., B-246829, May 18, 1982 (“Our decisions have clearly 
held that fees for child care are not reimbursable expenses in connection with an employees 
travel or relocation since neither the governing statutes nor the [Federal Travel Regulations] 
authorize such an entitlement.”).

appropriated funds to support child care services in federal buildings for 
federal employees. 

Times have changed and the federal government, as an employer, is not 
immune from the changes. The number of single-parent families in America 
has increased dramatically, as has the number of two-parent families in 
which both parents work, out of either economic necessity, personal 
choice, or some combination of factors. The inevitable result is a 
heightened awareness of the need for child care.77 

GAO’s first written discussion of the authority to spend appropriated funds 
to provide child care services for government employees, B-39772-O.M., 
July 30, 1976, was not a decision to another agency but an internal 
memorandum from the General Counsel analyzing GAO’s own authority. 
GAO was considering establishing a day care center in its own building, to 
be funded and operated by employees. GAO’s administrative officials 
wanted to know what kinds of support the agency could or could not 
provide without statutory authority, which, at the time, did not exist. 

The General Counsel analyzed the questions from the perspective of 
purpose availability, and concluded that the Comptroller General could 
allocate space in the GAO building for a day care center, could use GAO’s 
appropriations to renovate the space and buy equipment, and could assume 
part or all of the rent payable to the General Services Administration for the 
space. 

However, before any of these things could be done, the Comptroller 
General, as the agency head, would first have to determine that the 
expenditure would materially contribute to recruiting or retaining staff or 
maintaining employee morale and hence efficiency and productivity. 
Because of the lack of statutory authority, the memorandum cautioned that 
GAO should disclose any substantial capital expenditures for renovation in 
its budget presentation and to the Appropriations Committees if it chose to 
take such action. See also B-205342, Dec. 8, 1981 (nondecision letter), 
reiterating the general conclusion of the 1976 memorandum. As it turned 

77 Some GAO reports on child care in the federal sector are: U.S. General Accounting Office,

Civilian Dependents at Selected DOD Installations, GAO/HRD-88-115 (Washington, D.C.: 
Sept. 15, 1988).

out, GAO did not establish a day care center until after the enactment of 
40 U.S.C. § 590 (formerly 40 U.S.C. § 490b), discussed below. 

Prior to the enactment of more general legislation in 1985, some agencies 
had authority to provide day care facilities under agency-specific 
legislation. For example, legislation authorized the then Department of 
Health, Education, and Welfare to donate space for day care centers.78 In 
57 Comp. Gen. 357 (1978), the Comptroller General held that the use of the 
term “donate” gave the agency discretion to provide the space without 
charge, or to lease space in other buildings for that purpose if suitable 
space was not available in buildings the agency already occupied. Also, as 
we have seen, the Defense Department has specific authority to use 
operation and maintenance appropriations for welfare expenditures. 

In 1985, Congress enacted former 40 U.S.C. § 490b, now recodified at 
40 U.S.C. § 590, which authorizes, but does not require, federal agencies to 
provide space and services for child care centers. The term “services” is 
defined as including “lighting, heating, cooling, electricity, office furniture, 
office machines and equipment, classroom furnishings and equipment, 
kitchen appliances, playground equipment, telephone service (including 
installation of lines and equipment . . .), and security systems ….” Id. 
§ 590(c)(1).79 The space and services may be provided with or without 
charge. 

The Comptroller General’s first construction of this statute came in 
response to an arbitration panel award that included a union day care 
proposal for the children of civilian employees. Council 214, American 
Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, 15 F.L.R.A. 151 (1984), 
aff’d sub nom. Department of Air Force v. Federal Labor Relations 
Authority, 775 F.2d 727 (6th Cir. 1985). The Federal Labor Relations 
Authority directed the Air Force to incorporate the award in its collective 
bargaining agreement,80 and the Air Force in turn asked GAO whether, 
under former 40 U.S.C. § 490b, it had authority to use its appropriations to 

78 Education Amendments of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-482, § 524, 90 Stat. 2081, 2240 (Oct. 12, 
1976), codified at 20 U.S.C. § 2564. 

79 The definition was patterned generally after the statute authorizing agencies to provide 
space to federal credit unions, 12 U.S.C. § 1770, discussed in 66 Comp. Gen. 356 (1987). 

80 The fact that day care is involved cannot be determined from either opinion, both of which 
discuss procedural issues. 

Page 4-132 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

implement the award. The resulting decision, 67 Comp. Gen. 443 (1988), 
reached the following conclusions: 

• The Air Force can, either with or without charge, allot space in 

government buildings under its control for child care facilities for 

civilian employees, and can provide the services outlined in the statute. 

• The Air Force can use its appropriations to renovate, modify, or expand 
the space allotted to make it suitable for use as a child care facility. 

• The Air Force can expand existing child care facilities for military 
personnel to accommodate the children of civilian employees. 

The decision also concluded that any reimbursements received from a 
child care center (which, as noted, are optional) must be deposited in the 
Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. 

In 70 Comp. Gen. 210 (1991), GAO concluded that former 40 U.S.C. § 490b 
did not preclude the General Services Administration from leasing space or 
constructing buildings for child care facilities if there is insufficient space 
available in existing federal buildings. The authority in section 490b to use 
existing space was not exclusive. (The 1988 decision to the Air Force, 
67 Comp. Gen. 443, had expressed a contrary view and was overruled to 
that extent.) In 73 Comp. Gen. 336 (1994), GAO approved the use of 
appropriated funds by the Forest Service to pay a consultant for services 
rendered to a Forest Service-supported child care center on Forest Service 
premises. Citing former section 490b and a recurring appropriation act 
provision that permitted payment of expenses (predecessor to 40 U.S.C. 
§ 590(d)(2), discussed below), GAO concluded that Forest Service funds 
were available to pay “start-up/support costs” for the day care facility, 
including consultant services. 

In 1998, Congress made permanent a recurring appropriation act provision 
authorizing reimbursement of “travel, transportation, and subsistence 
expenses incurred for training classes, conferences, or other meetings” in 
connection with the provision of child care services. Pub. L. No. 105-277, 
div. A, § 101(h) (title VI, § 603), 112 Stat. 2681-480, 2681-513 (Oct. 21, 1998). 
This statute is now codified at 40 U.S.C. § 590(d)(2). 

Similarly, in 2001, Congress made permanent another recurring provision

115 Stat. 514, 552–53 (Nov. 12, 2001). This statute is now codified at

(Mar. 24, 2003) (Interim Rule). 

In late 1989, Congress enacted new child care legislation for the armed 
forces, including the authority to use fees collected from parents. Military 
Child Care Act of 1989, title XV of the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, Pub. L. No. 101-189, 103 Stat. 1352, 1589 
(Nov. 29, 1989), formerly codified at 10 U.S.C. § 103 note. This provision 
was revised and recodified by Pub. L. No. 104-106, § 568, 110 Stat. 186, 329– 
336 (Feb. 10, 1996), which added new legislation governing Department of 
Defense child care programs. 10 U.S.C. § 1791 et seq.81 Section 1791 
expresses the policy of Congress that: 

“[T]he amount of appropriated funds available during a 
fiscal year for operating expenses for military child 
development centers and programs shall be not less than 
the amount of child care fee receipts that are estimated to 
be received by the Department of Defense during that fiscal 
year.”82 

In 71 Comp. Gen. 527 (1992), GAO addressed the analogous issue of the use 
of appropriated funds to provide “eldercare” facilities for adult relatives of 
federal employees, as well as related counseling services. In response to a 
request for a decision from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), GAO 
concluded that eldercare was not a necessary expense for which IRS’s 
appropriations were available. GAO pointed out that Congress had 
provided specific authority for child care in former 40 U.S.C. § 490b and, 
since eldercare was not a “typical benefit offered the American workforce,” 
similar benefits were available to federal workers only pursuant to specific 
legislation. It was “for the Congress to decide whether agency 
appropriations [could] be used to support eldercare centers.” IRS’s 
appropriations, therefore, were not available for costs associated with

eldercare facilities. IRS’s appropriated funds were available, however, “to 
implement a resource and referral service on eldercare issues” under the 
authority of 5 U.S.C. § 7901, which authorizes “preventive programs related 
to health.” Id. at 530. 

Implicit in all of our discussion of entertainment is the point that otherwise 
improper expenditures may be authorized under specific statutory 
authority. Congress has long recognized that many agencies have a 
legitimate need for items that otherwise would be prohibited as 
entertainment, and has responded by making limited amounts available for 
official entertainment to those agencies that can justify the need. 
Entertainment appropriations originated from the need to permit officials 
of agencies whose activities involve substantial contact with foreign 
officials to reciprocate for courtesies extended to them by foreign officials. 
For example, the State Department would find it difficult to accomplish its 
mission if it could not spend any money entertaining foreign officials. In 
fact, some of the early entertainment appropriations were limited to 
entertaining non-U.S. citizens, and some could only be spent overseas. An 
example of the latter type is discussed in B-46169, Dec. 21, 1944. 
Restrictions of this nature have become increasingly uncommon. 

Entertainment appropriations may take various forms. Some agencies have 
their own well-established structures that may include permanent 
legislation. For example, the State Department has permanent 
authorization to pay for official entertainment. 22 U.S.C. § 4085. See also 
22 U.S.C. § 2671, which authorizes expenditures for “unforeseen 
emergencies” that may include official entertainment in certain contexts. 
The authority of 22 U.S.C. § 4085 is implemented by means of annual 
appropriations under the heading “Representation Allowances.”83 State 
Department representation allowances have been found available for rental 
of formal evening wear by embassy officials accompanying the 
Ambassador to the United Kingdom in presenting his credentials to the 
Queen, 68 Comp. Gen. 638 (1989); hiring extra waiters and busboys to serve 
at official functions at foreign posts, 64 Comp. Gen. 138 (1984); meals for 
certain embassy officials at Rotary Club meetings in Tanzania, if approved 
by the local Chief of Mission, B-232165, June 14, 1989; and reimbursement

posts is U.S. General Accounting Office, Representational Funds: State 
Department Expenditures at Selected Posts, GAO/NSIAD-87-73FS 
(Washington, D.C.: Feb. 3, 1987). 

The Defense Department also has its own structure. Under 10 U.S.C. § 127, 
the Secretary of Defense, or of a military department, within the limitations 
of appropriations made for that purpose, may use funds to “provide for any 
emergency or extraordinary expense which cannot be anticipated or 
classified.” See Official Representation Funds, DOD Directive 7250.13 
(Sept. 10, 2002). When so provided in an appropriation, the official may 
spend the funds “for any purpose he determines to be proper.” 10 U.S.C. 
§ 127(a). See 72 Comp. Gen. 279 (1993) (certifying officer processing 
voucher under 10 U.S.C. § 127 is responsible only for errors made in his 
own processing of the voucher, and not for the Defense Attache’s prior 
certification as to the propriety of the payment). Annual Operation and 
Maintenance appropriations include amounts for “emergencies and 
extraordinary expenses.”84 Although the title is not particularly revealing, it 
has long been understood that official representation expenses are charged 
to this account. See U.S. General Accounting Office, Internal Controls: 
Defenses Use of Emergency and Extraordinary Funds, GAO/AFMD-86-44 
(Washington, D.C.: June 4, 1986); DOD Use of Official Representation 
Funds to Entertain Foreign Dignitaries, GAO/ID-83-7 (Washington, D.C.: 
Dec. 29, 1982); 69 Comp. Gen. 242 (1990) (reception for newly assigned 
commander at U.S. Army School of the Americas). 

With these two major exceptions, most agencies follow a similar pattern 
and receive their entertainment funds, if they receive them at all, simply as 
part of their annual appropriations. The appropriation may specify that it 
will be available for “entertainment.” See, e.g., B-20085, Sept. 10, 1941. Far 
more commonly, however, the term used in the appropriation is “official 
reception and representation (R&R).” This has come to be the technical 
“appropriations language” for entertainment. 

While we cannot guarantee that one does not exist somewhere, we have 
not found a congressional definition of the term “official R&R.” Absent a 
definition, we found it instructive to review agency justifications to see 

84 E.g., Department of Defense Appropriations Act 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-248, 116 Stat. 1519, 
1521 (Army), 1522 (Navy, Air Force, Defense-Wide), 1535 (Inspector General) (Oct. 23, 
2002).

what sort of authority Congress thought it was conferring. The term seems 
to have originated—or at least became more widespread—in the early 
1960s. We identified the first appearance of the term for a number of 
agencies, and selected two, the Departments of Agriculture and Interior, as 
illustrative. Both agencies first received “official R&R” funds in their 
appropriations for fiscal year 1963.85 

The Agriculture Department explained that the Secretary frequently finds it 
necessary to provide a luncheon or similar courtesy to various individuals 
and small groups in the conduct of official business, to promote effective 
working relationships with farm, trade, industry, and other groups that are 
directly related to accomplishing the Agriculture Departments work. Such 
official courtesies benefit the government, and the Secretary and Under 
Secretary of Agriculture should not be required to bear these expenses 
from their own personal funds as was then the case. In conclusion, the 
justification observed that “[i]t is unseemly that the hospitality should 
always be left to the visitor.” 86 Similarly, the Interior Department explained 
that its request for “not to exceed $2,000 for official reception and 
representation expenses” was intended to provide authority to use 
appropriated funds for expenses incurred by the Interior Secretary “in 
fulfilling the courtesy and social responsibilities directly associated with 
his official duties,” in situations much like those the Agriculture 
Department had noted. Such official expenses, the justification asserted, 
“rightly should be borne by the Government rather than be financed from 
personal funds.”87 

One point that is clear from these excerpts is that an R&R appropriation, 
whatever its origins may have been, is not limited to the entertainment of 
foreign nationals, unless of course the appropriation language so provides. 
The experience of the former Department of Health, Education, and 
Welfare (HEW) provides further evidence that, absent some indication to

the contrary, Congress does not intend that an “official R&R” appropriation 
be limited to entertaining foreign nationals. The Secretary of HEW first 
received an entertainment appropriation in HEW’s fiscal year 1960 
appropriation act, but it was limited to certain foreign visitors.88 The 
language was changed to “official reception and representation” in HEW’s 
fiscal year 1964 appropriation.89 The conference report on the 1964 
appropriation explained that the change was intended to expand the scope 
of the appropriation to include U.S. citizens as well as foreign visitors.90 

It is clear that R&R appropriations have traditionally been sought, justified, 
and granted in the context of an agency’s need to interact with various 
nongovernment individuals or organizations. Precisely who these 
individuals or organizations might be will vary with the agency. Of course, 
the fact that the thrust of the appropriation is the entertainment of 
nongovernment persons does not mean that government persons are 
precluded. For example, it has long been recognized that persons from 
other agencies (and by necessary implication members of the host agency 
as well) may be included incident to an authorized entertainment function 
for nongovernment persons. E.g., B-84184, Mar. 17, 1949. 

An agency has wide discretion in the use of its R&R appropriation.

branch employees personally hosted by Director of the Trade and

In a case previously noted in our coverage of award ceremonies, the 
Veterans Administration could not use its general appropriations to provide 
refreshments at an awards ceremony for volunteers, but it could use its 
R&R appropriation. 43 Comp. Gen. 305 (1963). An agency may also use its 
R&R funds, although it is not required to, for refreshments at award 
ceremonies under the Government Employees’ Incentive Awards Act, 
5 U.S.C. §§ 4501–4506. 65 Comp. Gen. 738, 741 n.5 (1986). 

A case relied on in B-223678 was B-122515, Feb. 23, 1955, in which the 
Comptroller General held that a “representation allowance” similar to the 
State Department appropriation discussed above could be used to 
purchase printed invitation cards and envelopes in connection with an 
official function at an overseas mission. In 42 Comp. Gen. 19 (1962) and in 
B-131611, May 24, 1957, however, a similar appropriation to the Foreign 
Agricultural Service was not available for printed invitations because an 
executive order provided that the Foreign Agricultural Service was to be 
governed by State Department regulations, and the applicable State 
Department regulations prohibited the use of representation allowances 
for printing cards. 

91 The decision modified the result of an earlier decision, B-46169, Dec. 21, 1944, based on a 
change in the relevant appropriation language. The 1944 decision contains a fuller statement 
of the facts.

Notwithstanding the discretion it confers, an R&R appropriation is not 
intended to permit government officials to feed themselves and one 
another incident to the normal day-to-day performance of their jobs. Thus, 
GAO has held that R&R funds may not be used to provide food or 
refreshments at intra-government work sessions or routine business 
meetings, even if held outside of normal working hours. B-223678, June 5, 
1989. See also B-250884, Mar. 18, 1993 (the cost of meals provided to 
government employees during interagency working meetings improperly 
charged to R&R funds). 

A final but significant limitation on the use of representation funds stems 
from the appropriation language itself—R&R appropriations are made for 
the expenses of official reception and representation activities. There must 
be some connection with official agency business. Thus, it would be 
improper to use representation funds for a social function hosted and 
attended by private parties, such as a breakfast for Cabinet wives. 
61 Comp. Gen. 260 (1982), aff’d upon reconsideration B-206173(2), Aug. 3, 
1982. Similarly, R&R funds may not be used for entertainment incident to 
an activity which is itself unauthorized. 68 Comp. Gen. 226 (1989) 
(entertainment incident to trade show in Soviet Union which agency had no 
authority to sponsor). The impropriety of the underlying activity 
necessarily “taints” the entertainment expenditures. 

6. Fines and Penalties As a general proposition, no authority exists for the federal government to 
use appropriated funds to pay fines or penalties incurred as a result of its 
activities or those of its employees. 
In the most common situation, a fine is assessed against an individual 
employee for some action he or she took in the course of performing 
official duties. The cases frequently involve traffic violations. The rule is 
that appropriated funds are not available to pay the fine or reimburse the 
employee. The theory is that, while an employee may have certain 
discretion as to precisely how to perform a given task, the range of 
permissible discretion does not include violating the law. If the employee 
chooses to violate the law, he is acting beyond the scope of his authority 
and must bear any resulting liability as his personal responsibility. 

The earliest case stating the rule appears to be B-58378, July 31, 1946. 
Holding that a government employee ticketed for parking a government 
vehicle in a “no parking” zone could not be reimbursed, the Comptroller 
General stated: 

Page 4-140 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

“[T]here is not known to this office any authority to use 
appropriated moneys for payment of the amount of a fine 
imposed by a court on a Government employee for an 
offense committed by him while in the performance of, but 
not as a part of, his official duty. Such fine is imposed on the 
employee personally and payment thereof is his personal 
responsibility.” 

The rule applies to forfeitures of collateral as well as fines. B-102829, 
May 8, 1951. 

The first published decision stating the rule, and the case most often cited, 
is 31 Comp. Gen. 246 (1952). A government employee double-parked a 
government vehicle to make a delivery. While the employee was inside the 
building, the inner vehicle drove away, leaving the government vehicle 
unattended in the middle of the street, whereupon it was ticketed. Citing 
B-58378 and B-102829, the Comptroller General held that the employee 
could not be reimbursed from appropriated funds for the amount of the 
fine.92 

GAO has applied the rule even in a case where the employee could 
establish that the speedometer on the government vehicle was inaccurate. 
B-173660, Nov. 18, 1971. While at first glance this might seem like a harsh 
and unfair result, it in fact was not, at least in that particular case. In that 
case, the employee was ticketed for driving at 85 m.p.h. The speedometer 
at the time read a mere 73 m.p.h. Conceding the established inaccuracy of 
the speedometer, the employee nevertheless, by observing other vehicles 
on the road and applying common sense, should have suspected that he 
was driving at an excessive rate of speed. 

Further, in a case involving a possessory interest tax, a tax on the rental 
interest in government owned property, B-251228, July 20, 1993, the Forest 
Service was not permitted to pay penalties and interest assessed against an 
employee for a delay in payment of the tax due while the employee 
occupied government-owned quarters. The penalties and interest were 

92 For other cases involving motor vehicle violations, see 57 Comp. Gen. 270 (1978); 
B-250880, Nov. 3, 1992; B-238612, Apr. 16, 1990; B-147420, Apr. 18, 1968; B-168096-O.M., 
Aug. 31, 1976; B-147420, July 27, 1977 (nondecision letter); B-173783.188, Mar. 24, 1976 
(nondecision letter).

considered to be personal liabilities of the employee and not the federal 
government. 

The very statement of the rule as quoted above from B-58378 suggests that 
there may be situations in which reimbursement is permissible. The 
exception occurred in 44 Comp. Gen. 312 (1964). In connection with the 
case of Sam Giancana v. J. Edgar Hoover, 322 F.2d 789 (7th Cir. 1963), an 
agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was ordered by the court 
to answer certain questions. Based on Justice Department regulations and 
specific instructions from the Attorney General, the FBI agent refused to 
testify and was fined for contempt of court. The contempt order was 
upheld in Sam Giancana v. Marlin W. Johnson, 335 F.2d 372 (7th Cir. 1964). 
Finding that the employee had incurred the fine by reason of his 
compliance with Department regulations and instructions and that he was 
without fault or negligence, GAO held that the FBI could reimburse the 
agent from its Salaries and Expenses appropriation under the “necessary 
expense” doctrine.93 

Subsequently, some people thought that 31 Comp. Gen. 246 and 44 Comp. 
Gen. 312 appeared inconsistent, and GAO has discussed the two lines of 
reasoning in several later decisions. The distinction is this: in 31 Comp. 
Gen. 246, the offense was committed while performing official duties but it 
was not a necessary part of those duties. The employee could have made 
the delivery without parking illegally. The fine in 44 Comp. Gen. 312 was 
“necessarily incurred” in the sense that the employee was following his 
agency’s regulations and the instructions of his agency head. Thus, the 
actions that gave rise to the contempt fine could be viewed as a necessary 
part of the employee’s official duties, although certainly not in the sense 
that it would have been physically impossible for the employee to have 
done anything else. 

Applying these concepts, the Comptroller General held in B-205438, 
Nov. 12, 1981, that the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service could 
reimburse a former employee for a contempt fine levied against him for 
refusal to testify, pursuant to agency regulations and instructions, on 
matters discussed at a mediation session at which he was present while 
employed by the agency. 

93 B-239556, Oct. 12, 1990 and B-242786, Jan. 31, 1991, substantially supported the rule stated 
in Giancana and explained the rationale behind it drawing a distinction between criminal 
and civil contempt and the punitive nature of the awards. 

Page 4-142 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Reimbursement was denied, however, in B-186680, Oct. 4, 1976. There, a 
Justice Department attorney was fined for contempt for missing a court-
imposed deadline. The attorney had been working under a number of tight 
deadlines and argued that it was impossible to meet them all. However, he 
had not been acting in compliance with regulations or instructions, had 
exercised his own judgment in missing the deadline in question, and the 
record did not support a determination that he was without fault or 
negligence in the matter. Therefore, the case was governed by 31 Comp. 
Gen. 246 rather than 44 Comp. Gen. 312. 

Reading all of these cases together, it seems fair to state that the mere fact 
of compliance with instructions will not by itself be sufficient to authorize 
reimbursement. There must be some legitimate government interest to 
protect. Thus, it would not be sufficient to instruct an employee to refuse to 
testify where the purpose is to avoid embarrassment or to avoid the 
disclosure of government wrongdoing. Similarly, it would follow that the 
prohibition against reimbursement of traffic fines could not be 
circumvented merely because some supervisor instructed a subordinate to 
park illegally. 

The two lines of cases were discussed in the specific context of traffic 
violations in B-107081, Jan. 22, 1980, a response to a Member of Congress. 
Summarizing the rules discussed above, the Comptroller General pointed 
out that they applied equally to law enforcement personnel. However, the 
Comptroller General alluded to one situation in which reimbursement 
might be authorized—a parking fine incurred by a law enforcement official 
as a necessary part of an official investigation. An example might be 
parking an unmarked undercover vehicle during a surveillance where there 
was no other feasible alternative. Compare 38 Comp. Gen. 258 (1958) 
concerning the reimbursement of parking meter fees. 

Another situation in which a fine was held reimbursable is illustrated in 
57 Comp. Gen. 476 (1978). Forest Service employees had loaded logs on a 
truck to transport them from Virginia to West Virginia. In Virginia, the 
driver was fined for improper loading (overweight on rear axle). The 
employees had loaded the logs in a forest and there was no way for them to 
have checked the weight. The fine did not result from any negligent or 
intentional act on the part of the driver. Under these circumstances, the 
Comptroller General found that the fine was not for any personal 
wrongdoing by the employee but was, in effect, a citation against the 
United States. Therefore, Forest Service appropriations were available to 
reimburse the fine. This situation is distinguishable from the case of an 

Page 4-143 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

overweight fine levied against a commercial carrier, which is not 
reimbursable. 35 Comp. Gen. 317 (1955). 

Similar reasoning applies with respect to penalties in the form of liquidated 
damages assessed against a government employee who fails to either use 
or cancel airline reservations in accordance with the carrier’s applicable 
tariff. If the charges are unavoidable in the conduct of official travel or are 
incurred for reasons beyond the traveler’s control and acceptable to the 
agency concerned, they may be reimbursed from the agency’s travel 
appropriations. However, if the charges are not unavoidable in the 
performance of official business nor incurred for reasons beyond the 
employee’s control and acceptable to the agency, they are personal to the 
employee and may not be reimbursed. 41 Comp. Gen. 806 (1962). 

In 70 Comp. Gen. 153 (1990), GAO recognized that the government may 
reimburse an employee for the payment of a fine or penalty where the 
government has agreed to do so by contract. In this case, the Selective 
Service System had leased vehicles under a contract with a commercial 
vendor in the District of Columbia. The government had agreed to “hold 
[the] lessor harmless” for any fine or penalty imposed on the vehicles. One 
of the vehicles received a ticket for failure to have a current safety 
inspection sticker. Although the lessor was arguably responsible for the 
ticket, the government employee had paid the ticket and was seeking 
reimbursement. GAO therein stated that: 

“[T]he government’s immunity from state or municipal fines 
is inapplicable when the legal incidence of the fine is not 
imposed directly on the government but, instead, is imposed 
on the lessor, and the fine is merely a measure of damages 
for the government’s failure to comply with the terms of its 
agreement and against which the government has agreed to 
indemnify the lessor.” 

The case was returned to the Selective Service System to make a 
determination as to whether, under D.C. law, the lessor was liable for the 
ticket. For further discussion of the concept of “legal incidence” and the 
government’s immunity, see section C.7.c in this chapter. 

The cases discussed so far have all involved fines levied against individual 
employees. Questions may also arise over the liability of a federal agency 
for a fine or civil penalty. The question is essentially one of sovereign 
immunity. In order for a federal agency to be liable for a fine or penalty, 

Page 4-144 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

there must be an express statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. E.g., 
United States Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U.S. 607 (1992). 

For example, the Clean Air Act provides for the administrative imposition 
of civil penalties for violation of state or local air quality standards. The 
statute directs the federal government to comply with these standards and 
makes government agencies liable for the civil penalties to the same extent 
as nongovernmental entities. In view of this express waiver of sovereign 
immunity, the Comptroller General held that agency operating 
appropriations are available, under the “necessary expense” theory, to pay 
administratively imposed civil penalties under the Clean Air Act. B-191747, 
June 6, 1978. If the penalty is imposed by court action, it may be paid from 
the permanent judgment appropriation, 31 U.S.C. § 1304. However, if there 
is no legitimate dispute over the basis for liability or the amount of the 
penalty, an agency may not avoid use of its own appropriations by the 
simple device of refusing to pay and forcing the state or local authority to 
sue. 58 Comp. Gen. 667 (1979). 

Absent the requisite statutory waiver of sovereign immunity, the agency’s 
appropriations would not be available to pay a fine or penalty. For example, 
in 65 Comp. Gen. 61 (1985), appropriated funds were not available to pay a 
“fee,” which was clearly in the nature of a penalty, imposed by a city of 
Boston ordinance for equipment malfunctions resulting in the transmission 
of false fire alarms. See also B-227388, Sept. 3, 1987 (no authority to pay 
false alarm fines imposed by municipality). 

What about a penalty assessed by one federal agency against another? In 
B-161457, May 9, 1978, the Comptroller General held that, absent a statute 
specifically so providing, an agency’s appropriations are not available to 
pay penalties assessed by the Internal Revenue Service for late filing or 
underpayment of employment taxes. The reason is that this would 
constitute a use of the funds for a purpose other than that for which they 
were appropriated. Also, in B-260532, May 9, 1995, the Comptroller General 
held that there was no authority for the Government Printing Office to 
directly charge other federal agencies interest for payments that the 
Government Printing Office considered to be “late.”

7. Firefighting and Other 
Municipal Services 
a. Firefighting Services: 
Availability of 
Appropriations 
A frequent subject of inquiry has been the authority of the federal 
government to voluntarily contract, or to pay involuntary assessments, for 
firefighting services rendered by local governments to federal property and 
buildings. The general rule is: If the political subdivision rendering the 
service is required by law to extinguish fires within its boundaries, then the 
United States cannot make additional payments in any form to underwrite 
that legal responsibility. The earliest published decision containing a 
detailed discussion of the rule and its rationale is 24 Comp. Gen. 599 
(1945). 

The rule proceeds from the premise that firefighting is a governmental 
rather than a proprietary or business function. Where a local firefighting 
organization (city or county fire department, fire protection district, etc.) is 
required by local law to cover a particular territorial area and to respond to 
fires without direct charge to the property owners, this duty extends to 
federal as well as nonfederal property within that territorial area. A charge 
to appropriated funds under these circumstances would amount to a tax or 
a payment in lieu of taxes and would, absent specific statutory authority, 
violate the government’s constitutional immunity from taxation. B-243004, 
Sept. 5, 1991. It follows that the government may not contract for 
firefighting services that it would be legally entitled to receive in any 
event,94 nor may it reimburse a political subdivision for the additional costs 
incurred in fighting a federal fire.95 See 53 Comp. Gen. 410 (1973) and cases 
cited therein. In addition to the taxation problem, use of appropriated 
funds for this purpose would violate the purpose statute at 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1301(a). 32 Comp. Gen. 91 (1952). 

Limited reimbursement authority now exists by virtue of the Federal Fire 
Prevention and Control Act of 1974, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 2210, discussed 
later in this section. The present discussion concerns the availability of 
appropriations apart from that limited authority. 

94 In addition to the cases cited in the text, see B-131932, Mar. 13, 1958; B-125617, Apr. 11, 
1956; B-126228, Jan. 6, 1956; B-105602, Dec. 17, 1951; B-40387-O.M., June 24, 1966. 

95 In addition to the cases cited in the text, see B-167709, Sept. 9, 1969; B-153911, Dec. 6, 
1968; B-147731, Jan. 22, 1962.

In applying the rule, it is irrelevant that a city cannot regulate building and 
fire codes for structures on a military establishment within the city limits. 
24 Comp. Gen. 599 (1945). Also, the rule applies equally when the fire 
protection is provided by a volunteer fire department performing the 
mandatory governmental function for a political subdivision. The fact that 
the firefighters are unpaid does not affect the local government unit’s legal 
duty to render the service. 26 Comp. Gen. 382 (1946); B-47142, Apr. 3, 1970. 

In 53 Comp. Gen. 410 (1973), GAO denied a claim by the St. Louis 
Community Fire Protection District (CFPD) and several surrounding fire 
districts and departments for equipment losses and supplemental payroll 
expenses incurred in fighting a massive fire at the St. Louis Federal 
Records Center. The St. Louis CFPD could not be reimbursed because the 
Records Center was within its territorial responsibility. The surrounding 
fire districts were also under a duty to respond to the alarm because they 
had entered into mutual aid agreements with the St. Louis CFPD that had 
the effect of extending their own areas of responsibility. 

In some rural areas, firefighting services may be unavailable or very 
limited. In such areas, the government may have to provide its own fire 
protection. The Comptroller General had stated, in 32 Comp. Gen. 91 
(1952), that an agency could not enter into “mutual aid agreements” to 
extend that service to the general community beyond the boundaries of 
government property, even where the local inhabitants were predominantly 
government employees and where the additional protection could be 
accomplished without additional expense. Later, Congress enacted 
legislation specifically authorizing reciprocal agreements for mutual aid. 
42 U.S.C. §§ 1856–1856d. This statutory authority is limited to mutual aid 
agreements and does not authorize an agency to enter into an agreement to 
reimburse a political subdivision for services unilaterally provided to the 
government. 35 Comp. Gen. 311, 313 (1955); B-243004, Sept. 5, 1991; 
B-126228, Jan. 6, 1956; B-40387-O.M., June 24, 1966. An agency participating 
in a mutual aid agreement under this authority may contribute, on a basis 
comparable to other participants, to a common fund to be used for training 
and equipment incident to responding to fires and related emergencies 
such as hazardous waste accidents. B-222821, Apr. 6, 1987. 

If the government may not contract for or reimburse fire protection 
services which a local entity is legally required to provide, it follows that 
the government may not pay a “service charge” for fire protection provided 
by a municipality with respect to federal property within the city limits, at 
least where the assessment for fire protection is normally included in the 

Page 4-147 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

city’s property tax. In 49 Comp. Gen. 284 (1969), the city of New London, 
Connecticut, sought to charge the government on a direct cost-related 
basis for fire protection afforded the United States Coast Guard Academy. 
Fire protection was included in the city’s real estate tax and the service 
charge was to apply only to tax-exempt property. In view of the city’s duty 
to provide fire protection to the Academy, the Comptroller General found 
the proposed charge to be an unconstitutional tax on the government. See 
also B-160936, Mar. 13, 1967. However, a flat-fee service charge levied by a 
utility district for extinguishing a fire in a postal vehicle was held 
permissible where the utility district was under no legal obligation to 
provide the service. B-123294, May 2, 1955. 

In B-168024, Dec. 13, 1973, a city was required to provide fire protection to 
all property within its boundaries, but was given the option under state law 
of financing the fire protection by service charges rather than from general 
tax revenues. In these circumstances, it was held that the United States 
could pay a valid service charge, although the charge in that particular case 
was held to be a tax and therefore invalid because it was based on the value 
of the property rather than the quantum of services provided. The decision 
contains a useful discussion of the distinction between a service charge 
and a tax.96 

Similarly, in B-243004, Sept. 5, 1991, a service charge was imposed on the 
Bureau of Reclamation for fire protection on federal property where the 
city was not required to provide such services. If the charge for firefighting 
services bears a reasonable relationship to the quantum of services 
provided and is charged proportionately against all who use the services, it 
need not be considered a tax but a fee for services that the United States 
may pay. In this case, however, the method used to compute the charge was 
found not to bear any particular relationship to the services rendered, and 
hence, was not payable. 

Because the rule is predicated on the existence of state laws requiring 
political subdivisions to provide firefighting services, it would not apply in 
instances where there is no entitlement to service. Thus, reimbursement 
was allowed in 3 Comp. Gen. 979 (1924) where a fire unit had no legal duty 
to respond to an emergency call outside its district. It was further noted 
that there was no violation of the prohibition on accepting voluntary 

96 For more on the distinction between a tax and a service charge, see “Other Municipal 
Services” later in this section, and section C.15 of this chapter.

services now found in 31 U.S.C. § 1342 (part of the Antideficiency Act). 
Similarly, a contractual agreement for fire protection with the nearest fire 
district may be proper where the federal property in question is not served 
by any fire district. 35 Comp. Gen. 311 (1955). Under the same theory, the 
Comptroller General held that the Bureau of Indian Affairs could make a 
financial contribution to the “Community Fire Truck,” a volunteer 
firefighting organization which otherwise would have been under no 
obligation to respond to fires at an Indian school outside the limits of the 
city served by the organization. 34 Comp. Gen. 195 (1954). See also 
B-163089, Feb. 8, 1968; B-123294, May 2, 1955. However, there is no 
authority to pay for fire services rendered without a preexisting legal 
obligation if such services were necessary to protect adjoining state or 
privately owned property as to which such a legal duty existed. 30 Comp. 
Gen. 376 (1951). 

A variation occurred in B-116333-O.M., Oct. 15, 1953, in which it was held 
permissible to reimburse a private firefighting enterprise for repair and 
maintenance service to hydrants and fire alarm boxes on a government- 
owned and -operated housing facility, irrespective of the duty of the 
municipality. 

In the analysis of legal duty to provide protection, it is irrelevant that the 
government may have engaged in an activity causing the fire. 32 Comp. 
Gen. 401 (1953); B-167709, Sept. 9, 1969; B-147731, Dec. 28, 1961; B-6400, 
Aug. 28, 1940.97 Similarly, there is no estoppel created by the fact that the 
United States operated its own fire protection at a given installation for a 
period of time. If the legal duty to provide protection exists, the United 
States is entitled to claim protection at any time its own service becomes 
obsolete, undesirable, or uneconomical. B-129013, Sept. 20, 1956; B-126228, 
Jan. 6, 1956. 

An exception to the general rule may exist in the case of a “federal enclave.” 
This term usually describes large tracts of land held under exclusive federal 
jurisdiction. In 45 Comp. Gen. 1 (1965), the Comptroller General held that, 
despite locally available protection, a federal enclave could provide its own 

97A claim for expenses (as opposed to damages) incurred by a state in suppressing a fire 
starting on federal property and allegedly caused by the negligence of a federal employee is 
not a claim for injury or loss of property under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. 
§§ 2671 et seq., and is therefore not cognizable under that Act. Oregon v. United States, 
308 F.2d 568 (9th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 941 (1963); California v. United States, 
307 F.2d 941 (9th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 941 (1963); B-163089, Oct. 19, 1970.

b. Federal Fire Prevention and 
Control Act of 1974 
fire protection on a contract basis. Further, adjacent land under federal 
control but not part of the federal enclave could be protected under the 
same contractual arrangement. However, an additional factor in 45 Comp. 
Gen. 1 was that legitimate doubt existed as to whether the fire district was 
under a legal obligation under state law to provide services to the federal 
property involved, and the district had petitioned the state government to 
redraw its boundaries to exclude the federal property. The effect of this 
factor is unclear, and since that time, no case has been decided in which a 
federal enclave was involved. Note that the threatened exclusion of the 
federal property was based on a legitimate doubt as to whether protection 
was required by state law. If protection is required, exclusion would be 
improper. See B-129013, Sept. 20, 1956. Cf. B-192641, May 2, 1979 
(nondecision letter) (questioning a redistricting to exclude federal property 
that was not a federal enclave). 

A 1981 decision addressed the authority of the Bureau of Land Management 
to contract with rural fire districts in Oregon and Washington for fire 
protection and firefighting services for federally owned timberlands in 
those states. The Comptroller General reviewed the principles and 
precedents established over the years and concluded that, since the fire 
districts were legally required to protect the federal tracts, the Bureau 
could not enter into the desired contracts without specific statutory 
authority. However, Bureau installations with a federally maintained 
firefighting capacity could enter into mutual aid agreements under 
42 U.S.C. § 1856, discussed above. 60 Comp. Gen. 637 (1981). 

In light of the huge losses suffered by local fire districts in the 1973 
St. Louis Records Center fire, the need for some legislative action became 
apparent. The result was section 11 of the Federal Fire Prevention and 
Control Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-498, 88 Stat. 1535, 1543 (Oct. 29, 1974), 
codified at 15 U.S.C. § 2210. This provision allows a fire service fighting a 
fire on federal property to file a claim for the direct expenses and direct 
losses incurred. The claim is filed with the United States Fire 
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).98 The 
amount allowable is the amount by which the additional firefighting costs, 
over and above the claimant’s normal operating costs, exceed the total of 
any payments made by the United States to the claimant or its parent 

98 FEMA was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security by Pub. L. No. 107-296, 
§ 503, 166 Stat. 2135, 2213 (Nov. 25, 2002).

jurisdiction for the support of fire services on the property in question, 
including taxes and payments in lieu of taxes. 

FEMA, upon determining the amount allowable, must forward it to the 
Treasury Department for payment. The Comptroller General has 
determined that section 11 constitutes a permanent indefinite 
appropriation for the payment of these claims. B-160998, Apr. 13, 1978. 
Disputes under section 11 may be adjudicated in the United States Claims 
Court. FEMA has issued implementing regulations at 44 C.F.R. pt. 151.99 

Notwithstanding this authority, the decisions discussed previously in this 
section remain significant for several reasons. First, they define the extent 
to which an agency may use its own appropriations apart from section 11. 
Second, they define the extent to which an agency may contract for fire 
protection services. Finally, section 11 provides that payment shall be 
subject to reimbursement by the federal agency under whose jurisdiction 
the fire occurred, “from any appropriations which may be available or 
which may be made available for the purpose.” Although no decision has 
been rendered on this point, it would seem that the existing body of 
decisions provides a starting point in determining the extent to which an 
agency’s operating appropriations “may be available” to make this 
reimbursement. 

c. Other Municipal Services The principles involved in the firefighting cases are relevant to other 
municipal services as well. 
The closest analogy is police protection. Like fire protection, police 
protection is a mandatory governmental function. Thus a municipality may 
not levy direct charges against the United States for ordinary police 
protective services provided within its area of jurisdiction. 49 Comp. 
Gen. 284, 286–87 (1969); B-187733, Oct. 27, 1977. However, the United 
States may pay on a quantum meruit basis for police services over and 
above the ordinary level, where the city is not required to provide such 
extraordinary services and where the same charge would be imposed on 
nonfederal users in like circumstances. Examples are: extra police for 
special events such as football games at the Coast Guard Academy 

99 Section 2465 of Title 10 of the United States Code prohibits DOD contracts for firefighting 
or security guard functions, although this provision has been suspended during Operation 
Enduring Freedom by Pub. L. No. 107-56, title X, § 1010, 115 Stat. 272, 395 (Oct. 26, 2001).

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

(49 Comp. Gen. at 287) and special police details at Bicentennial 
ceremonies (B-187733, Oct. 27, 1977). 

The same principles have been applied to emergency ambulance services 
required to be furnished by a municipality. 49 Comp. Gen. at 286. However, 
contracts with state or local governments or private entities for ambulance 
services have been held permissible where there was no requirement for 
the political subdivision involved to provide ambulance services without 
direct charge. 51 Comp. Gen. 444 (1972), modifying B-172945, June 22, 
1971; B-198032, June 3, 1981. Another example is the maintenance of public 
highways. See B-199205, Apr. 27, 1981. 

A charge for services rendered by a state or local government to the United 
States is to be distinguished from a tax; the former may be paid while the 
latter may not. E.g., 20 Comp. Gen. 748 (1941). While this distinction does 
not apply to mandatory governmental functions such as police and fire 
protection, it has frequently been cited in connection with such things as 
water and sewer services. As a general proposition, a charge for water 
and/or sewer services is a permissible service charge rather than a tax if it 
is based on the quantum of direct services actually furnished. A federal 
agency may generally pay service charges such as those for municipal 
sewer service, so long as the charges represent the fair and reasonable 
value received by the United States for the services. GAO has also held that, 
in the context of utility services, where rates are established by a legislative 
body, such rates are controlling unless they are manifestly unjust, 
unreasonable, or discriminatory. 73 Comp. Gen. 1 (1993). (In that 1993 
case, GAO questioned discounts built into the city’s fee structure that were 
not afforded to the federal agency, and held that the sewer charge may be 
paid only to the extent that the city makes and documents a 
nondiscriminatory assessment for the reasonable value of sewer services 
rendered.) See 31 Comp. Gen. 405 (1952) (assessment for water/sewer 
services levied on citywide basis rather than quantum of service rendered 
held a tax); 29 Comp. Gen. 120 (1949) (sewer service charge held payable 
on quantum meruit basis); 20 Comp. Gen. 206 (1940) (water charge held 
to be a tax where it was levied as a flat charge rather than on the basis of 
actual water consumption). See also 49 Comp. Gen. 284 (1969); B-243004, 
Sept. 5, 1991; B-168024, Dec. 13, 1973; B-105117, Mar. 16, 1953. 

Also, in 70 Comp. Gen. 687 (1991), GAO held that the Forest Service may 
pay county landfill user fees as a reasonable service charge, analogous to 
other utility services provided the government, since the charge was based 
on levels of service provided and appeared nondiscriminatory. 

Page 4-152 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

A reasonable charge based on the quantum of direct services actually 
furnished need not be considered a tax even though the services in 
question are provided to the taxpayers of the political subdivision without a 
direct charge, provided of course that the political subdivision is not 
required by law to furnish the service without direct charge. Such a charge 
may be paid if it is applied equally to all tax-exempt property, but not if it 
applies only to federal tax-exempt property. 50 Comp. Gen. 343 (1970). 

A sewer service charge which is otherwise proper may be paid in advance if 
required by local law, notwithstanding 31 U.S.C. § 3324. 73 Comp. Gen. 1 
(1993). The government’s liability would also include late payment 
penalties to the extent required by local law. 39 Comp. Gen. 285 (1959). 

GAO has applied the same principles to charges for 9-1-1 emergency 
services. In a series of cases, GAO examined 9-1-1 charges in several states 
and found that they amounted to a tax and therefore could not be assessed 
against the United States or its agencies. 66 Comp. Gen. 385 (1987) 
(Florida); 65 Comp. Gen. 879 (1986) (Maryland); 64 Comp. Gen. 655 (1985) 
(Texas); B-300737, June 27, 2003 (Alabama); B-230691, May 12, 1988 
(Tennessee); B-239608, Dec. 14, 1990 (nondecision letter) (Rhode Island). 
One decision stated: 

“In our view, telephone access to police, fire and other 
municipal services, is intrinsically connected to the services 
themselves. The fact that 9-1-1 service is more 
technologically sophisticated than normal telephone access 
does not change its essential character.” 

66 Comp. Gen. at 386. In each case, the charges were included in telephone 
bills, with the telephone company acting as collection agent for the 
relevant governmental authority. As noted in 66 Comp. Gen. 385, 387, a 
9-1-1 fee might be properly payable if a telephone company installed and 
operated the system itself and, as with directory assistance for example, 
offered the service as a component of its regular communications services. 
However, in none of the situations examined was this the case. 

Several characteristics of the systems support the conclusion of 
nonliability: the service is provided by a local government or quasi-
governmental unit; public funding of the service requires legal authority 
such as an ordinance or referendum; and the charge is not related to actual 
levels of service but is based on a flat rate per telephone line. 65 Comp. 
Gen. at 881. It is irrelevant that the 9-1-1 charge is called a “service charge” 

Page 4-153 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

(B-230691) or a “service fee” (64 Comp. Gen. 655), or that state law 
provides that the charge shall not be construed as a tax (B-230691), or that 
the local government has threatened to cut off access (66 Comp. Gen. 385). 
The same analysis produced the same result in B-227388, Sept. 3, 1987, in 
which a municipality tried to charge a federal agency a registration fee for 
9-1-1 services. 

The distinction between “vendor taxes” and “vendee taxes” discussed later 
in this chapter, that is, the applicability or nonapplicability to the 
government depending on the “legal incidence” of the tax, applies as well to 
9-1-1 charges. When the legal incidence of a tax falls directly on the federal 
government as the “vendee,” the tax is not payable unless expressly 
authorized by Congress. 64 Comp. Gen. 655, 656–57 (1985). On the other 
hand, if the legal incidence of the tax falls directly on a business enterprise 
(the “vendor”), which is supplying the federal government as a customer 
with goods or services, immunity does not apply. 61 Comp. Gen. 257 (1982). 
Thus, in B-238410, Sept. 7, 1990, GAO considered the Arizona 9-1-1 statute, 
found that it was a vendor tax and, distinguishing the prior 9-1-1 decisions, 
concluded that it could be assessed against the federal government. 

A final group of cases involves the installation of traffic signals. At one 
point, GAO took the position, subsequently modified, that appropriated 
funds could not be used to pay for or contribute to the installation of traffic 
signals on public roads or highways, regardless of the resulting benefit to 
the government. Traffic control, so the reasoning went, is a municipal 
service financed by tax revenues the same as police or firefighting services, 
for which payment by a federal agency is not permissible. 51 Comp. 
Gen. 135 (1971); 36 Comp. Gen. 286 (1956). 

A different situation was presented in 55 Comp. Gen. 1437 (1976). There, a 
state highway bisected an Army installation and the Army wanted to install 
a traffic light to regulate traffic at the intersection of the state highway and 
a road on the Army facility. Local authorities had agreed to repair and 
maintain the light if the Army would purchase and install it. Since the light 
would be located on federal property and would be for the primary benefit 
of the federal facility, even though it would regulate traffic on the state 
highway as well, GAO distinguished the prior cases and concluded that the 
Army could use its appropriations for the proposed expenditure. 

In 1982, GAO modified the prior decisions and held that traffic signals at or 
near a federal facility, where the federal facility is the primary beneficiary

and benefit to the general public is incidental, should be governed by the 
same tests applicable to other municipal services. If the state or local 
government is legally required to provide the service to all residents free of 
charge, the federal agency may not pay. If, however, the service is not 
legally required and the charge does not discriminate against the United 
States—that is, any other resident would be subject to a similar charge— 
then the appropriations of the benefiting agency may be used. 61 Comp. 
Gen. 501 (1982). 

Does the primary benefit shift where the federal agency is leasing the 
property from a private owner? GAO said no in 65 Comp. Gen. 847 (1986), 
but the lease in that case was to continue for at least another 6 years. 
Compare 71 Comp. Gen. 4 (1991). The answer would presumably be 
different if the agency was about to vacate, but the decision does not 
purport to address precisely where the line should be drawn. 

8. Gifts and Awards 
a. Gifts An agency frequently wants to use gifts to attract attention to the agency or 
to specific programs. For example, gifts can be used as recruiting tools, to 
commemorate an event, or to inform the public or agency employees about 
the agency. Appropriated funds may not be used for personal gifts, unless, 
of course, there is specific statutory authority. 68 Comp. Gen. 226 (1989). 
To state the rule in this manner is to make it appear rather obvious. If, for 
example, a General Counsel decided it would be a nice gesture and 
improve employee morale to give each lawyer in the agency a Thanksgiving 
turkey, few would argue that the expense should be borne by the agency’s 
appropriations. Appropriated funds could not be used because the 
appropriation was not made for this purpose (assuming, of course, that the 
agency has not received an appropriation for Thanksgiving turkeys) and 
because giving turkeys to lawyers is not reasonably necessary to carry out 
the mission at least of any agency that now exists. Most cases, however, are 
not quite this obvious or simple. 
The cases generally involve the application of the necessary expense 
doctrine, and, as with any necessary expense analysis, the result turns on 
whether the item will directly further the agency’s mission. Occasionally, an 
item that would typically be viewed as a personal gift may, in other 
circumstances, help advance an agency’s mission. In making the analysis, it 
makes no difference whether the “gift items” are given to federal employees 

Page 4-155 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

or to others. The connection is either there or, far more commonly, it is not. 
In each of the cases in which funds have been found unavailable, there was 
a certain logic to the agency’s justification, and the amount of the 
expenditure in many cases was small. The problem is that, in most cases, 
were the justification put forward by the agency deemed sufficient, there 
would be no stopping point. If a free ashtray might generate positive 
feelings about an agency or program or enhance motivation, so would a 
new car or an infusion of cash into the bank account. The rule prohibiting 
the use of appropriated funds for personal gifts reflects the clear potential 
for abuse. Because a necessary expense analysis is, of course, case 
specific, it is impossible to draw a rational line identifying those gift items 
that are acceptable and those that are not. That certainly is evident from 
the discussion that follows. It is important that anyone confronting a “gift” 
issue scrutinize the case law carefully to appreciate distinctions that may 
not be apparent at first read. 

In 53 Comp. Gen. 770 (1974), a certifying officer for the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) asked GAO to rule on the propriety of an expenditure 
for decorative ashtrays that were distributed to federal employee 
participants of a conference sponsored by that agency. By passing out 
ashtrays, the agency intended that they would generate conversation 
concerning the conference and thereby further SBA’s objectives by serving 
as a reminder of the purposes of the conference. The decision held that the 
justification given by the agency was not sufficient because the recipients 
of the ashtrays were federal officials who were already charged by law to 
cooperate with the objectives of SBA. Thus, there was no necessity that 
ashtrays be given away. The ashtrays were properly designated as personal 
gifts. 

Contrast the SBA decision, however, with a 1993 Veterans Affairs decision. 
In B-247563.2, May 12, 1993, GAO approved the distribution by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) of imprinted book matches and 
imprinted jar grip openers at the Oklahoma State Fair for recruiting 
purposes and to provide veterans with a number to call to obtain 
information. VA’s appropriation explicitly authorized it to create exhibits 
and other material to accomplish its mission. This case stated the general 
rule regarding the use of appropriated funds to purchase gifts: 

“Under the ‘necessary expense rule,’ an agency may not 
purchase items in the nature of gifts or souvenirs unless 
there is a direct link between the items and the purpose of 
the appropriation charged. Stated differently, in order to 

Page 4-156 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

justify purchasing novelty items or personal gifts with 
appropriated funds, an agency must demonstrate that the 
items will directly further its mission.” 

Applying this rule to the VA’s matches and jar openers, GAO concluded that 
it was “entirely appropriate for the [VA] to attempt to attract the attention 
of those attending the event,” and that the means chosen were “appropriate 
for the objective to be accomplished.” 

In this section, we provide a short discussion of decisions in which we 
concluded that the item at issue was a gift. We follow that with a discussion 
of decisions in which we found that items ordinarily considered to be gifts 
were connected to carrying out the agency’s mission. The discussion, of 
course, does not identify all of our gift decisions and, while we provide our 
holdings, the discussion does not substitute for a full analysis of these 
decisions. We encourage the reader to use the discussion as a tool for 
honing his or her research. 

In 54 Comp. Gen. 976 (1975), specially made key chains, which were 
distributed to educators who attended seminars sponsored by the Forest 
Service, were determined to be personal gifts despite the Department of 
Agricultures claim that their distribution would generate future responses 
from participants. That decision stated: 

“The appropriation …proposed to be charged with payment 
for the items in question is available for ‘…expenses 
necessary for forest protection and utilization….’ Since the 
appropriation is not specifically available for giving key 
chains to individuals, in order to qualify as a legitimate 
expenditure it must be demonstrated that the acquisition 
and distribution of such items constituted a necessary 
expense of the Forest Service.” 

The decision concluded that the key chains were not necessary to 
implement the appropriation and were, therefore, improper expenditures. 

This line of reasoning was also used in 57 Comp. Gen. 385 (1978). There it 
was held that novelty plastic garbage cans containing candy in the shape of 
solid waste, which were distributed by the Environmental Protection 
Agency to attendees at an exposition, were personal gifts. The agency’s 
argument that the candy was used to attract people to its exhibit on the 

Page 4-157 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and therefore to promote solid 
waste management was not sufficient to justify the expenditure. 

In B-195247, Aug. 29, 1979, the Comptroller General held that an 
expenditure of appropriated funds for the cost of jackets and sweaters as 
holiday gifts to corpsmen at a Job Corps Center with the intent of 
increasing morale and enhancing program support was unauthorized. It 
was determined that these were not a necessary and proper use of 
appropriated funds and therefore were personal gifts. 

The following cases are additional illustrations of expenditures that were 
found to be in the nature of personal gifts and therefore improper: 

• T-shirts stamped with Combined Federal Campaign logo to be given to 
employees contributing a certain amount. 70 Comp. Gen. 248 (1991). 

• Winter caps purchased by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
Administration to be given to volunteer participants in weather 
observation program to create “esprit de corps” and enhance 
motivation. B-201488, Feb. 25, 1981. 

• Photographs taken at the dedication of the Klondike Gold Rush Visitor 
Center to be sent by the National Park Service as “mementos” to 
persons attending the ceremony. B-195896, Oct. 22, 1979. 

• “Sun Day” buttons procured by the General Services Administration 
(GSA) and given out to members of the public to show GSA’s support of 
certain energy policies. B-192423, Aug. 21, 1978. 

• Agricultural products developed in Department of Agriculture research 
programs (gift boxes of convenience foods, leather products, 
paperweights of flowers imbedded in plastic) to be given to foreign 
visitors and other official dignitaries. B-151668, June 30, 1970. 

• Cuff links and bracelets to be given to foreign visitors by the Commerce 
Department to promote tourism to the United States. B-151668, Dec. 5, 
1963; B-151668, June 28, 1963 (same case). 

• Baseball caps purchased by the Department of Energy to be given to 
nonemployees for personnel recruitment purposes. B-260260, Dec. 28, 
1995. 

Page 4-158 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

• Pens, scissors, and shoe laces purchased by the then Veterans 
Administration (VA) to be given to potential employees for recruiting 
purposes, which were nothing more than “favorable reminders of VA” 
and did not facilitate VA’s acquisition of information necessary to its 
recruiting efforts. B-247563.3, Apr. 5, 1996. 

• Gift certificates to local restaurants and silk plants distributed by the 
then Veterans Administration in celebration of women’s Equality Week, 
where there was no evidence of how these items advanced the agency’s 
celebration. Id. 

In these cases, while we gave considerable weight to the agency’s 
administrative determination of necessity, it was not controlling. See, e.g., 

B-151668, Dec. 5, 1963. 

What follows is a discussion of some expenditures that resemble personal 
gifts, but which we approved because they were found necessary to carry 
out the purposes of the agency’s appropriation. For example, in B-193769, 
Jan. 24, 1979, it was held that the purchase and distribution of pieces of 
lava rocks to visitors of the Capulin Mountain National Monument was a 
necessary and proper use of the Interior Department’s appropriated funds. 
The appropriation in question was for “expenses necessary for the 
management, operation, and maintenance of areas and facilities 
administered by the National Park Service ….” The distribution of the 
rocks furthered the objectives of the appropriation because it was effective 
in preserving the Monument by discouraging visitors from removing lava 
rock elsewhere in the Monument. Thus, the rocks were not considered to 
be personal gifts. 

Similarly, GAO concluded in B-230062, Dec. 22, 1988, that the Army could 
use its appropriations to give away framed recruiting posters as “prizes” in 
drawings at national conventions of student organizations. The students 
had to fill out cards to enter the drawings, and the cards would provide 
leads for potential recruits. Also, the Army is authorized to advertise its 
recruitment program, and posters are a legitimate form of advertising. 

Another case in which GAO found adequate justification is 68 Comp. 
Gen. 583 (1989), concluding that the U.S. Mint may give complimentary 
specimens of commemorative coins and medals to customers whose orders 
have been mishandled. Since customers who do not receive what they paid 
for may be disinclined to place further orders, the goodwill gesture of 

Page 4-159 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

giving complimentary copies to these customers would directly contribute 
to the success of the Mint’s commemorative sales program. 

In another case involving buttons, 72 Comp. Gen. 73 (1992), GAO 
responded to a request from the Comptroller of the Environmental 
Protection Agency for an opinion on the availability of appropriated funds 
to acquire buttons and magnets inscribed with messages related to indoor 
air quality, concluding that appropriated funds were available for such 
items. GAO discussed and distinguished cases such as 53 Comp. Gen. 770 
(SBA decorative ashtrays) and 54 Comp. Gen. 976 (key chains for 
participants at Forest Service seminars), above, noting that the buttons and 
magnets, “unlike a container of candy, a key chain, or an ice scraper,” had 
“no real use other than to convey a message.” 72 Comp. Gen. at 74. Also key 
was the “direct link between the items and an authorized agency function,” 
which involved conveying a message to increase public awareness of 
indoor air quality. Id. 

In yet another “button” case, B-257488, Nov. 6, 1995, GAO concluded that 
the Food and Drug Administration could use appropriated funds to 
purchase “No Red Tape” buttons for employees to wear at work. GAO 
noted that the buttons had “no intrinsic value” to the recipients and served 
solely to assist the achievement of agency objectives. The agency had 
demonstrated “the requisite nexus between its appropriation’s purpose and 
the ‘No Red Tape’ buttons. The message [was] clearly informational and 
directed at the promotion of an internal agency management objective.” 

In B-280440, Feb. 26, 1999, GAO approved a plan by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to purchase medals to be worn by uniformed 
employees of the Border Patrol to commemorate the Border Patrol’s 75th 
anniversary. Citing the FDA “No Red Tape” button case, B-257488, above, 
GAO noted first that the medals would not be gifts, but rather part of a 
Border Patrol agent’s uniform. Additionally, GAO observed that, “The 
medals convey as well as serve an institutional purpose—i.e., reminding 
the public and agency staff of the Border Patrol’s …history and mission and 
promoting the stability and longevity of the agency.” 

In a case involving GAO’s own appropriations, GAO cited several of the 
above cases in support of GAO’s distribution of GAO-logo coffee mugs to 
new employees and highlighter pens and post-it notes to potential recruits. 
B-287241, Aug. 21, 2001 (nondecision letter). The mugs, pens, and note 
pads had all been imprinted with a new GAO logo, “Accountability, 
Integrity and Reliability,” and had already been supplied to current GAO 

Page 4-160 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

staff as part of a larger campaign to instill GAO’s priorities. Some items 
were provided to new employees as part of an orientation package to 
educate them in GAO’s priorities. The pens and pads, along with other 
materials about GAO, were provided to potential recruits to inform them of 
GAO’s priorities. Id. 

b. Contests (1) Entry fees 
The Comptroller General has held that payment of an entry fee to enter 
agency publications in a contest sponsored by a private organization is 
improper and cannot be justified as a necessary expense, at least where the 
prize is a monetary award to be given to the editors of the winning 
publications. B-164467, June 14, 1968. 

However, payment of a contest entry fee may be permissible where the 
prize is awarded to the agency and not to the individuals and where there is 
sufficient justification that the expense will further the objects of the 
appropriation. B-172556, Dec. 29, 1971. The Comptroller General pointed 
out in that decision that whether appropriated funds may be used to enter a 
contest will depend on the nature of the contest, the nature of the prizes 
and to whom they are awarded, and the sufficiency of the administrative 
justification. 

Thus, the Bureau of Mines could use its appropriations to enter an 
educational film it produced in an industrial film festival where entry was 
made in the Bureau’s name, awards would be made to the Bureau and not 
to any individuals, and there was adequate justification that entry would 
further the Bureau’s function of promoting mine safety. B-164467, Aug. 9, 
1971. 

In recent years, the issue of the use of appropriated funds to pay contest 
entry fees has come up in the context of athletic contests. See section C.5.e 
of this chapter, “Recreational and Welfare Facilities for Government 
Personnel.” In each case, funds were found not to be available for the entry 
fee in question. See, e.g., 73 Comp. Gen. 169 (1994) (Department of Energy 
employees participating in competitive fitness promotion, team activities, 
and sporting events); B-247563.3, Apr. 5, 1996 (Department of Veterans 
Affairs payment of “sponsor fee” at a local “Corporate Challenge” in which 
employees participated); B-262008, Oct. 23, 1996 (Army Corps of Engineers 
employees participating in a “Corporate Cup Run” sponsored by the 
American Lung Association).

(2) Government-sponsored contests 
In an early case, the Navy wanted to use its appropriation for naval aviation 
to sponsor a competition for the design of amphibious landing gear for 
Navy aircraft. Cash prizes would be awarded for the two most successful 
designs. The Comptroller General ruled, however, that the proposed 
expenditure was unauthorized because the prizes were not related to the 
reasonable value of the services of the successful contestants and because 
the appropriation contemplated that the design and development work 
would be performed by Navy personnel. 5 Comp. Gen. 640 (1926). See also 
B-247563.3, Apr. 5, 1996 (Department of Veterans Affairs purchase of 
restaurant gift certificates and a silk plant “for distribution as prizes during 
women’s Equality Week” not permissible). 

While 5 Comp. Gen. 640 may be said to express a general rule, later 
decisions have permitted agencies to, in effect, sponsor contests and 
competitions where artistic design was involved. Thus, in A-13559, Apr. 5, 
1926, the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission wanted to invite several 
firms to submit designs for a portion of the Arlington Memorial Bridge. 
Each design accepted by the Commission would be purchased for $2,000, 
estimated to approximate the reasonable cost of preparing a design. Since 
the $2,000 was reasonably related to the cost of producing a design, GAO 
viewed the proposal as amounting to a direct purchase of the satisfactory 
designs and distinguished 5 Comp. Gen. 640 on that basis. A significant 
factor was that the bridge was intended not merely as a functional device to 
cross the river but “as a memorial in which artistic features are a major, if 
not the primary, consideration.” 

This decision was followed in 9 Comp. Gen. 63 (1929), holding that the 
Marine Corps could offer a set sum of $1,000 for an acceptable original 
design for a service medal. The Comptroller General stated: 

“Competition in the purchase of supplies or articles for 
Government use in its most common form is for the purpose 
of securing specified supplies or articles at the lowest 
possible price. Where, however, the purpose is the selection 
of the most suitable and artistic design …, the primary value 
of the subject being in its design, the ordinary procedure 
may be reversed and the amount to be expended fixed in 
advance at a sum considered to be the reasonable value of 
the services solicited and the bidders requested to submit 
the best design which they can furnish for that sum.” 

Page 4-162 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Id. at 65. 

The concept of A-13559 was followed and applied in several later decisions. 
See 19 Comp. Gen. 287, 288 (1939) (design of advertising literature for 
savings bonds); 18 Comp. Gen. 862 (1939) (plaster models for Thomas 
Jefferson Memorial); 14 Comp. Gen. 852 (1935) (bronze tablets and 
memorials for Boulder Dam); A-37686, Aug. 1, 1931 (monument at 
Harrodsburg, Kentucky, as first permanent settlement west of the 
Allegheny Mountains); A-35929, Apr. 3, 1931 (ornamental sculptured 
granite columns for the Arlington Memorial Bridge). 

Thus, a prize competition per se is generally unauthorized in accordance 
with 5 Comp. Gen. 640. However, the procedure in A-13559 and its progeny 
is permissible where artistic features are the major consideration, and the 
amount awarded is related to the reasonable cost of producing the design. 

Apart from the artistic design line of cases, an agency may be authorized to 
sponsor a contest under the necessary expense theory, if the expenditure 
bears a reasonable relationship to carrying out some authorized activity. 
For example, in B-158831, June 8, 1966, prizes were awarded to enrollees at 
a Job Corps Conservation Center in a contest to suggest a name for the 
Center newspaper. GAO held the expenditure permissible because the 
enabling legislation authorized the providing of “recreational services” for 
the enrollees, and the contest was viewed as a permissible exercise of 
administrative discretion in implementing the statutory objective. 

In another case, the National Park Service sponsored a cross-country ski 
race in a national park and awarded trophies to the winners. The cost of the 
trophies could not be charged to appropriations for management, 
operation, and maintenance of the national park system. However, the Park 
Service also received appropriations for recreational programs in national 
parks, and the trophies could properly have been charged to that account. 
B-214833, Aug. 22, 1984. See also B-230062, Dec. 22, 1988. 

GAO concluded in 70 Comp. Gen. 720 (1991) that the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) could pay cash prizes to certain 
fortunate fisherman returning “fish tags” to the government. The National 
Marine Fisheries Service issued such “fish tags,” displaying questions about 
the circumstances under which the fish in question was caught, a return 
address, and the word “reward.” When returned by fishermen, the fish tags 
provided information on the history and migration rates of the tagged fish. 
The fishermen were paid a reward of $5.00 for the return of each fish tag. 

Page 4-163 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

GAO concluded that the agency was “statutorily required to conduct 
research supporting fishery management” and therefore was required to 
“obtain information from the public.” Since the fish tag awards facilitated 
acquisition of the needed information, the cost of the awards was 
reasonably necessary to the agency’s accomplishment of an authorized 
purpose. Id. at 722. In this decision, GAO also considered an NOAA 
proposal to expand its reward program to include the alternative of 
participating in an annual drawing for a limited number of large cash 
prizes. This alternative was also approved. Id. at 723. 

In B-286536, Nov. 17, 2000, GAO considered a proposal by the General 
Services Administration’s Public Buildings Service (PBS) to use 
appropriated funds to pay for prizes in a drawing held in connection with 
customer satisfaction surveys. In order to develop customer satisfaction 
information, PBS distributed such customer surveys to employees of 
tenant-agencies in buildings it managed. PBS proposed the use of the 
Federal Buildings Fund to provide prizes to survey recipients whose names 
PBS chose in a drawing. Citing 70 Comp. Gen. 720 and B-230062, above, 
GAO observed that it had concluded in several instances that “agencies 
may use appropriated funds to provide prizes to individuals to further the 
collection of information necessary to the accomplishment of the agency’s 
statutory mandate.” This case differed in that PBS proposed to make 
awards to federal employees, rather than to the general public as in the 
cited cases. This was not determinative, however, since the federal 
employees would not be receiving prizes for what they already were 
required to do, and therefore they were “akin to the general public.” There 
was “a direct connection between the purpose of the Fund and the use of 
prizes to increase the response rate to customer satisfaction surveys.” 
Therefore, GAO had no objection to PBS’s use of the Federal Buildings 
Fund for this purpose. 

c. Awards A number of early decisions established the proposition that, absent 
specific statutory authority, appropriations could not be used to purchase 
such items as medals, trophies, or insignia for the purpose of making 
awards. The rationale follows that of the gift cases. The prohibition was 
applied in 5 Comp. Gen. 344 (1925) (medals for winners of athletic events) 
and 15 Comp. Gen. 278 (1935) (annual trophies for Naval Reserve bases for 
efficiency). In 10 Comp. Gen. 453 (1931), the Comptroller General held that 
a general appropriation could be used to design and procure medals of 
honor for air mail flyers where the awarding of the medals had been 
authorized in virtually concurrent legislation. The general appropriation 
was viewed as available to carry out the specifically expressed intent of 
Page 4-164 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Congress and the express authorization obviated any need for a more 
specific appropriation. 

The rule was restated in 45 Comp. Gen. 199 (1965) and viewed as 
prohibiting the purchase of a plaque to present to a state to recognize 
50 years of achievement in forestry. While the voucher in that case was paid 
because the plaque had already been presented, the decision stated that 
payment was for that instance only and that congressional authority should 
be sought if similar awards were considered desirable in the future. A more 
recent case applying the prohibition is B-223447, Oct. 10, 1986. 

As with the gift cases, an occasional exception will be found based on an 
adequate justification under the necessary expense doctrine. One example, 
prompted perhaps by wartime considerations, is B-31094, Jan. 11, 1943, 
approving the purchase of medals or other inexpensive insignia (but not 
cash payments) to be awarded to civil defense volunteers for heroism or 
distinguished service. 

Similarly, the Comptroller General held in 17 Comp. Gen. 674 (1938) that an 
appropriation, one of whose purposes was “accident prevention,” was 
available to purchase medals and insignia (but not to make monetary 
awards) to recognize mail truck drivers with safe driving records. There 
was sufficient discretion under the appropriation to determine the forms 
“accident prevention” should take. However, the discretion in recognizing 
safe job performance does not extend to distributing “awards” of 
merchandise selected from a catalogue. B-223608, Dec. 19, 1988.100 The 
same decision disapproved the distribution of ice scrapers imprinted with a 
safety message, based on the lack of adequate justification. 

The prohibition does not apply to a government corporation with the 
authority to determine the character and necessity of its expenditures. 
64 Comp. Gen. 124 (1984). (The expenditure in the case cited was to be 
made from donated funds.) 

Several statutes now authorize the making of awards in various contexts. 
Perhaps the most important is the Government Employees’ Incentive 

100 Merchandise in that case was distributed to more than 80 percent of the workforce at one 
project.

Awards Act, enacted in 1954 101and now found at 5 U.S.C. §§ 4501–4506. The 
Act authorizes an agency to pay a cash award to an employee who by his or 
her “suggestion, invention, superior accomplishment, or other personal 
effort contributes to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of 
Government operations or achieves a significant reduction in paper work” 
or performs a special act or service in the public interest related to his or 
her official employment. 5 U.S.C. § 4503. The agency may also incur 
“necessary expenses” in connection with an incentive award. Id. Awards 
and related expenses under the Act are paid from appropriations available 
to the activity or activities benefited. The Office of Personnel Management 
is authorized to prescribe implementing regulations. 5 U.S.C. § 4506. OPM’s 
regulations are found in 5 C.F.R. pt. 451. See also Awards, Department of 
Defense Civilian Personnel Manual, DOD 1400.25-M, subchapter 451 
(Dec. 1996). A provision added in 1990, 5 U.S.C. § 4505a, authorizes cash 
awards for employees with fully successful performance ratings.102 

The Incentive Awards Act applies to civilian agencies, civilian employees of 
the various armed services, the District of Columbia government, and 
specified legislative branch agencies. 5 U.S.C. § 4501. Within the judicial 
branch, it applies to the United States Sentencing Commission. Id.103 While 
it does not apply to members of the armed forces, the Defense Department 
has very similar authority for military personnel in 10 U.S.C. § 1124. 

GAO has issued a number of decisions interpreting the Government 
Employees’ Incentive Awards Act. Thus, where an award is based on a 
suggestion resulting in monetary savings, the savings must be to 
government rather than nongovernment funds. 36 Comp. Gen. 822 (1957). 
Applying this principle, GAO found that a suggestion for changes in 
 


101 68 Stat. 1112. This was an expansion of similar but more limited authority enacted in 1946 
(60 Stat. 809). GAO reviewed the Acts effectiveness in U.S. General Accounting Office,

(Washington, D.C.: Aug. 1989). 

102 Section 207 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), contained 
in section 529 of the fiscal year 1991 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government 
Appropriation Act, Pub. L. No. 101-509, 104 Stat. 1389, 1457 (Nov. 5, 1990). The authority is 
effective only to the extent funds are provided in appropriation acts. FEPCA § 301, 104 Stat. 
1461. 

103 The Sentencing Commission had not been covered prior to a 1988 amendment to the 
statute. See 66 Comp. Gen. 650 (1987). The Administrative Office of the United States Courts 
is no longer covered by the statute. Pub. L. No. 101-474, § 5(f), 104 Stat. 1100 (Oct. 30, 1990).

procedures that would decrease administrative expenses of state 
employment security offices would effect a savings to an appropriation for 
unemployment service administration grants to the states. Therefore, the 
appropriation was available to make an award to the employee who made 
the suggestion. 38 Comp. Gen. 815 (1959). An agency may make an award 
to an employee on detail from another agency. 33 Comp. Gen. 577 (1954). 
An agency may also make an award to one of its employees for service to a 
Federal Executive Board. B-240316, Mar. 15, 1991. See also 70 Comp. 
Gen. 16 (1990). 

An interesting situation occurred in B-192334, Sept. 28, 1978. There, an 
employee made a suggestion that resulted in monetary savings to his own 
agency, but the savings would be offset by increased costs to other 
agencies. The decision concluded that, if the agency wanted to make an 
award on the basis of tangible benefits, it must measure tangible benefits to 
the government, that is, it must deduct the increased costs to other 
agencies from its own savings. However, the agency could view the 
suggestion as a contribution to efficiency or improved operations and make 
a monetary award based on intangible benefits. 

As noted, the Act authorizes an agency to incur“necessary expenses” 
incident to its awards program. Thus, an agency may pay travel and 
miscellaneous expenses to bring recipients to Washington D.C. to 
participate in award ceremonies. 70 Comp. Gen. 440 (1991). These 
expenses are not chargeable against the statutory award ceiling. 32 Comp. 
Gen. 134 (1952). The agency may also pay travel expenses for the recipients 
spouse. 69 Comp. Gen. 38 (1989), overruling 54 Comp. Gen. 1054 (1975); 
B-235163.11, Feb. 13, 1996. Travel and miscellaneous expenses may also be 
paid to a surviving spouse to receive an award on behalf of a deceased 
recipient. B-111642, May 31, 1957. Where a recipient has a disability and 
cannot travel unattended, the travel and miscellaneous expenses of an 
attendant, whether or not a family member, may be paid. 55 Comp. 
Gen. 800 (1976). 

The Act does not authorize “necessary expenses” incident to the receipt of 
an award from a nonfederal organization. 40 Comp. Gen. 706 (1961). See, 
e.g., B-258216, July 27, 1995 (agency’s payment for airline tickets for 
mother and brother of a deceased employee to attend nongovernmental 
awards ceremony honoring deceased employee not authorized). However, 
in limited situations where an award from a nonfederal organization is 
closely related to the recipients official duties, it may be possible to pay 
certain related expenses on other grounds. See 55 Comp. Gen. 1332 (1976).

As previously discussed in our section on entertainment, the Comptroller 
General has held that the “necessary expense” language of the Government 
Employees’ Incentive Awards Act may include refreshments at an agency’s 
awards ceremony. 65 Comp. Gen. 738 (1986). See also B-167835, Nov. 18, 
1969. A 1990 decision applied the rationale of 65 Comp. Gen. 738 and held 
that an agency could pay a fee, which included a luncheon, for attendance 
at a Federal Executive Board regional award ceremony by agency 
employees who had been selected for awards and their supervisors. 
70 Comp. Gen. 16 (1990). See also B-288536, Nov. 19, 2001 (buffet-style 
luncheon provided Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) employees attending 
awards ceremony); B-270199, Aug. 6, 1996 (cake at a Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation awards ceremony); B-235163.11, Feb. 13, 1996 
(National Science Foundation annual awards dinner). 

In B-247563.4, Dec. 11, 1996, however, the Comptroller General ruled that 
the Government Employees’ Incentive Awards Act does not authorize 
refreshments “in connection with an event or function designed to achieve 
other objectives simply because the agency distributes awards as part of 
the event or function.” The purpose of authorized refreshments is to 
“facilitate public recognition of awards recipients” and this purpose would 
not be served where, as in this case, the awards recipients and the donor 
were the only participants in the event. 

GAO explored the range of agency discretion in providing refreshments in 
connection with awards ceremonies in B-270327, Mar. 12, 1997. This case 
arose when the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS), in 
recognition of excellent agency performance, designated a worldwide 
“celebration day,” on which it hosted luncheons for all DRMS employees 
and provided each employee a specially designed “Bucks Bunny” and “Reut 
Rabbit” T-shirt, as well as 4 hours of administrative leave. DRMS guidance 
authorized each DRMS location to spend up to $20 per person for 
accommodations and “incidental refreshments” in connection with the 
awards ceremonies. GAO considered the DRMS awards program in light of 
OPM’s regulations implementing the Incentive Awards Act at 5 C.F.R. 
pt. 451, which, the decision concluded, “purposely leave it up to the 
agencies to design their award programs and make their own award 
decisions.” GAO concluded that it was required to “respect and defer” to 
OPM’s regulatory decisions and implicit delegation of authority to agencies 
to make implementing decisions so long as such decisions were consistent 
with essential requirements of the Act. Although GAO observed that the 
coverage of the “celebration day” was “broader than [it had] typically 
encountered in … prior decisions,” it concluded that “unless arbitrary and 

Page 4-168 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

capricious, differences in degree do not invalidate the decisions made.” The 
submitted vouchers were approved. See also B-288536, supra (BIA buffet). 

Awards under the Act may take forms other than cash. Thus, in 55 Comp. 
Gen. 346 (1975), the Comptroller General held that the Army Criminal 
Investigation Command could award marble paperweights and walnut 
plaques to Command employees, including those who had died in the line 
of duty, if the awards conformed to the Act and applicable regulations. In 
situations not covered by the statute (e.g., presentations to nongovernment 
persons to recognize cooperation and enhance community relations), 
however, such awards would be personal gifts and therefore improper. 
Similarly authorized as “honorary” awards are desk medallions (B-184306, 
Aug. 27, 1980); telephones of nominal value (67 Comp. Gen. 349 (1988)); 
$50 jackets bearing agency insignia (B-243025, May 2, 1991); coffee mugs 
and pens (B-257488, Nov. 6, 1995); tickets to local sporting events or 
amusement parks (B-256399, June 27, 1994); and meals or gift certificates 
for meals (B-271511, Mar. 4, 1997). Administrative leave can also be 
awarded if and to the extent authorized in Office of Personnel 
Managements (OPM) implementing regulations. 5 U.S.C. § 4502(e)(2).104 
See also B-208766, Dec. 7, 1982. Whether the award is monetary or 
nonmonetary, the act or service prompting it must be related to official 
employment. 70 Comp. Gen. 248 (1991) (the Government Employees’ 
Incentive Awards Act does not authorize giving T-shirts to Combined 
Federal Campaign contributors). See also 71 Comp. Gen. 145 (1992) 
(contractor in 70 Comp. Gen. 248 not entitled to payment for shirts 
provided to government). 

The Act does not authorize cash awards based merely on length of service 
or upon retirement. However, honorary noncash awards are permissible. 
For example, the Department of Agriculture wanted to present to retiring 
members of its Office of Inspector General engraved plastic holders 
containing their credentials. GAO found this authorized by the Act. 
46 Comp. Gen. 662 (1967). The use of incentive awards for good sick leave 
records is inappropriate. 67 Comp. Gen. 349 (1988), cited in National 
Association of Government Employees Local R1-109, 53 F.L.R.A. 271, 
Aug. 15, 1997. 

The making of an award—and therefore the refusal to make an award— 
under the Government Employees’ Incentive Awards Act is discretionary.

(Fed. Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 907 (1987). As such, it is reviewable 
only for abuse of discretion. E.g., Shaller v. United States, 202 Ct. Cl. 571, 
cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1092 (1973). A labor relations arbitrator may order an 
agency to prepare and submit an award recommendation, but cannot order 
the agency to actually make the award. 56 Comp. Gen. 57 (1976). 

In B-202039, Apr. 3, 1981, aff’d upon reconsideration, B-202039, May 7, 
1982, two employees filed a claim where their agency had given them a 
cash award several years after implementing their suggestion. They 
claimed interest on the award, lost imputed investment earnings, an 
inflation adjustment, and compensation for higher income taxes paid as a 
result of the delay. The claim was denied. In the May 1982 decision, GAO 
pointed out that an agency’s own regulations can have the effect of limiting 
the discretion it would otherwise have under the statute. See also Griffin v. 
United States, 215 Ct. Cl. 710 (1978). Thus, agency regulations can commit 
the agency to making an award if it adopts a suggestion. However, this does 
not create an entitlement to interest. 

Finally, the Government Employees’ Incentive Awards Act is limited to 
government employees. Since no similar authority exists for persons other 
than government employees, an award may not be made to a 
nongovernment employee who submits a suggestion resulting in savings to 
the government. B-160419, July 28, 1967. The limitation to government 
employees is also noted in two internal GAO memoranda. B-224071-O.M., 
Aug. 3, 1987 (GAO appropriations not available for cash awards to contract 
security guards); B-176600-O.M., Aug. 18, 1978 (appropriations of agencies 
funding the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program not 
available to make cash awards to other than federal employees). 

In addition to the Government Employees’ Incentive Awards Act, several 
other statutes authorize various types of awards. Some examples are: 

• 5 U.S.C. § 5384: authorizes lump-sum cash performance awards to 

members of the Senior Executive Service. Some representative 

decisions are 68 Comp. Gen. 337 (1989), 64 Comp. Gen. 114 (1984), and 

62 Comp. Gen. 675 (1983). 

• 10 U.S.C. § 1125 and 14 U.S.C. § 503: authorize the Defense Department 

and the Coast Guard, respectively, to award trophies and badges for 

certain accomplishments. See 71 Comp. Gen. 346 (1992) (Air Force 

purchase of belt buckles as awards for participants in “Peacekeeper

Challenge” competition permissible under 10 U.S.C. § 1125). The Coast 
Guard statute includes cash prizes. The statutes have been narrowly 
construed as limited essentially to proficiency in arms and related 
skills. 68 Comp. Gen. 343 (1989) (Coast Guard); 27 Comp. Gen. 637 
(1948) (discussing predecessor of 10 U.S.C. § 1125). 

• 5 U.S.C. §§ 4511–4513: Inspector General of an agency may make cash 
awards to employees whose disclosure of fraud, waste, or 
mismanagement results in cost savings for the agency. For an agency 
without an Inspector General, the agency head is to designate an 
official to make the awards. The President may make the awards where 
the cost savings accrue to the government as a whole. GAO reviews 
under this legislation indicate that the authority has been used 
sparingly, but that actual or projected cost savings appear reasonable in 
those cases where awards have been made.105 

9. Guard Services: Anti-
Pinkerton Act 
a. Evolution of the Law Prior 
to 57 Comp. Gen. 524 
On July 6, 1892, in Homestead, Pennsylvania, a riot occurred between 
striking employees of the Carnegie, Phipps & Company steel mill and 
approximately 200 Pinkerton guards. The company had brought in the 
Pinkerton force ostensibly to protect company property. As the Pinkertons 
were being transported down the Monongahela River, the strikers sighted 
them and began firing on them. The strikers were heavily armed, and even 
had a cannon on the riverbank. The violence escalated to the point where 
the strikers spread oil on the water and ignited it. Several of the Pinkerton 
men were killed and several of the strikers were indicted for murder. The 
riot received national attention. 

The then-common practice of employing armed Pinkerton guards as 
strikebreakers in labor disputes became an emotionally charged issue. The 
Homestead riot, together with other similar although less dramatic 
incidents, made it clear that the use of these guards provoked violence. 
Although Congress was reluctant to legislate against their use in the private

sector, some congressional action became inevitable. The result was the 
law that came to be known as the Anti-Pinkerton Act. Originally enacted as 
part of the Sundry Civil Appropriation Act of August 5, 1892, 27 Stat. 368, it 
was made permanent the following year by the Act of March 3, 1893, 
ch. 208, 27 Stat. 591. Now found at 5 U.S.C. § 3108, the Act provides: 

“An individual employed by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, 
or similar organization, may not be employed by the 
Government of the United States or the Government of the 
District of Columbia.” 

As we will see, the statute has little impact today. Nevertheless, it remains 
on the books and could become relevant, albeit only in unusual 
circumstances. Therefore, it may be useful to briefly record the 
administrative interpretations of the law. 

Although the Anti-Pinkerton Act was never the subject of any judicial 
decisions until the late 1970s, it was the subject of numerous decisions of 
the Comptroller General and the Comptroller of the Treasury. Several 
principles evolved through the decisions. 

1. The Act applies to contracts with “detective agencies” as firms or 
corporations as well as to contracts with or appointments of individual 
employees of such agencies. 8 Comp. Gen. 89 (1928); A-12194, Feb. 23, 
1926. 
2. The Act prohibits the employment of a detective agency or its 
employees, regardless of the character of the services to be performed. 
The fact that such services are not to be of a “detective” nature is 
immaterial. Thus, detectives or detective agencies within the scope of 
the Act may not be employed in any capacity. 51 Comp. Gen. 494 
(1972); 26 Comp. Gen. 303 (1946). 
3. The statutory prohibition applies only to direct employment. It does not 
extend to subcontracts entered into with independent contractors of 
the United States. 26 Comp. Gen. 303. The legislative history of the 
original 1892 statute made it clear that Congress did not intend to reach 
subcontracts. However, the Act does apply to a contract under the 
Small Business Administration (SBA) set-aside program since the 
contract is a prime contract vis-à-vis SBA even though it may be a 
subcontract vis-à-vis the actual employing agency. 55 Comp. Gen. 1472 
(1976). 
Page 4-172 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

4. Although the Comptroller General never defined “detective agency” for 
purposes of the Anti-Pinkerton Act, the decisions drew a distinction 
between detective agencies and protective agencies and held that the 
Act did not forbid contracts with the latter. 38 Comp. Gen. 881 (1959); 
26 Comp. Gen. 303 (1946); B-32894, Mar. 29, 1943. Thus, the government 
could employ a protective agency, but could not employ a detective 
agency to do protective work. An important test became whether the 
organization was empowered to do general investigative work. 
5. In determining whether a given firm is within the statutory prohibition, 
GAO considers the nature of the functions it may perform as well as the 
functions it in fact performs. Two factors are relevant here—the firm’s 
authority under its corporate charter and its powers under licensing 
arrangements in the states in which it does business. If a firm is 
chartered as a detective agency and licensed as a detective agency, then 
the fact that it does not actually engage in detective work will not 
permit it to escape the statutory prohibition. Since virtually every 
corporation inserts in its charter an “omnibus” clause (“engage in any 
lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized in this 
state” or similar language), an omnibus clause alone will not make a 
company a detective agency. Rather, specific charter authorization is 
needed. 41 Comp. Gen. 819 (1962); B-146293, July 14, 1961. 
6. The government may employ a wholly owned subsidiary of a detective 
agency if the subsidiary itself is not a detective agency, even if the 
subsidiary was organized primarily or solely to avoid the Anti-
Pinkerton Act. As long as there is prima facie separation of corporate 
affairs, the Act does not compel the government to “pierce the 
corporate veil.” 44 Comp. Gen. 564 (1965); 41 Comp. Gen. 819 (1962); 
B-167723, Sept. 12, 1969. 
7. A telephone listing alone is not sufficient evidence that a given firm is a 
“detective agency” for purposes of 5 U.S.C. § 3108, although the fact of 
such a listing should prompt further inquiry by the procuring agency. 
55 Comp. Gen. 1472 (1976); B-181684, Mar. 17, 1975; B-176307(1), 
Mar. 21, 1973; B-177137, Feb. 12, 1973. 
8. Corrections to charters and licenses may be made prior to contract 
award to avoid Anti-Pinkerton Act violations. Post-award corrections, 
while perhaps relevant to future procurements, do not, absent 
compelling circumstances, retroactively expunge ineligibility existing at

b. 57 Comp. Gen. 524 and the 
Present State of the Law 
the time of the award. 56 Comp. Gen. 225 (1977); B-172587, June 21, 

1971; B-161770, Nov. 21, 1967; B-160538, Nov. 15, 1967; B-156424, 

July 22, 1965. 

These principles were discussed and applied in many decisions over the 
years. For example, a contract for guard services was found to violate the 
Act where the contractor was expressly chartered and licensed as a 
detective agency. 55 Comp. Gen. 1472, aff’d upon reconsideration, 
56 Comp. Gen. 225. Similarly, a contract with a sole proprietorship was 
invalid where the owner was also the president of a corporation chartered 
and licensed as a detective agency. B-186347, B-185495, Oct. 14, 1976, aff’d 
upon reconsideration, B-186347, B-185495, Mar. 7, 1977. 

By the 1970s, the Anti-Pinkerton Act had become a hindrance to the 
government’s guard service contracting activities. The federal government 
is a major consumer of guard services, and it was the rare solicitation that 
did not generate a squabble over who was or was not subject to the Act. 
Many companies, including Pinkerton itself, were forced to form 
subsidiaries in order to compete for government business. 

The first reported judicial decision dealing with the Anti-Pinkerton Act was 
United States ex rel. Weinberger v. Equifax, 557 F.2d 456 (5th Cir. 1977), 
cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1035 (1978). The issue in that case was whether the 
Act applied to a credit reporting company. The Comptroller General, in 
B-139965, Jan. 10, 1975, had already held that it did not. The court reached 
the same result, although on different reasoning. Relying heavily on the 
Act’s legislative history, the court held: 

“In light of the purpose of the Act and its legislative history, 

we conclude that an organization is not ‘similar’ to the 

(quondam) Pinkerton Detective Agency unless it offers 

quasi-military armed forces for hire.” 

557 F.2d at 463. 

In a June 1978 circular letter to department and agency heads, published at 
57 Comp. Gen. 524 (1978), the Comptroller General announced that GAO 
would follow the Equifax interpretation in the future. Therefore, the 
statutory prohibition will now be applied only if an organization can be said 
to offer quasi-military armed forces for hire. The Comptroller General 
declined, as did the Fifth Circuit, to attempt a definition of a quasi-military 
armed force but noted that, whatever it might mean, “it seems clear that a 

Page 4-174 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

company which provides guard or protective services does not thereby 
become a ‘quasi-military armed force,’ even if the individual guards are 
armed.” 57 Comp. Gen. at 525. It follows that whether that company also 
provides investigative or detective services is no longer relevant. The first 
decision applying this new standard was 57 Comp. Gen. 480 (1978). 

Prior to the Equifax decision, GAO had gone on record as favoring repeal 
of the Anti-Pinkerton Act. See, e.g., 56 Comp. Gen. 225, 230 (1977). In light 
of the Equifax case and 57 Comp. Gen. 524, the case for repeal is 
considerably lessened. The statute is no longer a major impediment to 
legitimate guard service contracting, and certainly most would agree that 
the government should not deal with an organization that offers quasi-
military armed forces for hire. 

With the issuance of 57 Comp. Gen. 524 and 57 Comp. Gen. 480, GAO 
reviewed the prior decisions under the Anti-Pinkerton Act and designated 
them as either overruled or modified. If the result in the earlier case would 
have remained the same under the new standard, the decision was only 
“modified.” If the new standard would have produced a different result, the 
earlier decision was “overruled.” This is important because 57 Comp. 
Gen. 524 did not simply throw out all of the old rules. What it did is 
eliminate the “protective versus investigative” distinction and adopt the 
Equifax standard as the definition of a proscribed entity. Thus, an 
organization will no longer violate the Act by providing general 
investigative services; it will violate the Act only if it “offers quasi-military 
armed forces for hire.” 57 Comp. Gen. at 525. If a given organization were 
found to offer quasi-military armed forces for hire—an event that is viewed 
as unlikely although not impossible—the rules in the earlier decisions 
would still be applicable even though the decisions themselves have been 
technically overruled or modified. Thus, the pre-1978 principles set forth 
previously in this discussion remain applicable, but the focal point is now 
whether the organization in question offers quasi-military armed forces for 
hire, not merely whether it provides general detective or investigative 
services. For purposes of guard service contracting, the burden of proof 
rests with the party alleging the violation. E.g., B-216534, Jan. 22, 1985. 

10. Insurance 
a. The Self-Insurance Rule One frequently hears that the government is a self-insurer. This is not 
completely true. There are many situations in which the government buys 
Page 4-175 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

or pays for insurance. Among the more well-known examples are the 
Federal Employees’ Health Benefits Program and Federal Employees’ 
Group Life Insurance. As another example, the federal government is 
required by statute to pay half of the costs incurred by “qualified 
employees” for professional liability insurance. See Pub. L. No. 106-58, title 
VI, § 642(a), 113 Stat. 430, 477 (Sept. 29, 1999), and discussion later in this 
chapter in section C.13.j; B-300866, May 30, 2003. Also, the government 
frequently pays for insurance indirectly through contracts, grants, and 
leases. E.g., B-72120, Jan. 14, 1948 (lease). A comprehensive treatment may 
be found in a report of the Comptroller General. U.S. General Accounting 
Office, Survey of the Application of the Government’s Policy on Self-
Insurance, B-168106 (Washington, D.C.: June 14, 1972). Another useful 
report, although more limited in scope, is U.S. General Accounting Office, 

Extending the Government’s Policy of Self-Insurance in Certain 
Instances Could Result in Great Savings, PSAD-75-105 (Washington, D.C.: 
Aug. 26, 1975). 

However, the government is essentially a self-insurer in certain important 
areas, primarily loss or damage to government property and the liability of 
government employees insofar as the government is legally responsible or 
would ultimately bear the loss. The rule to be discussed in this section may 
be stated thus: In the absence of express statutory authority to the 
contrary, appropriated funds are not available for the purchase of 
insurance to cover loss or damage to government property or the liability of 
government employees. 

The rationale for the rule is aptly summarized in the following two passages 
from early decisions: 

“The basic principle of fire, tornado, or other similar 
insurance is the lessening of the burden of individual losses 
by wider distribution thereof, and it is difficult to conceive 
of a person, corporation, or legal entity better prepared to 
carry insurance or sustain a loss than the United States 
Government.” 

19 Comp. Gen. 798, 800 (1940). 

“The magnitude of [the government’s] resources obviously 
makes it more advantageous for the Government to carry its 
own risks than to shift them to private insurers at rates 
sufficient to cover all losses, to pay their operating

expenses, including agency or broker’s commissions, and to 
leave such insurers a profit.” 

19 Comp. Gen. 211, 214 (1939). 

The rule and its evolution are also summarized in B-158766, Feb. 3, 1977. 

The “self-insurance rule” dates back to the nineteenth century and has been 
stated and applied in numerous decisions of the Comptroller General and 
the Comptroller of the Treasury. In one early decision, 13 Comp. Dec. 779 
(1907), the question was whether an appropriation for the education of 
natives in Alaska could be used to buy insurance to cover desks en route to 
Alaska which had been purchased from that appropriation. The 
Comptroller of the Treasury held that the insurance could not be 
considered a necessary expense incident to accomplishing the purpose of 
the appropriation unless it somehow operated either to preserve and 
maintain the property for use or to preserve the appropriation that was 
used to buy it. It did not do the first because insurance does not provide 
any added means to actually protect the property (life insurance does not 
keep you alive) but merely transfers the risk of loss. Neither could it 
“preserve the appropriation” because any recoveries would have to be 
deposited into the general fund (miscellaneous receipts) of the Treasury. 
Therefore the appropriation was not available to purchase the insurance. 

The following year, the Comptroller held that appropriations for the 
construction and maintenance of target ranges for the National Guard 
(then called “organized militias”) could not be used to insure buildings 
acquired for use in target practice. 14 Comp. Dec. 836 (1908). The decision 
closely followed the reasoning of 13 Comp. Dec. 779—the insurance would 
not actually protect the property from loss nor would it preserve the 
appropriation because any proceeds could not be retained by the agency 
but would have to be paid into the Treasury. Thus, the object of the 
appropriation “can be as readily accomplished without insurance as with 
it.” 14 Comp. Dec. at 840. 

Citing these and several other decisions, the Comptroller held similarly in 
23 Comp. Dec. 269 (1916) that an appropriation for the construction and 
operation of a railroad in Alaska was not available to pay premiums for 
insurance on buildings constructed as part of the project. 

A slightly different situation was presented in 24 Comp. Dec. 569 (1918). 
The Lincoln Farm Association had donated to the United States a memorial

hall enclosing the log cabin in which Abraham Lincoln was born, together 
with a $50,000 endowment fund to preserve and maintain the property. The 
question was whether the fund could be used to buy fire insurance on the 
property. The Comptroller noted that the funds were not appropriated 
funds in the strict sense, but were nevertheless “government funds” in that 
legal title was in the United States. Therefore, the self-insurance rule 
applied. Recalling the reasoning of the earlier decisions, the Comptroller 
apparently could not resist commenting “[i]t should be remembered that 
fire insurance does not tend to protect or preserve a building from fire.” Id. 
at 570. 

The Comptroller General continued to apply the rule. In a 1927 case, a 
contracting officer attempted to agree to indemnify a contractor against 
loss or damage by casualty on buildings under construction. Since the 
appropriation would not have been available to insure the buildings 
directly, the contracting officer could not agree to do so by contract. The 
stipulation to indemnify was held to exceed the contracting officer’s 
authority and therefore imposed no legal liability against the appropriation. 
7 Comp. Gen. 105 (1927). Boiler inspection insurance was found improper 
in 11 Comp. Gen. 59 (1931). 

A more recent decision applying the self-insurance rule is 55 Comp. 
Gen. 1196 (1976). There, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) loaned certain property associated with the Apollo 
Moon Mission to the Air Force for exhibition. As a condition of the loan, 
NASA required the Air Force to purchase commercial insurance against 
loss or damage to its property. The Comptroller General found that the self-
insurance rule applied to the loan of property from one federal agency to 
another, and that commercial coverage should not have been procured. 
Since the insurance had already been purchased and had apparently been 
procured and issued in good faith, the voucher could be paid. However, the 
decision cautioned against similar purchases in the future. See also 

B-237654, Feb. 21, 1991. 

As noted at the outset, the self-insurance rule applies to tort liability as well 
as property damage. This was established in a 1940 decision to the Federal 
Housing Administration, 19 Comp. Gen. 798. In holding that insurance 
could not be procured against possible tort liability, the Comptroller 
General noted that the self-insurance rule “relates to the risk and not to the 
nature of the risk.” Id. at 800. Since the 1946 enactment of the Federal Tort 
Claims Act, now codified at 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671 et seq., the issue has become 
largely moot. However, questions still arise concerning the operation of 

Page 4-178 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


b. Exceptions to the Rule 
Chapter 4

motor vehicles, and these are discussed later in this section. Conceptually 
related is 65 Comp. Gen. 790 (1986), holding that an agency may not use its 
appropriations to insure against loss or damage to employee-owned hand 
tools. If the agency wishes to afford a measure of protection to employees 
who use their own tools, it may consider loss or damage claims under the 
Military Personnel and Civilian Employees’ Claims Act of 1964, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3721. (This provision was amended in 1994 to permit agencies to pay for 
losses sustained by government personnel forced to evacuate a foreign 
country. Pub. L. No. 103-236, § 172, 108 Stat. 382 (Apr. 30, 1994).) 

Another type of insurance which may not be paid for from appropriated 
funds is flight insurance. If a federal employee traveling by air on official 
business wishes to buy flight insurance, it is considered a personal expense 
and not reimbursable. 47 Comp. Gen. 319 (1967); 40 Comp. Gen. 11 (1960). 
Similarly nonreimbursable is trip cancellation insurance. 58 Comp. 
Gen. 710 (1979). 

Insurance on household goods placed in storage incident to a permanent 
change of duty station may not be reimbursed to the employee unless the 
insurance is required by the storage company as a condition of accepting 
the goods for storage or is otherwise required by law. 28 Comp. Gen. 679 
(1949). 

Many of the decisions in this area include a statement to the effect that the 
government’s practice of self-insurance “is one of policy and not of positive 
law.” E.g., 21 Comp. Gen. 928, 931 (1942). While the statement is true, as it 
has been carried from decision to decision the word “positive” has 
occasionally been omitted and this has caused some confusion. All the 
statement means is that the rule is not mandated by statute, but has 
evolved administratively from the policy considerations summarized 
above. See also 71 Comp. Gen. 4 (1991) (policy against using appropriated 
funds to make permanent improvements to private property). 

(1) Departments and agencies generally 
Exceptions to the self-insurance rule may of course be authorized by 
statute. The absence of an express prohibition on insurance is not enough 
to authorize it; rather, specific statutory authority is required. 19 Comp. 
Gen. 798, 800 (1940); 14 Comp. Dec. 836, 839 (1908). Although legislation in 
this area has been minimal, Congress has occasionally authorized the 
procurement of insurance in some instances and prohibited it in others. By 
this pattern, congressional recognition of the rule may be inferred. 

Page 4-179 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Also, the existence of statutory authority to buy insurance does not 
necessarily mean it has to be exercised. In one case, the Comptroller 
General recommended against the purchase of insurance although 
recognizing that it was statutorily authorized in that instance. 19 Comp. 
Gen. 211 (1939). 

Moreover, because the rule is not mandated by statute but rather has 
evolved administratively from policy considerations, there are 
nonstatutory exceptions in the limited number of cases where the 
underlying policy considerations do not apply. The standards for exception 
were summarized in B-151876, Apr. 24, 1964, as follows: 

1. where the economy sought by self-insurance would be defeated; 
2. where sound business practice indicates that a savings can be effected; 
or 
3. where services or benefits not otherwise available can be obtained by 
purchasing insurance. 
See also B-290162, Oct. 22, 2002; B-244473.2, May 13, 1993. 

Two World War II cases provide early illustrations of this approach. In 
B-35379, July 17, 1943, the procurement of airplane hull insurance by the 
Civil Aeronautics Administration was approved. It was determined that the 
Administration did not have in its employ, and was unable at the time to 
recruit, the number of qualified personnel that would be required to 
appraise damage and arrange for and supervise immediate repairs in 
connection with the War Training Service and that commercial insurance 
coverage could provide such services. Also, in B-59941, Oct. 8, 1946, the 
purchase of pressure vessel insurance including essential inspection 
services from commercial sources was permissible because of the 
necessity and economy brought on by wartime conditions. 

In 37 Comp. Gen. 511 (1958), GAO considered a provision in a shipbuilding 
contract, which required the contractor to procure builder’s risk insurance, 
including war risk insurance that was obtainable mainly from the 
government. Under the contract, title vested in the United States to the 
extent work was completed, but the risk of loss remained in the shipbuilder 
until the completed vessel was delivered to and accepted by the 
government. The government would end up paying part of the premiums 
because their cost was included in the bid price. GAO approved the 

Page 4-180 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

arrangement, finding that it did not improperly transfer the contractors risk 
to the government. 

A more recent example is provided in B-290162, Oct. 22, 2002. The 
Architect of the Capitol asked whether appropriated funds could be used 
for the purchase of “wrap-up” insurance for the construction of the Capitol 
Visitor Center. Wrap-up insurance would cover both the government’s risk 
and the risks of contractors, designers, and consultants in constructing the 
Visitor Center. GAO held that wrap-up insurance could be purchased if it 
were shown that purchasing wrap-up insurance (1) is reasonably necessary 
or incident to the construction of the Visitor Center and (2) would 
otherwise satisfy the standards for exception (discussed above), that is, the 
use of wrap-up insurance would result in a savings or that a benefit, not 
otherwise obtainable, would be gained through the use of wrap-up 
insurance. 

Exceptions may be based on the funding arrangement of a particular 
agency or program. For example, the rule prohibiting the purchase of 
insurance did not apply to the Panama Canal Commission because the 
Commission operated on a self-sustaining basis, deriving its operating 
funds from outside sources. The vast resources available to the 
government, upon which the self-insurance rule is founded, were not 
intended to be available to the Commission. B-217769, July 6, 1987 (holding 
that the Commission could purchase “full scope” catastrophic insurance 
coverage if administratively determined to be necessary). Similarly, GAO 
held in B-287209, June 3, 2002, that the rule prohibiting the purchase of 
insurance to cover loss of property or tort claims does not apply to the 
District of Columbia, since the United States resources are not available to 
cover such loss sustained by the District. The fact that an agency’s initial 
appropriation was placed in an interest-earning trust fund was found not 
sufficient to warrant an exception where the government’s resources were 
nevertheless available to it. B-236022, Jan. 29, 1991 (John C. Stennis Center 
for Public Service Training and Development). 

The Comptroller General has held that the self-insurance rule does not 
apply to privately owned property temporarily entrusted to the 
government. 17 Comp. Gen. 55 (1937) (historical items loaned to the 
government for exhibition purposes); 8 Comp. Gen. 19 (1928) (corporate 
books and records produced by subpoena for a federal grand jury); 
B-126535-O.M., Feb. 1, 1956 (airplane models loaned by manufacturer). 
Compare 25 Comp. Dec. 358 (1918), disallowing a claim for insurance 
premiums by West Publishing Company for law books loaned to a federal 

Page 4-181 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4

employee, where correspondence from the claimant made it clear that it 
was loaning the books to the employee personally and not to the 
government. 

However, insurance may be purchased on loaned private property only 
where the owner requires insurance coverage as part of the transaction. If 
the owner does not require insurance, private insurance is not a necessary 
expense and the government should self-insure. 63 Comp. Gen. 110 (1983) 
(works of art temporarily loaned by the Corcoran Gallery to the President’s 
Commission on Executive Exchange); 42 Comp. Gen. 392 (1963) (school 
classrooms used for civil service examinations). 

Foreign art treasures are frequently loaned to the United States for 
exhibition purposes. While insurance may be purchased by virtue of 
17 Comp. Gen. 55, its extremely high cost has been a disincentive. To 
remedy this situation, in 1975 Congress passed the Arts and Artifacts 
Indemnity Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 971–977. This statute authorizes the Federal 
Council on the Arts and Humanities to enter into agreements to indemnify 
against loss or damage to works of art and other materials while on 
exhibition under specified circumstances and within specified limits. 
Claims under the Act require specific appropriations for payment, but the 
agreements are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The 
Act constitutes authority to incur obligations in advance of appropriations 
and the agreements would therefore not violate the Antideficiency Act. See 
B-115398.01, Apr. 19, 1977 (nondecision letter). 

Since nonappropriated fund activities are by definition not financed from 
public funds, they are not governed by the self-insurance rule. Whether the 
rule should or should not be followed would generally be within the 
discretion of the activity or its parent agency. Thus, it is within the 
discretion of the Department of Defense to establish the rule by regulation 
for its nonappropriated fund activities. B-137896, Dec. 4, 1958. 

Finally, it is important to keep in mind that the self-insurance rule is aimed 
at insurance whose purpose is to protect the United States from risk of 
financial loss. Applying the rule from this perspective, GAO found that it 
would not preclude the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from 
purchasing insurance in connection with certain of its undercover 
operations. The objective in these instances was not to protect the 
government against risk of loss, but to maintain the security of the 
operation itself, for example, by creating the appearance of normality for 
FBI-run undercover proprietary corporations. Thus, the FBI could treat the 

Page 4-182 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

expenditure purely as a “necessary expense” question. B-204486, Jan. 19, 
1982. For additional exceptions, see 59 Comp. Gen. 369 (1980) and 
B-197583, Jan. 19, 1981. 

(2) Government corporations 
In an early case, the Comptroller of the Treasury indicated that the self-
insurance rule would not apply to a wholly owned government corporation 
and suggested that it would generally take an act of Congress to apply the 
prohibition to a corporations funds. 23 Comp. Dec. 297 (1916). 

The Comptroller General followed this approach in 21 Comp. Gen. 928 
(1942), noting that the rule “has not been observed strictly in cases 
involving insurance of property of government corporations.” Id. at 931. 
The decision held that, while the funds of the Virgin Islands Company were 
subject to various statutory restrictions on the use of public funds, they 
could be used to insure the Company’s property. 

The Federal Housing Administration is treated as a corporation for many 
purposes although it is not chartered as one. See 53 Comp. Gen. 337 (1973). 
In 16 Comp. Gen. 453 (1936), the Comptroller General held that the 
Administration could purchase hazard insurance on acquired property 
based on a determination of necessity, but in 19 Comp. Gen. 798 (1940), 
declined to extend that ruling to cover insurance against possible tort 
liability. See also 55 Comp. Gen. 1321 (1976) (former Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board, although technically not a corporation, could nevertheless 
insure its new office building since the Board’s authority to cover losses by 
assessments against member banks made the rationale of self-insurance 
rule inapplicable). 

(1) Property owned by government contractors 
The cases previously discussed in which insurance was prohibited involved 
property to which the government held legal title. Questions also arise 
concerning property to which the government holds less than legal title, 
and property owned by government contractors. 

A contractor will normally procure a variety of insurance as a matter of 
sound business practice. This may include hazard insurance on its property, 
liability insurance, and workers’ compensation insurance. The premiums 
are part of the contractors’ overhead and will be reflected in its bid price. 
When this is done, the government is paying at least a part of the insurance 

Page 4-183 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

cost indirectly. Since the risks covered are not the risks of the government, 
there is no objection to this “indirect payment” nor, if administratively 
determined to be necessary, to the inclusion of an insurance stipulation in 
the contract. 39 Comp. Gen. 793 (1960); 18 Comp. Gen. 285, 298 (1938). 

Similarly differentiating between the government’s risk and the 
contractor’s risk, the Comptroller General has applied the self-insurance 
rule where the government holds “equitable title” under a lease-purchase 
agreement. 35 Comp. Gen. 393 (1956); 35 Comp. Gen. 391 (1956). In both 
decisions, the Comptroller General held that, although the government 
could reimburse the lessor for the cost of insuring against its own (the 
lessors) risk, it could not require the lessor to carry insurance for the 
benefit of the government. 

(2) Use of motor vehicles 
As noted previously, the self-insurance rule applies to tort liability as well 
as property damage. 19 Comp. Gen. 798 (1940). At present, the Federal Tort 
Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671 et seq., provides the exclusive remedy for 
claims against the United States resulting from the negligent operation of 
motor vehicles by government employees within the scope of their 
employment. Thus, insurance questions have become largely moot. 
Nevertheless, the self-insurance rule has been involved in several situations 
involving the operation of motor vehicles. 

A 1966 decision, 45 Comp. Gen. 542, involved Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) employees classified as “high mileage drivers.” They were assigned 
government-owned cars for official use and, when warranted, could drive 
the cars home at the close of the workday so that they could proceed 
directly to an assignment from home the next morning. The Treasury 
Department asked whether IRS appropriations were available to reimburse 
the employees for having their commercial liability insurance extended to 
cover the government vehicles. Applying the self-insurance rule, and noting 
further that the travel would most likely be considered within the scope of 
employment for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Comptroller 
General concluded that the funds could not be so used. GAO similarly 
denied the claims of six Navy members for reimbursement of extra collision 
insurance they purchased on rented trucks. They were authorized to rent 
trucks to perform their official duties and were even directed to obtain 
extra collision insurance. Nonetheless, GAO denied reimbursement because 
the insurance had been purchased in violation of the Joint Federal Travel 
Regulation, vol. I, para. U3415C2a, which prohibits the purchase of optional 

Page 4-184 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

extra collision insurance. B-256669, Aug. 31, 1994. See also B-261141, 
Nov. 9, 1995. Collision damage waiver coverage on commercial rental 
vehicles is discussed in the section entitled “Damage to Commercial Rental 
Vehicles” in Chapter 12 (Volume III of the second edition of Principles of 
Federal Appropriations Law). 

In B-127343, Dec. 15, 1976, the Comptroller General concluded that the 
Federal Tort Claims Act applied to Senate employees operating Senate-
owned vehicles within the scope of their employment. Therefore, the 
purchase of commercial insurance would be neither necessary nor 
desirable. 

In 1972, the Veterans Administration (VA) asked whether it could use its 
appropriations to provide liability insurance coverage for disabled veteran 
patients being given VA-conducted driver training. Since the trainees were 
not government employees, they would not be covered by the Federal Tort 
Claims Act. Since the risk was not that of the government, the self-
insurance rule was not applicable. Therefore, VA could procure the liability 
insurance upon administrative determinations that (1) the driver training 
was a necessary part of a given patient’s medical rehabilitation and (2) that 
the insurance coverage was necessary to its success. B-175086, May 16, 
1972. 

The Federal Tort Claims Act does not apply to claims arising in foreign 
countries and the rules are a bit different for driving overseas. Originally, 
notwithstanding the nonavailability of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the 
Comptroller General had prohibited the purchase of insurance for 
government-owned vehicles operated in foreign countries. 39 Comp. 
Gen. 145 (1959). Instances of specific statutory authority for the State 
Department and the Foreign Agricultural Service were viewed as 
precluding insurance in other situations without similar legislative 
sanction. 

However, GAO reviewed and revised its position in 1976. In 55 Comp. 
Gen. 1343 (1976), the Comptroller General held that the General Services 
Administration (GSA) could provide by regulation for the purchase of 
liability insurance on government-owned vehicles operated regularly or 
intermittently in foreign countries, where required by local law or 
necessitated by legal procedures that could pose extreme difficulties in 
case of an accident (such as arrest of the driver and/or impoundment of the 
vehicle). The decision also concluded that GSA could amend its regulations 
to permit reimbursement of federal employees for the cost of “trip 

Page 4-185 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

insurance” on both government-owned and privately owned vehicles in 
foreign countries where liability insurance is a legal or practical necessity. 
The decision was extended in 55 Comp. Gen. 1397 (1976) to cover the cost 
of required insurance on vehicles leased commercially in foreign countries 
on a long-term basis. 

Some confusion may result from the statement in 55 Comp. Gen. 1343, 
1347, that “39 Comp. Gen. 145 (1959), 19 Comp. Gen. 798 (1940), and 
similar decisions” are overruled “to the extent that they are inconsistent 
with this decision.” Since 39 Comp. Gen. 145 prohibited insurance on 
government-owned vehicles in foreign countries, it is properly viewed as 
overruled by 55 Comp. Gen. 1343. However, 19 Comp. Gen. 798 and “similar 
decisions” remain valid insofar as they assert the general applicability of 
the self-insurance rule to tort liability and to motor vehicle usage in the 
United States. They should be viewed as modified to the extent that they no 
longer preclude purchase of insurance in the foreign country situations 
dealt with in 55 Comp. Gen. 1343 and 55 Comp. Gen. 1397. 

(3) Losses in shipment 
Early decisions had applied the self-insurance rule to the risk of damage or 
loss of valuable government property while in shipment. Thus, marine 
insurance could not be purchased for shipment of a box of silverware. 
4 Comp. Gen. 690 (1925). Nor could it be purchased to cover shipment of 
$5,000 in silver dollars from San Francisco to Samoa. 22 Comp. Dec. 674 
(1916), aff’d upon reconsideration, 23 Comp. Dec. 297 (1916). 

In 1937, Congress enacted the Government Losses in Shipment Act, 
40 U.S.C. §§ 721–729. The Act provides a fund for the payment of claims 
resulting from the loss or damage in shipment of government-owned 
“valuables” as defined in the Act. The Act also prohibits the purchase of 
insurance except as specifically authorized by the Secretary of the 
Treasury. The Secretary may give such an authorization when he finds the 
risk of loss in shipment cannot adequately be guarded against by the 
facilities of the United States or adequate replacement cannot be provided 
for. See S. Rep. No. 75-738, at 5 (1937). If a given risk is beyond the scope of 
the Act, for example, if the items in question are not within the definition of 
“valuables” or if the particular movement does not qualify as “shipment,” 
then the self-insurance rule and its exceptions would still apply. See, e.g., 
17 Comp. Gen. 419 (1937); B-244473.2, May 13, 1993.

(4) Bonding of government personnel 
Prior to 1972, the federal government frequently required the surety 
bonding of officers and employees who handled money or other valuables. 
In 1972, Congress enacted legislation, now found at 31 U.S.C. § 9302, to 
expressly prohibit the government from requiring or obtaining surety 
bonds for its civilian employees or military personnel in connection with 
the performance of their official duties. The reasons for this legislation 
parallel the policy considerations behind the self-insurance rule. Indeed, 
the objective of the legislation was to substitute the principle of self-
insurance for the practice of obtaining surety bonds on federal employees 
where the risk insured against is a loss of government funds or property in 
which the United States is the insured.106 56 Comp. Gen. 788, 790 (1977). 
Although 31 U.S.C. § 9302 does not define “officer” or “employee,” the 
definitions in Title 5 of the United States Code are available for guidance. 

B-236022, Jan. 29, 1991. 

Under the former system, the surety bonds were for the protection of the 
government, not the bonded employee. If a loss occurred and the 
government collected on the bond, the surety could attempt to recover 
against the individual employee. Thus, the elimination of bonding in no way 
affects the personal liability of federal employees, and 31 U.S.C. § 9302 
specifies this. This principle has been noted several times in connection 
with the liability of accountable officers and the cases are cited in 
Chapter 9. 

In 56 Comp. Gen. 788 (1977), the Comptroller General held that, by virtue 
of 31 U.S.C. § 9302, the United States became a self-insurer of restitution, 
reparation, and support moneys collected by probation officers under 
court order. The decision noted that the same result applied to litigation 
funds paid into the registry of the court (funds paid into the registry by a 
litigant pending distribution by the court to the successful party). 

However, if an agency requires an employee to serve as a notary public and 
state law requires bonding of notaries, the employee’s expense in obtaining 
the surety bond may be reimbursed notwithstanding 31 U.S.C. § 9302. The 
bond in such a situation is neither required by nor obtained by the federal 

106 GAO had recommended the legislation. See U.S. General Accounting Office, Review of 
Bonding Program for Employees of the Federal Government, B-8201 (Washington, D.C.: 
Mar. 29, 1962); B-8201, B-59149, Jan. 18, 1972 (bill comments).

government. It is required by the state and obtained by the employee. Also, 
the risk involved is not one in which the United States is the insured. 

B-185909, June 16, 1976. 

Similarly, if a federal court designates a state court employee to perform 
certain functions in connection with the arrest and detention of federal

11. Lobbying and Related 
Matters 
a. Introduction Lobbying—attempting to influence legislators—is nothing new. The term 
itself derives from the practice of advocates of a particular measure lying in 
wait in the corridors or “lobby” of the Capitol Building, there to collar 
passing members of Congress. 
Generally speaking, there are two types of lobbying. “Direct lobbying,” as 
the term implies, means direct contact with the legislators, either in person 
or by various means of written or oral communication. “Indirect” or 
“grassroots” lobbying is different. There, the lobbyist contacts third parties, 
either members of special interest groups or the general public, and urges 
them to contact their legislators to support or oppose something. Of 
course, the term “lobbying” can also refer to attempts to influence decision 
makers other than legislators. 
There is nothing inherently evil about lobbying. A House select committee 
investigating lobbying in 1950 put it this way: 
“Every democratic society worthy of the name must have 
some lawful means by which individuals and groups can lay 
their needs before government. One of the central purposes 
of government is that people should be able to reach it; the 
central purpose of what we call ‘lobbying’ is that they 
should be able to reach it with maximum impact and

possibility of success. This is, fundamentally, what lobbying 
is about.”107 

Nevertheless, because of the obvious potential for abuse, there are legal 
restrictions on lobbying. This section will explore some of them. Because 
the focus of this publication is on the use of appropriated funds, coverage 
is limited for the most part to lobbying by government officials and does 
not include lobbying by private organizations. Restrictions on lobbying by 
government officials derive from two sources: penal statutes and 
provisions in appropriation acts. 

b. Penal Statutes Originally enacted in 1919, 18 U.S.C. § 1913 provided for criminal sanctions. 
In late 2002, however, the statute was amended to omit the criminal 
sanctions and significantly expand the scope of the lobbying restriction.108 
The statute, commonly referred to as the Anti-Lobbying Act, now provides: 
“No part of the money appropriated by any enactment of 
Congress shall, in the absence of express authorization by 
Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any 
personal service, advertisement, telegram, telephone, letter, 
printed or written matter, or other device, intended or 
designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress, 
a jurisdiction, or an official of any government, to favor, 
adopt, or oppose, by vote or otherwise, any legislation, law, 
ratification, policy, or appropriation, whether before or after 
the introduction of any bill, measure, or resolution 
proposing such legislation, law, ratification, policy, or 
appropriation; but this shall not prevent officers or 
employees of the United States or of its departments or 
agencies from communicating to any such Member or 
official, at his request, or to Congress or such official, 
through the proper official channels, requests for any 
legislation, law, ratification, policy, or appropriations which 
they deem necessary for the efficient conduct of the public

business, or from making any communication whose 
prohibition by this section might, in the opinion of the 
Attorney General, violate the Constitution or interfere with 
the conduct of foreign policy, counter-intelligence, 
intelligence, or national security activities.” 

The statute is now punishable by civil penalties ranging between $10,000 
and $100,000 per expenditure. Section 1913 actually incorporates the civil 
penalties contained in another lobbying statute, 31 U.S.C. § 1352. 
Section 1352(a) prohibits recipients of federal contracts, grants, or loans 
from using such funds to lobby in connection with the awarding of such 
contracts, grants, or loans. A thorough discussion of 31 U.S.C. § 1352, also 
known as the Byrd Amendment, is found in the subsequent section on 
lobbying with grant funds in this chapter, section C.11.d. 

Prior to the 2002 amendment, 18 U.S.C. § 1913 only prohibited the use of 
appropriated funds for lobbying aimed at the most basic legislative 
activities of Congress. The amended statute expands the prohibition to a 
broader scope of legislative activities conducted at all levels of 
government, not just the federal level. 

To date there has been no case law interpreting the expanded and 
decriminalized 18 U.S.C. § 1913. The following discussion of the statute, 
while based upon section 1913 before it was amended in 2002, nevertheless 
provides a solid foundation for interpreting the statute as the basic 
framework of the lobbying restriction was not altered. 

The context in which the original section 1913 was enacted is reflected in 
the following passage from the floor debate on the 1919 legislation: 

“The bill also contains a provision which …will prohibit a 
practice that has been indulged in so often, without regard 
to what administration is in power—the practice of a bureau 
chief or the head of a department writing letters throughout 
the country, sending telegrams throughout the country, for 
this organization, for this man, for that company to write his 
Congressman, to wire his Congressman, in behalf of this or 
that legislation. [Applause.] The gentleman from Kentucky 
…during the closing days of the last Congress was greatly 
worried because he had on his desk thousands upon 
thousands of telegrams that had been started right here in 
Washington by some official wiring out for people to wire

Congressman Sherley …Now, it was never the intention of 
Congress to appropriate money for this purpose, and 
[§ 1913] will absolutely put a stop to that sort of thing. 
[Applause.]” 109 

Since 18 U.S.C. § 1913 was a criminal statute, its enforcement was the 
responsibility of the Justice Department and the courts. Although the 
statute no longer contains criminal sanctions, the Justice Department 
continues to have enforcement responsibilities. The enforcement 
mechanism for 18 U.S.C. § 1913 is derived from 31 U.S.C. § 1352(c), which 
provides that violations are to be handled in accordance with the 
administrative process for adjudicating civil liability for false claims. Under 
this process, provided for under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 
1986, 31 U.S.C. § 3801–3812, no alleged violation is subject to adjudication 
unless approved by the Justice Department. 31 U.S.C. § 3803(b)(2). The 
Justice Department is also responsible for the judicial enforcement of any 
civil penalty imposed. 31 U.S.C. § 3806. 

Where GAO has determined that appropriated funds were used, it would 
refer those matters to the Justice Department in appropriate cases. E.g., 
B-192658, Sept. 1, 1978; B-164497(5), Mar. 10, 1977. Generally, GAO would 
refer matters to the Justice Department if asked to do so by a Member of 
Congress or where available information provided reasonable cause to 
suspect that a violation may have occurred. B-145883, Apr. 27, 1962. 

In addition, since a violation of section 1913 is by definition an improper 
use of appropriated funds, such a violation could form the basis of a GAO 
exception or disallowance.110As a practical matter, however, this option is 
often not viable. GAO’s real “enforcement” tool is to report any unlawful 
activities to Congress in furtherance of Congress’s oversight of executive 
branch activities.111

Employees Union v. Campbell, 654 F.2d 784, 791 (D.C. Cir. 1981). 

110 In the past, GAO noted that it could take no action unless the Justice Department or the 
courts first determined that there had been a violation. B-164497(5), Mar. 10, 1977.

The Justice Department has construed section 1913 as applying to large-
scale “grassroots” lobbying campaigns of telegrams, letters, and other 
forms of communication designed to generate citizen contacts with 
Congress on behalf of an administration position with respect to pending 
legislation, but not to direct communications between executive branch 
officials and Congress. More recently, the Justice Department emphasized 
that section 1913 does not apply to (1) public speeches, appearances, or 
writings, so that officials are free to publicly advance administration 
positions, even to the point of calling on the public to encourage Members 
of Congress to support such positions, or (2) the lobbying activities of the 
President, his aides and assistants within the Executive Office of the 
President, the Vice President, cabinet members, and other Senate-
confirmed officials appointed by the President. See Memorandum for the 
Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General from Walter Dellinger, 
Assistant Attorney General, Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, 
Apr. 14, 1995; 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 300 (1989). 

In evaluating particular fact situations to determine possible violations of 
section 1913, GAO has applied the Justice Department’s interpretation of 
that statute. Thus, GAO found that referral to the Justice Department was 
not warranted in the following situations: 

• Various judicial branch activities including direct contacts with 
legislators by federal judges, legislative liaison activities by the Judicial 
Conference of the United States, and some grassroots lobbying that did 
not involve the use of federal funds. 63 Comp. Gen. 624 (1984). 

• Providing to a private lobbying group a copy of congressional 
testimony by the Secretary of State supporting the administration’s 
Central American policies. 66 Comp. Gen. 707 (1987). The answer 
would have been different if the State Department had used 
appropriated funds to develop material for the lobbying group rather 
than simply providing existing and readily available material. Id. at 712. 
See also “Providing assistance to private lobbying groups” later in this 
chapter, section C.11.c, and B-229069.2, Aug. 1, 1988. 

• Contacts with congressional staff members and a briefing for the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee by State Department officials designed to 
generate opposition for a legislative measure perceived as inconsistent 
with administration nuclear nonproliferation policy. B-217896, July 25, 
1985.

• Speeches and written materials by the Chairman of the Federal Trade 
Commission expressing opposition to the Postal Service’s “monopoly” 
status for letter class mail. None of the materials exhorted members of 
the public to contact their legislators. B-229257, June 10, 1988.112 

• Written materials prepared and disseminated by the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), none of which included grassroots lobbying, 
designed to support an administration proposal to transfer SBA to the 
Commerce Department. B-223098, B-223098.2, Oct. 10, 1986. 

• Transmission of information by the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission to a private company advising of scheduled congressional 
hearings on legislation relevant to a problem the company was facing. 
B-229275-O.M., Nov. 17, 1987. The memorandum stated: 

“We believe it is within the statutory authority of a 
regulatory agency to advise a regulated company that a 
remedy it seeks can only be obtained through legislation 
and that such legislative remedy may be initiated by a 
particular Congressional Committee.” 

• Congressional briefings by Department of Energy officials designed to 
influence views on nuclear weapons testing legislation. A planned 
media campaign to further that objective would have been more 
questionable, but it was not carried out. U.S. General Accounting 
Office, Nuclear Test Lobbying: DOE Regulations for Contractors Need 
Reevaluation, GAO/RCED-88-25BR (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 9, 1987). 

• Memorandum written by Commissioner of Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, urging individuals and organizations to “make [their] 
position known to the co-sponsors of this [b]ill,” constituted grassroots 
lobbying. However, no referral was made since the Commissioner was 
a presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate and the amount spent 
on the memorandum was not substantial. B-270875, July 5, 1996. 

• Letter sent by Deputy Secretary of Energy to thousands of individuals 
and organizations addressing the administration’s energy policies and 

112 Although not noted in the decision, under the Department of Justice’s interpretation of 
section 1913 noted above, the lobbying activities of the Chairman would not have been 
restricted in any case. See, e.g., B-270875, July 5, 1996.

legislative proposals was not grassroots lobbying as recipients were 
encouraged to contact the Deputy Secretary, not their elected 
representatives. Moreover, the Deputy Secretary’s activities were not 
restricted by section 1913 since he was a Senate-confirmed presidential 
appointee. B-270875, July 5, 1996. 

• Environmental Protection Agency distribution of fact sheets to various 
organizations setting forth the adverse effects of pending legislation on 
the environment, was not grassroots lobbying as none of the material 
contained direct appeals for people to contact Members of Congress. 
B-270875, July 5, 1996. 

Numerous additional examples may be found in our discussion of “pending 
legislation” appropriation restrictions later in this chapter, in 
section C.11.c. 

GAO found the following situations sufficiently questionable to warrant 
referral to Justice:113 

• An article written by a Commerce Department official and published in 
Business America, a Commerce Department publication, explicitly 
urging readers to contact their elected representatives in Congress to 
support certain amendments to the Export Administration Act. 
B-212235(1), Nov. 17, 1983. Under the Justice Department’s more recent 
interpretations of section 1913, this case would not have warranted 
referral since officials are free to publicly advance administration 
positions. 

• Campaign by Air Force and Defense Department to use contractors’ 
lobbyists and subcontractor network to lobby Congress in support of 
C-5B aircraft procurement. U.S. General Accounting Office, Improper 
Lobbying Activities by the Department of Defense on the Proposed 
Procurement of the C-5B Aircraft, GAO/AFMD-82-123 (Washington, 
D.C.: Sept. 29, 1982). 

113 A few early cases will be found in which GAO held expenditures illegal under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1913. E.g., B-139134-O.M., June 17, 1959 (Air Force paid registration fee for members to 
enter state rifle association shooting match; portion of fee set aside for fund to fight adverse 
gun legislation held to be an improper payment); B-76695, June 8, 1948.

As of early 1995, the Justice Department reported that there had been no 
prosecutions under section 1913.114 See Memorandum for the Attorney 
General and the Deputy Attorney General from Walter Dellinger, Assistant 
Attorney General, Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, Apr. 14, 
1995. To our knowledge, Justice initiated no prosecutions between 1995 
and 2002 when section 1913 was amended. 

As noted earlier, there has been no judicial activity under the amended 
version of 18 U.S.C. § 1913. The only judicial activity addressing the preamendment 
version was the issue of whether the statute created a private 
right of action. The answer was no. National Treasury Employees 
Union v. Campbell, 482 F. Supp. 1122 (D.D.C. 1980), aff’d, 654 F.2d 784 

(D.C. Cir. 1981), overruling National Association for Community 
Development v. Hodgson, 356 F. Supp. 1399 (D.D.C. 1973); Grassley v. 
Legal Services Corp., 535 F. Supp. 818 (S.D. Iowa 1982); American 
Trucking Assn’s, Inc. v. Department of Transportation, 492 F. Supp. 566 
(D.D.C. 1980). 
One other statute with penal sanctions deserves brief mention— the 
Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-65, 109 Stat. 691 (Dec. 19, 
1995), codified largely at 2 U.S.C. § 1601–1612. This statute does not apply 
to the legislative activities of government agencies, but rather to 
organizations that lobby certain federal officials in the legislative and 
executive branches. These organizations are required to register with the 
Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives and 
to semiannually report expenditures and certain other information related 
to their lobbying efforts. 2 U.S.C. § 1603(a) and § 1604.115 This statute 
repealed the 1946 Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, which GAO 
criticized for resulting in comparatively few lobbyists registering with 
Congress. See U.S. General Accounting Office, Federal Lobbying: 
Comments on the Adequacy of Federal Lobbying Laws, GAO/T-GGD-93-49 
(Washington, D.C.: Sept. 30, 1993). 

114 A conclusion by the Justice Department that section 1913 was violated would not have 
automatically resulted in a prosecution. The Attorney General has what is known as 
“prosecutorial discretion,” wherein a great many factors influence the decision whether to 
prosecute.

c. Appropriation Act 
Restrictions 
(1) Origin and general considerations 
In 1949, a House Resolution created a Select Committee on Lobbying 
Activities to review the operation of the Federal Regulation of Lobbying 
Act and to investigate all lobbying activities both by the private sector and 
by federal agencies. The Committee held extensive hearings and issued 
several reports. In its final report, the Committee had this to say about 
lobbying by government agencies: 

“The existing law in this field, unlike the law governing 
lobbying by private interests, is not directed toward 
obtaining information of such activities, but is prohibitory in 
concept and character. It forbids the use of appropriated 
funds for certain types of lobbying activities and is 
specifically a part of the Criminal Code. Enacted in 1919, it 
is not a recent or in any sense a novel piece of legislation. Its 
validity has never been challenged and we consider it sound 
law…. 

“It is our conclusion that the long-established criminal 
statute referred to above should be retained intact and that 
Congress, through the proper exercise of its powers to 
appropriate funds and to investigate conditions and 
practices of the executive branch, as well as through its 
financial watch dog, the General Accounting Office, can and 
should remain vigilant against any improper use of 
appropriated funds and any invasion of the legislative 
prerogatives and responsibilities of the Congress.”116 

When the Select Committee referred to the “proper exercise” of the 
congressional power to appropriate funds, it of course had in mind the use 
of that power to restrict the use of funds for activities considered 
undesirable. While the use of appropriation act restrictions to control 
lobbying had some earlier precedent, the practice began in earnest shortly 
after the issuance of the Select Committee’s final report with some fiscal 
year 1952 appropriations, and has continued ever since.

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

The most common form of appropriation act restriction prohibits the use of 
funds for “publicity or propaganda.” There are several variations of the 
provision, with varying degrees of specificity. As of 2003, in addition to two 
governmentwide publicity or propaganda restrictions, approximately half 
of the regular annual appropriation acts include some version. The simplest 
version of the statute, and the most general, is this: 

“No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be 
used for publicity or propaganda purposes not authorized 
by the Congress.”117 

It prohibits expenditures for all unauthorized publicity or propaganda. 
Unfortunately, as with most of the publicity and propaganda statutes over 
the years, there is no definition of either term. Thus, the statutes have been 
applied through administrative interpretation. 

In construing and applying a publicity or propaganda provision, it is 
necessary to achieve a delicate balance between competing interests. On 
the one hand, every agency has a legitimate interest in communicating with 
the public and with the Congress regarding its functions, policies, and 
activities. The Select Committee recognized this, quoting in its Interim 
Report from the report of the Hoover Commission: 

“Apart from his responsibility as spokesman, the 
department head has another obligation in a democracy: to 
keep the public informed about the activities of his agency. 
How far to go and what media to use in this effort present 
touchy issues of personal and administrative integrity. But 
of the basic obligation there can be little doubt.”118 

In addition, the courts have indicated that it is not illegal for government 
agencies to spend money to advocate their positions, even on controversial 
issues. See Joyner v. Whiting, 477 F.2d 456, 461 (4th Cir. 1973); Donaggio v. 
Arlington County, Virginia, 880 F. Supp. 446, 454–56 (E.D. 

117 E.g., Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies 
Appropriation Act, 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, div. B, § 601, 117 Stat. 11, 99 (Feb. 20, 2003).

Va. 1995); Arrington v. Taylor, 380 F. Supp. 1348, 1364 (M.D. N.C. 1974).119 

Yet on the other hand, the statute has to mean something. As the court said 
in National Association for Community Development v. Hodgson, 356 F. 
Supp. 1399 (D.D.C. 1973) in reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1913, “[o]bviously, 
Congress intended to remedy some problem or further some cause, 
otherwise they would not have bothered enacting the statute.” Id. at 1403. 
As long as the law exists, there has to be a point beyond which government 
action violates it. Testifying before the Select Committee on March 30, 
1950, former Assistant Comptroller General Frank Weitzel made the 
following remarks: 

“[I]f you set up an organization in the executive branch for 
the benefit of the three blind mice they would come up here 
with a budget program and prospectus which would 
convince any Member of Congress that that was one of the 
most important organizations in the executive branch…. 

“And no doubt by that time there would also be some 
private organizations with branches which would parallel 
your Federal agency, which would be devoted to the 
propagation and dissemination of information about the 
three blind mice….”120 

In evaluating whether a given action violates a publicity or propaganda 
provision, GAO will rely heavily on the agency’s administrative 
justification. In other words, the agency gets the benefit of any legitimate 
doubt. GAO will not accept the agency’s justification where it is clear that 
the action falls into one of a very few specific categories. Before discussing 
what those categories are, two threshold issues must be noted. 

First, it must be determined whether the agency in question is subject to a 
publicity or propaganda restriction. The existence and precise terms of the 
 


119 Further useful discussion may be found in cases dealing with different but conceptually 
related issues such as Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457 (1997), 
citing United States v. Frame, 885 F.2d 1119 (3rd Cir. 1989).

restriction can change over time. Therefore, it is always necessary to check 
the relevant appropriation acts for the year in which the questioned 
obligation or expenditure was made in order to determine what, if any, 
agency-specific or governmentwide restrictions exist. 

Second, a violation must be predicated on the use of public funds (either 
direct appropriations or funds which, although not direct appropriations, 
are treated as appropriated funds). If appropriated funds are not involved, 
there is no violation no matter how blatant the conduct may be. 56 Comp. 
Gen. 889 (1977) (involving a newsletter concerning the Clinch River 
Breeder Reactor Project containing material that would have been illegal 
had it been financed in any way with appropriated funds). 

(2) Self-aggrandizement 
As noted above, the broadest form of the publicity and propaganda 
restriction prohibits the use of appropriated funds “for publicity or 
propaganda purposes not authorized by the Congress.” A fiscal year 2003 
governmentwide variation limits the restriction to activities “within the 
United States.”121 

The Comptroller General first had occasion to construe this provision in 
31 Comp. Gen. 311 (1952). The National Labor Relations Board asked 
whether the activities of its Division of Information amounted to a 
violation. Reviewing the statute’s scant legislative history, the Comptroller 
General concluded that it was intended “to prevent publicity of a nature 
tending to emphasize the importance of the agency or activity in question.” 
Id. at 313. Therefore, the prohibition would not apply to the “dissemination 
to the general public, or to particular inquirers, of information reasonably 
necessary to the proper administration of the laws” for which an agency is 
responsible. Id. at 314. Based on this interpretation, GAO concluded that 
the activities of the Board’s Division of Information were not improper. The 
only thing GAO found that might be questionable, the decision noted, were 
certain press releases reporting speeches of members of the Board. 

Thus, 31 Comp. Gen. 311 established the important proposition that the 
statute does not prohibit an agency’s legitimate informational activities. See 
also B-284226.2, Aug. 17, 2000; B-223098, B-223098.2, Oct. 10, 1986;

div. J, § 626, 117 Stat. 11, 470 (Feb. 20, 2003).

obvious purpose is “self-aggrandizement” or “puffery.” 

GAO’s approach to this statute is basically the same as its approach to the 
other appropriation act lobbying restrictions to be discussed in detail later. 
The statute does not provide adequate guidelines to distinguish the 
legitimate from the proscribed. Thus, without further clarification from 
Congress or the courts, GAO is reluctant to find a violation where the 
agency can provide a reasonable justification for its activities. 

In a 1973 case, B-178528, July 27, 1973, the Republican National Committee 
financed a mass mailing of copies of editorials from British newspapers in 
praise of the President. The editorials were transmitted with a letter 
prepared by a member of the White House staff, on State Department 
letterhead stationery, and signed by the Ambassador to Great Britain. GAO 
again noted the extreme difficulty in distinguishing between disseminating 
information to explain or defend administration policies, which is 
permissible, and similar activities designed for purely political or partisan 
purposes. (See also B-194776, June 4, 1979.) In addition, a legitimate 
function of a foreign legation is to communicate information on press 
reaction in the host country to policies of the United States. Thus, GAO was 
unable to conclude that there was any violation of the publicity and 
propaganda law. In any event, the use of appropriated funds was limited to 
the cost of one piece of paper and the time it took the Ambassador to think 
about it and sign his name. 

Other cases in which GAO found no violation are B-284226.2, supra 
(Housing and Urban Development report “Losing Ground” and 
accompanying letter providing information to agency constituents about 
the impact of program reductions being proposed in Congress); B-212069, 
Oct. 6, 1983 (press release by Director of Office of Personnel Management 
excoriating certain Members of Congress who wanted to delay a civil 
service measure the administration supported); and B-161686, June 30, 
1967 (State Department publications on Vietnam War). In none of these 
cases were the documents designed to glorify the issuing agency or official. 

Similarly, GAO concluded that the Census Bureau did not violate this 
restriction when its employees participated in a symposium. The 

Page 4-200 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

symposium was to attract thousands of African-Americans, a population 
the Bureau characterized as “hard-to-count” and therefore targeted in its 
outreach activities. The Bureau’s participation in the symposium was 
limited to responding to questions about the census and giving away 
promotional items and was therefore legitimate informational activity, not 
puffery or self-aggrandizement. See U.S. General Accounting Office, Census 
Bureau Participation in Los Angeles Symposium, August 2000, GAO-01124R 
(Washington, D.C.: Oct. 24, 2000). 

GAO did find a violation in B-136762, Aug. 18, 1958. The Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Military Assistance Programs attended a meeting 
of the Aircraft Industries Association and made a speech “clearly designed 
to enlist the aid of the Aircraft Industries Association in publicizing and 
selling the Mutual Security program to the American public through the 
various media available to the Association.” Reviewing the text of the 
speech, GAO found that it went far beyond any legitimate purpose of 
informing the public and that it therefore violated the publicity and 
propaganda restriction. However, the officer had been authorized to attend 
the meeting as related to the performance of official duty and would have 
been entitled to per diem for the full day even if he had not made the 
speech. Therefore, since the government incurred no additional expense by 
virtue of the speech, GAO declined to seek recovery either from the officer 
himself or from the accountable officers who had made the payment. 

Some agencies have authority to disseminate material that is promotional 
rather than purely informational. For example, the Commerce Department 
is charged with promoting commerce. In so doing, it entered into a contract 
with the Advertising Council to undertake a national multimedia campaign 
to enhance public understanding of the American economic system. 
Finding that this was a reasonable means of implementing its function and 
that the campaign did not “aggrandize” the Commerce Department, GAO 
found nothing illegal. B-184648, Dec. 3, 1975. 

If an agency does not have promotional authority, the scope of its 
permissible activities is correspondingly more restricted. For example, 
GAO found the publicity and propaganda law violated when a presidential 
advisory committee, whose sole function was to advise the President and 
which had no promotional role, set up and implemented a public affairs 
program that included the hiring of a “publicity expert.” B-222758, June 25, 
1986.

See section C.11.f of this chapter for further discussion of agency 
promotional authorities and the employment of publicity experts. 

(3) Covert propaganda 
Another type of activity that GAO has construed as prohibited by the 
“publicity or propaganda not authorized by Congress” statute is “covert 
propaganda,” defined as “materials such as editorials or other articles 
prepared by an agency or its contractors at the behest of the agency and 
circulated as the ostensible position of parties outside the agency.” 
B-229257, June 10, 1988. A critical element of the violation is concealment 
of the agency’s role in sponsoring the material. Id. 

In a 1986 case, the Small Business Administration (SBA) prepared 
“suggested editorials” and distributed them to newspapers. The editorials 
urged support of an administration proposal to merge SBA with the 
Department of Commerce. The editorials were clearly “propaganda.” This, 
however, was not enough to violate the law. The problem was that they 
were misleading as to their origin. The plan presumably was for a 
newspaper to print the editorial as its own without identifying it as an SBA 
document. This, the Comptroller General concluded, went beyond the 
range of acceptable public information activities and therefore violated the 
publicity and propaganda law. B-223098, B-223098.2, Oct. 10, 1986. 

A similar holding is 66 Comp. Gen. 707 (1987), involving newspaper articles 
and editorials in support of Central American policy. The materials were 
prepared by paid consultants at government request, and published as the 
work of nongovernmental parties. The decision also found that media visits 
by Nicaraguan opposition leaders, arranged by government officials but 
with that fact concealed, constituted another form of “covert propaganda.” 
See also B-129874, Sept. 11, 1978 (“canned editorials” and sample letters to 
the editor in support of Consumer Protection Agency legislation, had they 
been prepared, would have violated the law). 

In B-229257, supra, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) prepared a 
variety of materials critical of the Postal Services “monopoly” on letter 
class mail, for distribution at a National Press Club breakfast that the 
Postmaster General was to attend. While the material was unquestionably 
propaganda, it did not violate the law because it identified the FTC as the 
source.

(4) Pending legislation: overview 
The version of the appropriations act restriction that the Comptroller 
General has had the most frequent occasion to apply is the version 
prohibiting publicity and propaganda designed to influence pending 
legislation. 

For over 30 years, from the early 1950s to fiscal year 1984, the following 
provision was enacted every year: 

“No part of any appropriation contained in this or any other 
Act …shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes 
designed to support or defeat legislation pending before 
Congress.”122 

As long as this version was in effect, it applied, by virtue of the “this or any 
other act” language, to all government agencies regardless of which 
appropriation act provided their funds. For fiscal year 1984, the “this or any 
other act” provision fell victim to a point of order and was dropped. See 
64 Comp. Gen. 281 (1985). For some time after that, no governmentwide 
provision existed. However, another change in course occurred and since 
fiscal year 1997,123 the following governmentwide “pending legislation” 
provision has been in place: 

“No part of any funds appropriated in this or any other Act 
shall be used by an agency of the executive branch, other 
than for normal and recognized executive-legislative 
relationships, for publicity or propaganda purposes, and for 
the preparation, distribution or use of any kit, pamphlet, 
booklet, publication, radio, television or film presentation 

122 E.g., Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1980, Pub. L. 
No. 96-74, § 607(a), 93 Stat. 559, 575 (Sept. 29, 1979). 

123 In fiscal year 1996 GAO investigated whether or not the activities of five agencies violated 
any anti-lobbying provisions and concluded that there were no violations, in part, because 
only one of the five agencies was covered by a restriction on influencing pending legislation. 
B-270875, July 5, 1996. A governmentwide restriction reappeared the next fiscal year. 

Page 4-203 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

designed to support or defeat legislation pending before the 
Congress, except in presentation to the Congress itself.”124 

Although the governmentwide provision currently in place is more detailed 
than the prior governmentwide restriction, we have concluded that the 
language currently used has the same legal effect. See B-270875, supra. 

During the time when there was no governmentwide restriction, 
restrictions aimed at curtailing the influencing of pending legislation 
appeared in individual appropriation acts in various forms. Many of these 
continue to appear in individual appropriation acts along with the 
governmentwide restriction.125 A sampling of fiscal year 2003 appropriation 
acts provisions provided below reveals a variety of versions, many of which 
do not include the terms publicity and propaganda: 

• “None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used in any way, 
directly or indirectly, to influence congressional action on any 
legislation or appropriation matters pending before the Congress.”126 

• “ …[No] part of this appropriation shall be used for publicity or 
propaganda purposes or implementation of any policy including 
boycott designed to support or defeat legislation pending before 
Congress or any State legislature.”127 

• “None of the funds in this Act shall …be used …to pay for any personal 
service, advertisement, telegraph …or other device, intended or 
designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress or of a State 
legislature to favor or oppose by vote or otherwise, any legislation or 

124 E.g., Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1997, Pub. L. 
No. 104-208, title VI, § 631, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-362 (Sept. 30, 1996). 

125 While it is understandable that individual agency situations may require unique language, 
in some instances the restrictions included in the individual appropriation acts are mere 
repetition. For example, in 2003 a restriction identical to the governmentwide restriction 
was also contained in the Veterans Affairs appropriations act. See Veterans Affairs and 
Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations, 2003, Pub. L. 
No. 108-7, div. K, title IV, § 414, 117 Stat. 11, 524 (Feb. 20, 2003). 

126 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-248, § 8012, 116 Stat. 
1519, 1539 (Oct. 23, 2002). 

127 District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, div. C, title III, § 107(a), 
117 Stat. 11, 122 (Feb. 20, 2003).

appropriation by Congress or a State legislature after the introduction 
of any bill or resolution in Congress proposing such legislation or 
appropriation, or after the introduction of any bill or resolution in a 
State legislature proposing such legislation or appropriation.”128 

• “No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be used, other 
than for normal and recognized executive-legislative relationships, for 
publicity or propaganda purposes, for the preparation, distribution, or 
use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, publication, radio, television, or video 
presentation designed to support or defeat legislation pending before 
the Congress or any State legislature, except in presentation to the 
Congress or any State legislature itself.”129 

If a given policy or activity is affected by pending or proposed legislation, 
any discussion of that policy or activity by officials will necessarily refer to 
such legislation, either explicitly or by implication, and will presumably be 
either in support of or in opposition to it. Thus, an interpretation of a 
pending legislation statute that strictly prohibited expenditures of public 
funds for dissemination of views on pending legislation would preclude 
virtually any comment by officials on agency or administration policy or 
activities. Absent a compelling indication of congressional intent, GAO has 
been unwilling to adopt this approach. See, e.g., B-270875, supra; U.S. 
General Accounting Office, Department Of Education: Compliance with 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act and Lobbying Restrictions, 

GAO/GGD/OGC-00-18 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 30, 1999). 

The Comptroller General has construed the “pending legislation” provisions 
as applying primarily to indirect or “grassroots” lobbying and not to direct 
contact with Members of Congress. In other words, the statute prohibits 
appeals to members of the public suggesting that they in turn contact their 
elected representatives to indicate support of or opposition to pending 
legislation, thereby expressly or implicitly urging the legislators to vote in a 
particular manner. GAO and the Justice Department have interpreted the 
traditional prohibition (“publicity or propaganda purposes designed to

support or defeat pending legislation”) to require an overt appeal to the 
public. B-270875, July 5, 1996. 

GAO concluded in a 1984 study that further statutory restraints on 
executive branch lobbying did not appear necessary. GAO did recommend, 
however, that the restriction on “grassroots” lobbying be enacted into 
permanent law. See U.S. General Accounting Office, No Strong Indication 
That Restrictions on Executive Branch Lobbying Should Be Expanded, 
GAO/GGD-84-46 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 20, 1984). See also U.S. General 
Accounting Office, H.R. 3078, The Federal Agency Anti-Lobbying Act, 
GAO/T-OGC-96-18 (Washington, D.C.: May 15, 1996); B-206391, B-217896, 
Oct. 30, 1985; B-206391, July 2, 1982. (Each of these documents comments 
on proposed legislation that was not enacted.) 

Before proceeding to the specific cases, certain threshold concerns should 
be noted. As noted earlier in the discussion of the simple publicity and 
propaganda restriction, the discussion that follows interprets the pending 
legislation provisions in existence at that time. The particular agencies 
involved may or may not still be subject to the same restriction. Or a 
different version of the restriction may apply that could produce different 
results. As we have noted, governmentwide restrictions have gone in and 
out of congressional favor. Therefore, it is critical to check the current 
appropriations acts to determine what restrictions are applicable. 

The appropriation act restrictions, unless specified to the contrary, require 
pending legislation. Of course, this would include appropriation acts and 
proposed presidential budgets. B-178648, Sept. 21, 1973. 

Finally, unless a particular provision specifically includes lobbying at the 
state level, the legislation must be pending before the U.S. Congress, not a 
state legislature. E.g., B-193545, Mar. 13, 1979; B-193545, Jan. 25, 1979. See 
also U.S. General Accounting Office, Highway Safety: NHTSA’s Activities

(5) Cases involving “grassroots” lobbying violations 
A bill was introduced in the 86th Congress to prohibit the Post Office 
Department from transporting first class mail by aircraft on a space-
available basis. The Post Office Department opposed the bill and embarked 
on a campaign to defeat it. Among the tactics used were letters to postal 
patrons and “canned” editorials asking the public to contact Members of 
Congress to urge opposition to the bill. GAO found that this activity 
violated the anti-lobbying statute. B-116331, May 29, 1961. 

Another violation resulted from the use of a kit entitled “Battle of the 
Budget 1973.” The White House at the time was opposed to 15 bills then 
pending in Congress that it felt would exceed the administration’s 1974 
budget. White House staff writers assembled a package of materials that 
were distributed to executive branch officials in an effort to defeat the bills. 
The kit included statements that people should be urged to write their 
representatives in Congress to support the administration’s opposition to 
the 15 bills. This, the Comptroller General held, violated the publicity and 
propaganda statute. B-178448, Apr. 30, 1973. 

Administration budget battles with Congress produced another violation in 
B-178648, Sept. 21, 1973. This case involved prerecorded news releases 
provided to radio stations by executive branch agencies. GAO reviewed 
over 1,000 of these releases and while most were proper, GAO found 
several that violated the law. Examples of the violations are as follows: 

• “If the President’s position of resisting higher taxes resulting from big 

spending is to be upheld, the people need to be heard. The voice of 

America can reach Capitol Hill and can be a positive persuader.” 

130 The report concluded that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
did not violate any anti-lobbying restrictions since the activities were directed at state 
governments, not Congress. Within a year after this report, however, Congress passed 
permanent legislation prohibiting the NHTSA from engaging in activity “specifically 
designed to urge a State or local Legislator to favor or oppose the adoption of any specific 
legislative proposal pending before any State or local legislative body.” See 49 U.S.C. 
§ 30105(a). See also Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations, 
2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, § 322, supra.

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

• “If we are going to have economic stability and fiscal responsibility, we 
must all support the President’s budget program—and let Congress 
know we support it.” 

The next two examples illustrate important points: 

• “If we don’t slow down Federal spending …we face a 15-percent 
increase in income taxes and more inflation. I don’t think any American 
wants this. But, in the final analysis the responsibility rests with the 
voters and the taxpayers. They must let the Congress know how they 
feel on this critical issue.” 

Here, the listener is urged merely to make his or her “views” known to 
Congress. This is nevertheless a violation if the context makes it clear, as in 
the example, what those “views” are supposed to be. 

• “All those unneeded new bills headed for the Presidents desk from 
Congress—all the unworthy Federal programs and projects—are guns 
pointed at the heads of American taxpayers…. Right now, Congress is 
getting all kinds of letters from special interest groups. Those groups 
are pleading their own selfish causes. I think Congress should hear 
from all Americans on what the President is trying to do whatever their 
views may be. And I say that regardless of whether those who contact 
their Congressmen happen to be in agreement with me.” 

The purported disclaimer in the last sentence does not cure the obvious 
violation. 

But see B-239856, Apr. 29, 1991, discussed further below, where the 
official’s disclaimer statement factored into our finding that the statements 
made did not constitute prohibited lobbying. Despite the fact that the 
official’s statement on its face was an exhortation for her audience to 
contact Members of Congress, we concluded that her comment was a good 
faith response to an audience members question and was more of a “civics 
lesson.” Furthermore, audience members recalled that the official made 
explicit “disclaimers” to the effect that she could not advise audience 
members to take particular actions in support of her agency. 

A clear violation occurred in B-128938, July 12, 1976. The Environmental 
Protection Agency, as part of an authorized public information program, 
contracted with a nonprofit organization to publish a newsletter in 
California entitled “Water Quality Awareness.” One of the articles discussed 

Page 4-208 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

a pending bill that environmentalists opposed. The article went on to name 
the California representatives on the House committee that was 
considering the bill and exhorted readers to “[c]ontact your representatives 
and make sure they are aware of your feelings concerning this important 
legislation.” As with some of the violations in B-178648, the context of the 
article left no doubt what those “feelings” were supposed to be. The fact 
that EPA did not publish the article directly did not matter since an agency 
has a duty to insure that its appropriations are not used to violate a 
statutory prohibition. See also B-202975(1), Nov. 3, 1981; U.S. General 
Accounting Office, Alleged Lobbying Activities: Office for Substance 
Abuse Prevention, GAO/HRD-93-100 (Washington, D.C.: May 4, 1993) 
(grantee violated statutory restriction by using grant funds to encourage 
grassroots lobbying).131 

In B-285298, May 22, 2000, the White House engaged in extensive outreach 
efforts to business, labor, environmental, and other groups in order to 
achieve enactment of legislation establishing permanent normal trade 
relations for China. After reviewing hundreds of documents we identified 
one e-mail communication that constituted grassroots lobbying. The e-mail, 
sent by an Agriculture employee serving on the interagency working group 
established by the White House, went to two major farmers’ organizations. 
The e-mail forwarded an attached message from a Commerce employee 
(also serving on the working group) reporting that a certain Member of the 
House of Representatives had not heard from any of the farmers in his 
district on the issue of trade with China. The forwarding e-mail stated: “We 
need to work on this ASAP. [The Member] needs to hear from the farmers 
in his district.” The fact that the House Member was already planning on 
supporting the legislation did not impact our conclusion that the e-mail on 
its face directly appealed to large farm organizations to contact a Member 
of Congress to support the legislation. 

Two other cases in which violations were found are B-212235(1), Nov. 17, 
1983, and U.S. General Accounting Office, Improper Lobbying Activities 
by the Department of Defense on the Proposed Procurement of the C-5B 
Aircraft, GAO/AFMD-82-123 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 29, 1982), both of 
which are summarized in our previous discussion of 18 U.S.C. § 1913.

activities, see section C.11.d of this chapter.

It is not necessary for a statement to explicitly refer to the particular piece 
of pending legislation. Thus, a lobbying campaign using appropriated funds 
urging the public to write to Members of Congress to support a strong 
merchant marine at a time when cargo preference legislation is pending 
violates the law. B-192746-O.M., Mar. 7, 1979. The fact that an article did not 
refer to specific pending legislation was, however, a factor in our 
determination that the agency did not engage in prohibited grass roots 
lobbying. GAO/HRD-93-100. 

(6) Pending legislation: cases in which no violation was found 
As indicated above, GAO has consistently taken the position that the 
pending legislation statute does not prohibit direct communication, 
solicited or unsolicited, between agency officials and Members of 
Congress. This is true even where the contact is an obvious attempt to 
influence legislation. Thus, GAO concluded that the pending legislation 
statute was not violated in the following cases: 

• Contacts with Members of Congress by federal judges and legislative 

liaison activities by the Judicial Conference of the United States. 

63 Comp. Gen. 624 (1984). 

• Visits to Members of Congress by National War College students as part 
of a seminar on the legislative process. B-209584, Jan. 11, 1983. 

• Director of the Office of Management and Budget’s letter to all 

Members of the House of Representatives urging opposition to a 

disapproval resolution on a Presidential Reorganization Plan. B-192658, 

Sept. 1, 1978.

proponents of the legislation); B-164786, Nov. 4, 1969 (cruises with 
Members of Congress on presidential yacht, paid for from entertainment 
appropriation); B-145883, Oct. 10, 1967 (unsolicited letter to Members of 
Congress from agency head urging support for continuation of agency 
programs); B-93353, Sept. 28, 1962 (telegram sent by agency head to all 
Members of Congress).

A government contractor lobbying with its own corporate (i.e., nonfederal) 
funds would generally not violate the appropriation act restriction. 
However, applicable contract cost principles may restrict or prohibit 
reimbursement. See, e.g., Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R. 
§ 31.205-22; B-218952, Aug. 21, 1985; U.S. General Accounting Office, 

Nuclear Test Lobbying: DOE Regulations for Contractors Need 

Reevaluation, GAO/RCED-88-25BR (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 9, 1987). In 
addition, there may be legislation applicable to contractor lobbying.132 

Also as indicated above, an agency will not violate the pending legislation 
statute by disseminating material to the public that is essentially expository 
in nature. Even if the material is promotional, there is no violation, at least 
of the pending legislation statute, as long as it is not a clear appeal to 
members of the public to contact their elected representatives.133 Again, 
several cases will illustrate. 

For example, the Department of Transportation (Transportation) set up 
displays on U.S. Capitol grounds of passenger cars equipped with passive 
restraint systems (airbags). Transportation employees at the displays 
distributed brochures, explained the devices, and answered questions from 
Members of Congress and the public. All this was done while legislation 
was pending to prohibit mandatory enforcement of the airbag standard. 
Considering the timing and location of the displays, one would have to be 
pretty stupid not to see this as an obvious lobbying ploy, that did not make 
it illegal since there was no evidence that Transportation urged members of 
the public to contact their elected representatives. Thus, since it was not 
illegal for Transportation to advocate the use of airbags or to communicate 
with Congress directly, there was no violation. B-139052, Apr. 29, 1980. The 
apparent intent alone is not enough; it must be translated into action. 

132 One of the previously cited pending legislation statutes—the Labor-Health & Human 
Services provision—has an additional sentence, not included in our quotation, barring the 
use of appropriated funds to pay the salary or expenses of any grant or contract recipient, or 
agent of such recipient, related to any activity designed to influence pending legislation. In 
addition, 31 U.S.C. § 1352, enacted in October 1989 and summarized later in our discussion 
of lobbying with grant funds, includes governmentwide restrictions on certain lobbying 
activities by contractors. 

133 The fact patterns of some of the examples that follow may have yielded violations of 
another restriction on legislative lobbying, had the provision applied. The next section will 
discuss this restriction, typically included in the Department of Interior appropriations act, 
which prohibits activity that falls short of an overt appeal to the public to contact Members 
of Congress.

and alcohol abuse material and to educate the public. OSAP included in the 
publication items submitted to it with the following disclaimer: 
“Publication of information and products does not imply endorsement by 
OSAP or the Federal Government.” One item that was submitted to and 
published by OSAP informed readers of an “activist’s guide” for 
communities developed by an organization that lobbied for legislation 
requiring warning labels on alcoholic beverages. While the item went on to 
describe the guide as helping people with writing to U.S. Senators to urge 
support of legislation, it did not make any reference to the specific 
legislation that was pending before Congress at the time, nor did it 
expressly endorse the idea of writing to Members of Congress in support of 
legislation. U.S. General Accounting Office, Alleged Lobbying Activities: 
Office for Substance Abuse Prevention, GAO/HRD-93-100 (Washington, 
D.C.: May 4, 1993). 

Similarly, the statute was not violated by the following actions: 

• Speech by Secretary of the Air Force urging defense contractors to 
direct their advertising toward convincing the public of the need for a 
strong defense rather than promoting particular weapon systems 
manufactured by their companies. Speech did not refer to legislation 
nor urge anyone to contact Congress. B-216239, Jan. 22, 1985. 

• Bumper stickers purchased by the Department of Transportation and 
affixed to government vehicles urging compliance with 55 mph speed 
limit. B-212252, July 15, 1983.

made speeches supporting the administration’s law enforcement policy.

• Statements by cabinet members, distributed to news media, which 
discussed pending legislation but were limited to an exposition of the 
administration’s views. B-178648, Dec. 27, 1973. 

• Mailings by the National Credit Union Administration to federally 
chartered credit unions consisting of reprints from the Congressional 
Record giving only one side of a controversial legislative issue.

(7) Pending legislation: Providing assistance to private lobbying groups 
Another type of “lobbying” activity GAO has found improper is the use of 
appropriated funds to provide assistance to private lobbying groups. This is 
largely an outgrowth of the concept that an agency should not be able to do 
indirectly that which it cannot do directly. 

In 1977, the Office of the Special Assistant to the President for Consumer 
Affairs and the Office of Consumer Affairs within the then Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) mounted an active campaign to 
obtain passage of legislation to establish a Consumer Protection Agency. As 
part of the campaign, the Special Assistant had instructed the Office of 
Consumer Affairs to informally clear its efforts with certain “public interest 
lobby members.” In addition, two of the consumer lobby groups asked HEW 

Page 4-213 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

to provide material illustrating situations where a Consumer Protection 
Agency could have had an impact had it been in existence. Before 
implementing the campaign, however, the Office of Consumer Affairs 
sought advice from the HEW General Counsel, who advised against certain 
elements of the plan, including the two items mentioned. 

Since, pursuant to the HEW General Counsel’s advice, the more egregious 
elements of the plan were not carried out, the Comptroller General 
concluded that no laws were violated. However, the Comptroller General 
pointed out that the publicity and propaganda statute would prohibit the 
use of appropriated funds to develop propaganda material to be given to 
private lobbying organizations to be used in their efforts to lobby Congress. 
An important distinction must be made. There would be nothing wrong 
with servicing requests for information from outside groups, lobbyists 
included, by providing such items as stock education materials or position 
papers from agency files, since this material would presumably be available 
in any event under the Freedom of Information Act. The improper use of 
appropriated funds arises when an agency assigns personnel or otherwise 
provides administrative support to prepare material not otherwise in 
existence to be given to a private lobbying organization. B-129874, Sept. 11, 
1978. See also 66 Comp. Gen. 707, 712 (1987), drawing the same distinction 
in the context of 18 U.S.C. § 1913. 

In another example, the Maritime Administration (“MarAd”) had become 
intimately involved with the National Maritime Council, a trade association 
of ship operators and builders. MarAd staff performed the administrative 
functions of the Council at MarAd headquarters and regional offices. In 
1977, at a time when cargo preference legislation was pending in Congress, 
the Council, with MarAd’s active assistance, undertook an extensive 
advertising campaign in national magazines and on television advocating a 
strong U.S. merchant marine. Some of the advertisements encouraged 
members of the public to contact their elected representatives to urge them 
to support a strong merchant fleet. Reviewing the situation, GAO 
concluded that MarAd had violated the publicity and propaganda statute by 
expending appropriated funds to provide administrative support to the 
Council in the form of staff time, supplies, and facilities, when it knew the 
Council was attempting to influence legislation pending before Congress. 
See B-192746O.M., Mar. 7, 1979; U.S. General Accounting Office, The 
Maritime Administration And The National Maritime Council—Was 
Their Relationship Appropriate? CED-79-91 (Washington, D.C.: May 18, 
1979).

In B-133332, Mar. 28, 1977, the Smithsonian Institution had prepared an 
exhibit entitled “The Tallgrass Prairie: An American Landscape” and 
displayed it at a premiere showing for the benefit of the Tallgrass Prairie 
Foundation, a nonprofit organization. While appropriated funds were used 
to prepare the exhibit, none were used for the premiere showing itself 
since, under the Smithsonian’s traveling exhibit program, administrative 
costs are paid by the host organization. The problem arose because the 
Tallgrass Prairie Foundation shared a large part of its membership with a 
lobbying organization known as “Save the Tallgrass Prairie, Inc.” (There is 
no cause that does not have its lobbyists.) In addition, a leading member of 
both organizations had actually created the exhibit under contract with the 
Smithsonian. However, the exhibit itself was noncontroversial and the 
Foundation had an independent legal existence. Thus, since no lobbying 
took place at the premiere showing, and since any lobbying by “Save the 
Tallgrass” or by the exhibits creator could not be imputed to the 
Foundation or to the Smithsonian, GAO concluded that the Smithsonian 
had not used its appropriations for any improper indirect lobbying.134 

(8) Promotion of legislative proposals: Prohibited activity short of grass 
roots lobbying 
Since 1977, the following restriction has been included in every Interior 
Department appropriations act: 

“No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be 
available for any activity or the publication or distribution of 
literature that in any way tends to promote public support 
or opposition to any legislative proposal on which 
congressional action is not complete.”135 

134 See also U.S. General Accounting Office, Department Of Education: Compliance With 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act and Lobbying Restrictions, GAO/GGD/OGC-00-18 
(Washington, D.C.: Dec. 23, 1999), for a discussion of another instance in which GAO found 
no evidence that an agency was involved in providing improper assistance to lobbying 
groups. 

135 Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations, 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, 
div. F, title III, § 302, 117 Stat. 11, 270 (Feb. 20, 2003). Originally the provision concluded 
with the phrase “in accordance with the Act of June 25, 1948 (18 U.S.C. § 1913).” While this 
language was eventually eliminated, GAO concluded that its deletion had no effect on the 
interpretation of the restriction. B-262234, Dec. 21, 1995.

The Committee report accompanying what ultimately became the Interior 
restriction explained the Committee’s concern over “certain public 
information activities being promoted by [some agencies] that tend to 
promote pending legislative proposals to set aside certain areas in Alaska 
for national parks, wildlife refuges, national forest and other withdrawals.” 
The Committee referred to the colorful brochures printed and actively 
distributed by these agencies, extolling the benefits of such proposals, 
which as a result tended to promote certain legislative goals of these 
agencies. The Committee considered these activities to be, at a minimum, 
violations of the intent of 18 U.S.C. § 1913. At the same time the Committee 
cautioned that the language “should not be construed as an impediment on 
the agencies ability to respond to public information inquiries.”136 

The Interior restriction has been interpreted to prohibit both grassroots 
lobbying activity, proscribed by both 18 U.S.C. § 1913 and the pending 
legislation restriction, and activity that falls short of such activity. In 
describing the prohibited activity as that which “in any way tends to 
promote public support or opposition (emphasis added)” to legislation, the 
restriction is designed to cover particularly egregious examples of lobbying 
even though the material or activity stops short of explicitly soliciting a 
member of the public to contact his or her member of Congress in support 
or opposition of pending legislation. See 59 Comp. Gen. 115 (1979); 
B-284226.2, Aug. 17, 2000. 

We have found a number of instances where agencies covered by the 
Interior provision avoided grassroots lobbying but went beyond 
appropriate information dissemination and violated the Interior restriction: 

• A mass mailing by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) of an 

information package supporting the Livable Cities Program implicitly 

advocated support of the appropriation for that NEA program. 

Although the literature did not directly exhort readers to lobby 

Congress, its tenor was clearly designed to promote public support for 

the program and the mailing was timed to reach the public just before 

House reconsideration of a prior refusal to fund the program. 59 Comp. 

Gen. 115 (1979). 

• Remarks made by a Fish and Wildlife Service employee at a press 
conference called to generate opposition to a pending amendment to 

136 S. Rep. No. 95-276, at 4–5 (1977). 

Page 4-216 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

the Clean Water Act and timed to coincide with the congressional 
committee’s active consideration, tended to promote public opposition 
to the legislative proposal. While the official did not urge members of 
the public to contact their Members of Congress, he stated, “we cannot 
afford to roll back protection” for wetlands, which he believed the 
legislation would do. B-262234, Dec. 21, 1995. 

• Forest Service officials waged an aggressive campaign to promote 
public support for a budget proposal seeking to change the way certain 
Forest Service payments to states are calculated. Briefing packages, 
used by officials in talking to local public officials likely to be 
concerned about funding, were highly supportive of the proposal, 
emphasizing the benefits of re-forming Forest Service payments to 
states. Based on the response of some local officials, who indicated 
they would contact their congressional representatives, the briefing 
efforts were clearly 

• successful at promoting support for the payment proposal. B-281637, 
May 14, 1999.137 

In analyzing whether a violation has occurred, a variety of factors must be 
considered, including the timing, setting, audience, content, and the 
reasonably anticipated effect of the questioned activity. See U.S. General 
Accounting Office, H.R. 3078, The Federal Agency Anti-Lobbying Act, 
GAO/T-OGC-96-18 (May 15, 1996).138 

Intent can also be an important factor to consider when presented with a 
particularly close case. As we have noted, “there is a very thin line between 
the provision of legitimate information in response to public inquiries and 
the provision of information in response to the same requests which tends 
to promote public support or opposition to pending legislative proposals.” 
59 Comp. Gen. 115 (1979). Navigating this thin line may be difficult for 
agencies, which cannot always prevent or even anticipate public response. 

In B-239856, Apr. 29, 1991, GAO relied on the demonstrated intent of the 
National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) officials engaging in the 
questioned activities, in concluding that the agency had not violated the 

137 See also U.S. General Accounting Office, Alleged Unauthorized Use of Appropriated 
Moneys by Interior Employees, CED-80-128 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 13, 1980). 

138 This testimony concerned proposed governmentwide legislation modeled on the Interior 
restriction. The proposed legislation did not pass.

Interior restriction. One aspect of this decision involved an NEA official’s 
remarks at an arts conference. In response to a question from the audience 
concerning what the audience could do to support NEA, the official 
responded that they could contact their congressional representatives. 
GAO’s investigation concluded that there was no intent to promote. The 
official’s response was incidental to her presentation and not part of any 
plan to generate action on the part of her audience. The official’s answer 
was viewed as more of a civics lesson, informational in nature, rather than 
an exhortation to contact Congress. 

(9) Dissemination of political or misleading information 
Generally speaking, funds appropriated to carry out a particular program 
would not be available for political purposes, that is, for a propaganda 
effort designed to aid a political party or candidate. See B-147578, Nov. 8, 
1962. If for no other reason, such an expenditure would be improper as a 
use of funds for other than their intended purpose in violation of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1301(a). However, the publicity and propaganda statute does not provide 
adequate guidelines to distinguish between legitimate and purely political 
activities and is therefore applicable to “political” activities only to the 
extent that the activities would otherwise constitute a violation. See 

B-130961, Oct. 26, 1972. 

In more general terms, it is always difficult to find that conduct is so purely 
political as to constitute a purpose violation. As stated in B-144323, Nov. 4, 
1960: 

“[The question is] whether in any particular case a speech or 
a release by a cabinet officer can be said to be so completely 
devoid of any connection with official functions or so 
political in nature that it is not in furtherance of the purpose 
for which Government funds were appropriated, thereby 
making the use of such funds …unauthorized. This is 
extremely difficult to determine in most cases as the lines 
separating the nonpolitical from the political cannot be 
precisely drawn. 

“…As a practical matter, even if we were to conclude that 
the use of appropriated funds for any given speech or its 
release was unauthorized, the amount involved would be 
small, and difficult to ascertain; and the results of any 
corrective action might well be more technical than real.”

Apart from considerations of whether any particular law has been violated, 
GAO has taken the position that the government should not disseminate 
misleading information. On occasion, the Comptroller General has 
characterized publications as propaganda and attacked them from an audit 
perspective. 

In 1976, the former Energy Research and Development Administration 
(ERDA) published a pamphlet entitled “Shedding Light On Facts About 
Nuclear Energy.” Ostensibly created as part of an employee motivational 
program, ERDA printed copies of the pamphlet far in excess of any 
legitimate program needs, and inundated the state of California with them 
in the months preceding a nuclear safeguards initiative vote in that state. 
The pamphlet had a strong pro-nuclear bias and urged the reader to “Let 
your voice be heard.” On the legal side, the pamphlet did not violate any 
anti-lobbying statute because applicable restrictions did not extend to 
lobbying at the state level. B-130961-O.M., Sept. 10, 1976. However, GAO’s 
review of the pamphlet found it to be oversimplified and misleading. GAO 
characterized it as propaganda not suitable for distribution to anyone, 
employees or otherwise, and recommended that ERDA cease further 
distribution and recover and destroy any undistributed copies. See U.S. 
General Accounting Office, Evaluation Of the Publication and 
Distribution Of “Shedding Light On Facts About Nuclear Energy,” 

EMD-76-12 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 30, 1976). 

In a later report, GAO reviewed a number of publications related to the 
Clinch River Breeder Reactor Project, a cooperative government/industry 
demonstration project, and found several of them to be oversimplified and 
distorted propaganda, and as such questionable for distribution to the 
public. However, the publications were produced by the private sector 
components of the Project and paid for with utility industry contributions 
and not with federal funds. While GAO was thus powerless to recommend 
termination of the offending publications, it nevertheless recommended 
that the Department of Energy work with the private sector components in 
an effort to eliminate this kind of material, or at the very least insure that 
such publications include a prominently displayed disclaimer statement 
making it clear that the material was not government approved. U.S. 
General Accounting Office, Problems With Publications Related To The 
Clinch River Breeder Reactor Project, EMD-77-74 (Washington, D.C.: 
Jan. 6, 1978). 

d. Lobbying with Grant Funds The use of grant funds by a federal grantee for lobbying presents somewhat 
more complicated issues. On the one hand, there is the principle, noted in 
Page 4-219 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

various contexts throughout this publication, that an agency should not be 
able to do indirectly what it cannot do directly. Thus, if an agency cannot 
make a direct expenditure of appropriated funds for certain types of 
lobbying, it should not be able to circumvent this restriction by the simple 
device of passing the funds through to a grantee. Yet on the other hand, 
there is the seemingly countervailing rule that where a grant is made for an 
authorized grant purpose, grant funds in the hands of the grantee largely 
lose their identity as federal funds and are no longer subject to many of the 
restrictions on the direct expenditure of appropriations. See B-289801, 
Dec. 30, 2002 (holding that when the Department of Education makes grant 
awards during the period of availability of the funds to be used, Education’s 
grant awards are in compliance with the bona fide needs rule even when 
appropriations available for only one fiscal year are used to fund multiyear 
grants). 

In some instances, Congress has dealt with the problem by legislation. For 
example, legislation, commonly known as the Byrd Amendment and 
codified at 31 U.S.C. § 1352, imposes limited governmentwide restrictions. 
Subsection 1352(a)(1) provides: 

“None of the funds appropriated by any Act may be 
expended by the recipient of a Federal contract, grant, loan, 
or cooperative agreement to pay any person for influencing 
or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any 
agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of 
Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in 
connection with any Federal action described in paragraph 

(2) of this subsection.” 
The actions identified in paragraph (2) are the awarding of any federal 
contract; the making of any federal grant or loan; the entering into of any 
cooperative agreement; and the extension, continuation, renewal, 
amendment, or modification of any federal contract, grant, loan, or 
cooperative agreement. The law includes detailed disclosure requirements 
and civil penalties. Subsection (d)(1)(C) stresses that section 1352 should 
not be construed as permitting any expenditure prohibited by any other 
provision of law. Thus, section 1352 supplements other anti-lobbying 
statutes; it does not supersede them. 

Subsection (b)(6) of 31 U.S.C. § 1352 directs the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) to issue guidance for agency implementation. OMB 
published interim final guidance entitled “Governmentwide Guidance for 

Page 4-220 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

New Restrictions on Lobbying” on December 20, 1989 (54 Fed. Reg. 52306), 
supplemented on June 15, 1990 (55 Fed. Reg. 24540), and amended on 
January 15, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 1772) and January 19, 1996 (61 Fed. Reg. 
1412). An interim final rule for grants was issued jointly by OMB and 29 
grantor agencies as a common rule on February 26, 1990 (55 Fed. Reg. 
6736). For contracts, see subpart 3.8 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulations. 

GAO has addressed the application of the Byrd Amendment to federal 
contractors in the context of bid protests but has not had occasion to apply 
it to federal grant recipients. See 71 Comp. Gen. 281 (1992) 
(communication between bidder’s “regularly employed” employee and 
government engineer was not an attempt to influence procuring agency in 
connection with a federal contract and therefore did not violate the Byrd 
Amendment); 71 Comp. Gen. 81 (1991) (Byrd Amendment does not require 
disclosure of reasonable compensation to regularly employed employees); 
69 Comp. Gen. 604 (1990) (contractor lobbying activity was not directed at 
award of current contract and therefore was not required to be disclosed 
under the Byrd Amendment); B-246304.8 and B-246304.9, May 4, 1993 
(bidder’s lobbying to have legislation changed, regardless of how funded, 
did not violate the Byrd Amendment). 

More recently, the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995,139 as amended, 2 U.S.C. 
§§ 1601 et seq., provides that organizations described in section 
501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code140 which engage in lobbying 
activities are not eligible to receive federal grants. 2 U.S.C. § 1611. The Act, 
at 2 U.S.C. § 1602(7), defines “lobbying activities” to mean: 

“[L]obbying contacts and efforts in support of such 
contacts, including preparation and planning activities, 
research and other background work that is intended, at the 
time it is performed, for use in contacts, and coordination 
with the lobbying activities of others.” 

The Act, at 2 U.S.C. § 1602(8), further defines “lobbying contact” to mean 
communications with covered federal officials. As such, the Act does not

prevent “grassroots” lobbying activities by federal grants recipients as that 
term is discussed earlier in this chapter in section C.11.c.141 

Another example is the legislation governing the Legal Services 
Corporation. Under the Legal Services Corporation Act, recipients of funds, 
both contractors and grantees, may not use the funds directly or indirectly 
to attempt to influence the passage or defeat of legislation. The prohibition 
covers legislation at the state and local level as well as federal legislation. 
The statute permits three exceptions: (1) recipients may testify before and 
otherwise communicate with legislative bodies upon request, (2) they may 
initiate contact with legislative bodies to express the views of the 
Corporation on legislation directly affecting the Corporation, and (3) they 
may engage in certain otherwise prohibited lobbying activities when 
necessary to the proper representation of an eligible client. 42 U.S.C. 
§ 2996f(a)(5).142 For a general discussion of these provisions, see 
B-129874-O.M., Oct. 30, 1978. See also B-202569, Apr. 27, 1981; Regional 
Management Corp. v. Legal Services Corp., 186 F.3d 457 (4th Cir. 1999) 
(generally discussing 42 U.S.C. § 2996f(a)(5) as part of finding that there is 
no private right of action to challenge the Legal Services Corporation’s 
decision that its grantee did not violate anti-lobbying provision). 

Three 1981 cases illustrate the application of the Legal Services 
Corporation statute. In one case, the Board of Aldermen for the City of 
Nashua, New Hampshire, was considering a resolution to authorize a “food 
stamp workfare” demonstration project. An attorney employed by the New 
Hampshire Legal Assistance group, a Legal Services Corporation grantee, 
wrote to members of the Board urging them to reject the resolution. Since 
the letter was not related to the representation of any specific client or 
group of clients but rather had been self-initiated by the attorney, the use of 
federal funds to prepare and distribute the letter was illegal. B-201928, 
Mar. 5, 1981. 

141 See also U.S. General Accounting Office, Federal Lobbying: Differences in Lobbying 
Definitions and Their Impact, GAO/GGD-99-38 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 15, 1999) for 
further discussion of the Act. 

142 Similar provisions, found in 42 U.S.C. § 2996e(c), apply to the Corporation itself. An 
illustrative case is B-231210, June 7, 1988, aff’d upon reconsideration, B-231210, June 4, 
1990, holding that the Corporation is not authorized to retain a private law firm to lobby 
Congress on its behalf.

In the second case, 60 Comp. Gen. 423 (1981), the Corporation and its 
grantees conducted a lobbying campaign to drum up support for the 
Corporation’s reauthorization and appropriation legislation. The 
Corporation argued that the actions were permissible under the exception 
authorizing contact with legislative bodies on legislation directly affecting 
the Corporation. While recognizing that the statute permitted direct self-
initiated contact in these circumstances, GAO reviewed the legislative 
history and concluded that the exception did not permit grassroots 
lobbying either by the Corporation itself or by its grantees. 

In the third case, the Managing Attorney of a Legal Services Corporation 
(LSC) grantee made a mass mailing of a form letter to local attorneys. The 
letter solicited their support for continuation of the LSC program and urged 
them to contact a local Congressman opposed to reauthorization of the 
LSC to try to persuade him to change his vote. This too constituted 
impermissible grassroots lobbying. B-202787, Dec. 29, 1981.143 

GAO also found the statute was violated when a grantee used LSC grant 
funds to oppose the confirmation of Judge Robert Bork to the United States 
Supreme Court. The finding was based largely on LSC regulations that 
broadly define “legislation” to include action on appointments. B-230743, 
June 29, 1990. 

Another provision in the LSC enabling legislation prohibits both the 
Corporation and its grantees from contributing or making available 
“corporate funds or program personnel or equipment for use in advocating 
or opposing any ballot measures, initiatives, or referendums.” 42 U.S.C. 
§ 2996e(d)(4). The Corporation and one of its grantees violated this one by 
providing funds and personnel for a campaign to defeat a ballot measure in 
California. 62 Comp. Gen. 654 (1983). 

In addition to the LSC’s enabling legislation, appropriation acts providing 
funds for the Corporation also include restrictions. Beginning in 1978, the 
Corporation’s appropriations contained a restriction that prohibited the use 
of Corporation funds for publicity or propaganda designed to support or 
defeat legislation pending before Congress or any state legislature. While 
serving largely to reemphasize the prohibitions contained in the 
Corporation’s enabling legislation, the restriction made it clear that the 

143 Government lobbying has a tendency to adjust to changes in the political climate. A 1988 
case, B-231210, June 7, 1988, found the LSC lobbying to reduce its appropriations.

exception for the proper representation of eligible clients did not extend to 
grass roots lobbying. See 60 Comp. Gen. 423 (1981); B-163762, Nov. 24, 
1980. 

Since 1996 the LSC’s appropriations have gone beyond restricting grantee 
use of federal funds for lobbying activities to a broader prohibition of the 
Corporation’s providing funds to any grantee “that attempts to influence 
the passage or defeat of any legislation, constitutional amendment, 

referendum, initiative, or any similar procedure of the Congress or a State 
or local legislative body.”144 

In 2001, the Supreme Court struck down a restriction contained in the 
Corporation’s 1996 appropriation on the use of the Corporation’s funds for 
lobbying purposes. Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001). 
The Court found that provisions, which sought to restrict efforts toward 
welfare reform, were unconstitutional. See also Legal Aid Society of 
Hawaii v. Legal Services Corp., 145 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 
525 U.S. 1015 (1998) for additional background on appropriation act 
restrictions. 

Still another example of legislation expressly applicable to grantees is 
discussed in B-202787(1), (May 1, 1981). The appropriation act providing 
funds for the Community Services Administration (CSA) contained a 
provision which prohibited the use of funds “to pay the salary or expenses 
of any grant or contract recipient …to engage in any activity designed to 
influence legislation or appropriations pending before the Congress.” GAO 
found this provision violated when a local community action agency used 
grant funds for a mass mailing of a letter to members of the public urging 
them to write to their Congressmen to oppose abolition of the agency. In 
addition, CSA had issued a regulation purporting to exempt CSA grantees 
from the appropriation act restriction. Finding that CSA had exceeded its 
authority, the Comptroller General recommended that CSA rescind its 

144 Ascertaining applicable lobbying restrictions often requires a certain level of patience. 
The Corporation’s 2003 appropriation refers back to the restriction contained in its 1996 
appropriation by prohibiting the use of funds “for any purpose prohibited or limited by, or 
contrary to any of the provisions of, sections 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, and 506 of Public Law 
105-119 . . .” Pub. L. No. 108-7,117 Stat. 11, 96, 97 (Feb. 20, 2003); Pub. L. No. 105-119, 
111 Stat. 2440, 2510 (Nov. 26, 1997). Public Law 105-119 contains the Corporation’s 1998 
appropriation, which itself refers back to the Corporation’s 1996 appropriation, contained in 
the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-134, 
§ 504(a)(4), 110 Stat. 1321, 1321-53 (Apr. 26, 1996).

ruling. The Justice Department also found the CSA regulations invalid, 
construing the statute as constituting “an unqualified prohibition against 
lobbying by federal grantees” and not merely a restriction on grassroots 
lobbying. 5 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 180 (1981). 

The provision discussed in the preceding paragraph was also violated when 
a university, using grant funds received from the Department of Education, 
encouraged students to write to Members of Congress to urge their 
opposition to proposed cuts in student financial aid programs. U.S. General 
Accounting Office, Improper Use of Federal Student Aid Funds for 
Lobbying Activities, GAO/HRD-82-108 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 13, 1982). 

An almost identical, subsequent provision was violated when a grantee of 
the Office of Substance Abuse Prevention used grant funds to host a 
conference used as a forum for grassroots lobbying. Another grantee did 
not violate the provision, however, because its lobbying efforts related to a 
state legislature matter. U.S. General Accounting Office, Alleged Lobbying 
Activities: Office for Substance Abuse Prevention, GAO/HRD-93-100 
(Washington, D.C.: May 4, 1993). The fiscal year 2003 Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies appropriation act 
contains a version of this restriction, which has been expanded to prohibit 
such lobbying activities at the state level. Pub. L. No. 108-7, § 503(b), 
117 Stat. 11, 343 (Feb. 20, 2003). 

The question of lobbying with grant funds becomes more difficult when the 
situation is not covered by statute and applicable appropriation act 
restrictions do not expressly cover grantees. Until late in 1981, the question 
of whether appropriation act restrictions, silent as to grantees, applied to 
grantee expenditures had not been definitively addressed in a decision of 
the Comptroller General. An early case held that telegrams to Members of 
Congress by state agencies funded by Labor Department grants constituted 
an improper use of federal funds where they were clearly designed to 
influence pending legislation. B-76695, June 8, 1948. This case pre-dated 
appropriation act restrictions and was decided under 18 U.S.C. § 1913.145 
The concept of applying the prohibition to grantee expenditures would 
arguably be the same under the appropriation act restrictions. In a 1977 

145 While 18 U.S.C. § 1913 has been regarded as applicable only to officers and employees of 
the federal government and not to contractors or grant recipients, this interpretation has not 
been challenged since the statute was amended in 2002 by Pub. L. No. 107-273, § 205(b), 
116 Stat. 1758, 1778 (Nov. 2, 2002). See B-214455, Oct. 24, 1984 (citing a May 24, 1983, letter 
to GAO from the Justice Department’s Criminal Division).

letter, GAO noted the principle that funds in the hands of a grantee largely 
lose their identity as federal funds and said that the applicability of the 
publicity and propaganda statute was therefore “questionable.” B-158371, 
Nov. 11, 1977 (nondecision letter). A 1978 letter to a Member of the Senate 
said that the issue should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. B-129874, 
Aug. 15, 1978. 

In B-128938, July 12, 1976, GAO said that an agency has a responsibility to 
insure that its appropriations are not used to violate the anti-lobbying 
statute. While the case involved expenditures by a contractor, the principle 
would seemingly apply as well to a grantee. 

Finally, in B-202975(1), Nov. 3, 1981, the Comptroller General resolved the 
uncertainty, applied the concept of B-128938, and concluded that: 

“Federal agencies and departments are responsible for 
insuring that Federal funds made available to grantees are 
not used contrary to [the publicity and propaganda] 
restriction.” 

The case involved the Los Angeles Downtown People Mover Authority, a 
grantee of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), 
Department of Transportation. Fearing that its funding was in jeopardy, the 
Authority prepared and distributed a newsletter urging readers to write to 
their elected representatives in Congress to support continued funding for 
the People Mover project. The Comptroller General found that this 
newsletter, to the extent it involved UMTA grant funds, violated the anti-
lobbying statute. 

Similarly, in 1996, GAO determined that the state of Nevada improperly 
used grant funds in violation of a broad provision found in the annual 
Energy and Water Development appropriation acts prohibiting the use of 
federal funds to influence legislation and other lobbying activities.146 See 

U.S.General Accounting Office, Nuclear Waste: Nevada’s Use of Nuclear 
Waste Grant Funds, GAO/RCED-96-72 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 20, 1996). 
146 “[N]one of the funds herein appropriated may be used directly or indirectly to influence 
legislative action on any matter pending before Congress or a State legislature or for any 
lobbying activity as provided in section 1913 of title 18, United States Code.” Energy and 
Water Development Appropriations Act, 1995, Pub. L. No. 103-316, 108 Stat. 1707, 1716 
(Aug. 26, 1994). 

Page 4-226 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


e. Informational Activities 
Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

GAO concluded that the production of a videotape advancing the state’s 
opposition to a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain was an indirect 
attempt to influence a matter pending before Congress. 

In our preceding discussion of lobbying by government agencies, we noted 
that appropriation act restrictions may be limited to lobbying the United 
States Congress or may also apply to lobbying at the state and local level 
where expressly provided. The same principle applies with respect to 
lobbying with grant funds. B-214455, Oct. 24, 1984; B-206466, Sept. 13, 1982. 

As we have noted previously, a government agency has a legitimate interest 
in informing the public about its programs and activities. Just how far it can 
go depends on the nature of its statutory authority. Certainly there is no 
need for statutory authority for an agency to issue a press release 
describing a recent speech by the agency head, or for the agency head or 
some other official to participate in a radio, television, or magazine 
interview. Activities of this type are limited only by applicable restrictions 
on the use of public funds such as the anti-lobbying statutes previously 
discussed. 

A 1983 decision illustrates another form of information dissemination that 
is permissible without the need for specific statutory support. Military 
chaplains are required to hold religious services for the commands to 
which they are assigned. 10 U.S.C. § 3547. Publicizing such information as 
the schedule of services and the names and telephone numbers of 
installation chaplains is an appropriate extension of this duty. Thus, GAO 
advised the Army that it could procure and distribute calendars on which 
this information was printed. 62 Comp. Gen. 566 (1983). Applying a similar 
rationale, the decision also held that information on the Community 
Services program, which provides various social services for military 
personnel and their families, could be included. See also B-290900, Mar. 18, 
2003 (approving the Bureau of Land Management’s use of appropriated 
funds to pay its share of the costs of disseminating information under a 
cooperative agreement); B-280440, Feb. 26, 1999 (allowing the Border 
Patrol’s use of appropriated funds to purchase uniform medals that, in part, 
served to advance “knowledge and appreciation for the agency’s history 
and mission”). 

Some agencies have specific authority to disseminate information. Such 
authority will permit a broader range of activities and gives the agency 
 


Page 4-227 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

discretion to choose the appropriate means, the selection being governed 
by the necessary expense doctrine. 

The agency may use common devices such as buttons or magnets (e.g., 
72 Comp. Gen. 73 (1992)), newsletters (e.g., B-128938, July 12, 1976) or 
conferences or seminars (e.g., B-166506, July 15, 1975). In one case, the 
Comptroller General approved a much less conventional means. Shortly 
after World War II, the Labor Department wanted to publicize its 
employment services for veterans. It did this by discharging balloons from 
a float in a parade. Attached to the balloons were mimeographed messages 
asking employers to list their available jobs. Since the Department was 
charged by statute with publishing information on the program, the cost of 
the balloons was permissible. B-62501, Jan. 7, 1947. Other pertinent cases 
are 32 Comp. Gen. 487 (1953) (publication of Public Health Service 
research reports in scientific journals); 32 Comp. Gen. 360 (1953) (the 
recording of Office of Price Stabilization forum discussions to be used at 
similar meetings in other regions); B-89294, Aug. 6, 1963 (use of motion 
picture by United States Information Agency); B-15278, May 15, 1942 
(photographs); A-82749, Jan. 7, 1937 (radio broadcasts). 

Conversely, in 18 Comp. Gen. 978 (1939), radio broadcasts by the Veterans 
Administration were held to violate 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) because the agency 
did not have statutory authority to disseminate information about its 
activities. However, in 1958, Congress gave the then-named Veterans 
Administration the authority to “provide for the preparation, shipment, 
installation, and display of exhibits, photographic displays, moving 
pictures, and other visual educational information and descriptive 
material.”147 The Comptroller General found that this authority, now 
codified in 38 U.S.C. § 703(d), permitted the Department of Veterans Affairs 
to use its medical care appropriation for the rental of booth space at the 
Oklahoma State Fair and for the purchase of imprinted book matches and 
imprinted jar grip openers to be distributed at the fair for recruiting 
purposes and to provide veterans with a number to call to obtain 
information. B-247563.2, May 12, 1993. The Bureau of Printing and 
Engraving also needed statutory authority to publish a 100-year history to 
commemorate its centennial because the Bureau is essentially an 
“industrial and service” establishment and lacked authority to disseminate 
information. 43 Comp. Gen. 564 (1964).

f. Advertising and the 
Employment of Publicity 
Experts 
(1) Commercial advertising 
Suppose you opened this publication and found on the inside front cover a 
full-page advertisement for somebody’s soap or underwear or aluminum 
siding or the local pool parlor. We assume most readers would find this 
offensive. There is in fact a long-standing policy against involving the 
government in commercial advertising. In the case of government 
publications, the policy is codified in section 13 of the Government Printing 
and Binding Regulations issued by the Joint Committee on Printing (1990 
reprint):

 “No Government publication or other Government printed 
matter, prepared or produced with either appropriated or 
nonappropriated funds or identified with an activity of the 
Government, shall contain any advertisement inserted by or 
for any private individual, firm, or corporation; or contain 
material which implies in any manner that the Government 
endorses or favors any specific commercial product, 
commodity, or service.” 

S.Pub. No. 101-9 at 13 (1990). An explanatory paragraph included in the 
regulations summarizes many of the reasons for this prohibition. 
Advertising would be unfair to competitors in that it would, regardless of 
intent, unavoidably create the impression of government endorsement. It 
would also be unfair to nongovernment publications that compete for 
advertising dollars and need those dollars to stay in business. Acceptance 
of advertising could also pose ethical, if not legal, problems. (Imagine, for 
example, lobbyists scrambling to purchase advertising space in the 
Congressional Record.) 
A different situation was presented in 67 Comp. Gen. 90 (1987). The United 
States Information Agency (USIA) was authorized to accept donations of 
radio programs from private syndicators for broadcast over the Voice of 
America. Some donations were conditioned on the inclusion of commercial 
advertising. GAO noted that, in the case of public broadcast stations (which 
are supported by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting), commercial 
advertising is expressly prohibited by 47 U.S.C. § 399b(b). However, there 
was no comparable statute applicable to USIA. Therefore, the conditional 
donations were not subject to any legal prohibition. In view of the 
traditional policy against commercial advertising, GAO suggested that 
USIA first consult the appropriate congressional committees.

(2) Advertising of government programs, products, or services 
Even the casual viewer of commercial television will note that the 
government is heavily “into” advertising. From the ever-present “Smokey 

Bear” reminding us that only we can prevent wildfires148 to Vince and  
Larry, the Crash Test Dummies, and the recruitment efforts of the U.S. 
Army and its message “An Army of One,” the government has sponsored a 
variety of campaigns designed to either encourage or discourage various 
behaviors. Whether an agency’s appropriations are available for 
advertising, like any other expenditure, depends on the agency’s statutory 
authority. 

Whether to advertise and, if so, how far to go with it149 are determined by 
the precise terms of the agency’s program authority in conjunction with the 
necessary expense doctrine and general restrictions on the use of public 
funds such as the various anti-lobbying statutes. See B-251887, July 22, 1993 
(Forest Service may pay for newspaper advertisements informing the 
public of activities in the national forests because these activities are within 
the Service’s statutory authority and the advertisements are reasonable 
ways of disseminating information related to the purposes of the Service’s 
appropriation); B-229732, Dec. 22, 1988 (Department of Housing and Urban 
Development had no authority to incur promotional expenses at a trade 
show in the Soviet Union when the purpose of the show was to enhance the 
potential for sale of American products and services in the Soviet Union, a 
purpose unrelated to HUD’s mission). 

As noted previously, some agencies have express promotional authority. 
For example, the Department of Energy may promote energy conservation. 
See B-139965, Apr. 16, 1979 (nondecision letter). Similarly, the United  
States Postal Service has statutory authority to advertise its philatelic 

148 Smokey Bear and his famous warning, “Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires” was 
introduced to Americans in 1944. In response to an outbreak of wildfires in 2000, the 
campaign was changed to “Only You Can Prevent Wildfires.” Whatever his slogan, Smokey is 
recognized and protected by act of Congress. See 16 U.S.C. § 580p. Mess with Smokey and 
you can go to jail. 18 U.S.C. § 711. 

149 Even with specific authority to advertise, agencies still need to be careful. See Federal 
Express Corp. v. United States Postal Service, 151 F.3d 536 (6th Cir. 1998) and Federal 
Express Corp. v. United States Postal Service, 40 F. Supp. 2d 943 (W.D. Tenn. 1999) 
(involving claims that the U.S. Postal Service engaged in false advertising).

services to encourage stamp collecting. B-114874.30, Mar. 3, 1976 
(nondecision letter). 

As with the dissemination of information, where promotional authority 
exists, agencies have reasonable discretion, subject to “necessary expense” 
considerations, in selecting appropriate means. Thus, the Navy could 
exercise its statutory authorization to promote safety and accident 
prevention by procuring book matches with safety slogans printed on the 
covers and distributing them without charge at naval installations. 
B-104443, Aug. 31, 1951. Another example is B-184648, Dec. 3, 1975. 

Activities of the United States Mint furnish additional illustrations. In 
B-206273, Sept. 2, 1983, GAO considered the Mint’s promotional authority 
under legislation authorizing coins to commemorate the 1984 Los Angeles 
Summer Olympics. GAO concluded that the Mint could stage media events 
and receptions, and could give away occasional sample coins at these 
events, if (1) the expenditures were deemed necessary to further the 
statutory objectives, (2) a reasonable relationship were found to exist 
between a given expenditure and a marketing benefit for the program, and 

(3) promotional expenses were recouped from sales proceeds. In 68 Comp. 
Gen. 583 (1989), GAO applied the same standards to the commemorative 
coin program generally.150 Subsequent Mint legislation expressly authorizes 
marketing, promotion, and advertising. See, e.g., 31 U.S.C. § 5136. 
The line between promotion and information dissemination is occasionally 
thin, but the concepts are nevertheless different. Thus, an agency may be 
authorized to disseminate information but not to promote. If so, its 
“advertising” must be tailored accordingly. For example, the Federal 
Housing Administration could disseminate authentic information on 
available benefits or related procedures under a loan insurance program, 
but could not use its funds for an advertising campaign to create demand. 
14 Comp. Gen. 638 (1935). Similarly, when the United States Metric Board 
was first created, it could provide information, assistance, and 
coordination for voluntary conversion to metrics but could not advocate 
metric conversion. See U.S. General Accounting Office, Getting A Better 
Understanding of the Metric System—Implications If Adopted by the 

150 This case also held that the scope of legitimate promotional activities could not include 
the printing of business cards for sales representatives. Business cards are now approved 
expenditures where they are a necessary expense of agency operations. B-280759, Nov. 5, 
1998. There is a lengthy discussion of business cards in this chapter, section C.13.b.

(3) Publicity experts 
A statute originally enacted in 1913, now found at 5 U.S.C. § 3107, provides:

 “Appropriated funds may not be used to pay a publicity 
expert unless specifically appropriated for that purpose.” 

GAO has had little occasion to interpret or apply 5 U.S.C. § 3107 and, from 
the earliest cases, has consistently noted certain difficulties in enforcing 
the statute. In GAO’s first substantive discussion of 5 U.S.C. § 3107, the 
Comptroller General stated “[i]n its present form, the statute is ineffective.” 
A-61553, May 10, 1935. The early cases151 identified three problem areas, 
summarized in B-181254(2), Feb. 28, 1975. 

First, the prohibition is against compensating any “publicity expert,” but 
the statute does not define the term “publicity expert” nor does it provide 
criteria for determining who is one. Traditionally, persons employed for or 
engaged in so-called publicity work have not been appointed as “publicity 
experts” but under some other designation, and often have other duties as 
well. Everyone who prepares a press release is not a “publicity expert.” 
Testifying before the House Select Committee on Lobbying Activities in 
1950, Assistant Comptroller General Weitzel said:

 “I might mention one of the great difficulties in enforcing 
that language is it is very, very rare, if ever, the case that a 
man is on the pay roll as publicity experts [sic]. He can be 
called almost anything else, and usually and frequently will 
have other duties, so that that in itself, is a very difficult 
statute to enforce.”152 

151 There is no mention of the 1913 statute before the 1930s. A small group of cases then 
arose. In addition to A-61553, cited in the text, see B-26689, May 4, 1943; A-93988, Apr. 19, 
1938; A-82332, Dec. 15, 1936; A-57297, Sept. 11, 1934. Another stretch of silence followed and 
the statute did not arise again until B-181254(2), Feb. 28, 1975.

Select Committee on Lobbying Activities, 81st Cong., pt. 1, at 156 (1950).

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Second, employees engaged in so-called publicity work are normally 
assigned to their duties by their supervisors. It would be harsh, in the 
absence of much more definitive legislative or judicial guidance, to 
withhold the compensation of an employee who is merely doing his or her 
assigned job. Some thought was given in the 1930s and early 1940s to 
amending the statute to cure this problem, but the legislation was not 
enacted. See B-181254(2), supra; B-26689, May 4, 1943; A-82332, Dec. 15, 
1936. 

Third, the effective implementation of the duties of some agencies requires 
the acquisition and dissemination of information, although agencies 
normally do not receive specific appropriations for the required personnel. 

Based on these considerations, GAO does not view 5 U.S.C. § 3107 as 
prohibiting an agency’s legitimate informational functions or legitimate 
promotional functions where authorized by law. The apparent intent of the 
statute is to prohibit publicity activity “for the purpose of reflecting credit 
upon an activity, or upon the officials charged with its administration, 
rather than for the purpose of furthering the work which the law has 
imposed upon it.” A-82332, Dec. 15, 1936. See also B-181254(2), supra. In 
this sense, 5 U.S.C. § 3107 is closely related to the prohibition on self-
aggrandizement previously discussed, although the focus is different in 
that, to violate 5 U.S.C. § 3107, the activity must be performed by a 
“publicity expert.” 

In the only two cases in the 1970s with any substantial discussion of 
5 U.S.C. § 3107, GAO considered a mass media campaign by the Federal 
Energy Administration (FEA), now part of the Department of Energy, to 
educate the American public on the need for and means of energy 
conservation. Based on the considerations discussed above and on the 
FEA’s statutory authority to disseminate information and to promote 
energy conservation, GAO found no basis on which to assess a violation of 
5 U.S.C. § 3107. B-181254(2), supra; B-139965, Apr. 16, 1979 (nondecision 
letter). In both cases GAO stressed its view that the statute is not intended 
to interfere with the dissemination of information that an agency is 
required or authorized by statute to disseminate, or with promotional 
activities authorized by law. 

The only case in the 1980s to apply 5 U.S.C. § 3107 is B-222758, June 25, 
1986. The Chemical Warfare Review Commission, a presidential advisory 
committee, hired a public affairs consultant. The Commission’s functions 
were solely advisory; it had no authority to engage in promotional activities 

Page 4-233 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

or to maintain a public affairs program. In view of the consultant’s duties, 
job title, and reputation, GAO found that he was a “publicity expert.” As 
such, and given the nature of the Commission’s functions and its lack of 
statutory authority, the hiring was held to violate 5 U.S.C. § 3107. 

12. Membership Fees 
a. 5 U.S.C. § 5946 Appropriated funds may not be used to pay membership fees of an 
employee of the United States or the District of Columbia in a society or 
association. 5 U.S.C. § 5946. The prohibition does not apply if an 
appropriation is expressly available for that purpose, or if the fee is 
authorized under the Government Employees Training Act. Under the 
Training Act, membership fees may be paid if the fee is a necessary cost 
directly related to the training or a condition precedent to undergoing the 
training. 5 U.S.C. § 4109(b). 
The rule that has evolved under 5 U.S.C. § 5946 is that membership fees for 
individuals may not be paid, regardless of the resulting benefit to the 
agency. An agency may, however, purchase a membership in its own name 
upon an administrative determination that the expenditure would further 
the authorized activities of the agency, and this determination is not 
affected by any incidental benefits that may accrue to individual 
employees.153 
In 24 Comp. Gen. 814 (1945), the Veterans Administration (VA) asked 
whether it could pay membership fees for VA facilities in the American 
Hospital Association. Facility membership would enable individual 
employees to apply for personal membership at reduced rates. The 
Comptroller General responded that the facility memberships were 
permissible if administratively determined necessary to accomplish the 
objectives of the appropriation to be charged. The indirect benefit to 
individual officials would not operate to invalidate the agency membership. 
However, the expenditure would be improper if its purpose was merely to 

153 A few very early decisions will be found to the effect that 5 U.S.C. § 5946 prohibits agency 
memberships as well as individual memberships. E.g., 19 Comp. Gen. 838 (1940); 24 Comp. 
Dec. 473 (1918). While these decisions do not appear to have been explicitly overruled or 
modified, they must be regarded as implicitly repudiated by the subsequent body of case law 
to the extent they purport to prohibit adequately justified agency memberships.

enable the officials to obtain the reduced rates for personal memberships. 
VA could not, of course, pay for the individual memberships. 

Similarly, GAO advised the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it 
could not pay the membership fees for its employees in professional 
organizations (such as the National Environment Research Center and the 
National Solid Waste Management Association), notwithstanding the 
allegation that the benefits of membership would accrue more to the 
agency than to the individuals. EPA could, however, purchase a 
membership in its own name if it justified the expenditure as being of direct 
benefit to the agency and sufficiently related to carrying out the purposes 
of its appropriation. 53 Comp. Gen. 429 (1973).154 

In another 1973 decision, the Comptroller General held that the Justice 
Department could not reimburse an electronics engineer employed by the 
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs for membership in the Institute 
of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. The Justice Department had argued 
that the government benefited from the membership by virtue of reduced 
subscription rates to Institute publications and because the membership 
contributed to employee development. These factors were not sufficient to 
overcome the prohibition of 5 U.S.C. § 5946. Once again, GAO pointed out 
that the Bureau could become a member of the Institute in its own name if 
membership was administratively determined to be necessary. 52 Comp. 
Gen. 495 (1973). To the same effect is B-205768, Mar. 2, 1982 (Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service can purchase agency membership in 
Association of Labor Related Agencies upon making appropriate 
administrative determinations). 

In another case, the Comptroller General held that the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration could not pay the membership fee of one 
of its employees in Federally Employed Women, Inc., notwithstanding the 
employee’s designation as the agency’s regional representative. The mere 
fact that membership may be job-related does not overcome the statutory 
prohibition. B-198720, June 23, 1980. See also 19 Comp. Dec. 650 (1913) 
(Army could not pay for Adjutant General’s membership in International 
Association of Chiefs of Police). Similarly, the fact that membership may 
result in savings to the government, such as reduced travel rates for 

154 The last sentence of the decision uses the term “essential.” This word is too strong. The 
necessary expense doctrine does not require that an expenditure be essential.

members, does not overcome the prohibition against individual 
memberships. 3 Comp. Gen. 963 (1924). 

As noted, an agency may purchase membership in its own name in a 
society or association since 5 U.S.C. § 5946 prohibits only memberships for 
individual employees. The distinction, however, is not a distinction in name 
only. An expenditure for an agency membership must be justified on a 
“necessary expense” theory. To do this, the membership must provide 
benefits to the agency itself. For example, in 31 Comp. Gen. 398 (1952), the 
Economic Stabilization Agency was permitted to become a member of a 
credit association because members could purchase credit reports at 
reduced cost and the procurement of credit reports was determined to be 
necessary to the enforcement of the Defense Production Act. In 33 Comp. 
Gen. 126 (1953), the Office of Technical Services, Commerce Department, 
was permitted to purchase membership in the American Management 
Association. The appropriation involved was an appropriation under the 
Mutual Security Act to conduct programs including technical assistance to 
Europe, and the membership benefit to the agency was the procurement of 
Association publications for foreign trainees and foreign productivity 
centers. See also 70 Comp. Gen. 190 (1991) (prohibition in 5 U.S.C. § 5946 
does not prohibit an agency from using appropriated funds to purchase 
access for its employees to a private fitness center’s exercise facilities as 
part of the agency’s health service program as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 
§ 7901); B-241706, June 19, 1991 (Public Health Service may reimburse 
physicians for annual medical staff dues since hospital privileges are 
essential to the performance of the agency’s business); B-236763, Jan. 10, 
1990 (GAO may pay fees for agency membership in certain professional 
organizations and designate appropriate GAO employees to attend 
functions for recruitment purposes). 

Citing 31 Comp. Gen. 398 and 33 Comp. Gen. 126, the Comptroller General 
held in 57 Comp. Gen. 526 (1978), that the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development could purchase, in the name of the Department, air 
travel club memberships to obtain discount air fares to Hawaii. Similarly, 
the General Services Administration could join a shippers association to 
obtain the benefit of volume transportation rates. B-159783, May 4, 1972. 

GAO has also approved membership by the Federal Law Enforcement 
Center in the local Chamber of Commerce, B-213535, July 26, 1984, and by 
a naval installation in the local Rotary Club, 61 Comp. Gen. 542 (1982). In 
the latter decision, however, GAO cautioned that the result was based on 
the specific justification presented, and that the decision should not be 

Page 4-236 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

taken to mean that “every military installation or regional Government 
office can use appropriated funds to join the Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions, and 
similar organizations.” Id. at 544. 

The acquisition of needed publications for the agency is sufficient benefit 
to justify purchase of an agency membership. 20 Comp. Gen. 497 (1941) 
(membership of Naval Academy in American Council on Education); 
A-30185, Feb. 5, 1930 (membership of Phoenix Indian School in National 
Education Association). See also 33 Comp. Gen. 126 (1953). Compare 
52 Comp. Gen. 495 (1973), holding that acquisition of publications is not 
sufficient to justify an individual, as opposed to agency, membership. 

A variation occurred in 19 Comp. Gen. 937 (1940). The Cleveland office of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) desired access to a law 
library maintained by the Cleveland Law Library Association. Access was 
available only to persons who were stockholders in the Association. The 
alternative to the SEC would have been the purchase of its own library at a 
much greater cost. Under the circumstances, GAO advised that 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5946 did not prohibit the stock purchases or the payment of stockholders 
assessments. GAO further noted, however, that a preferable alternative 
would be a contract with the Association for a flat-rate service charge. 

Where there is no demonstrable benefit to the agency, the membership 
expense is improper. Thus, in 32 Comp. Gen. 15 (1952), the cost of 
membership fees for the New York Ordnance District of the Army in the 
Society for Advancement of Management was disallowed. The membership 
was in actuality four separate memberships for four individuals and the 
primary purpose was to enhance the knowledge of those individuals. 

Since the benefit to the agency must be in terms of furthering the purposes 
for which its appropriation was made, a benefit to the United States as a 
whole rather than the individual agency may not be sufficient. In 5 Comp. 
Gen. 645 (1926), the former Veterans Bureau owned herds of livestock and 
wanted to have them registered. Reduced registration costs could be 
obtained by joining certain livestock associations. The benefit of 
registration would be a higher price if the agency sold the livestock. 
However, sales proceeds would have to be deposited in the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts and would thus not benefit the agency’s 
appropriations. Membership was therefore improper. (The agency’s 
appropriation language was subsequently changed and the membership 
was approved in A-38236, Mar. 30, 1932.) 

Page 4-237 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

Several of the decisions have pointed out that an agency may accept a 
gratuitous membership without violating the Antideficiency Act. 31 Comp. 
Gen. 398, 399 (1952); A-38236, Mar. 30, 1932, quoted in 24 Comp. Gen. 814, 
815 (1945). 

In addition, payment of a membership fee at the beginning of the period of 
membership does not violate the prohibition on advance payments found in 
31 U.S.C. § 3324. For example, in B-221569, June 2, 1986, the Coast Guard 
could properly use its funds to pay the membership fees in certain 
unspecified private organizations (not physical fitness facilities) at the 
beginning of the membership period. The advance payment prohibition 
was not applicable since the agency got the benefit of what it purchased 
upon payment. What was being purchased was a “membership,” and the 
membership was received upon payment. Compare B-288013, Dec. 11, 
2001, holding that agency payments of membership fees to a private fitness 
center at the beginning of each option year, under a contract for providing 
fitness facilities and services for government employees, before it is known 
how many and when agency employees use the contractor’s facilities and 
services, would violate the advance payment provision in 31 U.S.C. § 3324. 
There is a fuller discussion of the advance payment provision in Chapter 5, 
section C. 

The evolution of the statutory law on membership fees produced a 
somewhat anomalous result in some of the early cases. Section 5946 of 
Title 5 of the United States Code originally prohibited—and still prohibits— 
not only membership fees but also the expenses of attending meetings. In 
the early decades of the statute, some agencies received specific authority 
to pay the expenses of attendance at meetings, but many did not. Thus, as 
the individual versus agency membership distinction developed, some of 
the decisions were forced to conclude that an agency could purchase a 
membership in an association but that nobody could attend the meetings 
since attending meetings could not be done by “the agency” but only 
through an individual. See, e.g., 24 Comp. Gen. 814, 815 (1945); A-30185, 
Feb. 5, 1930. Two provisions of the Government Employees Training Act, 
5 U.S.C. §§ 4109 and 4110, now permit attendance at meetings and 
conferences in certain situations. Thus, as a general proposition, if an 
organization is closely enough related to an agency’s official functions to 
justify agency membership, it is presumably closely enough related to 
justify sending a representative to its meetings. See also section C.2 of this 
chapter, entitled “Attendance at Meetings and Conventions.”

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

As noted above, the prohibition in 5 U.S.C. § 5946 against individual 
memberships does not apply if the fee is authorized by the Government 
Employees Training Act. An illustration is 61 Comp. Gen. 162 (1981), 
holding that the Defense Department could pay the licensing fees of 
Methods Time Measurement instructors for the Army Management 
Engineering Training Agency. The instructors had to be trained and 
certified—hence the fee—before they could train others. Further, the fee 
was not a matter of “personal qualification” since the certifications would 
be restricted to the training of Defense Department personnel and would 
be of no personal use to the instructors apart from their Defense 
Department jobs. For more on the issue of personal qualification see 
section C.13.e of this chapter. 

Compare that case with the decision in B-286026, June 12, 2001, in which 
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) asked whether it could 
use appropriated funds to pay, as training costs, fees for actuary 
accreditation. PBGC employs a number of actuaries to calculate pension 
benefits. Although actuaries do not need a professional license for 
employment, as part of a collective bargaining agreement PBGC proposed 
to use training funds to send actuaries to the examination review courses, 
provide on-the-job study time, and pay for the accreditation examinations. 
PBGC determined that this course of study and testing would enhance the 
ability of the PBGC actuaries to carry out their assignments. PBGC has the 
discretion under the Government Employees Training Act to determine 
that the review courses constitute appropriate training for its actuaries. 
Accordingly, GAO agreed that PBGC has authority, under 5 U.S.C. 
§ 4109(a), to use appropriated funds for review courses and on-the-job 
study time. However, there was no authority to pay the cost of the 
accreditation examination itself, since a licensing accreditation 
examination does not fall within the Government Employees Training Act’s 
definition of training. In the absence of statutory authority, an agency may 
not pay the costs of its employees taking licensing examinations since 
professional accreditation is personal to the employee and should be paid 
with personal funds. Here, the actuarial accreditation belongs to the 
employee personally and would remain so irrespective of whether the 
employee remains with the federal government. This case predated 
enactment of 5 U.S.C. § 5757, which gave agencies the discretionary 
authority to reimburse employees for expenses incurred in obtaining 
professional credentials, including the costs of examinations. This 
authority is discussed in more detail in this chapter in the next section on 
attorneys’ expenses related to admission to the bar, and in section C.13.e of 
this chapter on professional qualification expenses.

Another example of the inapplicability of 5 U.S.C. § 5946 when the 
membership fee is authorized under the Government Employees Training 
Act is B-223447, Oct. 10, 1986, approving certain individual memberships 
for employees of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Toastmasters 
International organization as a source of public speaking training. The 
organization required membership in order to obtain the training. Because 
the Government Employees Training Act does not apply to active duty 
members of the uniformed services (68 Comp. Gen. 127 (1988)), the Act’s 
exception to 5 U.S.C. § 5946, and cases applying the Act or the exception, 
apply to civilian employees of the military departments but not to 
uniformed personnel. 

b. Attorneys Over the years a number of cases have dealt with the expenses of admission 
to the bar and related items for attorneys employed by the government. 
Generally these expenses have been viewed as personal qualification 
expenses to be paid by the attorney. Recent legislation codified at 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5757 provides authority for agencies, at their discretion, to pay some or 
all of these expenses. See the discussion at the end of this section. 
The question first came up in 22 Comp. Gen. 460 (1942), when the Federal 
Trade Commission asked if it could reimburse one of its attorneys the fee 
he paid to be admitted to the bar of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The 
attorney had paid the fee in order to make an appearance to represent the 
agency in a suit filed against it. The Comptroller General said no, stating the 
rule as follows: 

“It has been the consistent holding of the accounting 
officers of the United States that an officer or employee of 
the Government has upon his own shoulders the duty of 
qualifying himself for the performance of his official duties 
and that if a personal license is necessary to render him 
competent therefor, he must procure it at his own expense.” 

Id. at 461. 

In 1967, the National Labor Relations Board asked GAO to reconsider the 
rule in a fact situation similar to that in 22 Comp. Gen. 460. GAO reviewed 
the basis for the prior decision in light of the Government Employees 
Training Act, but found no reason to change it. Pointing out that “the 
privilege to practice before a particular court is personal to the individual 
and is his for life unless disbarred regardless of whether he remains in the 
Government service,” the Comptroller General again held that the bar 

Page 4-240 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

admission fee was personal to the attorney and could not be paid from 
appropriated funds. 47 Comp. Gen. 116 (1967). 

The same result was reached in B-161952, June 12, 1978, again to the 
National Labor Relations Board. The fact that an attorney might require 
admission to several courts rather than just one in the performance of 
official duties was found immaterial and GAO rejected the suggestion that 
the court admission would be of very limited value to the attorney after 
leaving the government. 

Questions have also arisen over the requirement for a government attorney 
to remain a member in good standing of the bar of some state or the 
District of Columbia. In a jurisdiction with a “unified” or “integrated” bar, 
the attorney must pay an annual fee to remain a member in good standing, 
and membership in the state’s bar association goes along with the fee. 
(Some states require annual fees to remain on the active rolls but do not 
include bar association membership.) In B-171667, Mar. 2, 1971, the annual 
fee for an Internal Revenue Service attorney to remain in good standing in 
the California bar, an integrated bar jurisdiction, was held not reimbursable 
from appropriated funds. The fee remains a matter of personal qualification 
and the principle is the same whether applied to a one-time fee or to dues 
or fees charged on a recurring basis. The decision cited 5 U.S.C. § 5946 as 
an additional reason. GAO reached the same result in 51 Comp. Gen. 701 
(1972), concerning a Patent Office attorney’s membership in the unified bar 
of the District of Columbia; again in B-204213, Sept. 9, 1981, concerning 
mandatory dues for continued membership in the North Carolina bar; and 
still again in B-204215, Dec. 28, 1981, concerning the membership of an 
Internal Revenue Service estate tax attorney in the New Jersey bar. 

Another case applying the prohibition is B-187525, Oct. 15, 1976. The 
decision further pointed out that an agency may not pay the costs incurred 
by one of its attorneys in taking a bar examination since the examination is 
part of the employee’s personal qualification process. See also 55 Comp. 
Gen. 759 (1976) concerning examinations in general. 

In 61 Comp. Gen. 357 (1982), GAO held that the Merit Systems Protection 
Board could not pay the bar membership fees of its appeals officers. It 
made no difference that the requirement for appeals officers to be bar-
admitted attorneys was a new one the Board had imposed on incumbent 
employees. In addition, the Board could not pay bar review course fees. 
(The decision distinguished B-187525, cited above, which had permitted 
bar review course fees in a very limited situation.)

In 2001, section 1112 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-107, 115 Stat. 1238 (Dec. 28, 2001) amended Title 
5, United States Code, by adding a new section 5757. Under 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5757(a), agencies may, at their discretion, use appropriated funds to pay 
expenses incurred by employees to obtain professional credentials, state-
imposed and professional licenses, professional accreditations, and 
professional certifications, including the costs of examinations to obtain 
such credentials. This authority is not available to pay such fees for 
employees in or seeking to be hired into positions excepted from the 
competitive service because of the confidential, policy-determining, policymaking, 
or policy-advocating character of the position. 5 U.S.C. § 5757(b). 
Nothing in the statute or its legislative history defines or limits the terms 
“professional credentials,” “professional accreditation,” or “professional 
certification.” Agencies have the discretion to determine whether 
resources permit payment of credentials, and what types of professional 
expenses will be paid under the statute. Thus, if an agency determines that 
the fees its attorneys must pay for admission to practice before federal 
courts are in the nature of professional credentials or certifications, the 
agency may exercise its discretion under 5 U.S.C. § 5757 and pay those fees 
out of appropriated funds. B-289219, Oct. 29, 2002. 

13. Personal Expenses and 
Furnishings 
a. Introduction Items that are classified as personal expenses or personal furnishings may 
not be purchased with appropriated funds without specific statutory 
authority. Most of the cases tend to involve government employees, the 
theory being simply that there are certain things an employee is expected 
to provide for him(her)self. A prime example is food, covered in detail 
previously in this chapter. 
The rule on personal expenses and furnishings was stated as follows in 
3 Comp. Gen. 433 (1924): 
“[P]ersonal furnishings are not authorized to be purchased 
under appropriations in the absence of specific provision 
therefor contained in such appropriations or other acts, if 
such furnishings are for the personal convenience, comfort, 
or protection of such employees, or are such as to be 
reasonably required as a part of the usual and necessary 

Page 4-242 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

equipment for the work on which they are engaged or for 
which they are employed.” 

This decision is still cited frequently and the rule is applied in many 
contexts. Of course, over the years, exceptions have evolved, both 
statutory and nonstatutory. The remainder of this section explores several 
categories of personal expenses. 

b. Business or Calling Cards Business cards or calling cards are commonly used in the commercial 
world. (We use the terms synonymously here even though there may be 
technical distinctions.) Until 1998, we considered them inherently personal 
in nature, and therefore, a personal expense that was not payable from 
appropriated funds, absent specific statutory authority. See B-246616, 
July 17, 1992. In 1998, however, we agreed that an agency, applying a 
necessary expense analysis, may reasonably determine that its 
appropriations are available to obtain business cards for employees who 
regularly deal with the public or organizations outside their immediate 
office. B-280759, Nov. 5, 1998. 
The previous rule had its origins in decisions of the Comptroller of the 
Treasury. For example, in 20 Comp. Dec. 248 (1913), the Comptroller of the 
Treasury considered the argument that was usually presented in every 
case—that the cards were to be used for official business purposes. 
Nonetheless, business or calling cards were considered more a matter of 
personal convenience than necessity. Therefore, the Comptroller advised 
federal agencies that the cost of business cards is a personal expense and, 
therefore, is not chargeable to public funds.155 

In more recent years, the Comptroller General applied the long-standing 
prohibition of the use of appropriated funds for: reimbursement of an 
employee of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration who had 
purchased business cards at his own expense (B-195036, July 11, 1979); 
purchase of a Forest Service public affairs officer’s “identification cards,” 
since the cards were to be used for the same purposes as traditional 
business cards (68 Comp. Gen. 467 (1989)); and payment for “cards of 
introduction” (B-149151, July 20, 1962). 

155 “[I]n official life it has been the practice for the official himself to furnish his own cards, 
the salaries in most instances being adequate for such expenditures,” the Comptroller of the 
Treasury chided. 20 Comp. Dec. at 250. 

Page 4-243 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

In 1998, GAO re-examined the prohibition. In B-280759, Nov. 5, 1998, GAO 
did not object to the use of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds for 
the purchase of business cards for use by civilian personnel specialists of 
the Army Civilian Personnel Advisory Center. The Advisory Center acts as a 
liaison between Army employing units and their employees, and provides 
advice and assistance to employers and employees. The specialists would 
use the business cards to provide the Center’s customers with accurate 
information on how to contact the specialist assigned to a customer’s case. 
Applying a necessary expense analysis, we concluded that business cards 
would advance the Center’s mission, and that use of the Army’s O&M 
appropriation (which funds the Center’s activities) to purchase business 
cards for the specialists was proper. See also Memorandum from Richard L. 
Shiffrin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, 
Department of Justice, to Emily C. Hewitt, General Counsel, General 
Services Administration, Aug. 11, 1997. 

We have considered the cost of business or calling cards for Members of 
Congress and their staff who require them a necessary and justifiable 
expense, given the nature of Members’ constituent responsibilities. See 

B-198419, Nov. 25, 1980; B-198419, July 8, 1980. 

Also, we have considered reception and representation (or comparable 
forms of “entertainment”) appropriations to be available to purchase 
business cards for employees whose jobs included representation. 
B-223678, June 5, 1989 (noting that business cards are a “legitimate and 
accepted” representation device, so the expenditure is subject to the 
limitation of that appropriation). See also 72 Comp. Gen. 146 (1993); 
68 Comp. Gen. 467, 468 n.1 (1989); B-246616, July 17, 1992). 

We considered a variation on business cards in B-173239, June 15, 1978. 
The Board for International Broadcasting wanted to use what it termed 
“transmittal slips” to accompany the distribution of its annual report. The 
transmittal slip resembled a business card and contained the words “With 
the compliments of (name and title), Board for International Broadcasting.” 
It was not necessary to decide whether the “slips” were business cards or 
not, because 44 U.S.C. § 1106 expressly provides that documents 
distributed by an executive department or independent establishment may 
not contain or include a notice that they are being sent with “the 
compliments” of a government official. Use of the transmittal slips was 
therefore unauthorized.

c. Health, Medical Care and 
Treatment 
Also, “name tags” to be worn on the person were not considered the same 
as business cards and could be provided from appropriated funds. 
B-236763, Jan. 10, 1990. A name tag is more closely analogous to a 
government identification card, which is clearly not a personal expense. 
2 Comp. Gen. 429 (1923). See also 11 Comp. Gen. 247 (1931) (identification 
insignia to be worn on caps). 

(1) Medical care 
The rule for medical care is that, except for illness directly resulting from 
the nature of the employment, medical care and treatment are personal to 
the employee and payment may not be made from appropriated funds 
unless provided for in a contract of employment or by statute or valid 
regulation. 57 Comp. Gen. 62 (1977); 53 Comp. Gen. 230 (1973). The case 
most frequently cited for this rule is 22 Comp. Gen. 32 (1942), which 
contains citations to many of the earlier decisions.156 

Exceptions have been recognized where a particular item could be justified 
as being primarily for the benefit of the government rather than the 
employees. The exceptions involve primarily physical examinations and 
inoculation. For example, appropriated funds were held available in the 
following cases: 

• 41 Comp. Gen. 387 (1961) (desensitization treatment for a Department 
of Agriculture horticulturist with a known history of severe reaction to 
bee and wasp stings). 

• 23 Comp. Gen. 888 (1944) (purchase of drugs and their administration 
by private doctor to employees exposed to spinal meningitis in line of 
duty; otherwise, agency would have risked having to quarantine the 
employees and close the facility).

156 Although not directly related to medical care, there is a very early group of cases, on 
which the earlier medical care cases partly relied, standing for the proposition that 
appropriated funds are not available for the burial of a deceased civilian employee unless 
necessary for the health and/or safety of other employees, in which event the “reasonable 
expenses of a decent burial” are permissible. 3 Comp. Gen. 111 (1923); 11 Comp. Dec. 789 
(1905); 6 Comp. Dec. 447 (1899); 2 Comp. Dec. 347 (1896).

By virtue of legislation enacted in 1946 and now found at 5 U.S.C. § 7901, 
each agency is authorized to establish a health service program to promote 
and maintain the physical and mental fitness of employees under its 
jurisdiction. The statute expressly limits authorized health service 
programs to (1) treatment of on-the-job illness and dental conditions 
requiring emergency attention; (2) pre-employment and other 
examinations; (3) referral of employees to private physicians and dentists; 
and (4) preventive programs relating to health. 

Under this legislative authority, the Comptroller General advised, for 
example, that an agency could, upon determining that it will be in the 
government’s interest to do so, provide immunization against specific 
diseases without charge to employees. 47 Comp. Gen. 54 (1967). 

In 57 Comp. Gen. 62 (1977), the Comptroller General held that the 
Environmental Protection Agency was authorized by 5 U.S.C. § 7901 to 
procure diagnostic and preventive psychological counseling services for its 
employees. The service could encompass problem identification, referral 
for treatment or rehabilitation to an appropriate service or resource, and 
follow-up to help an employee readjust to the job during and after 
treatment, but could not include the actual treatment and rehabilitation. 
Actual treatment and rehabilitation remain the employee’s responsibility. 

In B-270446, Feb. 11, 1997, provision of psychological assessment and 
referral services for Customs Service employees’ family members was 
determined to be for the benefit of the government and, therefore, 
permitted under 5 U.S.C. § 7901. The Service’s Employee Assistance 
Program may render these services for family members adversely affected 
by work-related activities of, or traumatic incidents involving death or 
serious injury to, an employee in the line of duty carrying out the agency’s 
law enforcement activities. Cf. 71 Comp. Gen. 527 (1992) (a federal agency 
may not use appropriated funds to provide space for eldercare facilities for 
the adult relatives of agency employees, but may provide employee referral 
and counseling programs). 

In B-198804, Dec. 31, 1980, GAO refused to expand the holding in 57 Comp. 
Gen. 62 to permit an agency to pay the expenses of alcoholism treatment 
and rehabilitation for one of its employees. Treatment and rehabilitation, as 
stressed in 57 Comp. Gen. 62, are the employee’s responsibility. It made no 
difference that the employee had been erroneously advised that the 
expenses would be covered by her health insurance and had already 

Page 4-246 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4

incurred the expenses, since the government cannot be bound by the 
unauthorized acts or representations of its agents. 

Federal agencies are authorized under 5 U.S.C. § 7901 to establish smoking 
cessation programs for their employees, and may use their operating 
appropriations to pay the costs. 68 Comp. Gen. 222 (1989). In light of the 
body of evidence of the health hazards of smoking, the decision reasoned, 
programs to help employees quit smoking are clearly “preventive programs 
relating to health” for purposes of the statute.157 

Physical fitness programs may qualify as preventive health programs under 
5 U.S.C. § 7901 to the extent permissible under applicable regulations such 
as Office of Management and Budget Circulars, the Federal Personnel 
Manual, and regulations of the General Services Administration. In 
addition, it may be possible to justify some programs under the necessary 
expense concept without the need to invoke the statute. For example, in 
63 Comp. Gen. 296 (1984), GAO applied the necessary expense doctrine to 
conclude that Bureau of Reclamation funds were available for physical 
exercise equipment to be used in a mandatory physical fitness program for 
firefighters. 

In 64 Comp. Gen. 835 (1985), GAO considered the scope of a permissible 
fitness program under section 7901, concluding that a program could 
include comprehensive physical fitness evaluations and laboratory blood 
tests. Based on the statute alone, it could also include physical exercise. 
However, regulations then in effect precluded use of appropriated funds for 
physical exercise as part of a health service program. The decision further 
noted, as 63 Comp. Gen. 296 had held, that physical exercise costs incident 
to a mandatory program necessitated by the demands of designated 
positions could be paid as a necessary expense without the need to rely on 
5 U.S.C. § 7901. See also B-216852-O.M., Mar. 6, 1985 (discussing GAO’s own 
authority to establish a fitness program); B-216852, Dec. 17, 1984 
(nondecision letter). 

Subsequent to 64 Comp. Gen. 835, the Office of Personnel Management 
revised its regulations to include physical fitness programs and facilities as 

157 The 1989 decision modified 64 Comp. Gen. 789 (1985), which had found smoking 
cessation programs unauthorized. The 1985 case had correctly held that such programs 
were not a form of “medical care,” but had failed to properly evaluate them as preventive 
programs. 

Page 4-247 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

permissible preventive health services. Based on the revised regulations, an 
agency may now use appropriated funds to provide access to a private 
fitness center’s exercise facilities, although both GAO and OPM caution 
that expenditures of this type should be carefully monitored and should be 
undertaken only where all other resources have been considered and 
rejected. 70 Comp. Gen. 190 (1991). However, appropriated funds are not 
authorized for payment of: (1) employees’ membership fees to a contracted 
private fitness center in advance of employees’ use of facilities (B-288013, 
Dec. 11, 2001); or (2) registration fees for employee members of an 
agency’s on-site fitness center to participate in local competitive fitness or 
sports activities. Participation in such events is generally a personal 
activity, not an essential part of a government-sponsored preventive health 
program. 73 Comp. Gen. 169 (1994). 

Medical treatment not within the scope of 5 U.S.C. § 7901 remains subject 
to the general rule expressed in cases such as 22 Comp. Gen. 32. Thus, the 
cost of an ambulance called by an agency medical officer to take an 
employee to a hospital could not be paid from appropriated funds. 
B-160272, Nov. 14, 1966. (This is the kind of expense that can be covered by 
employee health insurance plans.) In another case, GAO rejected the 
contention that medical expenses are automatically “necessary expenses,” 
and concluded that Internal Revenue Service (IRS) appropriations were not 
available to reimburse the State Department for medical services provided 
to IRS overseas employees and their dependents under the Foreign Service 
Act of 1946. 53 Comp. Gen. 230 (1973). The decision noted that several 
other agencies had received specific statutory authority to participate in 
the program. 

A review of the decisions involving medical examinations will further 
illustrate the relationship of 5 U.S.C. § 7901 to the decisional rules. Prior to 
the enactment of section 7901, a pre-employment physical examination, the 
purpose of which was to determine an applicant’s eligibility for a federal 
job, was the applicant’s responsibility and was not chargeable to 
appropriated funds. 22 Comp. Gen. 243 (1942). 

Applying the “primary benefit of the government” standard, however, the 
Comptroller General found post-employment examinations permissible in 
certain situations. Thus, in 22 Comp. Gen. 32 (1942), GAO told the Army 
that it could use its appropriations to provide periodic physical 
examinations to detect arsenic poisoning in civilian workers in a chemical 
warfare laboratory. The decision noted that instances of arsenic poisoning 

Page 4-248 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

“might have a depressing effect on the morale of fellow workers”158 and 
might make it more difficult to find qualified people to do the work.159 In 
another case, a civilian employee joined the Army during World War II. He 
received a medical discharge, and thereafter applied for reinstatement to 
his former civilian job. GAO advised that the agency could pay for a 
physical examination which it required prior to reinstatement. 23 Comp. 
Gen. 746 (1944). 

In 1946, 5 U.S.C. § 7901 was enacted. Now, agencies have specific authority 
to include medical examinations, including pre-employment examinations, 
without charge to applicants, in the health programs they are authorized to 
establish. 30 Comp. Gen. 493 (1951). While the statute authorizes 
establishment of government programs, it does not authorize the 
reimbursement of privately incurred expenses. Thus, an applicant who 
declines to use an available government doctor for a pre-employment 
examination and instead chooses to have it performed by a private doctor 
may not be reimbursed. 31 Comp. Gen. 465 (1952). 

In situations not covered by the statute, the “primary benefit of the 
government” test continues to apply. Thus, based on the earlier precedents, 
the cost of medical examinations by private physicians was approved in the 
following cases: 

• 30 Comp. Gen. 387 (1951) (physical examinations of Department of 

Agriculture employees engaged in testing repellents and insecticides 

for use by the armed forces; no government medical facilities 

available). 

• 41 Comp. Gen. 531 (1962) (annual physical examinations for Saint 

Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation employees engaged in 

strenuous physical work, often under severe weather conditions; no 

public health facilities in area). 

The examinations in both of the above cases could have been included in an 
authorized health service program. As noted, however, facilities were not 
available in either case. Thus, since the examinations were for the primary 
benefit of the government, appropriated funds were available to have them 

158 The morale of the poisoned workers would not be particularly enhanced either. 

159 While this may sound heartless, the expenditure could be justified only if it was 
determined to be necessary to carry out the objects of the appropriation, and the 
appropriation in this instance was for chemical warfare service, not for employee health.

performed by private physicians. See also 73 Comp. Gen. 219 (1994) 
(National Transportation Safety Board could reimburse air safety 
investigators for the costs of physical exams required to obtain a Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate if the agency’s public 
health facility has no FAA-certified physician); B-286137, Feb. 21, 2001 

(U.S. Geological Survey could pay for eye examinations for employees 
whose work requires visual acuity, but may not pay for their prescription 
eyeglasses, which are personal and useful to employees who need them 
inside, as well as outside, the workplace). 
In 65 Comp. Gen. 677 (1986), the Navy could pay for a medical examination 
required for a private individual joining a government research exercise 
under invitational travel orders. Although government medical facilities 
were presumably available, there was no need to note this fact in the 
decision. Since the individual was neither a government employee nor an 
applicant for a government job, she could not be required to use the 
government facility and, since the Navy wanted her participation, it could 
not very well expect her to bear the expense. 

Conversely, in B-253159, Nov. 22, 1993, the costs of medical examinations 
performed by private physicians for two Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention employees and their dependents were not reimbursable 
because the examinations were neither required by the agency nor for the 
benefit of the government. The two employees and their dependents 
obtained the examinations in preparation for their relocation to 
assignments outside the United States. See also A. Carter, Jr., GSBCA 
No. 15435, 01-1 B.C.A. ¶ 31,404 (Apr. 9, 2001) (Department of Defense 
should reimburse its civilian employee for dependents’ immunizations, and 
may reimburse him for dependents’ physical examinations (both required 
to obtain return visas to the United States), if the Navy determines that the 
examinations were primarily for the benefit of the government). 

(2) Purchase of health-related items160 
The purchase of health-related items, while conceptually related to the 
medical care cases, is also an application of the “personal expense” rule set 
forth in 3 Comp. Gen. 433, cited at the beginning of this section, that 
personal equipment needed to qualify an employee to perform the regular 
duties of his or her position may not be paid from appropriated funds. The 

160 See also “Wearing Apparel” in section C.13.i for related cases. 

Page 4-250 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

rule is illustrated in B-187246, June 15, 1977. There, a Community Services 
Administration employee’s doctor had placed him under certain 
restrictions because of a back injury. Specifically, he was to use a “sacroease 
positioner” for his office chair and could drive cars only with a 
minimum 116-inch wheel base, bucket seats, and full power. While the 
equipment may have been necessary for that particular individual to 
perform his duties, it was not essential to the transaction of official 
business from the government’s standpoint. Therefore, the items could not 
be provided from appropriated funds. 

In B-166411, Sept. 3, 1975, an employee who, as a result of a back injury, 
needed a bedboard while traveling could not be reimbursed beyond the 
normal per diem. The bedboard was a personal expense. Similarly, 
gratuities for wheelchair services while traveling were held 
nonreimbursable in B-151701, July 3, 1963. 

A different type of situation arose in B-215640, Jan. 14, 1985. An agency 
asked whether it could purchase a heavy-duty office chair for an employee 
who needed extra physical support because he weighed over 300 pounds 
and had broken 15 regular chairs. While the particular type of chair in 
question was necessitated by the employee’s physical condition, it is 
nevertheless the case that an office chair is not “personal equipment” but is 
an item the government is normally expected to provide for its employees. 
The purchase was therefore authorized. 

Another exception occurred in 23 Comp. Gen. 831 (1944). There, GAO 
approved the rental of an amplifying device to be attached to an official 
telephone for use by an employee with a hearing handicap. The device was 
seen as a means of obtaining the best results from available personnel. The 
precedent value of this decision is somewhat speculative. On the one hand, 
the device would not become the property of the individual. Yet on the 
other hand, the decision seems to have been based largely on the difficulty 
of hiring “qualified” employees in view of the wartime draft situation. 
(Whether consideration was given to hiring women is not mentioned.) 

Generally, however, exceptions stem from some statutory basis. Thus, in 
56 Comp. Gen. 398 (1977), the Comptroller General approved the purchase 
of a motorized wheelchair for use by a Social Security Administration 
employee. The decision emphasized that a wheelchair is normally the 
employee’s personal expense. In this case, however, the employee had his 
own nonpowered wheelchair and needed a motorized wheelchair only 
because the agency had not complied with the Architectural Barriers Act of 

Page 4-251 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

1968. The wheelchair would, of course, become the property of the 
government and was approved only as a temporary expedient pending 
compliance with the statute. 

One important statute in this regard is the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
29 U.S.C. § 791. Pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act, federal agencies are 
required to make “reasonable accommodations” for the known physical or 
mental limitations of qualified employees with disabilities. See 29 C.F.R. 
§§ 1614.203(b), 1630.9(a). We discuss the Rehabilitation Act in the next 
section. 

Health-related items may also be authorized as “special protective 
equipment” under 5 U.S.C. § 7903, discussed later in this chapter in 
section C.13.i. Thus, prescription ground safety glasses may be purchased 
for employees engaged in hazardous duties. The glasses become and 
remain the property of the government. The government can also pay the 
cost of related eye refraction examinations in limited circumstances. 

51 Comp. Gen. 775 (1972). 

Relying on 3 Comp. Gen. 433 rather than 5 U.S.C. § 7903, GAO, in 45 Comp. 
Gen. 215 (1965), approved the purchase of special prescription filter 
spectacles and clinical eye examinations necessary to obtain the proper 
prescription for employees operating stereoscopic map plotting 
instruments. Employees who did not use special glasses frequently lost the 
required visual skills before reaching the normal retirement age. Also, the 
special glasses would be of no personal use to the employees except during 
working hours and would remain the property of the government. 
However, the purchase of eyeglasses for employees who work at video 
display terminals is not authorized. There is no applicable safety standard 
in the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 651–678, the work 
is not (or at least has not yet been found to be) hazardous to the eyes if 
proper care is used, and not all employees who work at terminals need 
eyeglasses. 63 Comp. Gen. 278 (1984). See also B-286137, Feb. 21, 2001 

(U.S. Geological Survey may use appropriated funds to provide eye 
examinations for certain employees for the benefit of the government, but 
it may not provide these employees with prescription eyeglasses that 
would not be for exclusive use at work).

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

The 1980s saw a veritable flood of cases involving the purchase of air 
purifiers (“smokeeaters”) as the campaign against smoking became a cause 
celebre. The rules, distilled from several decisions,161 are as follows: 

• Appropriated funds are not available to purchase air purifiers for the 

private office of an employee who objects to tobacco smoke unless the 

employee’s hypersensitivity to smoke qualifies him or her as 

handicapped under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 

• Air purifiers may be purchased for “common areas” such as reading 
rooms. 

• Air purifiers may be placed on the desks of employees who smoke if 
they will provide a general benefit to all employees working in the area. 

In 2002, consistent with Executive Order No. 13058, Protecting Federal 
Employees and the Public From Exposure to Tobacco Smoke in the 
Federal Workplace, 62 Fed. Reg. 43,451 (Aug. 9, 1997), the General Services 
Administration prohibited the smoking of tobacco products in all interior 
space owned, rented, or leased by the executive branch, and in any outdoor 
areas under executive branch control in front of air intake ducts. 41 C.F.R. 
§ 102-74.315. 

Another related line of decisions addresses the purchase of bottled 
drinking water for use in federal work facilities where the safety of 
municipal or locally provided water is at issue. Generally, appropriated 
funds are not available to pay for bottled water for the personal use of 
employees. GAO has made an exception where a building’s water supply is 
unhealthy or unpotable. See, for example, B-247871, Apr. 10, 1992, where a 
problem with the water supply system in a building caused lead content to 
exceed the maximum contaminant level and justified the purchase of 
bottled water for employees until the problems with the system could be 
resolved. 

(3) The Rehabilitation Act 
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701–797, 
establishes a federal policy in support of nondiscriminatory employment of 

161 64 Comp. Gen. 789 (1985), modified on other grounds, 68 Comp. Gen. 222 (1989); 
63 Comp. Gen. 115 (1983); 62 Comp. Gen. 653 (1983); 61 Comp. Gen. 634 (1982); B-213666, 
July 26, 1984; B-215108, July 23, 1984.

Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

individuals with a disability. Consistent with that policy, the federal 
government, its contractors, and federally funded entities are prohibited 
from discriminating against employees who have physical or mental 
impairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities but 
who can perform the essential functions of the position they hold (or apply 
for), with or without reasonable accommodation. 29 U.S.C. § 791; 29 C.F.R. 
§§ 1614.203, 1630(2). The Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to 
assume an affirmative leadership role in promoting the employment of 
qualified handicapped individuals. 29 U.S.C. § 791(b); see also 29 U.S.C. 
§ 701(b)(2). 

The Rehabilitation Act is related to the probably better known Americans 
With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336, title I, § 101, 
104 Stat. 330 (July 26, 1990), codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. Although 
the ADA does not apply to federal employers [42 U.S.C. § 12111(5)(B)(i); 29 

C.F.R. § 1630.2(e)(2)(i)], the ADA’s standards are used to determine 
whether agencies are in compliance with the Rehabilitation Act’s 
requirements for employment of qualified individuals with disabilities. 
29 U.S.C. § 791(g).162 Under Equal Employment Opportunity regulations, 
federal agencies are required to make “reasonable accommodations” for 
the known physical or mental limitations of qualified employees with 
disabilities, unless the accommodation(s) would impose an undue hardship 
on the agency’s program. 29 C.F.R. §§ 1630.9(a), 1614.203(b). See B-291208, 
Apr. 9, 2003; B-243300, Sept. 17, 1991. 
While GAO has no jurisdiction over substantive claims brought against 
federal agencies under the Rehabilitation Act, we have responded to 
agency inquiries concerning the propriety of using appropriated funds for 
expenditures or informal settlement awards under the Act. See 72 Comp. 
Gen. 111 (1993); 69 Comp. Gen. 470 (1990). Questions occasionally arise 
concerning whether an agency’s provision of a proposed, or requested, 
accommodation complies with federal appropriations principles (see, e.g., 
B-240271, Oct. 15, 1990); whether an expense claimed by an employee is 
reimbursable or must be borne by the employee (see, e.g., 68 Comp. 
Gen. 242 (1989)); or whether an item or service may appropriately be 
provided under the Rehabilitation Act as a reasonable accommodation, 

162 We note that Congress enacted the Rehabilitation Act in 1973. It modeled the now more 
familiar Americans With Disabilities Act on the Rehabilitation Act, adopting the same 
definition of “disability” and its interpretation by courts. 42 U.S.C. § 12201(a). See Toyota 
Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 193 (2002).

even though not initially viewed as such (see, e.g., B-291208, Apr. 9, 2003). 
We discuss these three decisions, and others, below. 

In addressing these questions, we recognize that agencies may expend 
appropriated funds to accomplish the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act 
when acting under the Act’s authority and the regulatory standards that 
govern its application. B-240271, Oct. 15, 1990. An expenditure that might 
be viewed as personal in nature but for the Rehabilitation Act is a proper 
use of an agency’s appropriation when incurred in satisfaction of the Act’s 
requirements. 

Thus, in B-240271, supra, GAO advised that the purchase of a motorized 
wheelchair for a quadriplegic employee who spent half of his time on 
official travel could be regarded as a “reasonable accommodation” under 
29 C.F.R. § 1630.9, on condition that the wheelchair remain the property of 
the government. Similarly, in B-243300, Sept. 17, 1991, GAO determined that 
an agency could pay for wheelchair van transportation as a reasonable 
accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act for an employee severely 
handicapped by cerebral palsy. The employee needed the service for 
assistance in returning home when her disability affected her at work in a 
manner that temporarily rendered her unable to walk. Since this condition 
occurred only about three times a year, the cost to the agency for the 
service would be minimal. 

The employment of reading assistants for blind employees and interpreting 
assistants for deaf employees is covered. Cf. 72 Comp. Gen. 305 (1993) (the 
Department of Education may pay for personal assistants for handicapped 
grant and compliance reviewers who are not federal employees as a cost of 
acquiring the personal services of these reviewers). 

The Rehabilitation Act has also been held applicable to parking expenses. 
As a general matter, parking incident to an employee’s commute between 
his residence and permanent duty station is a personal expense (see 
section C.13.k). However, if severely disabled employees must pay parking 
costs higher than those paid by nondisabled employees working at the 
same facility,163 the agency can subsidize the difference. 63 Comp. Gen. 270 
(1984); (see also B-291208, Apr. 9, 2003, discussed in detail in this chapter, 
section C.13.j). 

163 For example, the disabled employee may have to park closer to the facility at higher 
rates. 

Page 4-255 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Other types of personal expenses that have been recognized as reasonable 
accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act for employees with 
disabilities include— 

• Baggage handling fees, to the extent they were incurred as the result of 
the employee’s disability and exceeded similar expenses a non-disabled 
person would incur in a similar situation (68 Comp. Gen. 242 (1989)); 

• Additional subsistence expenses incurred by an employee who, with 
supervisory approval, began a required temporary duty assignment 
3 days early, driving from Denver through mountainous terrain to San 
Francisco, and delayed the return trip by 2 days because of a severe 
snowstorm. Under the circumstances the employee exercised good 
judgment and prudence by extending his travel time in view of his 
disability (64 Comp. Gen. 310 (1985)); 

• Shipment of an employee’s specially equipped vehicle in connection 
with a permanent change of duty station from California to Washington, 
D.C., which the agency clearly justified as a cost beneficial, reasonable 
accommodation under the circumstances (64 Comp. Gen. 30 (1984)); 
and 

• Travel expenses and per diem for an attendant accompanying an 
employee who was required to travel to an unfamiliar area in 
connection with a permanent change of duty station. The attendant’s 
travel expense and per diem constituted a necessary expense under the 
circumstances. 59 Comp. Gen. 461 (1980). 

The costs of structural changes to an employee’s home were not 
considered a reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. The 
employee had argued that the changes were required as a result of his 
assignment to a new permanent duty station. Even though the 
modifications were necessary to facilitate his mobility, they were made to 
his privately owned property, and therefore, did not constitute a 
“reasonable accommodation” under the statute or regulations. B-266286, 
Oct. 11, 1996. 

d. Office Furnishings An agency’s appropriations are available without question to furnish the 
(Decorative Items) space it occupies with such necessary items as desks, filing cabinets, and 
other ordinary office equipment. Questions occasionally arise when the 
item to be procured is decorative rather than utilitarian. 

Page 4-256 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

The availability of appropriations for certain decorative items has long 
been recognized. In 7 Comp. Dec. 1 (1900), the Comptroller of the Treasury 
advised the Secretary of the Treasury that “paintings suitable for the 
decoration of rooms” were within the meaning of the term “furniture.” 
Therefore, an appropriation for the furnishing of public buildings was 
available to purchase cases and glass coverings for paintings of deceased 
judges. The paintings had been donated to the government for display in a 
courtroom. 

The Comptroller followed this decision in 9 Comp. Dec. 807 (1903), holding 
that Treasury appropriations were available to buy portraits as furniture for 
the Ellis Island immigration station if administratively determined 
“necessary for the public service.” 

Citing both of these decisions, the Comptroller General held in B-178225, 
Apr. 11, 1973, that the appropriation for Salaries and Expenses of the Tax 
Court was available for portraits of the Chief Judges of the Tax Court, to be 
hung (the portraits, not the judges) in the main courtroom. Similarly, the 
Tax Court could purchase artwork and other decorative items for judges’ 
individual offices. 64 Comp. Gen. 796 (1985). 

Other decisions approving the use of appropriated funds for decorative 
items are B-143886, Sept. 14, 1960 (oil painting of agency head for 
“historical purposes” and public display); B-121909, Dec. 9, 1954 (“solid 
walnut desk mount attached to a name plate”); B-114692, May 13, 1953 
(framing of Presidential Certificates of Appointment for display in the 
appointee’s office). 

Purchase of decorative items for federal buildings is now covered in the 
Federal Property Management Regulations, 41 C.F.R. § 101.26.103-2 (2003). 
The regulations authorize expenditures for pictures, objects of art, plants, 
flowers (both artificial and real), and other similar items. However, such 
items may not be purchased solely for the personal convenience or to 
satisfy the personal desire of an official or employee. 

The regulation was discussed and the rule restated in 60 Comp. Gen. 580 
(1981). Decorative items may be purchased if the purchase is consistent 
with work-related objectives and the items to be purchased are not

e. Personal Qualification 
Expenses 
“personal convenience” items.164 The determination of “necessity” is within 
the agency’s discretion, subject to the regulations. The regulations apply 
equally to space leased by an agency in a privately owned building. See also 
64 Comp. Gen. 796 (1985); 63 Comp. Gen. 110, 113 (1983). 

As noted, one type of permissible decorative item is plants. A restriction in 
a 1980 appropriation act prohibited the use of funds for plant maintenance 
contracts. The Comptroller General construed this provision to apply to 
office space to which particular federal employees were actually assigned. 
The provisions legislative history suggested that it was not intended to 
apply to outdoor plants or to plants in common areas that were not the 
assigned work space of any particular employee or group of employees. 
59 Comp. Gen. 428 (1980). 

Generally, expenses necessary to qualify a government employee to do his 
or her job are personal expenses and not chargeable to appropriated funds. 
As stated in an early decision: 

“That which is required of a person to become invested with 
an office must be done at his own expense unless specific 
provision is made by law for payment by the Government.” 

2 Comp. Dec. 262, 263 (1895). Somewhat coldly, the Comptroller added, “if 
he does not desire the office, he need not accept it.” Id. See also United 
States v. Van Duzee, 140 U.S. 169, 171 (1891) (“it is the duty of persons 
receiving appointments from the government …to qualify themselves for 
the office”). 

In a 1994 decision, GAO recognized that federal law has subjected the 
federal government to state regulation in some areas, particularly in the 
area of environmental regulation, and concluded that where federal 
employees are required by federal law to comply with state and local 
licensing regulations, the employee’s agency can use appropriations to 
cover the cost of obtaining the license necessary to perform the regulated 
activity. 73 Comp. Gen. 171 (1994) (asbestos abatement license required by 
South Carolina; water treatment foreman’s license required by Texas; 

164 The decision also noted that the items must be for permanent rather than “seasonal” use. 
60 Comp. Gen. at 582. The rule prohibiting use of appropriated funds for seasonal (e.g., 
holiday) decorations has since been modified. See 67 Comp. Gen. 87 (1987), discussed in 
this chapter, section C.13.g.

pesticide and herbicide application license required by North Carolina). In 
that decision, GAO noted that federal law required that Air Force activities 
in these areas conform to the regulatory requirements of the states. 

“While the license or permit is often obtained in the name of 
the [Air Force] member, the primary interest in obtaining 
the license lies with the Air Force …Any personal benefit 
that Air Force members receive from the acquisition of the 
licenses is nominal and incidental to the performance of 
their official duties.” 

Id. at 173. GAO distinguished such licenses from the licensing requirements 
of professional personnel such as teachers, accountants, engineers, 
lawyers, doctors, and nurses. 

“These individuals are fully aware of the licensing 
requirements of their professions from the time they begin 
their professional education, and of the fact that society 
expects them to fully qualify themselves for the 
performance of their chosen professions. In that sense, the 
licensing requirements are considered to be more for the 
personal benefit of the individuals than for their employers.” 

Id. GAO noted, also, that driver’s licenses are considered for the personal 
benefit of the employee. Id. 

In 2001, Congress enacted legislation permitting agencies to use 
appropriations for “expenses for employees to obtain professional 
credentials, including expenses for professional accreditation, State-
imposed and professional licenses, and professional certification; and 
examinations to obtain such credentials.” Pub. L. No. 107-107, § 1112(a), 
115 Stat. 1238 (Apr. 12, 2001), codified at 5 U.S.C. § 5757.165 The statutory 
language does not create an entitlement; instead, it authorizes agencies to 
consider such expenses as payable from agency appropriations if the 
agency chooses to cover them. 

165 The reader should note that in Pub. L. No. 107-273, § 207(a), 116 Stat. 1757, 1779–1780 
(Nov. 2, 2002), Congress enacted another section 5757 of Title 5 of the United States Code. 
There are now two sections in the Code numbered 5757. They are not related.

Neither the statute nor its legislative history defines the terms “professional 
credentials,” “professional accreditation,” and “professional certification.” 
GAO has not had occasion to interpret and apply the statute. Nevertheless, 
the statute and the 1994 decision together appear to cover many, if not 
most, qualification expenses that GAO previously found to be personal to 
the employee, including actuarial accreditation (B-286026, June 12, 2001), 
licenses to practice medicine (B-277033, June 27, 1997), a Certified 
Government Financial Manager designation (B-260771, Oct. 11, 1995), and 
professional engineering certificates (B-248955, July 24, 1992). See also 
section C.12.b of this chapter for a discussion of attorneys’ bar membership 
fees. 

It is not clear whether the statute covers driver’s licenses. Historically, with 
a few exceptions, a driver’s license was considered a personal expense. 
21 Comp. Gen. 769, 772 (1942); 6 Comp. Gen. 432 (1926); c23 Comp. 
Dec. 386 (1917). An exception was recognized in B-115463, Sept. 18, 1953, 
for Army civilian employees on temporary duty (TDY) of at least 6 months’ 
duration in foreign countries, where the employees did not already possess 
drivers licenses, operating a motor vehicle was not part of the job for which 
the employees were hired, but the Army wanted to include driving as part 
of their TDY duties as a less expensive alternative to hiring additional 
personnel, and the license was required by the host country. See also 
B-257895, Oct. 28, 1994 (National Security Agency may pay for commercial 
licenses where the license benefited the Agency and was not a personal 
qualification for the employee’s position); B-87138-O.M., July 19, 1949 
(Virgin Islands). As noted above, in 73 Comp. Gen. 171, which concluded 
that agencies may pay for licenses required by certain state and local 
regulations, GAO expressly excluded driver’s licenses. 73 Comp. Gen. 
at 173 (“the cost of driver’s licenses are considered for the personal benefit 
of federal employees”). To the extent that an agency refers to the 2001 
statute as authority to pay the cost of an employee’s driver’s license, the 
agency will have to find that the license is a professional credential, 
professional accreditation, State-imposed and professional license, or 
professional certification. 

Another statute, 5 U.S.C. § 5945, specifically covers notary publics. It 
permits agencies to reimburse an employee whose job includes serving as a 
notary public the expense required to obtain the commission. 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5945. The expense is reimbursable even though the employee uses the 
notarial power for private as well as government business. 36 Comp. 
Gen. 465 (1956).

f. Photographs General rule: The cost of photographs of individual government employees 
is a personal expense not chargeable to appropriated funds in the absence 
of specific statutory authority. 31 Comp. Gen. 452 (1952). Thus, the 
dissemination to the press of photographs of a new agency official upon his 
appointment was held to be an improper expenditure in B-111336, Sept. 16, 
1952. 
The rule is intended to prevent the use of public funds for the personal 
publicity of a particular individual. Exceptions have accordingly been 
recognized where there is adequate justification that the expenditure is 
necessary to accomplish some purpose for which the appropriation was 
made. For example, the distribution of photographs of an area director of 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was held 
permissible in 47 Comp. Gen. 321 (1967) where the purpose was to increase 
cooperation with the EEOC by publicizing its activities and functions. The 
decision further pointed out that the expense was chargeable to the fiscal 
year in which the photographs were taken rather than the year in which 
they were actually used. 

Another acceptable justification is illustrated in B-123613, June 1, 1955, 
involving photographs of the Under Secretary of the Interior. One of the 
Under Secretary’s functions is to represent the Secretary in various parts of 
the country. The photographs were obtained in order to respond to 
requests by organizations in preparing programs or by the press, in 
connection with this official travel. Similar justifications were found 
sufficient in B-114344, May 19, 1953, and B-47547, Feb. 15, 1945. 

Photographs for use on identification cards or badges are permissible when 
administratively determined necessary to protect government property or 
for security reasons. 23 Comp. Gen. 494 (1944); 20 Comp. Gen. 566 (1941); 
20 Comp. Gen. 447 (1941); 2 Comp. Gen. 429 (1923). 

At one time, travel regulations did not provide for the reimbursement of 
passport photographs, and they were held to be nonreimbursable personal 
expenses unless and until the regulations should be amended. 9 Comp. 
Gen. 311 (1930). The regulations were subsequently amended and passport 
photographs are now reimbursable under 41 C.F.R. § 301-12.1 (2003). See 

52 Comp. Gen. 177 (1972). 

While earlier decisions state the rule in terms of photographs of individual 
employees, it applies to other photographs as well. The expense will be

g. Seasonal Greeting Cards 
and Decorations 
permitted where it clearly constitutes a means of effecting a proper agency 
function and disallowed where adequate justification does not exist. 

For example, distribution of photographs of a department store display 
was viewed as a proper means of carrying out a statutory function of 
encouraging public cooperation toward economic stabilization. B-113464, 
Jan. 29, 1953. Similar types of justification were found sufficient in 
B-175434, Apr. 11, 1972; B-113026, Jan. 19, 1953; and B-15278, May 15, 1942. 
However, inadequate justification was found in B-149493, Dec. 28, 1977, in 
which a group photograph of interagency participants in a training 
symposium, sent free to participants, was held a personal, rather than a 
necessary, expense. Similarly, photographs taken at the dedication of the 
Klondike Gold Rush Visitor Center to be sent by the National Park Service 
as “mementos” to persons attending the ceremony were disallowed as a 
personal gift in B-195896, Oct. 22, 1979. 

(1) Greeting cards 
The cost of seasonal greeting cards is a personal expense to be borne by the 
officer who ordered and sent them, and may not be charged to public funds. 

In a 1957 case, an agency with overseas posts wanted to send Christmas 
cards to “important individuals” in the countries where the posts were 
located. The agency tried to justify the expense as a means of disseminating 
information and thereby to promote mutual understanding. The 
Comptroller General ruled, however, that the expense was a personal one 
and could not be paid from the agency’s appropriations. 37 Comp. Gen. 360 
(1957). As to the purported justification, the Comptroller General said “it 
seems to us that very little, if any, information in that regard is contained on 
the ordinary Christmas greeting card.” Id. at 361. See also 7 Comp. Gen. 481 
(1928); B-247563.4, Dec. 11, 1996; B-115132, June 17, 1953. 

It is immaterial that the card is “nonpersonal,” that is, sent by the agency 
and not containing the names of any individuals. The expenditure is still 
improper. 47 Comp. Gen. 314 (1967); B-156724, July 7, 1965. 

In 47 Comp. Gen. 314, it was also held immaterial that the expenditure had 
been charged to a trust fund in which donations, which the agency was 
statutorily authorized to accept, had been deposited. 

Transmitting the greetings in the form of a letter rather than a card does 
not legitimize the expenditure. In 64 Comp. Gen. 382 (1985), an agency 

Page 4-262 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


h. Traditional Ceremonies 
Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

head sent out a letter stating that the entire staff of the agency “joins me in 
wishing you a joyous holiday. We look forward to working with you and 
your staff throughout the coming year.” A Member of Congress questioned 
the propriety of sending these letters in penalty mail envelopes. GAO noted 
that the letter “transacts no official business” and “is the essence of a 
Christmas card.” Id. at 384. Therefore, the costs should not have been 
charged to appropriated funds. 

While all of the above cases deal with Christmas greetings, the rule would 
presumably apply equally to other holiday or seasonal cards. It would also 
apply to “greetings” not tied in to any particular holiday. B-149151, July 20, 
1962 (“thank you for hospitality” cards). The point is that while sending 
greetings may be a nice gesture, it is not the sort of thing that should be 
charged to the taxpayers. 

(2) Seasonal decorations 
Prior to 1987, based in part on the reasoning that seasonal decorations are 
significantly different from ordinary office furnishings designed for 
permanent use, it had been GAO’s position that Christmas decorations 
(trees, lights, ornaments, etc.) were not a proper charge to appropriated 
funds. 52 Comp. Gen. 504 (1973); B-163764, Feb. 25, 1977 (nondecision 
letter). 

In 1987, GAO overruled 52 Comp. Gen. 504, concluding that the rules for 
office decorations should be the same whether the decorations are 
seasonal or permanent. 67 Comp. Gen. 87 (1987). Thus, seasonal 
decorations are now permissible “where the purchase is consistent with 
work-related objectives [such as enhancement of morale], agency or other 
applicable regulations, and the agency mission, and is not primarily for the 
personal convenience or satisfaction of a government employee.” Id. at 88. 
See also B-226781, Jan. 11, 1988. In implementing this decision, agencies 
should be appropriately sensitive (whatever that means) with respect to 
the display of religious symbols. 67 Comp. Gen. at 89. 

The rationale of 67 Comp. Gen. 87 does not apply to Christmas cards, 
which remain “basically individual good will gestures and are not part of a 
general effort to improve the work environment.” Id. See also B-247563.4, 
Dec. 11, 1996. 

Expenditures that might otherwise be prohibited as personal may be 
permissible when they are incurred incident to certain traditional 

Page 4-263 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

ceremonies. Groundbreaking ceremonies and dedication ceremonies for 
the laying of cornerstones in public buildings are the most common 
examples of such traditional ceremonies. 

For example, in B-158831, June 8, 1966, the cost of flowers used as 
centerpieces at a dedication ceremony was held to be a proper 
expenditure. See also B-247563.4, Dec. 11, 1996 (floral centerpiece for use 
at awards ceremony). Similarly, the cost of engraving and chrome-plating a 
ceremonial shovel used in a groundbreaking ceremony was viewed as a 
necessary expense of the ceremony. 53 Comp. Gen. 119 (1973). In the cited 
decision, however, the voucher could not be paid because there was no 
evidence as to who authorized the work, where the shovel originated, the 
subsequent use to be made of the shovel, and why there was a year’s delay 
between the ceremony and the engraving. 

Expenses necessarily incident to a groundbreaking or cornerstone 
ceremony are chargeable to the appropriation for the construction of the 
building. B-158831, June 8, 1966; B-11884, Aug. 26, 1940 (cost of printing 
programs and invitations to cornerstone ceremony); A-88307, Aug. 21, 1937 
(recording of presidential speech and group photograph at cornerstone 
ceremony); B-107165-O.M., Apr. 3, 1952 (cost of dedication ceremony). But 
see B-250450, May 3, 1993 (grand opening of a new cafeteria located inside 
an existing federal building does not fall within the “traditional ceremony” 
exception. Costs of food and entertainment provided for this event are not 
payable from appropriations for operating expenses, but may be 
chargeable to reception and representation funds then available). 

In 56 Comp. Gen. 81 (1976), the rationale of these cases was extended to 
Armed Forces change of command ceremonies. The decision held that the 
cost of printing invitations to a change of command ceremony for a Coast 
Guard vessel could be paid from the Coast Guard’s appropriations for 
operating expenses. In view of the traditional role of change of command 
ceremonies in the military, the Comptroller General concluded that the 
invitations were not inherently personal. (The case was therefore 
distinguishable from the decisions previously discussed prohibiting the use 
of public funds for business cards and greeting cards.) However, since 
expenditure of operating funds had not been approved for the costs of a 
reception following the change of command ceremony as required by Army 
regulations, those costs were determined to be payable from official 
reception and representation funds (for which the agency required no prior 
approval) because these activities met the prerequisites for an “official 
reception for an incoming commander.” 69 Comp. Gen. 242 (1990). (See

section C.5 of this chapter for a more general discussion of related subject 
matter.) 

The “traditional ceremony” concept has also been applied to a vessel 
“christening” ceremony at a Navy Yard (A-74436, May 19, 1936), a 
Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences annual graduation 
ceremony (B-211700, Mar. 16, 1984), and a Federal Law Enforcement 
Training Center’s graduation ceremony (B-240365.2, Mar. 14, 1996). 

The starting point is the principle that “every employee of the Government 
is required to present himself for duty properly attired according to the 
requirements of his position.” 63 Comp. Gen. 245, 246 (1984), quoting from 
B-123223, June 22, 1955. In other words, the government will not clothe the 
naked, at least where the naked are receiving government salaries. 

Nevertheless, there are certain out-of-the-ordinary items, required by the 
nature of the job, which the government should furnish. The test was 
described in 3 Comp. Gen. 433 (1924), and that discussion is still relevant 
today: 

“In the absence of specific statutory authority for the 
purchase of personal equipment, particularly wearing 
apparel or parts thereof, the first question for consideration 
in connection with a proposed purchase of such equipment 
is whether the object for which the appropriation involved 
was made can be accomplished as expeditiously and 
satisfactorily from the Government’s standpoint, without 
such equipment. If it be determined that use of the 
equipment is necessary in the accomplishment of the 
purposes of the appropriation, the next question to be 
considered is whether the equipment is such as the 
employee reasonably could be required to furnish as part of 
the personal equipment necessary to enable him to perform 
the regular duties of the position to which he was appointed 
or for which his services were engaged. Unless the answer 
to both of these questions is in the negative, public funds 
can not be used for the purchase. In determining the first of 
these questions there is for consideration whether the 
Government or the employee receives the principal benefit 
resulting from use of the equipment and whether an 
employee reasonably could be required to perform the 
service without the equipment. In connection with the 

Page 4-265 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

second question the points ordinarily involved are whether 
the equipment is to be used by the employee in connection 
with his regular duties or only in emergencies or at 
infrequent intervals and whether such equipment is 
assigned to an employee for individual use or is intended for 
and actually to be used by different employees.” 

Id. at 433–34. Under the rule set forth in 3 Comp. Gen. 433, most items of 
apparel were held to be the personal responsibility of the employee. E.g., 
5 Comp. Gen. 318 (1925) (rubber boots and coats for custodial employees 
in a flood-prone area); 2 Comp. Gen. 258 (1922) (coats and gloves for 
government drivers). But there were limited exceptions. Thus, caps and 
gowns for staff workers at Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington were 
viewed as for the protection of the patients rather than the employees and 
could therefore be provided from appropriated funds as part of the hospital 
equipment. 2 Comp. Gen. 652 (1923). See also 5 Comp. Gen. 517 (1926). 
Similarly, aprons for general laboratory use were held permissible in 
2 Comp. Gen. 382 (1922). Another exception was wading trousers for 
Geological Survey engineers as long as the trousers remained the property 
of the government and were not for the regular use of any particular 
employee. 4 Comp. Gen. 103 (1924). One category of apparel not 
permissible under the early decision was uniforms. Uniforms were viewed 
as personal furnishings to be procured at the expense of the wearer. 
24 Comp. Dec. 44 (1917). 

There are now three general statutory provisions that permit the purchase 
of items of apparel from appropriated funds in certain circumstances. 

The first is 5 U.S.C. § 7903, enacted as part of the Administrative Expenses 
Act of 1946. It provides: 

“Appropriations available for the procurement of supplies 
and material or equipment are available for the purchase 
and maintenance of special clothing and equipment for the 
protection of personnel in the performance of their assigned 
tasks. For the purpose of this section, ‘appropriations’ 
includes funds made available by statute [to wholly owned 
government corporations].” 

Id. (explanatory information provided). In order for an item to be 
authorized by 5 U.S.C. § 7903, three tests must be met: (1) the item must be 
“special” and not part of the ordinary and usual furnishings an employee 

Page 4-266 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

may reasonably be expected to provide for himself; (2) the item must be for 
the benefit of the government, that is, essential to the safe and successful 
accomplishment of the work, and not solely for the protection of the 
employee, and (3) the employee must be engaged in hazardous duty. See 
32 Comp. Gen. 229 (1952); B-193104, Jan. 9, 1979. Thus, this provision is but 
a slight liberalization of the rule in 3 Comp. Gen. 433. 

Applying 5 U.S.C. § 7903, the Comptroller General has held that raincoats 
and umbrellas for employees who must frequently go out in the rain are not 
special equipment but are personal items that the employee must furnish. 
B-193104, Jan. 9, 1979; B-122484, Feb. 15, 1955. Similarly unauthorized are 
coveralls for mechanics (B-123223, June 22, 1955) and running shoes for 
Department of Energy nuclear materials couriers (B-234091, July 7, 1989). 
Nor does 5 U.S.C. § 7903 authorize reimbursement for ordinary clothing 
and toiletry items purchased by narcotics agents on a “moving” 
surveillance. B-179057, May 14, 1974. 

An illustration of the type of apparel authorized by 5 U.S.C. § 7903 is found 
in 51 Comp. Gen. 446 (1972). There, the Comptroller General advised the 
Department of Agriculture that snowmobile suits, mittens, boots, and crash 
helmets for personnel required to operate snowmobiles over rough and 
remote forest terrain were clearly authorized by the statute. Similarly 
authorized are down-filled parkas for Office of Surface Mining employees 
temporarily assigned to Alaska or the high country of the western states. 
63 Comp. Gen. 245 (1984).166 Conversely, the purchase of insulated 
coveralls by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the use of employees 
working outdoors in near-freezing temperatures would be an improper use 
of appropriated funds, absent the agency’s determination that such cold 
weather clothing is necessary to satisfy Occupational Safety and Health Act 
standards, discussed in more detail below. B-289683, Oct. 7, 2002; B-288828, 
Oct. 3, 2002. 

Items other than wearing apparel may be furnished under 5 U.S.C. § 7903 if 
the tests set forth above have been met. See, e.g., 28 Comp. Gen. 236 (1948) 
(mosquito repellent for certain Forest Service employees). 

166 The distinction between this case and the “foul weather” cases cited in the preceding 
paragraph is that an employee is expected to provide his or her own clothing suitable for the 
climate in which the employee normally works or resides. See B-230820, Apr. 25, 1988 
(nondecision letter). For example, it is not reasonable to expect an employee who normally 
lives and works in Florida to own clothing suitable for Alaska in January.

Continuing the old rule, however, the Comptroller General held that 
5 U.S.C. § 7903 does not constitute general authority for the purchase of 
uniforms. 32 Comp. Gen. 229 (1952). 

Congress addressed the uniform problem with the second general statutory 
provision under consideration, 5 U.S.C. § 5901, the so-called Federal 
Employees Uniform Act, most recently amended by section 202 of the 
Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990, contained in section 529 
of the fiscal year 1991 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government 
Appropriation Act, Pub. L. No. 101-509, 104 Stat. 1389, 1456 (Nov. 5, 
1990)1456 (Nov. 5, 1990). This provision authorizes annual appropriations 
to each agency, on a showing of necessity or desirability, to provide a 
uniform allowance of up to $400 a year (or more if authorized under Office 
of Personnel Management regulations) to each employee who wears a 
uniform in the performance of official duties. The agency may pay a cash 
allowance or may furnish the uniform. 

Note that 5 U.S.C. § 5901 is merely an authorization of appropriations. An 
appropriation is still required in order for payments to be made or 
obligations incurred. 35 Comp. Gen. 306 (1955). While the decision stated 
that specific appropriation language is preferable, it recognized that the 
inclusion of an item for uniforms in an agency’s budget request that is then 
incorporated into a lump-sum appropriation is legally sufficient. 

An example of an item that could properly be required under 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5901 is frocks for Department of Agriculture meat grader employees. 
57 Comp. Gen. 379, 383 (1978). Another example is robes for administrative 
law judges of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. 
B-199492, Sept. 18, 1980. (The decision concluded merely that the 
expenditure would be legal, not that it was an especially good idea, 
pointing out that federal judges pay for their own robes.) 

In 48 Comp. Gen. 678 (1969), a National Park Service employee was given a 
uniform allowance but, in less than a year, was promoted to a higher 
position that required substantially different uniforms. The Comptroller 
General held that the employee could receive the uniform allowance of his 
new position even though the sum of the two allowances would exceed the 
statutory annual ceiling. To hold otherwise would have been inconsistent 
with the statutory purpose. 

While the uniform allowance under 5 U.S.C. § 5901 may be in cash or in 
kind, there is no similar option for “special clothing or equipment” under 

Page 4-268 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

5 U.S.C. § 7903. The latter statute authorizes the furnishing of covered 
items in kind only. 46 Comp. Gen. 170 (1966). 

The third piece of legislation that may permit the purchase of items of 
apparel from appropriated funds is the Occupational Safety and Health Act 
of 1970 (OSHA). Section 19 of OSHA, 29 U.S.C. § 668, requires each federal 
agency to establish an occupational safety and health program and to 
acquire necessary safety and protective equipment. Thus, protective 
clothing may be furnished by the government if the agency head 
determines that it is necessary under OSHA and its implementing 
regulations. 

Under the OSHA authority, the following items have been held permissible: 

• Snowmobile suits, mittens, boots, and crash helmets for Department of 
Agriculture employees required to operate snowmobiles over rough 
and remote terrain. 51 Comp. Gen. 446 (1972). (This decision has 
already been noted in the discussion of 5 U.S.C. § 7903 above. The 
decision held that the items were justifiable on either basis.) 

• Down-filled parkas for Interior Department employees temporarily 
assigned to Alaska or the high country of the western states during the 
winter months. 63 Comp. Gen. 245 (1984). (This decision is also noted 
under 5 U.S.C. § 7903. As with 51 Comp. Gen. 446, the items could be 
justified under either statute.) 

• Protective footwear for Drug Enforcement Administration agents 
assigned to temporary duty in jungle environments. The footwear 
remains the property of the United States and must be disposed of in 
accordance with the Federal Property Management Regulations. 

B-187507, Dec. 23, 1976. 

• Cooler coats and gloves for Department of Agriculture meat grader 
employees. 57 Comp. Gen. 379 (1978). 

• Ski boots for Forest Service snow rangers, where determined to be 
necessary protective equipment in a job-hazard analysis. B-191594, 
Dec. 20, 1978. 

• Steel-toe safety shoes for an Internal Revenue Service supply clerk 
whose work includes moving heavy objects. 67 Comp. Gen. 104 (1987). 
This item also could have been justified under 5 U.S.C. § 7903. Id. 

Page 4-269 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

If an item is authorized under OSHA, it is unnecessary to determine 
whether it meets the tests under 5 U.S.C. § 7903. E.g., B-187507, supra. As 
noted in the above listing, however, several of the decisions have discussed 
both statutes. If an item does not qualify under OSHA, it is still necessary to 
examine the other possibilities. E.g. B-234091, July 7, 1989 (running shoes 
unauthorized under either statute). 

Thus, three statutes under which purchase of wearing apparel may be 
authorized are 5 U.S.C. § 7903 (special clothing for hazardous 
occupations), 5 U.S.C. § 5901 (uniform allowances), and 29 U.S.C. § 668 
(protective clothing under OSHA). Two decisions summarizing all three 
statutes are 63 Comp. Gen. 245 (1984) and B-289683, Oct. 7, 2002. Some 
agencies also have specific authority to provide uniforms or clothing 
allowances to their employees. See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. §§ 775 and 1593; 
22 U.S.C. §§ 1474(14), 2396(a)(12), and 2669(e); and 37 U.S.C. §§ 415–419. 
However, if neither general nor specific authorities apply, then the rule of 
3 Comp. Gen. 433 continues to govern. For example, in B-251189, Apr. 8, 
1993, GAO held that the costs of business suits worn by Agency for 
International Development chauffeurs may not be reimbursed. Such suits 
are not uniforms under section 636(a)(12) of the Foreign Service Act of 
1961 (22 U.S.C. § 2396(a)(12)) since they are worn as a part of customary 
business attire and provide no distinctive identification of the employees as 
a group. As such, the suits are a personal expense of the employees. 

Another illustration of the continued applicability of the decisional rules is 
the rental of formal evening wear, a situation which, thus far at least, no 
one has suggested fits under any of the three statutes. 

In a 1955 case, an employee on travel status in England rented a dinner 
jacket to attend a dinner related to the purposes of the trip. Based on the 
rule of 3 Comp. Gen. 433, the Comptroller General denied reimbursement 
for the cost of renting the jacket. 35 Comp. Gen. 361 (1955). “The claimant’s 
failure to take with him necessary clothing to meet reasonably anticipated 
personal necessities is not considered sufficient to shift the burden of the 
cost of procuring such clothing from personal to official business.” Id. 
at 362. This decision was followed in a similar situation involving the rental 
of a tuxedo in 45 Comp. Gen. 272 (1965), and again in 64 Comp. Gen. 6 
(1984). But see B-256936, June 22, 1995 (the Department of State may use 
its representation appropriation funds to reimburse rental costs for formal 
morning attire required by Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission in 
representing the United States on occasions of State in Great Britain).

j. Miscellaneous Personal 
Expenses 
A different situation was presented in 48 Comp. Gen. 48 (1968), in which it 
was held that the Secret Service could pay the rental charges on formal 
dress attire required to be used by special agents when attending formal 
functions incident to their furnishing protective services to persons whom 
they are assigned to protect. In this situation, the purpose of the formal 
attire is not merely to be “socially acceptable,” but is necessary for security 
purposes, to make the agents less readily identifiable as such. See also 

71 Comp. Gen. 447 (1992). 

Similarly, in the not-too-distant past, attorneys arguing before the Supreme 
Court were required to wear formal cutaway coats and striped pants. In 
B-164811, July 28, 1969, GAO approved reimbursement for the rental of 
these items by Justice Department attorneys who were only occasionally 
required to appear before the Supreme Court. A more recent case restating 
the rules is 67 Comp. Gen. 592 (1988) (advising agency to resolve certain 
conflicting information and pay or deny the claim accordingly). 

Finally, the rules we have been discussing for wearing apparel apply to 
government employees. Questions may arise with respect to 
nongovernment employees, in which event the answer is a pure application 
of the necessary expense doctrine, in light of whatever statutory authority 
may exist. For example, in B-62281, Dec. 27, 1946, the State Department 
was administering a training program for citizens of the Philippines to 
assist in post-war rehabilitation. The decision held that the government 
could provide “special purpose” clothing required for the training, such as 
uniforms, overalls, or work aprons. However, this could not include the 
furnishing of complete wardrobes adaptable to the cooler climate of the 
United States; this was a personal expense. See also 29 Comp. Gen. 507 
(1950) (clothing for indigent narcotic patients upon release from Public 
Health Service Hospitals, as therapeutic measure to aid rehabilitation). 

Several personal expense matters are dealt with elsewhere in this chapter, 
for example, the sections on entertainment and membership fees. Apart 
from those topics specifically covered elsewhere, the preceding portions of 
this section cover the situations that have generated the largest number of 
cases. There are, however, other frequently encountered situations. 

(1) Commuting and parking 
One personal expense everyone is familiar with is commuting to and from 
work (more precisely, between permanent residence and permanent duty 
location). The employee is expected to be at work; how the employee 

Page 4-271 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

chooses to get there is entirely his or her own business. 27 Comp. Gen. 1 
(1947); 16 Comp. Gen. 64 (1936). 

Along with commuting goes parking. It is equally clear that parking 
incident to ordinary commuting is also a personal expense. 63 Comp. 
Gen. 270 (1984); 43 Comp. Gen. 131 (1963); B-162021, July 6, 1977. These 
cases stand for the proposition that the government may not be required to 
provide parking facilities for its employees. However, an agency may 
provide employee parking facilities if it determines that the lack of parking 
facilities will significantly impair the operating efficiency of the agency and 
will be detrimental to the hiring and retention of personnel. 72 Comp. 
Gen. 139 (1993); 49 Comp. Gen. 476 (1970); B-168946, Feb. 26, 1970; 
B-155372-O.M., Nov. 6, 1964. If severely disabled employees are forced to 
pay parking costs higher than those paid by nondisabled employees 
working at the same facility,167 the agency can subsidize the difference. 
63 Comp. Gen. 270 (1984). For further information, see the Rehabilitation 
Act discussion in this chapter, section C.13.c. 

As several of the cases cited in the preceding paragraph discuss, agencies 
must generally obtain parking accommodations through the General 
Services Administration (GSA) under the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 377 
(June 30, 1949)), unless they have independent statutory authority or a 
delegation from GSA. See generally 40 U.S.C. §§ 581 et seq. GSA regards a 
delegation of authority to lease parking facilities as a delegation of 
authority to enter into a service contract, which can be approved at the 
regional level, rather than a delegation of leasing authority. 41 C.F.R. § 102


73.235(2003). If an agency has independent statutory or delegated 
authority to procure space and facilities and has made the requisite morale 
and efficiency determinations, it may provide for employee parking in a 
collective bargaining agreement. See 55 Comp. Gen. 1197 (1976). 
A governmentwide provision in the fiscal year 1991 Treasury, Postal 
Service, and General Government Appropriation Act authorizes federal 
agencies to participate in state or local government programs designed to 
encourage employees to use public transportation. Pub. L. No. 101-509, 
§ 629, 104 Stat. 1389, 1478 (Nov. 5, 1990). Thus, an agency could use its 
general operating appropriations to subsidize the use of discounted transit 
passes by its employees. The “subsidy” is not additional pay for purposes of 

167 For example, the disabled employee may have to park closer to the facility at higher rates.

the prohibition in 5 U.S.C. § 5536. Id. See also B-243677, B-243674, May 13, 
1991. The legislation had a sunset date of December 31, 1993. In 1993, 
5 U.S.C. § 7905 was enacted, which authorizes each agency head to 
establish a program to encourage employees to use means other than single 
occupancy motor vehicles to commute to and from work. 

The purposes of this authority are to improve air quality and reduce traffic 
congestion. 5 U.S.C. § 7905 note. Programs established under section 7905 
may include such options as: transit passes or cash reimbursements for 
transit passes; furnishing space, facilities, or services to bicyclists; and 
nonmonetary incentives. 5 U.S.C. § 7905(b)(2). On April 21, 2000, the 
President issued Executive Order No. 13150, set out at 5 U.S.C. § 7905 note, 
requiring federal agencies to implement a transportation fringe benefit 
program under the authority of section 7905 no later than October 1, 2000. 

In B-291208, Apr. 9, 2003, the Commission on Civil Rights asked whether 
parking benefits for employees with disabilities, who commute to work in 
privately owned vehicles rather than by mass transit or in vanpools, may be 
included in the federal government’s transportation fringe benefit program. 
In this case, the parking fees could not be paid under the program 
authorized by 5 U.S.C. § 7905 and E xecutive Order No. 13150, since 
payment would encourage employees to use privately owned vehicles for 
commuting contrary to the stated purposes of the program. However, GAO 
noted that, if the Commission employees with disabilities pay substantially 
more to park closer to the building than employees without disabilities, the 
differential portion may be paid under our holding in 63 Comp. Gen. 270 
(1984). 

(2) Flexiplace 
An emerging issue for the federal government is “flexiplace.” Employees on 
flexiplace schedules, also called telecommuting or telework, typically work 
at home but can work at other agency-approved locations. Over the past 
several years, both the President and Congress have increasingly sought to 
encourage more widespread use of flexiplace. In 1994, then President 
Clinton directed the head of each executive department or agency to 
establish a program to encourage and support the expansion of flexible 
family-friendly work arrangements, including telecommuting and satellite 
locations. Memorandum, Expanding Family-Friendly Work 
Arrangements in the Executive Branch, 30 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 
1468, 59 Fed. Reg. 36017 (July 11, 1994). In section 260 of the Treasury, 
Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 

Page 4-273 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

1996, Congress enacted permanent authority for federal agencies to spend 
money for the installation of telephone lines and related equipment in an 
employees residence and pay monthly fees for an employee authorized to 
work at home. Pub. L. No. 104-52, § 620, 106 Stat. 468, 501 (Nov. 19, 1995) 
(31 U.S.C. § 1348 note). Federal telework centers were authorized in 
40 U.S.C. § 587, and executive agencies are required to make at least 
$50,000 available annually for expenses necessary to carry out a flexiplace 
work program. 40 U.S.C. § 587(d)(2). More recently, section 359 of the 2001 
Department of Transportation Appropriations Act required all executive 
agencies to establish a policy under which eligible employees may 
participate in telecommuting. The law also directed the Office of Personnel 
Management to ensure that this requirement was applied to 25 percent of 
the federal workforce by April 2001 and to an additional 25 percent each 
year thereafter. Pub. L. No. 106-346, § 101(a) [title III, § 359], 114 Stat. 1356, 
1356A-36 (Oct. 23, 2000). 

While telephone lines and related equipment may be provided by the 
agency, increased utility expenses (heating, air conditioning, lighting, etc.) 
incurred by the employee by virtue of working at home are personal 
expenses and may not be reimbursed in the absence of statutory authority. 
68 Comp. Gen. 502 (1989). As the decision points out, along with the 
increased utility costs, the employee also incurs savings from reduced 
commuting, child care, meal, and/or clothing expenses. “How the balance 
should be struck, if at all, …is a legislative judgment.” Id. at 506. The fact 
that the employee is participating in a mandatory work-at-home program, 
as opposed to voluntary, does not matter. The incremental costs of utilities 
associated with the residential workplace may not be reimbursed. 

70 Comp. Gen. 631 (1991). 

(3) Miscellaneous employee expenses 
Personal expense questions may occur in contexts that arise infrequently 
and for which there is little precedent. The rationale of the decisions cited 
and discussed throughout this section should provide the approach 
necessary to analyze the problem. 

For example, the Forest Service requested a lodge owner to furnish lodging 
and meals to a group of summer employees on temporary duty on a forest 
project in Maine. While the Forest Service made the request on behalf of the 
employees, it did not contract directly with the lodge owner. The individual 
employees received a per diem allowance and were expected to settle their 
own accounts with the lodge. One of the employees left at the end of the 

Page 4-274 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

summer without paying his bill and the lodge owner filed a claim against 
the government. Under these circumstances, the unpaid bill was nothing 
more than a personal debt of the individual and there was therefore no 
basis for government liability. B-191110, Sept. 25, 1978. (Had the 
government contracted directly with the lodge, the result might have been 
different. See section on canceled hotel reservations in Chapter 12 
(Volume III of the second edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations 
Law).) 

In another case, the Navy asked whether it could use appropriated funds to 
buy luggage for use by members of the Navy’s Recruit Mobile Training 
Team. Normally, luggage is a personal expense. The employee who travels 
on government business is generally expected to provide his or her own 
luggage. In this case, however, the members of the team traveled an 
average of 26 weeks a year. The Comptroller General applied the test set 
forth in 3 Comp. Gen. 433 (1924), discussed at various points throughout 
this section, and accepted the Navy’s judgment that it would be 
unreasonable to require the team members to furnish their own luggage in 
view of this excessive amount of travel. Therefore, Navy could buy the 
luggage, but only on the conditions that it would become Navy property 
and be stored in Navy facilities. In other words, the members could not use 
the luggage for any personal business. B-200154, Feb. 12, 1981. The 
Comptroller General declined to state a precise rule as to how much travel 
is enough to justify government purchase of luggage, and emphasized that 
the purchase would be permitted only in highly unusual circumstances. 

The payment of a federal employee’s union dues is the employee’s personal 
obligation even though payment by payroll withholding is authorized. If an 
agency wrongfully fails to withhold the dues, it may use appropriated funds 
to reimburse the labor union, but must then recover the payment from the 
employee unless the debt can be waived. 60 Comp. Gen. 93 (1980); 
B-235386, Nov. 16, 1989. 

Another personal expense issue concerns payments for professional 
liability insurance. As discussed in section C.3.c of this chapter, concerning 
lawsuits against employees, certain federal employees may be vulnerable 
to civil tort suits by plaintiffs alleging that they have been injured by the 
actions of the employees. Where liability is established, plaintiffs may be 
awarded compensatory damages, and in appropriate cases punitive 
damages, which the federal employee- defendants would be required to 
pay. Consequently, government employees whose jobs place them in 

Page 4-275 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

positions where they risk being sued may purchase liability insurance as a 
protection against such suits. See B-211883-O.M., Dec. 14, 1983. 

In 1996, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the reimbursement of 
“qualified employees” of the executive and legislative branches for up to 
one-half the costs incurred by such employees for professional liability 
insurance. Pub. L. No. 104-208, title VI, § 636, 110 Stat. 3009-363 to 3009-364 
(Sept. 30, 1996). A qualified employee is an agency employee whose 
position is that of a law enforcement officer or a supervisor or management 
official. These reimbursements were to be paid from amounts appropriated 
for Salaries and Expenses. 

In 1998, Congress amended the law to include as qualified employees 
justices, judges, judicial officers, supervisors, and managers within the 
judicial branch. Pub. L. No. 105-277, title VI, § 644, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-526 
(Oct. 21, 1998). Then, in 1999, Congress once again amended the law to 
make the reimbursement mandatory as of October 1, 1999. Pub. L. No. 10658, 
title VI, § 642(a), 113 Stat. 430, 477 (Sept. 29, 1999). These provisions 
were not enacted in the form of an amendment or addition to Title 5 of the 
United States Code, although their text is set out as an uncodified note 
under subchapter IV, “Miscellaneous Expenses,” preceding 5 U.S.C. § 5941. 
See generally B-300866, May 30, 2003. 

14. Rewards This section discusses when appropriated funds may be used to offer and 
pay rewards. As a general proposition, statutory authority is needed. 
Exactly how explicit this statutory authority has to be depends somewhat 
on the nature of the information or services for which the reward is 
contemplated and its relationship to the authority of the paying agency. 
a. Rewards to Informers (1) Reward as “necessary expense” 
One group of decisions deals with rewards for the furnishing of information 
regarding violations of civil and criminal laws. The rule is that, if the 
information is “essential or necessary” to the effective administration and 
enforcement of the laws, a reward may be offered if it can be tied in to a 

Page 4-276 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

particular appropriation under the “necessary expense” theory.168 In that 
situation, the statutory authority does not have to expressly provide for the 
payment of rewards. If, however, the information is merely “helpful or 
desirable,” then more explicit statutory authority is needed. Since the 
distinction is difficult to administer as a practical matter, statutory 
authority has been granted in many situations.169 

The Comptroller General addressed the issue in 8 Comp. Gen. 613, 614 
(1929), stating: 

“An appropriation general in terms is available to do the 
things essential to the accomplishment of the work 
authorized by the appropriation to be done. As to whether 
such an appropriation may properly be held available to pay 
a reward for the furnishing of information, not essential but 
probably helpful to the accomplishment of the authorized 
work, the decisions of the accounting officers have not been 
uniform. The doubt arises generally because such rewards 
are not necessarily in keeping with the value of the 
information furnished and possess elements of a gratuity or 
gift made in appreciation of helpful assistance rendered.” 

While the reward in that particular case was permitted, the decision 
announced that specific legislative authority would be required in the 
future. See also 9 Comp. Gen. 309 (1930); A-26777, May 22, 1929. 

168 Some of the “contest” cases, discussed above, do not concern payment of “rewards” to 
“informers,” yet nonetheless use a “necessary information” analysis. See, e.g., 70 Comp. 
Gen. 720 (1991) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration could pay cash prizes to 
certain fortunate fisherman returning “fish tags” to the government); B-286536, Nov. 17, 2000 
(Public Buildings Service could use appropriated funds to pay for prizes in a drawing held in 
connection with customer satisfaction surveys, in order to develop customer satisfaction 
information). 

169 In addition to the statutes discussed in the text, other examples are: 16 U.S.C. § 668 
(information on capturing, buying or selling of bald eagles); 16 U.S.C. § 1540(d) (violations 
of Endangered Species Act); 16 U.S.C. § 2409 (Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978); 
18 U.S.C. § 1751(g) (information concerning presidential assassinations or attempted 
assassinations); 18 U.S.C. § 3056 (rewards by the Secret Service); 21 U.S.C. § 886 (Drug 
Abuse Act); 39 U.S.C. § 404(a)(8) (violations of postal laws); 50 U.S.C. § 47a (illegal 
introduction, manufacture, acquisition, or export of special nuclear material or atomic 
weapons).

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Whether a reward to an informer is necessary or merely helpful depends 
largely on the nature of the agency’s organic authority and its 
appropriations language. For example, the Forest Service is responsible for 
protecting the national forests “against destruction by fire and 
depredations.” 16 U.S.C. § 551. It receives appropriations for expenses 
necessary for “forest protection and utilization.” Under this authority, the 
Comptroller General held that information relating to violations (such as 
deliberately set forest fires, theft of timber, unauthorized occupancy, and 
vandalism) could be considered necessary rather than just helpful, and the 
Forest Service could therefore offer rewards to informers without more 
specific statutory authority. B-172259, Apr. 29, 1971. See also 5 Comp. 
Dec. 118 (1898). The ruling was extended in B-172259, Aug. 2, 1972, to 
cover “endorsements” (the “endorsement” by an informant of an 
undercover agent to help him gain acceptance with the suspects). 

Similarly, the Commerce Department could pay rewards to informers as a 
necessary expense under a provision of the Export Control Act of 1949, 
ch. 11, § 6, 63 Stat. 7 (Feb. 26, 1949), which authorized the obtaining of 
confidential information incident to enforcement of the act. B-117628, 
Jan. 21, 1954. 

The rule was also applied in B-106230, Nov. 30, 1951, in which GAO advised 
the Treasury Department that rewards to informers for information or 
evidence on violations of the revenue, customs, or narcotics laws could be 
offered under an appropriation for the necessary expenses of law 
enforcement. As long as the information was necessary and not just 
helpful, more specific appropriations language was not needed. The result 
would be different if the agency did not have specific law enforcement 
authority. A.D. 6669, May 15, 1922. 

(2) Payments to informers: Internal Revenue Service 
One reward to informers most people are familiar with is the reward 
offered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the detection of tax 
cheats. While the pertinent Internal Revenue Code provision does not use 
the term “reward,” it authorizes the payment of sums deemed necessary 
“for detecting and bringing to trial and punishment persons guilty of 
violating the internal revenue laws.” 26 U.S.C. § 7623. Where information 
leads to an actual recovery of back taxes or penalties, IRS may pay the 
informer a reward based on a percentage of the amount recovered, up to a 
10 percent maximum set by regulation. GAO approved this scheme as 
within the statutory authority in 3 Comp. Gen. 499 (1924). The

determinations of whether to pay a reward and, if so, its amount are 
discretionary and, short of a showing of no rational basis, are not 
reviewable by the courts or by GAO. Saracena v. United States, 508 F.2d 
1333 (Ct. Cl. 1975); Krug v. United States, 168 F.3d 1307 (Fed. Cir. 1999) 
aff’g 41 Fed. Cl. 96 (1998); Informant v. United States, 46 Fed. Cl. 1 (2000); 
B-131689, June 7, 1957; B-10761, June 29, 1940; B-5768, Sept. 18, 1939; 
A-96942, Aug. 23, 1938. The same statute has been held to authorize 
rewards for information on violations where no tax or fine is collected. 
24 Comp. Dec. 430 (1918). 

The IRS statute has been held to constitute an “indefinite reward offer.” 
The informant responds by his conduct, and an “enforceable contract” 
arises when the parties fix the amount of the reward. Merrick v. United 
States, 846 F.2d 725 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The plaintiff in that case provided 
information on an illegal tax shelter in which 1,585 persons had invested, 
resulting in the recovery of over $10 million. The court upheld the position 
of the IRS that the taxpayers were “related taxpayers” in a single tax 
avoidance scheme, thereby limiting the reward to $50,000 for the aggregate 
recovery rather than $50,000 per person as the plaintiff had sought. 
Merrick v. United States, 18 Cl. Ct. 718 (1989). See also Lewis v. United 
States, 70 F.3d 597, 601 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (applying a “similar statute” that 
authorized Customs Service awards). 

The issue in B-137762.32, July 11, 1977 was whether IRS could contract 
with an attorney representing an unnamed informant (i.e., a “partially 
disclosed principal”). The decision discussed the general prohibition 
against contracting with a partially disclosed principal, but approved the 
proposed agreement, noting that the reasons for the rule in the ordinary 
procurement context did not apply to the IRS reward situation. See also 
B-117628, Jan. 21, 1954. However, Treasury regulations required that the 
informant’s identity be disclosed before any claim could actually be paid. 
Therefore, disclosure would be necessary if and when a reward became 
payable but not before then. 

An additional issue in B137762.32 was when an obligation has to be 
recorded under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a). No contractual liability to make 
payment exists until IRS has evaluated the worth of the information and 
has assessed and collected any underpaid taxes and penalties. This is when 
the appropriate IRS official determines that a reward should be paid and its 
amount, and it is at this point that a recordable obligation arises. This is 
consistent with the Federal Circuit’s holding in Merrick. 

Page 4-279 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4

The Internal Revenue Service may also make “support and maintenance” 
payments to informers under its general investigation and enforcement 
authority. In B-183922, Aug. 5, 1975, the Comptroller General held that IRS 
could not make payments to an informer who was simultaneously being 
paid by the Justice Department under its Witness Protection Program. 
However, IRS could make the payments if administratively determined to 
be necessary after the informer had been disenrolled from the Justice 
Departments program. 

(3) Payments to informers: Customs Service 
The Customs Service also has statutory authority to pay rewards. Under 
19 U.S.C. § 1619, a person (other than a government employee) who detects 
and seizes any vessel, vehicle, aircraft, merchandise, or baggage subject to 
seizure and forfeiture under the customs or navigation laws, or who 
furnishes original information, leading to a monetary recovery, may be paid 
a reward of 25 percent of the amount recovered, not to exceed $250,000 in 
any case. Rewards are payable from “appropriations available for the 
collection of the customs revenue.” Id. § 1619(d). 

This reward is in the nature of compensation for services rendered rather 
than a personal gratuity. 5 Comp. Gen. 665 (1926). The statute has been 
deemed mandatory in the sense that an informant who complies with its 
terms has a legal and judicially enforceable claim for the reward. Doe v. 
United States, 100 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Wilson v. United States, 
135 F.2d 1005 (3rd Cir. 1943); Rickard v. United States, 11 Cl. Ct. 874 (1987); 
B-217636, Mar. 4, 1985 (nondecision letter). 

The information furnished must be “original” information, that is, the first 
information the Customs Service has concerning the particular fraud or 
violation. Lacy v. United States, 607 F.2d 951, 953 (Ct. Cl. 1979); 
Cornman v. United States, 409 F.2d 230, 234 (Ct. Cl.), cert. denied, 
396 U.S. 960 (1969); Tyson v. United States, 32 F. Supp. 135, 136 (Ct. Cl. 
1940). 

In cases where the furnishing of information leads to recoveries from 
multiple parties, the monetary ceiling on the reward “for any case” applies 
to the information furnished, not to the number of recoveries it produces. 
Cornman v. United States, supra, citing and following 24 Comp. Dec. 17 
(1917). 

Page 4-280 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Liquidated damages assessed under customs bonds are “recoveries” for 
purposes of 19 U.S.C. § 1619. 34 Comp. Gen. 70 (1954). So are recoveries 
under bail bonds. 19 U.S.C. § 1619(e). Moneys received by customs officers 
as bribes, however, are not recoveries for purposes of the reward. 

11 Comp. Gen. 486 (1932). 

The statute applies to recoveries under the “customs laws or the navigation 
laws.” See 16 Comp. Gen. 1051 (1937). Recoveries under other laws 
generally do not qualify. Thus, in 32 Comp. Gen. 405 (1953), a reward could 
not be paid where recovery was made under several laws and the amount 
attributable to the customs laws or navigation laws could not be 
ascertained. Similarly, a violation of the Anti-Dumping Act is not a violation 
of the customs laws for purposes of 19 U.S.C. § 1619. Fraters Valve & 
Fitting Co. v. United States, 347 F.2d 990 (Ct. Cl. 1965). Nor is a violation 
of the internal revenue laws. Wilson v. United States, supra. But see Doe v. 
United States, 47 Fed. Cl. 367 (2000). 

The reward is authorized, based on appraised value, if the item forfeited is 
destroyed or “delivered to any governmental agency for official use” rather 
than sold. Under this provision, seized merchandise donated to state 
governmental agencies under General Services Administration (GSA) 
regulations qualifies for the reward since the statutory language is not 
limited to federal agencies. B-146223, Nov. 27, 1961. Similarly, where 
forfeited distilled spirits, wines, or beer, which are required by statute to be 
delivered to GSA for disposal, are subsequently given to “eleemosynary 
institutions” for medicinal purposes, the reward is payable because the 
initial delivery to GSA counts as delivery to a “governmental agency for 
official use” under 19 U.S.C. § 1619. B-146223, Feb. 2, 1962. 

b. Missing Government 
Employees 
The only decisions that exist on rewards for locating missing government 
employees concern military deserters. No decision has been found 
discussing whether a reward could be offered for the apprehension of a 
military deserter in the absence of statutory authority, although one early 
case stated that “[t]here is no reward for the apprehension or delivery of a 
deserter by operation of law.” 20 Comp. Dec. 767 (1914). The reason the 
issue has not been discussed is probably that the authority has existed by 
statute for a long time. For many years, a provision in the annual Defense 
Department appropriation acts authorized payment of expenses of the 
apprehension and delivery of deserters, including a small reward. In 1984, 
the provision was made permanent and is now found at 10 U.S.C. § 956(1). 
The Coast Guard also has permanent authority to offer rewards for the 
apprehension of deserters. 14 U.S.C. § 644. 

Page 4-281 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

c. Lost or Missing 
Government Property 
Thus, the decisions that do exist concern mainly questions of interpretation 
under the statutory language and implementing regulations. For example, 
the term “apprehension” was construed to permit payment of the reward 
where an Army deserter voluntarily surrendered to a civil officer. 6 Comp. 
Gen. 479 (1927). 

The statute and implementing regulations limit the amount payable as 
expenses, but this limitation applies only to the period before the deserter 
is returned to military control. Expenses incurred after return to military 
control, for example, continued civil detention at the request of military 
authorities, are not subject to the limitation and may be paid. B-179920, 
July 18, 1974; B-147496-O.M., Jan. 4, 1962. Three early decisions permitted 
payment of expenses incurred in apprehending a deserter in excess of the 
statutory limit where the deserter was also wanted for other criminal 
offenses (such as forgery or embezzlement). 16 Comp. Dec. 132 (1909); 
11 Comp. Dec. 124 (1904); B-3591, May 27, 1939.170 

It has long been established that no payment may be made to one who finds 
lost government property unless a reward has been offered prior to the 
return of the property. 11 Comp. Dec. 741 (1905); 5 Comp. Dec. 37 (1898); 
A-23019, May 24, 1928; B-117297-O.M., Feb. 12, 1954. To offer a reward for 
the recovery of lost or missing property, an agency needs some statutory 
basis. Examples are 10 U.S.C. § 2252 (Defense, military departments) and 
14 U.S.C. § 643 (Coast Guard). While the degree of explicitness required 
has not been definitively addressed, the rules appear to be the same as in 
the case of rewards for information discussed above. 

Two early decisions permitted the use of military “contingent expense” 
appropriations. In 6 Comp. Gen. 774 (1927), GAO told the Army that it 
could offer a reward from its contingent expense appropriation for the 
recovery of stolen platinum. In B-33518, Apr. 23, 1943, prior to the 
enactment of 10 U.S.C. § 2252, the Navy wanted to use a general 
appropriation to offer rewards for locating lost aircraft. The Comptroller 
General advised that the general appropriation could not be used since the 
reward was not essential to carrying out its purposes, but, relying on 

170 The excess payment in each of these cases was authorized from the Army’s appropriation 
for “contingent expenses.” While the “contingent expense” language is no longer used, the 
military departments receive similar appropriations for “emergencies and extraordinary 
expenses.” See 53 Comp. Gen. 707 (1974). 

Page 4-282 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


d. Contractual Basis 
Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

6 Comp. Gen. 774, the Navy could use its contingent expense 
appropriation. 

In 41 Comp. Gen. 410 (1961), the Treasury Department asked if the Coast 
Guard had any general authority beyond 14 U.S.C. § 643 to make 
reasonable payments to persons who found lost property. The Comptroller 
General replied that he knew of none. Based on these decisions, it appears 
that a general operating appropriation is not available to offer or pay 
rewards for the recovery of lost property. 

In B-79173, Oct. 18, 1948, the Civil Aeronautics Administration had an 
appropriation for the temporary relief of distressed persons. The question 
presented was whether the appropriation was available to pay a reward to 
someone who had found a lost airplane 4 months after it disappeared. The 
Comptroller General said no, because the passengers could all be 
presumed dead after 4 months, but expressly declined to decide whether 
the appropriation would have been available if the airplane had been found 
“with such promptness as to afford reasonable hope that survivors might 
be found and given relief.” The reasoning is similar to that in the 
information cases—the reward might have been considered necessary to 
carrying out the relief appropriation if there was a reasonable chance of 
survivors, but after the passage of several months it would be at best 
helpful. As with the necessary expense theory in general, “necessary” 
relates not to the importance of the object itself but to carrying out the 
purposes of the particular appropriation. 

Stolen property was involved in 53 Comp. Gen. 707 (1974). The Air Force 
asked if it could pay a reward, pursuant to local custom, to two Thai police 
officers whose services had been instrumental in recovering a stolen road 
grader. Based on 6 Comp. Gen. 774, the Comptroller General held that the 
Air Force could pay the reward from its appropriation for emergencies and 
extraordinary expenses, successor to the old contingent expense 
appropriation. However, apart from that particular appropriation, the 
decision held that there was no authority for the reward. This part of the 
decision was based on 8 Comp. Gen. 613 (1929), once again implying that 
the rules in the information cases would apply to missing property as well. 
(This case would now be covered by 10 U.S.C. § 2252.) 

The basis of the right to a reward is contractual; that is, there must be an 
offer and an acceptance. The rationale is that “no person by his voluntary 
act can constitute himself a creditor of the Government.” 20 Comp. 
Dec. 767, 769 (1914). 

Page 4-283 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Where a reward is based on the “necessary expense” theory rather than on 
explicit statutory authority, the decisions hold that there must be an offer 
of reward before a reward can be claimed. Performance of the service 
constitutes the acceptance. See, e.g., 26 Comp. Gen. 605 (1947); 3 Comp. 
Gen. 734 (1924). See also 70 Comp. Gen. 720 (1991). The offer may be in the 
form of a “standing offer” promulgated by regulation. See, e.g., B-131689, 
June 7, 1957, in which a Treasury Decision constituted the offer for an 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reward. Another example is 28 C.F.R. pt. 7, 
a standing offer by the Attorney General for rewards for the capture, or 
information leading to the capture, of escaped federal prisoners. 

Consistent with contract theory in general, it is also possible for an offer to 
be implied from practice or course of conduct. For example, a reward was 
held payable to an informer under the prohibition laws without a specific 
offer in 4 Comp. Gen. 255 (1924). The informer was a member of a “gang of 
whiskey thieves” and the Comptroller General noted that “[u]nder such 
conditions no specific agreement for compensation is generally made, but 
with a man of such character there is, and practically must be, to obtain the 
information, an understanding that there will be compensation.” Id. at 256. 
The course of conduct and standing offer concepts were combined in 
A-23019, May 24, 1928, involving a reward for finding a lost Navy torpedo. 
In view of the prevailing understanding in the area and past practice, the 
Navy’s regulations were viewed as “implicitly” making a standing offer. 

Similarly, where a reward is based on express statutory authority and the 
statute either is discretionary or authorizes the agency to “offer and pay” a 
reward, there must be an offer before payment can be made. 41 Comp. 
Gen. 410 (1961) (14 U.S.C. § 643); 20 Comp. Dec. 767 (1914) (apprehension 
of a deserter). On the other hand, if a statute provides for a reward as a 
matter of entitlement, the reasons for requiring an offer are less 
compelling; the terms of the statute and any implementing regulations will 
determine precisely how and when the “contract” comes into existence. 
E.g., Merrick v. United States, 846 F.2d 725 (Fed. Cir. 1988), discussed above 
in section C.14.a in connection with the Internal Revenue Service statute. 

As to whether the claimant must have knowledge of the offer, the decisions 
are not entirely consistent. Cases involving the apprehension of deserters 
have held that performance of the service gives rise to an obligation on the 
part of the government to pay the offered reward notwithstanding the 
claimant’s lack of knowledge of the offer when he performed the service. 
27 Comp. Dec. 47 (1920); 20 Comp. Dec. 767 (1914); B-41659, May 26, 1944. 
On the other hand, cases involving the finding of lost property have held 

Page 4-284 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

that knowledge is required. Thus, in 26 Comp. Gen. 605 (1947), a reward 
the Navy had offered for the discovery of a lost airplane was denied where 
the person discovering the airplane had no knowledge of the offer at the 
time he performed the service. This ruling was followed in 41 Comp. 
Gen. 410 (1961), holding that the Coast Guard could not pay a reward under 
14 U.S.C. § 643 to one who had no knowledge of the published offer. See 
also A-35247, Apr. 1, 1931 (escaped prisoner). The latter group of decisions 
purports to be based on the “great weight of authority.” 26 Comp. Gen. at 
606. 

Since reward payments for information furnished to the government are in 
the nature of compensation for services rendered rather than personal 
gratuities, the right to file a claim for the reward vests at the time the 
compensation is earned (i.e., the services performed). Consequently, that 
right is not defeated where the informant dies prior to filing a claim or 
receiving the reward. The issue was discussed in 5 Comp. Gen. 665 (1926), 
in which GAO approved the payment of a reward to the legal representative 
of an informant’s estate for information furnished under the predecessor of 
19 U.S.C. § 1619, even though the informant had not filed a claim prior to 
his death. See also 2 Comp. Dec. 514 (1896) (customs); B-131689, June 7, 
1957 (internal revenue); B-129886-O.M., Dec. 28, 1956 (internal revenue). 

e. Rewards to Government 
Employees 
A reward may not be paid to a government employee for services rendered 
within the scope of his or her official duties. For example, in 4 Comp. 
Gen. 687 (1925), a Deputy United States Marshal claimed a reward for 
apprehending a military deserter. The Comptroller General held that the 
reward could not be paid since the Marshal had been acting in his official 
capacity (i.e., doing his job) rather than his personal capacity. See also 

7 Comp. Gen. 307 (1927); A-35247, Apr. 1, 1931; A-17808, Mar. 30, 1927. 

Under the Defense Department’s statutory authority to pay expenses plus a 
small reward, a federal employee may be reimbursed actual expenses 
incurred, but may not be paid the reward. 32 Comp. Gen. 219 (1952). In 
addition, some statutes, 19 U.S.C. § 1619 for one example, expressly 
exclude government employees from eligibility. 

However, if an employee performs services beyond the scope of his official 
duties for which a reward has been offered, the reward may be paid since 
the employee was acting in his capacity as a private citizen. Thus, a reward 
was held payable to a patrol inspector for the Immigration Service who had 
apprehended a military deserter since the action was outside the scope of 
his official duties. 5 Comp. Gen. 447 (1925). See also A-17066, Mar. 2, 1927. 

Page 4-285 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

The prohibition against an employee’s receiving a reward for services 
performed in the course of his official duties applies as well to rewards 
offered by nongovernment sources. The principle is illustrated in 49 Comp. 
Gen. 819 (1970). An Air Force major, flying a low-level training mission in 
the Republic of Colombia, spotted a cargo plane unloading in a suspicious 
location. He notified the Colombian authorities, who seized what turned 
out to be a load of contraband. Under Colombian law, the informant was 
entitled to a reward of 25 percent of the total value of the contraband. 
However, any earnings of an employee in excess of his regular 
compensation, earned in the course of performing his official duties, 
belong to the government. Therefore, the major could not keep the reward 
but had to turn it in for deposit in the Treasury. Another reason the major 
could not keep the reward is the prohibition in the United States 
Constitution (art. I, § 9, cl. 8) against the acceptance by a government 
officer or employee of gifts or emoluments from a foreign government 
without the consent of Congress. 

15. State and Local Taxes 
a. Introduction The doctrine of sovereign immunity and the Supremacy Clause of the 
Constitution (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2) prohibit states from taxing the 
federal government or its activities. McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 
(4 Wheat.) 316 (1819). The Supreme Court’s early interpretation was aimed 
at the preservation of the federal system, which includes Chief Justice 
Marshall’s famous dictum in McCulloch that “the power to tax involves the 
power to destroy.” 17 U.S. at 431. 
Since Chief Justice Marshall’s time, federal activity and state taxing 
schemes have grown in complexity and sophistication. Today, while the 
basic rule of federal immunity from state and local taxation is easy to state, 
it is far less easy to apply. In the words of the Supreme Court, federal 
immunity from state and local taxation is a “much litigated and often 
confused field.” United States v. City of Detroit, 355 U.S. 466, 473 (1958). It 
“has been marked from the beginning by inconsistent decisions and 
excessively delicate distinctions” (United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 
720, 730 (1982)), with the line between taxability and immunity “drawn by 
an unsteady hand” (United States v. Allegheny County, 322 U.S. 174, 176 
(1944)). 

Page 4-286 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

In the simplest situation, federal tax immunity applies to attempts to tax 
directly the property or activities of a federal department or agency. More 
difficult problems arise when the entity being taxed is not a typical federal 
agency. The test enunciated by the Supreme Court on whether federal 
immunity from taxation applies is whether the entity is “so closely 
connected to the [federal] Government that the two cannot realistically be 
viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed is 
concerned.” United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. at 735. The most 
common situation calling for the application of this test—the taxation of 
government contractors—will be discussed later. 

The government’s constitutional immunity from state taxation has been 
held to extend to federal credit unions. United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d 
803 (6th Cir. 1988). However, a municipal sales tax imposed on a “village 
corporation” established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 
and funded in part by federal funds is not a tax on the United States since 
the village corporation is not a federal agency and the funds, once 
distributed to the corporation, are essentially private funds. B-205150, 
Jan. 27, 1982. Similarly, funds paid over to a grantee under a federal grant 
program may be used to pay a nondiscriminatory state sales tax on 
purchases made with grant funds. 37 Comp. Gen. 85 (1957). The reason is 
that the funds, once paid to the grantee, are no longer federal funds subject 
to many of the restrictions on the direct expenditure of appropriations. Id. 
at 86–87. See also 62 Comp. Gen. 531, 533 (1983) (grant funds become funds 
of grantees subject only to grant terms and applicable regulations).171 

In 46 Comp. Gen. 363 (1966), the Comptroller General considered a 
program where the United States was to share the cost of materials and 
services procured by farmers to carry out a conservation program. The 
Department of Agriculture had proposed a procedure whereby the United 
States would make its cost-sharing payments directly to the vendors. Since 
the materials purchased would not become the property of the United 
States, the procedure was viewed as essentially a “credit device” provided 
to the farmers, and the Comptroller General concluded that the payments 
could include state sales taxes. 

171 The same result would apply to purchases by a contractor under a contract with a grantee 
financed from federal grant funds (B-177215, Nov. 30, 1972), and to state or local taxation of 
the income of a grantee’s employees (14 Comp. Gen. 869 (1935)). Note that appropriations 
for National Guard operations, however, are not grants to the states so that the federal 
government’s immunity from taxation applies. 42 Comp. Gen. 631 (1963).

Evidence of tax-exempt status because of the federal government’s 
immunity may take various forms, depending on the circumstances. For 
example, use of a government credit card or purchase order identifies the 
purchaser as an agent, agency, or instrumentality of the United States.172 
Other forms are listed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 
48 C.F.R. § 29.305. When other evidence is not available or is inapplicable, 
immunity is often established by use of a “tax exemption certificate” such 
as Standard Form 1094, which is usually processed individually. It is 
prescribed by and illustrated in the FAR. 48 C.F.R. §§ 29.302(b), 53.229, 
53.301–1094.173 

In some jurisdictions, tax exemption can be established by reciting a “taxexempt 
number” obtained from the taxing authority. Where this procedure 
exists, it is governed by state regulation. Where available, this can be a 
simple and cost-effective way of invoking the government’s tax immunity in 
situations where the amounts involved do not justify obtaining a tax 
exemption certificate See B-206804, Feb. 7, 1983. 

State taxation problems center on two distinct types of taxing schemes: 
taxes linked to business transactions involving the federal government, 
typically sales and use taxes, and property-oriented taxes linked to 
ownership or use of various types of real and personal property located 
within a state’s geographical boundaries. In addition, federal government 
employees frequently incur various types of state and local taxes while 
performing government business. These three broad categories form the 
framework of our discussion. 

172 The use of a government travel or purchase card does not necessarily demonstrate that 
the purchase was for the federal government, however. See, e.g., U.S. General Accounting 
Office, Travel Cards: Control Weaknesses Leave Navy Vulnerable to Fraud and Abuse, 
GAO-03-147 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 23, 2002) (reporting government travel card use for 
legalized brothels, gentlemen’s clubs, cruise lines, and other inappropriate transactions). 

173 The FAR also provides that when economically feasible agencies should take maximum 
advantage of all exemptions from state and local taxation. 48 C.F.R. § 29.302(b). This 
provision does not imply that small taxes should automatically be paid without asserting the 
government’s immunity, but instead suggests that taxes in small amounts should be paid 
regardless of the government’s immunity where no other evidence is available and where a 
tax exemption certificate would otherwise be required to take advantage of the immunity. 
The use of blanket and multiple exemption certificates is discussed in 41 Comp. Gen. 560 
(1962).

b. Tax on Business 
Transactions Where the 
Federal Government Is a 
Party 
(1) General principles 
The key question in determining whether the federal government may pay a 
sales or other tax imposed on its purchase of goods or services within a 
state depends, according to the Supreme Court in Alabama v. King & 
Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 (1941), on where the legal incidence of the tax falls. 
There, a construction contractor building a federal project objected to the 
state’s imposition of sales tax on its purchase of building materials used in 
construction. It argued that such purchases should be exempt from state 
taxation, as the costs would ultimately be borne by the federal government 
and thereby violate federal immunity from state taxation. The Supreme 
Court disagreed, drawing a distinction between the economic burden 
imposed on the United States when it must pay more for goods and 
services because of sales taxes levied against the seller of goods, and the 
constitutionally impermissible burden occurring when the government, as 
a purchaser of goods, is directly liable to the state for taxes imposed on a 
transaction. In other words, if the “legal incidence” of a tax falls on the 
vendor-seller and the seller alone is obligated to pay, the government may 
reimburse the seller for the total cost, including any tax.174 But if the 
vendee-buyer is in any way legally responsible for the payment of the tax, 
the federal government as a buyer cannot be required to pay. Id. at 12–14. 
See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134 (1937) (state gross 
receipts tax imposed on a government contractor).175 

The rule that the government is constitutionally immune from a “vendee 
tax” but may pay a valid “vendor tax”—even if the government ultimately 
bears its economic burden—has been recognized and applied in numerous 
Comptroller General decisions. E.g., 46 Comp. Gen. 363 (1966); 24 Comp. 
Gen. 150 (1944); 23 Comp. Gen. 957 (1944); 21 Comp. Gen. 1119 (1942); 
21 Comp. Gen. 733 (1942). The same rule applies to state tax levies on 

174 Of course, “no matter on whom the tax nominally falls, the market price (including the 
tax) and the quantity sold will be the same. Accordingly, the economic incidence will be 
shared in the same way: if the tax is nominally on the buyer, part of it will be passed back to 
the seller in the form of reduced quantity demanded.” United States v. Delaware, 958 F.2d 
555, 561 n.11 (3rd Cir. 1992). That the imposition of a particular fee may ultimately burden 
the Unites States financially is an insufficient ground to invalidate a tax. United States 
Postal Service v. Town of Greenwich, 901 F. Supp. 500, 507 (D. Conn. 1995). 

175 In the context of sales taxes, the hallmark of a vendor tax is that the law establishing the 
tax requires the seller to pay it notwithstanding any inability or unwillingness on the part of 
the seller to collect it from the purchaser. E.g., B-239608, Dec. 14, 1990 (nondecision letter); 
B-225123, May 1, 1987 (nondecision letter).

rental fees. See 49 Comp. Gen. 204 (1969); B-168593, Jan. 13, 1971; 
B-170899, Nov. 16, 1970. 

Determining whether the legal incidence of a particular tax is on the vendor 
or the vendee is a question of federal law, e.g., United States v. Nevada Tax 
Commission, 439 F.2d 435, 439 (9th Cir. 1971), and GAO will follow federal 
judicial precedent where available. If there are no federal judicial decisions 
on point, GAO will follow the determination of the states highest court. 

21 Comp. Gen. 843 (1942); B-211093, May 10, 1983. 

Nowhere is the vendor/vendee concept more clearly illustrated than in the 
many cases considered by GAO on the payment of state gasoline taxes. In 
57 Comp. Gen. 59 (1977), the Comptroller General held that the Vermont 
tax on gasoline distributors, which was required by law to be passed along 
to dealers and in turn to consumers, was a legal obligation on consumers to 
pay the tax. Since this tax collection mechanism constituted a vendee tax, 
the federal government was constitutionally immune from its payment as a 
purchaser. In 1979, Vermont amended its tax law to delete the requirement 
for pass-through to dealers and consumers. With this amendment, the tax 
became a vendor tax and the federal government’s immunity no longer 
applied. 63 Comp. Gen. 49 (1983). It remains immaterial that, as a practical 
matter, the tax will be reflected in the retail price of the fuel. While the 
economic incidence still fell on the federal government as purchaser, the 
legal incidence no longer did. 

Another example of a vendee tax for which the United States was immune 
was the California state gasoline tax, which the dealer was required to 
collect from a consumer “insofar as it can be done.” 55 Comp. Gen. 1358 
(1976). GAO’s finding that this was a vendee tax drew support from 
Diamond National Corp. v. State Board of Equalization, 425 U.S. 268 
(1976), where the Supreme Court concluded that an identically worded 
sales tax requirement was imposed on the vendee. 

In 55 Comp. Gen. 1358, GAO also considered gasoline taxes in 
Pennsylvania, Hawaii, and New Mexico. Pennsylvania’s tax was an excise 
tax on dealer-users (meaning retail service station operators). The statute 
did not provide any mechanism for the dealer-user to seek reimbursement 
from the consumer and therefore it was assumed that the tax levied against 
the dealer-user would become a part of that retailer’s operating expenses. 
Accordingly, the federal government could pay, as a part of the purchase 
price, the amount of tax on the retailer who was statutorily required to 
assume that tax as a cost of doing business. In Hawaii the tax was in the 

Page 4-290 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

form of a license fee paid by retail distributors of gasoline. This license fee 
was imposed directly on the distributors with no direct recourse against 
the consumers of gasoline, although the amount of the license fee was 
undoubtedly considered in setting the basic cost of fuel sold by those 
retailers. For this reason the federal government was authorized to pay the 
full retail price, including any amount attributable to the tax.176 The New 
Mexico gasoline tax, however, was a tax on the users of state highways, 
collected by the retail dealer of gasoline. The tax was added at the pump to 
the per-gallon cost of gasoline. Since the incidence of this tax was on the 
vendee, when the United States purchased fuel in New Mexico, it was 
exempt from the tax.177 

A type of vendor tax that the federal government must nearly always pay is 
a business privilege or gross receipts tax, a personal tax on domestic and 
foreign concerns for the privilege of doing business in the state commonly 
measured as a percentage of gross receipts. An example of this kind of tax 
is the Illinois Retailers’ Occupational Tax discussed in 43 Comp. Gen. 721 
(1964), 42 Comp. Gen. 517 (1963), and B-162452, Oct. 6, 1967. Similar taxes 
have been held to be payable in the states of Arizona (27 Comp. Gen. 767 
(1948) and B-167150, Feb. 17, 1970); Hawaii (49 Comp. Gen. 204 (1969) and 
37 Comp. Gen. 772 (1958)); New Mexico (B-147615, Dec. 14, 1961); and 
South Dakota (B211093, May 10, 1983). A “business privilege” tax on motor 
fuel sellers imposed by Kansas City, Missouri, was held payable in 
32 Comp. Gen. 423 (1953). 

The imposition of state taxes—sales, use, gross receipts, etc.—on federal 
government contractors has produced more than its share of litigation. 
Questions arise, for example, because the tax may be based on the value of 
property in the contractor’s possession but owned by the federal 
government, or purchased for use in performing the contract. For the most 
part, the taxes will be upheld. The most comprehensive discussion by the 

176 In 28 Comp. Gen. 706 (1949), a Washington State tax on gasoline distributors was 
similarly found to be a vendor tax and the United States was therefore required to pay the 
amount added to the purchase price of gasoline to represent the tax. See also B-154266, 
June 25, 1964, considering the same tax as applied to government-rented commercial 
vehicles. 

177 In the 1960s, California law provided for a refund of the tax paid on gasoline for vehicles 
operated entirely off state highways. The state courts had found that the term “highway” did 
not encompass roads running in and through national parks. Therefore, relying on the state’s 
interpretation of its own statute, GAO concluded that no tax was payable on gasoline used 
in vehicles driven only on the grounds of a national monument. 42 Comp. Gen. 593 (1963).

Supreme Court is United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720 (1982). The 
Court reviewed prior cases and concluded: 

“[T]ax immunity is appropriate in only one circumstance: 
when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on an 
agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the 
Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as 
separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed 
is concerned.” 

Id. at 735. Government contractors will generally be unable to meet this 
test except in very limited circumstances. Thus, a contractor can claim 
constitutional immunity from tax where there is an agency relationship 
between the United States and a contractor such that the contractor is 
acting solely as the government’s purchasing agent and title to goods 
purchased never vests in the contractor. Kern-Limerick v. Scurlock, 
347 U.S. 110, 120–23 (1954); United States v. Lohman, 74 F.3d 863, 867 
(8th Cir.), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1018 (1996); B-177215, Nov. 30, 1972. See 
also United States v. Kabeiseman, 970 F.2d 739 (10th Cir. 1992) (United 
States and not contractor was the real purchaser of diesel fuel, so state tax 
levied on the diesel fuel purchasers could not be enforced against the 
United States). However, the “contractor as agent” has limited application. 
For example, in United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720, 742 (1982), the 
Court sustained use and gross receipts taxes imposed on government 
contractors which, in that case, operated under an “advance funding” 
system whereby the contractors met their obligations by using Treasury 
funds that had been placed in a special bank account. Id. at 725–26.178 

In imposing taxes on government contractors, a state may not discriminate 
against the federal government (South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U.S. 505, 523 
(1988); see, e.g., B-156561, June 22, 1965), or substantially interfere with its 
activities. New Mexico, 455 U.S. at 735 n.11; Phillips Chemical Co. v. 
Dumas Independent School District, 361 U.S. 376, 387 (1960); City of 
Detroit v. Murray Corp., 355 U.S. 489, 495 (1958); United States v. City of 
Manassas, 830 F.2d 530, 533 (4th Cir. 1987), aff’d mem., 485 U.S. 1017 

178Some additional Supreme Court cases sustaining the imposition of state taxes on 
government contractors in various contexts include Washington v. United States, 460 U.S. 
536 (1983); United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39 (1964); City of Detroit v. Murray Corp., 
355 U.S. 489 (1958); Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 (1941); James v. Dravo 
Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134 (1937). Dravo is regarded as starting the current trend. New 
Mexico, 455 U.S. at 731–32.

(1988). This does not prevent states from taxing private parties who use 
federal property, even when the private parties are providing goods to the 
United States. United States v. Nye County, 178 F.3d 1080, 1084 (9th Cir. 
1999). 

The United States can be required to pay a state tax obligation imposed on 
its contractor when the federal government assumes responsibility for the 
tax by contract. United States v. Department of Revenue of State of 
Illinois, 202 F. Supp. 757, 760 (N.D. Ill.), aff’d per curiam, 371 U.S. 21 
(1962). The typical language in government contracts for the purchase of 
goods or services recites that the offered price includes all applicable state 
and local taxes. (See the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions 
on state and local taxes at 48 C.F.R. subpt. 29.3, and its prescribed contract 
clauses at 48 C.F.R. § 52.229.) Shifting the burden of determining which 
taxes apply to the contractor is premised on the belief that contractors are 
in a better position to know what taxes are applicable. B-251628, Apr. 2, 
1993; B-242303, Mar. 21, 1991; B-209430, Jan. 25, 1983. Unless otherwise 
specified in the contract, the government cannot be required to pay any 
additional amount for taxes (B162667, Dec. 19, 1967; B-134347, Mar. 1, 
1966), even when the taxes were first imposed during contract 
performance. B-160129, Dec. 7, 1966. In such circumstances it is irrelevant 
that the tax involved is a valid vendor tax from which the United States is 
not immune; there can be no liability unless the contract so provides. 
45 Comp. Gen. 192 (1965); 23 Comp. Gen. 957 (1944). Note however, that a 
contract can include a contingency clause for after-imposed state and local 
taxes. The failure to include such a clause is regarded as the contractors 
business decision so that the government will not be liable for any 
additional taxes. Cannon Structures, Inc., ICBA No. 3968-98, 99-1 B.C.A. 
¶ 30,236 (1999); Midcon of New Mexico, Inc., ASBCA No. 37249, 
90-1 B.C.A. ¶ 22,621 (1990). 

Other contract language, of course, may dictate different results. A 
contract that provides for the payment of “the actual direct costs” includes 
reimbursement of state taxes paid by a contractor. 72 Comp. Gen. 107 
(1993). Similarly, a contract for the “actual costs” justifies reimbursement 
to a contractor of back taxes and interest assessed against him when a 
court found that the contractor was not exempt from taxation. B-147316O.
M., Jan. 9, 1962. The same result would apply in the case of a contract for 
a cost plus fixed fee, such as the contract in Alabama v. King & Boozer, 
supra. 35 Comp. Gen. 378 (1955). Likewise, a contract to pay 50 percent of 
any new tax imposed by a state would include the obligation to pay half of 

Page 4-293 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

the business privilege tax assessed against a corporate contractor. 

B-152325, Dec. 12, 1963. 

A contractor may be entitled to equitable relief in certain limited 
circumstances where both the contractor and the government are mistaken 
as to the applicability of a state tax to a particular contract and where the 
contractor reasonably relies on an innocent representation of a 
government agent that no tax applies. In such cases, the contract may be 
reformed and the price increased to include the applicable state tax. Cases 
reaching this result in various fact situations include 64 Comp. Gen. 718 
(1985); B-186949, Oct. 20, 1976; B-180071, Feb. 25, 1974; B-169959, Aug. 3, 
1970; B-159064, May 11, 1966; and B-153472, Dec. 2, 1965. The underlying 
legal principle is to avoid unjust enrichment so that a party making a 
misrepresentation, however innocently, should not benefit at the expense 
of a party who reasonably relies on that misrepresentation. Mutual mistake 
is an essential element of recovery in these cases. If the contractor cannot 
establish mutual mistake, the contract is payable as written and the 
contractor must absorb the additional expense. E.g., Hugh S. Ferguson 
Co., PSBCA No. 2178, 89-1 B.C.A. ¶ 21,294 (1988) (distinguishing 64 Comp. 
Gen. 718); see Foley Co. v. United States, 36 Fed. Cl. 788, 792 (1996) 
(agency employee’s misrepresentation about tax-exempt status is not a 
mutual mistake of fact requiring contract reformation); see also Cannon 
Structures, Inc., supra at 99-1 B.C.A. ¶ 30,236 (FAR prohibits post-
contractual relief for after-imposed state taxes). 

If a contractor entitled under the contract to be reimbursed for state taxes 
pays a state tax that is later judicially determined to be invalid, the 
contractor is nevertheless entitled to reimbursement (43 Comp. Gen. 721 
(1964)), unless the contractor paid the tax without being required to do so 
(38 Comp. Gen. 624 (1959)). 

Throughout the preceding discussion, the government has been the buyer. 
Tax problems may also arise where the government is the seller, although 
there have been few decisions in this area. In one case, the Texas use tax 
statute required sellers to obtain a permit, collect the tax, and remit 
collections to the State Comptroller. The Comptroller General held that the 
state could not impose these requirements on the disposal of surplus 
federal property by the General Services Administration under the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. 41 Comp. Gen. 668 
(1962). The theory is that a state may not infringe on the right of the federal 
government to conduct its official activities free from state control or 
regulation. See Mayo v. United States, 319 U.S. 441, 447 (1943) (ruling that 

Page 4-294 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

imposition of state “inspection fees” on federal property interfered with 
federal functions in violation of the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, 
cl. 2). 

(2) Public utilities 
As with any other occupant of a building, the federal government is a 
consumer of services from public utilities. A utility bill may include various 
elements in addition to the basic charge for services used. Some of these 
elements may be taxes the federal government may properly pay; others 
may be taxes from which the government is immune; still others may not 
be taxes at all. 

In determining whether appropriated funds may be used to pay taxes 
appearing on or included in utility bills, the principles described above 
apply—such as the distinction between a vendor and vendee tax—with one 
additional feature based on the nature of the rate-fixing process. Utility 
rates are usually set by the state legislature or by a public service 
commission. Rates established through this process apply to federal and 
nonfederal users alike. Unless they are unreasonable or discriminatory, 
federal agencies are expected to pay them. E.g., 67 Comp. Gen. 220 (1988); 
27 Comp. Gen. 580 (1948). See also B-300538, Mar. 24, 2003 (appropriated 
funds may be used to pay the costs of relocating public utility facilities on 
federal lands when the government—acting as a customer—requests that 
the facility be moved). 

For example, state sales taxes that qualify as vendor taxes and that have 
been factored into the utility rates through the applicable rate-setting 
process are payable by the government. 45 Comp. Gen. 192 (1965); 
B-300538, supra; B-134602, Dec. 26, 1957; B-123206, June 30, 1955. The 
same result applies with respect to a vendor sales tax on the utility billed 
separately to the agency. B-211093, May 10, 1983. 

Business privilege or gross receipts taxes are frequently imposed on public 
utilities by law. The utility companies are permitted to treat these taxes as 
operating expenses and to incorporate them into their basic billing rates, 
thereby creating a constitutionally permissible vendor tax. B-300538, 
supra; B-144504, June 9, 1967; B-148667, May 15, 1962. This is true even 
where a state utility regulatory authority requires the pass-through, if the 
tax itself is a vendor tax. See 61 Comp. Gen. 257 (1982) (Veterans 
Administration medical centers were liable for that portion of their electric 

Page 4-295 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

bills which were attributable to a rate increase reflecting the states public 
utility license tax).179 

Where the business privilege tax is a valid vendor tax, it can be paid even if 
it is attributed as a tax and stated on the utility bill as a separate item. 
32 Comp. Gen. 577 (1953); B-300538, supra; B-260063, June 30, 1995; 
B-171756, Feb. 22, 1971; B-144504, June 30, 1970; B-225123, May 1, 1987 
(nondecision letter).180 The theory is that the “tax,” even though separately 
stated, is, in effect, an authorized rate increase designed to recover the 
revenue necessary to permit the utility to maintain the allowed rate of 
return on its investment. See B-167999, Dec. 31, 1969. See also B-288161, 
Apr. 8, 2002 (vendees do not bear the legal incidence of a utility tax even 
when a utility increases its rates to pass the tax on to the vendee). 
However, payment may not be approved where the tax is collected only 
from the federal government or where the collection of the tax would have 
a discriminatory effect on federal activities. B-159685, Apr. 7, 1967. 

Another charge occasionally encountered is a “lifeline” surcharge. This is a 
surcharge designed to subsidize the providing of reduced cost utility 
service to low-income or elderly customers. GAO regards a lifeline 
surcharge not as a tax, but merely part of the authorized rate properly 
payable by federal users. 67 Comp. Gen. 220 (1988); B-189149, Sept. 7, 1977. 

c. Property-Related Taxes Federal land located within state borders is also exempt from state 
property taxes on the same constitutional theory discussed above. E.g., 
Clallam County v. United States, 263 U.S. 341, 343–44 (1923); Van 
Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U.S. 151, 180 (1886). However, as with the 
contractor cases previously discussed, the immunity is generally limited to 
attempts to levy the tax directly against the federal government. Thus, the 
Supreme Court has sustained a state property tax on federally owned land 
leased to a private party for the conduct of for-profit activities (United 
States v. City of Detroit, 355 U.S. 466, 469 (1958)), and on the “possessory 
interest” of Forest Service employees living in government-owned housing 
179 The Department of Justice considered the same situation with the same result. 6 Op. Off. 
Legal Counsel 273 (1982). 

180 Another type of “tax” appearing on utility bills is a charge for 9-1-1 emergency service. See 
B-300737, June 27, 2003; B-253695, July 28, 1993; and the discussion in section C.7.c of this 
chapter.

(United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U.S. 452 (1977)).181 Similarly, the 
court of federal claims in Wright Runstad Properties Ltd. Partnership v. 
United States, 40 Fed. Cl. 820, 824 (1998), ruled that a landlord to the 
federal government had to pay a special assessment levied against the 
property, observing that the government’s tax immunity was not implicated 
because the government was not being taxed. 

Just as states and their political subdivisions are barred from levying 
general property taxes against federal property, they are likewise 
prevented from making assessments against federal land for local 
improvements, even if the improvements would be made to federally 
owned property. B-157435, Oct. 6, 1965. Such assessments are typically 
made for paving or repairing streets or sidewalks, installing sewers, and 
similar local governmental services. An assessment for local improvements 
is an involuntary exaction in the nature of a tax. Hagar v. Reclamation 
District No. 108, 111 U.S. 701, 707 (1884); City of Cincinnati v. United 
States, 39 Fed. Cl. 271, 275 (1997), aff’d, 153 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1998). As 
such, the decisions have uniformly held that the United States is not 
required to pay. E.g., United States v. City of Huntington, 999 F.2d 71 
(4th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1109 (1994); National Railroad 
Passenger Corp. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, 665 F. 
Supp. 402 (E.D. Pa. 1987), aff’d, 848 F.2d 436 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied,

181 A tax lien that attaches to property before title passes to the government is not a tax on 
government property. The lien is a valid encumbrance against the property, although it is 
unenforceable as long as the government holds the property. United States v. Alabama, 
313 U.S. 274 (1941). See United States v. Lewis County, 175 F.3d 671, 678 (9th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 528 U.S. 1018 (1999) (foreclosure against federally owned property impossible 
without consent of the United States). In a series of early decisions, however, GAO advised 
that the acquiring agency could use its appropriations to extinguish the lien if 
administratively determined to be in the best interests of the government, for example, to 
clear title prior to disposition of the property. B-40548, Jan. 26, 1945; B-41677, May 8, 1944; 
B-28443, Dec. 9, 1943; B-21817, Feb. 12, 1942. 

182 Amtrak’s status as an instrumentality of the United States for this purpose was irrelevant 
because Amtrak’s enabling legislation specifically provides for tax immunity. E.g., 
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, 665 F. Supp. at 411; 49 U.S.C. § 24301.

basis, is a tax and not payable by the government. E.g., Harford County, 
supra; B-168287, Feb. 12, 1970; B-159084, May 11, 1966. 

Naturally, the determination of whether a particular assessment can be 
paid does not depend on the taxing authority’s characterization of the 
assessment. Thus, payment has been denied where the assessment was 
termed a “benefit assessment” (B-168287, Nov. 9, 1970), a “systems 
development charge” (B-183094, May 27, 1975), or an “invoice for services” 
(49 Comp. Gen. 72 (1969)). Regardless of the designation, if the charge is 
computed on a footage basis or in the same manner as the taxes levied 
against other property owners, it cannot be paid. 

However, even though an assessment may not be paid as a tax, a state or 
municipality may be compensated on a quantum meruit basis for the fair 
and reasonable value of the services actually received by the United States. 
Harford County, supra; 49 Comp. Gen. 72 (1969); 18 Comp. Gen. 562 
(1938); B-226503, Sept. 24, 1987; B-168287, Nov. 9, 1970; see 70 Comp. 
Gen. 687 (1991) (federal government may pay reasonable user fees to a 
county for use of its landfill). To be paid on a quantum meruit basis, it 
must be clear that the government could have acquired the services it 
received in a normal procurement, that the federal government received 
and accepted the benefit of the services provided, the persons seeking 
payment acted in good faith, and the amount claimed represents the 
reasonable value of the benefit received. 64 Comp. Gen. 727, 728 (1985). 
Not surprisingly, most of GAO’s decisions in this area involve an evaluation 
of the reasonableness of the claim. 

The method for computing the assessment is the primary means of 
determining whether the charge represents the fair value of services 
received. Quantum meruit claimants must show how they arrived at the 
amount claimed: An unsupported statement that the sum represents the 
fair and reasonable value of the services rendered is insufficient. Although 
the claim need not be presented on a strict “quantity of use” basis, only 
when it is clearly shown that the specified method of computation is based 
purely upon the value of the particular services rendered to the government 
may any payment be made. B-177325, Nov. 27, 1972; B-168287-O.M., July 28, 
1972; B-168287-O.M., Mar. 29, 1971. However, where a precise 
determination of the benefit received by the government cannot reasonably 
be made, payment has been allowed where the method of computation 
used did not appear unreasonable under the circumstances. B-168287O.M., 

supra.

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Applying the above principles, the Comptroller General concluded in one 
case that a special assessment based on the federal property’s ratable share 
of the cost of necessary repairs and improvements to a septic sewage 
system could be paid on a quantum meruit basis. B-177325, Nov. 27, 1972. 
However, in B-179618, Nov. 13, 1973, an assessment against an Air Force 
base for maintenance of a drainage ditch based on the “benefit” to the land 
could not be paid since there was no indication of how the amount of the 
benefit had been computed and no showing that the assessment 
represented the fair and reasonable value of the services rendered to the 
government. Similarly, a municipal assessment based on such factors as 
land area, structure value, and size was found to be a tax and therefore not 
payable in B-183094, May 27, 1975. 

Using the same analysis, GAO advised the Air Force in B-207695, June 13, 
1983, that it was not required to pay fees for well registration and 
withdrawal of groundwater, which a state had attempted to impose on the 
Air Force’s right to draw water from wells on federal property. There was 
no showing that the fees bore any relationship to any services provided to 
the government. Similarly, an assessment levied against a federal facility 
for sewer charges unrelated to actual sewer usage could not be paid as a 
tax. B-226503, Sept. 24, 1987. However, fees for permits or certificates for 
the right to use state-owned water represent charges for services rendered 
rather than taxes and may therefore be paid. 5 Comp. Gen. 413 (1925); 
1 Comp. Gen. 560 (1922). And one-time connection fees for hooking up 
federal facilities to local sewer systems, whether new construction or 
improvements, are payable as authorized service charges. 39 Comp. 
Gen. 363 (1959); 9 Comp. Gen. 41 (1929). Where the hook-up is incident to 
new construction, the fee is chargeable to the construction appropriation. 
19 Comp. Gen. 778 (1940). 

The principle that a state or municipality may be paid on a quantum 
meruit basis for services actually rendered provides a justification for the 
payment of a “service charge” for services rendered, as distinguished from 
a tax. E.g., 70 Comp. Gen. 687 (1991); 49 Comp. Gen. 72 (1969). However, a 
local government cannot collect a service charge for services that the 
governmental unit is required by law to provide, such as police or 
firefighting services. E.g., B-243004, Sept. 5, 1991 (special assessment to 
finance new city fire truck in support of municipal duty to provide fire

protection is a tax not payable by the United States). See also section C.7 of 
this chapter.183 

Where a local government finances major improvements, such as sewers, 
by means of issuing revenue bonds, and then levies a surcharge on its 
service charge to liquidate the bonded indebtedness, a federal user of the 
sewer service who is under a contractual obligation to pay the service 
charge may also pay the surcharge. 42 Comp. Gen. 653 (1963). However, 
GAO has questioned the payment of bond interest where that interest was 
attributable to the municipality’s share of initial construction costs. 

B-180221-O.M., Mar. 19, 1974. 

The United States’ exemption from property-related taxes has an obvious 
effect on some state and local jurisdictions. Congress may choose to 
compensate local taxing authorities for the loss of income attributable to 
federal holdings of real property within a particular jurisdiction by 
payments in lieu of taxes. See B-149803, May 15, 1972.184 Payments may also 
be made pursuant to specific legislation establishing a new federal enclave. 
See B-145801, Sept. 20, 1961. 

The assessments we have been discussing thus far are assessments levied 
by governmental entities. Tax immunity would not apply to assessments 
levied by private entities, where the federal government’s liability is 
determined by application of traditional concepts of contract and property 
law, subject to any applicable federal statutory provisions. For example, in 
B-210361, Aug. 30, 1983, GAO advised that the Forest Service was liable for 
assessments levied by a private homeowners’ association on a parcel the 
Forest Service had acquired by donation. The obligation to pay the 
assessments amounted to a covenant running with the land, and the United 

183 State and local jurisdictions are also prohibited from imposing “inspection fees” on the 
federal government, not because these fees are “taxes,” but because they are a prerequisite 
to the federal government’s execution of a government function, they interfere with the 
United States and violate the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2). Mayo v. United 
States, 319 U.S. 441, 447 (1943). The result would be different if a federal statute established 
the obligation of a federal agency to comply with state regulatory processes, however, 
including the payment of permit fees. B-286951, Jan. 10, 2002. 

184 The most important statute in this area is the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act (PILT), 
31 U.S.C. §§ 6901–6907, which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make payments, 
pursuant to statutory criteria, to units of local governments in which “entitlement land” is 
located. GAO has issued a number of decisions and opinions construing the PILT statute. 
See, e.g., 65 Comp. Gen. 849 (1986); 58 Comp. Gen. 19 (1978); B-212145, Oct. 2, 1984; 
B-214267, Aug. 28, 1984.

d. Taxes Paid by Federal 
Employees 
States became contractually bound by accepting the deed with notice of 
the covenant. 

The principles we have discussed in the context of real property also apply 
to personal property. E.g., 27 Comp. Gen. 273 (1947) (no legal basis to pay 
state registration fee on government-owned outboard motors). Several 
earlier decisions applied the federal government’s immunity against state 
motor vehicle license plate and title registration fees. 21 Comp. Gen. 769 
(1942); 4 Comp. Gen. 412 (1924); 1 Comp. Gen. 150 (1921); 15 Comp. 
Dec. 231 (1908). (Most federal government-owned vehicles today would 
have federal government plates.) 

A final type of property-related state tax we may mention briefly are the so-
called “death taxes.” Death taxes are of two types, estate taxes and 
inheritance taxes. An estate tax is based on the value of the taxable estate 
in its entirety; an inheritance tax is based on the value of taxable property 
passing to a particular beneficiary. Property given to the United States by 
testamentary disposition may be subject to a state inheritance tax. The 
Supreme Court has held that a state may impose an inheritance tax on 
property bequeathed to the United States, and indeed may completely 
prohibit testamentary gifts to the United States by its domiciliaries. United 
States v. Burnison, 339 U.S. 87, 93 (1950). Death taxes on gifts to the 
United States do not involve federal immunity because the taxes are 
imposed before the property reaches the hands of the beneficiary. (See also 
Chapter 6, section E on donations to the federal government, which 
includes citations to the leading cases.) 

There may be situations, although they should be uncommon, when it may 
be desirable to pay a state death tax from appropriated funds. In an early 
case, the Comptroller of the Treasury advised the Smithsonian Institution 
that it could use its appropriation for “preservation of collections” to pay a 
state inheritance tax on a legacy bequeathed to the Smithsonian. 26 Comp. 
Dec. 480 (1919). This type of situation could arise, for example, if a 
decedent bequeathed specific real or personal property to the United States 
and the estate contained insufficient assets to pay an applicable death tax 
without liquidating the property. 

Another way the federal government sometimes pays a state or local tax is 
by the reimbursement to a federal employee who incurred the tax during 
the performance of official business or other activities. For example, a 
member of the Armed Services was entitled to reimbursement under a 
government-supported health insurance plan for the full amount of a 

Page 4-301 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

doctor’s bill, including the amount that was attributable to the New Mexico 
gross receipts tax, a valid vendor tax. B-130520, Nov. 30, 1970. See also 
36 Comp. Gen. 681 (1957) (state gasoline tax); B-203151, Sept. 8, 1981 (local 
sales tax on rental vehicle); B-160040, July 13, 1976 (certain intangible 
property taxes reimbursable as relocation expenses incident to transfer). 
Some other commonly encountered situations are described below. 

(1) Parking taxes 
Questions here arise in two contexts: parking meter fees and municipal 
taxes on parking in parking lots or garages. 

The rule for parking meters on public streets is: Unless and until there is a 
contrary judicial determination, appropriated funds may be used to 
reimburse a federal employee for street parking meter fees incurred while 
driving a government-owned vehicle on official business, except (1) where 
the fee would impose an impermissible burden on the performance of a 
federal function or (2) where the particular fee has been held by a court to 
be a tax or a revenue raising measure (as opposed to a traffic regulation 
device). 46 Comp. Gen. 624 (1967).185 

To the extent a parking meter fee may be held to be a tax under the above 
rule, it cannot be imposed against the federal government or against the 
employee-driver as the government’s agent. 41 Comp. Gen. 328 (1961). 
However, even where the fee is a tax, if the car is unmarked and being used 
in investigative work, the fee can be reimbursed as a necessary cost of the 
investigation. 38 Comp. Gen. 258 (1958). 

The two preceding paragraphs apply to government-owned vehicles. A 
statute expressly authorizes employee reimbursement of parking fees 
when using a privately owned vehicle on official business. 5 U.S.C. § 5704; 
41 Comp. Gen. 328. 

Parking meter fees in a municipally owned, off-street parking lot are not 
viewed as taxes for purposes of the rule stated in 46 Comp. Gen. 624. These 
fees may therefore be reimbursed whether the employee is driving a 

185 Several earlier decisions were overruled by 46 Comp. Gen. 624 and several others were 
modified. The text attempts to reflect those elements of the modified decisions that remain 
valid.

government-owned or privately owned vehicle. 44 Comp. Gen. 578 
(1965).186 

A local tax on parking in a parking lot or garage cannot be imposed on a 
government-owned vehicle on official business. 51 Comp. Gen. 367 (1971). 
However, if the amount of the tax is so small as not to justify issuance of a 
tax exemption certificate, the employee may be reimbursed 
notwithstanding the government’s immunity. 52 Comp. Gen. 83 (1972). The 
rationale is that the administrative cost of asserting the immunity by using 
the certificate would be prohibitive for very small amounts. As with the 
parking meter fees, an employee using a privately owned vehicle on official 
business may be reimbursed under 5 U.S.C. § 5704 for local taxes levied on 
parking in lots or garages. 51 Comp. Gen. 367 (1971). 

To sum up the rules on parking taxes and fees: 

1. Privately owned vehicles on official business. Employee may be 
reimbursed for meter fees either on a street or in a municipal lot, and 
for taxes on parking in a lot or garage. 
2. Government-owned vehicle, metered parking. Employee may be 
reimbursed for meter fees on a public street unless one of the 
exceptions in 46 Comp. Gen. 624 applies, and for meter fees in a 
municipal lot. 
3. Government-owned vehicle, unmetered parking. Employee may be 
reimbursed for local taxes on parking in a lot or garage if the amount is 
too small for the issuance of a tax exemption certificate, at least where 
the taxing entity requires the certificate as evidence of tax-exempt 
status. 
(2) Hotel and meal taxes 
State and local governments frequently add one or more taxes to the cost of 
a stay at a hotel or motel. When a federal employee rents a room directly 
from the proprietor, even when on official business, the federal employee 
becomes personally liable for the amount of the rental, including associated 

186 Note, however, that although federal employees may be reimbursed for parking fees, they 
remain personally liable for fines incurred when the employees fail to “feed” the meter, 
unless the employees had no control over the situation. B-250880, Nov. 3, 1992. 

Page 4-303 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

taxes.187 Since the United States is not a party to the transaction, the 
Comptroller General reasoned that the tax was not levied on the federal 
government. Accordingly, the employee must pay the tax and cannot assert 
the government’s immunity from local taxes.188 That the government may 
reimburse the employee for the full rental price, including the tax, does not 
transform the tax into a tax on the federal government. 55 Comp. Gen. 1278 
(1976); B-172621-O.M., Aug. 10, 1976.189 If local law exempts federal 
employees from the tax, the employees should use tax exemption 
certificates to claim the exemption. 

However, if the government rents the rooms directly, that is, if there is a 
direct contractual relationship between the United States and a hotel or 
motel for the rental of rooms to federal employees or others, then the 
government is entitled to assert its immunity from local taxes. 55 Comp. 
Gen. 1278. The Department of Justice reached the same result in 5 Op. Off. 
Legal Counsel 348 (1981), opining that the Office of the Vice President was 
not required to pay local hotel taxes when reserving a block of rooms for 
an official trip.190 

Similar results would occur where a tax was imposed on commercial rental 
of a vehicle or any other travel-related activity such as meals or other 
transportation. B-167150, Apr. 3, 1972. On the theory that the contract 
defines the limits of liability, however, a meal ticket good for the purchase 
of food up to a maximum dollar amount may include amounts attributable 
to a valid vendor tax up to the specified dollar limit. In the event the dollar 
limit was exceeded, however, the remainder of the expense would be 
personal, including the extra amounts for tax. 41 Comp. Gen. 719 (1962). 

187 Federal employees are required to use credit cards issued by government contractors for 
their temporary duty travel, 41 C.F.R. § 301-51.1, and are personally responsible for paying 
the credit card bill according to the cardholder agreement. See id. § 301-52.24. 

188 41 C.F.R. § 301-11.28. 

189 Note that 41 C.F.R. § 301-11.27 expressly permits reimbursement of lodging taxes to 
federal employees as a miscellaneous travel expense. 

190 The Department of Justice notes that even where an individual employee is procuring the 
accommodation, the government could, if it wanted to change existing practice, compel 
recognition of federal immunity. 5 Op. Off. Legal Counsel at 349 n.2.

Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

(3) Tolls 
State and local authorities frequently charge tolls for the use of state-
owned highways, bridges, or tunnels. “A tax is a demand of sovereignty; a 
toll, a demand of proprietorship.” In re State Freight Tax, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 
232, 278 (1872). Thus, it has long been established that a toll is not a tax, 
but is a charge for the use of the road, bridge, or tunnel. Sands v. Manistee 
River Improvement Co., 123 U.S. 288, 294 (1887). Because tolls do not raise 
questions of federal tax immunity, they are properly payable where 
necessarily incurred in the performance of official business. 9 Comp. 
Gen. 41, 42 (1929); 4 Comp. Gen. 366 (1924); 24 Comp. Dec. 45 (1917). 
Statutory authority now exists for the reimbursement of tolls incurred by 
government employees on official travel. 5 U.S.C. § 5704(d); 35 Comp. 
Gen. 92 (1955). 

GAO has also held that appropriated funds may be used to purchase annual 
toll road permits where justified by anticipated usage.191 Similarly, if an 
employee who frequently uses a toll road on official business purchases an 
annual permit for his or her own automobile, the agency may reimburse the 
toll charges that would otherwise have been incurred, on a per trip basis, 
not to exceed the cost of the annual permit. 34 Comp. Gen. 556 (1955). 

Some of the early decisions held that a toll could not be paid if the 
particular highway, bridge, or tunnel was constructed with the aid of 
federal funds. 9 Comp. Gen. at 42; 24 Comp. Dec. at 48. The statement in 
24 Comp. Dec. was based on legislation that authorized federal financial 
assistance but also prohibited the charging of “tolls of all kinds.” Id. at 47. 
The Federal-Aid Highway Act includes an almost identical prohibition 
(23 U.S.C. § 301), but also authorizes tolls in certain circumstances 
(23 U.S.C. § 129). The editors have found no discussion of this issue under 
the modern legislation, nor have we found any guidance as to how, apart 
from the interstate highway system, a federal employee would know which 
roads were constructed with aid. Regardless, it would seem prudent to 
apply the concept of 52 Comp. Gen. 83 (1972), discussed above under 
parking taxes, in conjunction with the reimbursement authority of 5 U.S.C. 
§ 5704. 

191 These purchases do not violate the statutory prohibition on advance payments because, 
GAO reasoned, the government did not make an advance payment but rather purchased a 
present right to use the thoroughfare in the future. 36 Comp. Gen. 829 (1957).

(4) State and local income withholding taxes 
In the absence of statutory authority, state or local withholding 
requirements would not apply to the federal government because a state 
may not “regulate” the governmental activities of the United States. 
28 Comp. Gen. 101 (1948); 27 Comp. Gen. 372 (1948). The requisite 
statutory authority now exists. For the District of Columbia and any other 
state, city, or county that provides for the collection of income tax by 
withholding, the Secretary of the Treasury must enter into an agreement 
with the applicable jurisdiction to withhold the tax from federal employees. 
5 U.S.C. §§ 5516, 5517, 5520. 

(5) Possessory interest taxes 
A possessory interest tax is a tax on the exclusive right to the beneficial use 
of real property or its improvements held by a tax-exempt public agency. 
See United States v. County of San Diego, 965 F.2d 691 (9th Cir. 1992) 
(interpreting California law). The Supreme Court upheld the validity of a 
possessory interest tax on federal employees required to live in housing 
owned by the Forest Service. The Court found that the tax was 
nondiscriminatory and that its legal incidence fell upon the employees and 
not the United States. United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U.S. 452 
(1977); see also B-251228, July 20, 1993; B-191232, June 20, 1978. Similarly, a 
tax on a federal contractor who had the beneficial use of a government-
owned experimental fusion device was held lawful and payable by the 
contractor. County of San Diego, 965 F.2d at 691. The device, which 
weighed between 400 and 500 tons, was deemed a “fixture” annexed to the 
property by gravity. United States v. County of San Diego, 53 F.3d 965, 968 
(9th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 867 (1995). 

Where the government provides quarters for employees and collects rent 
under 5 U.S.C. § 5911, the rental rate may be adjusted to discount an 
applicable possessory interest tax, but the adjustment must be approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget and may not be retroactive. 

B-194420, Oct. 15, 1981. 

(6) Occupational license fees 
Occupational license fees or employment taxes are fees imposed by a state 
or local jurisdiction, usually on members of a particular occupation or 
profession, such as doctors, attorneys, and accountants, as a prerequisite 
to being able to work or practice in that jurisdiction. Apart from the question 

Page 4-306 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

e. Refund and Recovery of 
Tax Improperly Paid 
of a state’s authority to impose such fees on federal employees performing 
federal functions, GAO had consistently ruled that absent specific statutory 
authority, agencies could not use appropriated funds to pay these fees. E.g., 
47 Comp. Gen. 116 (1967). GAO reasoned that federal employees have the 
burden of qualifying themselves for the performance of official duties and, 
therefore, federal employees had to pay any expense associated with 
becoming qualified. 22 Comp. Gen. 460 (1942). Thanks to a statutory 
change, however, agencies now have the discretion to use available funds 
to pay the expenses of an employee to obtain professional credentials, 
including state-imposed professional licenses, certifications, and for the 
examinations required to obtain these credentials. 5 U.S.C. § 5757. For 
further discussion and case citations, see sections C.13.e (Personal 
Qualification Expenses) and C.12.b (Membership Fees—Attorneys) of this 
chapter. 

GAO has held that improperly paid taxes may be recovered by setoff 
against other moneys payable to a state. B-150228, Aug. 5, 1973; see United 
States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239–40 (1947) (United States as a 
creditor is entitled to set off amounts it is owed from amounts otherwise 
payable). Setoff may be asserted against any money payable to any other 
agency of the state, whether or not related to the source of the erroneous 
payments. B-154778, Aug. 6, 1964; B-154113, June 24, 1964; B-150228, 
Aug. 5, 1963.192 

Some states provide for refunds of certain taxes paid by the United States. 
In evaluating these refund provisions, it is important to determine whether 
the tax subject to refund is a vendor tax or a vendee tax. If the tax is a 
vendor tax, the United States is not constitutionally immune from payment. 
Thus, any right to a refund of a vendor tax is purely a creature of state law 
and the United States must comply with any conditions and limitations 
imposed by state law. B-100300, June 28, 1965.193 If, however, the tax is a 
vendee tax, the government’s right to a refund is based on the Constitution 
and is wholly independent of state law. Therefore, in claiming a refund in 

192 As explored in Chapter 13 (Volume III of the second edition of Principles of Federal 
Appropriations Law), the Debt Collection Act of 1982 permits using offset against state or 
local governments. Setoff against advances under a federal grant program is discussed in 
Chapter 10 (Volume III of the second edition of Principles). 

193 That a state law permits refunds to the United States as the ultimate bearer of the tax in 
certain situations does not transfer the legal incidence of the tax to the vendee. B-152995, 
Jan. 30, 1964. See also 27 Comp. Gen. 179 (1947).

this situation, the United States is not bound by restrictions in state law, 
such as state statutes of limitations. United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d 
803, 809–10 (6th Cir. 1988); B-154778, Aug. 6, 1964; B-100300, Feb. 10, 1956. 

Using an established refund mechanism is the preferred method of 
recovering improperly paid taxes. 42 Comp. Gen. 593 (1963). Thus, upon 
the request of a state, and as long as the interests of the United States will 
be protected, setoff may be deferred pending the filing of a formal claim 
with the appropriate state agency. B-151095, Jan. 2, 1964. However, if the 
state refuses a refund to which the United States is entitled, setoff is again 
the proper remedy if legally available. 39 Comp. Gen. 816 (1960); B-162005, 
Apr. 8, 1968. 

Where a sales tax has been improperly paid, the vendor is little more than a 
collection agent for the state and the state is the ultimate beneficiary of the 
improper payment. Therefore, collection action should proceed against the 
state rather than by setoff against the vendor. 42 Comp. Gen. 179 (1962). 

In the course of resolving problems over the liability of the United States to 
pay a particular tax, the government has entered into various arrangements 
with states pending the outcome of litigation. In one case, the government 
agreed with a state taxing authority to file tax forms without remitting any 
money, and to make the actual payments upon a final judicial 
determination in a pending test case that the tax was valid. B-160920, 
May 10, 1967. (The decision, after the Supreme Court upheld the validity of 
the tax, held that the back taxes should be paid notwithstanding expiration 
of the state statute of limitations.) In another case, the government 
negotiated an agreement with contractors whose contracts were being 
subjected to a questionable state sales tax, under which the General 
Services Administration agreed to pay the tax and the contractors 
promised to refund the amounts paid if it was ultimately determined that 
the government’s immunity applied. B-170899, Nov. 16, 1970. See also 
50 Comp. Gen. 343 (1970). 

16. Telephone Services 
a. Telephone Service to 
Private Residences 
(1) The statutory prohibition and its major exception 
A problem that existed during the early years of the twentieth century was 
an apparent tendency on the part of government officials to have 

Page 4-308 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

telephones installed in their homes at government expense. See 53 Comp. 
Gen. 195, 197 (1973); 19 Comp. Dec. 350, 352 (1912). It must be 
remembered that telephones were much more of a novelty in those days; 
we were still decades from the point where almost every American home 
has a private home telephone, not to mention a mobile or cellular phone. In 
any event, Congress enacted legislation in 1912 to prevent the use of public 
funds for private telephone service for government officials. The portion of 
the statute we are concerned with here, 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a)(1), provides: 

“Except as provided in this section, appropriations are not 
available to install telephones in private residences or for 
tolls or other charges for telephone service from private 
residences.” 

Over time statutory exceptions have been passed, however, eroding the 
once almost blanket prohibition against the payment for telephones in 
residences. For example, in 1995, with the advent of telecommuting and the 
flexible workplace, Congress passed a major exception to the latter 
prohibition. Agencies are expressly authorized to use appropriated funds: 

“to install telephone lines, and necessary equipment, and to 
pay monthly charges, in any private residence or private 
apartment of an employee who has been authorized to work 
at home in accordance with guidelines issued by the Office 
of Personnel Management: Provided, That the head of the 
department, division, bureau, or office certifies that 
adequate safeguards against private misuse exist, and that 
the service is necessary for direct support of the agency’s 
mission.” 

Pub. L. No. 104-52, title VI, § 620, 109 Stat. 468, 501 (Nov. 19, 1995). So in the 
case of employees authorized to work at home under OPM’s 
telework/telecommuting guidelines, (see http://www.telework.gov), once 
the agency certifies that adequate safeguards against private misuse exist, 
agencies may pay for the very same charges that 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1348(a)(1) otherwise would have prohibited. 

However, barring application of the 1995 statutory provision allowing 
payment for residential telephone expenses in a telework situation (and 
several other situation-specific statutory exceptions to be discussed later), 
the decisions under 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a)(1) are still applicable. 

Page 4-309 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

The decisions are fond of saying that the statute, for the most part, has 
been strictly applied. Indeed, the earlier decisions are packed with the 
“reflex” observations that the language of the statute is “plain and 
comprehensive,” the “prohibition is mandatory,” and the statute “leaves no 
room for the exercise of discretion on the part of the accounting officers of 
the Government.” E.g., 21 Comp. Gen. 997, 999 (1942). As late as 1996 one 
decision stated that: 

“The statute is plain on its face and although in today’s era 
of instant communications the statute may appear outdated, 
we may not rewrite the statute to fit a fashionable view of 
what the norm should be. Certainly if the statute is to retain 
any meaning, we may not, under the guise of being essential, 
routinely grant exceptions of convenience, however 
beneficial the result may appear.” 

B-262013, Apr. 8, 1996. 

Thus, the rule remains that charges for residential telephones (installation, 
connection, monthly equipment rental, and basic service charges) may not 
be paid from appropriated funds unless one of the statutory exceptions 
applies. As we shall see at the end of this section, technological advances 
have also created end runs around the statutory prohibition. 

(2) Funds to which the statute applies 
The statute is a direct restriction on the use of appropriated funds. As such, 
it applies not only to direct appropriations from the Treasury but also to 
funds that constitute appropriated funds by operation of law. Thus, the 
statute applies to expenditures from the revolving fund established by the 
Federal Credit Union Act since the authority to maintain a revolving fund 
constitutes a continuing appropriation. 35 Comp. Gen. 615, 618 (1956).194 

Along these same lines, the Comptroller General held in 4 Comp. Gen. 19 
(1924) that the Alaska Railroad could not designate residential telephones 
as “operating expenses” and pay for them from revenues derived from 

194 But see Core Concepts of Florida, Inc. v. United States, 327 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 
2003) (holding that revenues from revolving funds not deposited into the General Fund are 
not “appropriated funds” under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346). The Tucker Act provides 
for jurisdiction of claims against the United States.

operating the railroad. The Comptroller General pointed out in that case 
that the authority to do “all necessary things” to accomplish a statutory 
purpose confers legal discretion, not unlimited discretion, and the 
authority is therefore subject to statutory limitations such as 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1348. Id. at 20. The same point was made in 35 Comp. Gen. at 618, and in 

B-130288, Feb. 27, 1957. 

(3) What is a private residence? 
Simply stated, a private residence is where you live as opposed to where 
you work, assuming the two can be distinguished. Cases where the two 
cannot be distinguished are discussed later. For purposes of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1348, it makes no difference that the residence is government-owned or 
on public land. 35 Comp. Gen. 28 (1955); 7 Comp. Gen. 651 (1928); 
19 Comp. Dec. 198 (1912). The statute therefore fully applies to permanent 
residential quarters on a military installation. 21 Comp. Gen. 997 (1942); 
B-61938, Sept. 8, 1950; A-99355, Jan. 11, 1939. It does not apply, however, to 
tents or other temporary structures on a military post, which are not 
available for family occupancy, notwithstanding that military personnel 
may use them as temporary sleeping quarters. 21 Comp. Gen. 905 (1942). 

In 41 Comp. Gen. 190 (1961), the statutory prohibition was held not 
applicable to the installation of telephones in hotel rooms occupied by 
officials on temporary duty where necessitated by the demands of the 
mission. (One would have thought that all hotel rooms were already 
equipped with telephones by 1961.) 

An early decision stated that “private” means set apart for the exclusive 
personal use of any one person or family. 19 Comp. Dec. at 199. In this light, 
the Comptroller General held that appropriated funds could be used to 
install and operate local-service telephones in Army barracks occupied by 
large numbers of enlisted personnel. 53 Comp. Gen. 195 (1973). An earlier 
decision, 35 Comp. Gen. 28, applied the prohibition to several government-
owned residences, one of which was used to house a number of employees. 
While these two cases may appear inconsistent at first glance in that the 
telephones in both instances would be available for the personal use of the 
residents, the apparent distinction is that Army appropriations are 
available for the welfare and recreation of military personnel so that the 
“personal use” aspect in the Army barracks case was not necessarily 
dispositive. 

Page 4-311 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Since the statute uses only the term “residence,” it has been held not to 
prohibit service charges for a dedicated telephone line, on which a Navy-
supplied fax machine was installed for official use, in the private business 
office of a Naval Reserve officer. B-236232, Oct. 25, 1990. 

Note that although the principles in the above cases still are pertinent 
where 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a) applies, 31 U.S.C. § 1348(c) authorizes the 
Department of Defense to “install, repair, and maintain telephone wiring in 
residences owned or leased by the United States Government and, if 
necessary for national defense purposes, in other private residences.” 

The location of the installation of the telephone service is determinative 
even though it facilitates an employees receipt of phone messages at her 
residence. In this connection, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
was allowed to install call forwarding service in the government office of 
an employee who was permitted to work part time from her home for 
6 months in order to care for her newly born child so as to facilitate her 
conducting business with Commission staff and persons having business 
with the Commission. Since the employee would not be paid for charges 
for calls or other services originating from the employee’s residence, but 
rather the government was being billed for forwarding calls from the 
employee’s government office to her residence, 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a)(1) did 
not bar payment. Moreover, the call forwarding was not designed to 
improve the employee’s personal telephone service or facilitate her receipt 
of private or personal messages. 73 Comp. Gen. 44 (1993). 

(4) Application of the general rule 
A large number of decisions have established that the prohibition applies 
even though the telephones are to be extensively used in the transaction of 
public business and even though they may be desirable or necessary from 
an official standpoint. 59 Comp. Gen. 723, 724 (1980) and cases cited 
therein. In this respect, there is no discretion involved. A rather stark 
application of this rule can be found in the 1996 decision quoted above, 
which held that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not 
use appropriated funds to install telephone lines in the private residence of 
its Director. The agency tried to justify the telephone lines by arguing that 
the Director might need to respond quickly to emerging health crises 
around the world, but the agency had not explained its role in responding 
to emergent or urgent health crises and the consequences for public health 
and safety if it were to fail to respond immediately upon learning of the 
problems. B-262013, Apr. 8, 1996. 

Page 4-312 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

Relevant factors are whether the telephone will be freely available for the 
employee’s personal use and whether facilities other than the employee’s 
residence exist for the transaction of official business. The employee’s 
personal desires are irrelevant. Thus, it makes no difference that the 
employee doesn’t want the telephone and has asked to have it removed. 
33 Comp. Gen. 530 (1954); A-99355, Jan. 11, 1939. The fact that a telephone 
is unlisted is also immaterial. 15 Comp. Gen. 885 (1936). 

The rule is well illustrated in a 1980 decision in which the District 
Commander of the Seventh Coast Guard District sought to be reimbursed 
for a telephone installed in his residence. The Commander was in charge of 
the Cuban Refugee Freedom Flotilla in the Florida Straits. He was in daily 
contact with the various federal, state, and local agencies involved and was 
required to be available 24 hours a day. Since this situation placed a burden 
on the Commander’s immediate family by restricting their personal use of 
the home telephone, he had another telephone installed for official 
business. In view of the statutory prohibition, and since the Commander 
was already provided with an office by the Coast Guard, reimbursement 
could not be allowed. 59 Comp. Gen. 723, supra. For an earlier decision 
applying the prohibition notwithstanding the need for employees to be 
available on a 24-hour basis, see 11 Comp. Gen. 87 (1931). 

A somewhat similar situation was presented in B-130288, Feb. 27, 1957. 
There, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service sought authority to 
pay for telephones in the homes of mediators stationed in cities where 
office accommodations were not provided. The mediators had to work out 
of their homes and were required to be available 24 hours a day. Applying 
the statutory prohibition, the Comptroller General concluded that the 
agency could not pay for the telephones, nor could it pay for an answering 
service. However, there was no reason a mediator couldn’t list his private 
telephone number under the agency’s name, and the government could pay 
for this listing. By doing this, the government would not be paying for 
personal use of the telephone. 

In B-175732, May 19, 1976, it was proposed to install a telephone in the 
“galley” (kitchen) of the Coast Guard Commandant’s home, for use by a 
“subsistence specialist” who worked there and presumably had no access 
to other telephones. The argument was that while the galley may have been 
part of the Commandant’s private residence, it was the subsistence 
specialist’s duty station and since he had no other office, he had to conduct 
government business from the galley. GAO found the proposal prohibited 
by 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a)(1). Although the duties of the subsistence 

Page 4-313 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

specialist—the procurement of food, supplies, and services—were official 
to him, they nevertheless accrued largely if not exclusively to the personal 
benefit of the Commandant and were not sufficient to justify an exception. 

(5) Exceptions 
As we have seen above, although the statute has been strictly applied, there 
are exceptions. 

First, there are statutory exceptions. 

• One example is 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a)(2), for residences owned or leased 
by the United States in foreign countries for use of the Foreign Service. 

• Another statutory exception is 31 U.S.C. § 1348(b), enacted in 1922, 
covering telephones deemed necessary in connection with the 
construction and operation of locks and dams for navigation, flood 
control, and related water uses, under regulations of the Secretary of 
the Army. 

• A further and broader exception enacted in 1984 provides that under 
regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, Department of 
Defense appropriations are available to install, repair, and maintain 
telephone wiring in residences owned and leased by the United States 
government and, if necessary for national defense purposes, in other 
private residences. 31 U.S.C. § 1348(c). 

• Yet another statutory exception is provided in 10 U.S.C. 
§ 1588(f)(1) which allows the Secretary concerned to install telephone 
lines and any necessary telecommunications equipment in the private 
residences of persons, designated in accordance with the regulations, 
to provide voluntary services for programs providing services to 
members of the armed forces and their families. 

• Still another is 16 U.S.C. § 580f, for telephones necessary for the 
protection of national forests. 

Next, there are some nonstatutory exceptions. They fall generally into two 
categories. The first, dictated by common sense, involves situations where 
private residence and official duty station are one and the same. If the 
government has made available office facilities elsewhere, it is clear that a 
residential telephone cannot be charged to appropriated funds no matter 

Page 4-314 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

how badly it is needed for official business purposes. E.g., 59 Comp. 
Gen. 723 (1980); 22 Comp. Dec. 602 (1916). However, exceptions have been 
recognized where a government-owned private residence was the only 
location available under the circumstances for the conduct of official 
business. E.g., 4 Comp. Gen. 891 (1925) (isolated lighthouse keeper); 
19 Comp. Dec. 350 (1912) (lock tender); 19 Comp. Dec. 212 (1912) (national 
park superintendent). 

Note that in all of these cases the combined residence/duty station was 
government-owned. The exception has not been extended to privately 
owned residences that are also used for the conduct of official business. 

26 Comp. Gen. 668 (1947); B-130288, Feb. 27, 1957; B-219084-O.M., June 10, 
1985. The theory seems to be that, in a privately owned residence, the 
degree of personal use as opposed to likely official need is considered so 
great as to warrant a stricter prohibition since there would be no other 
practical way to control abuse, whereas some flexibility is afforded for 
government-owned residences where sufficient official use for telephones 
exists. 53 Comp. Gen. 195, 197–98 (1973). Note that, as stated, the express 
prohibition in 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a)(1) applies to residences and does not 
apply when telephone services are provided in a private business office. 
B-236232, Oct. 25, 1990. 

It should also be noted that isolation alone is not sufficient to justify an 
exception. In 35 Comp. Gen. 28 (1955), 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a)(1) was held to 
prohibit payment for telephones in government-owned residences of 
Department of Agriculture employees at a sheep experiment station. The 
employees claimed a need for the telephones because they frequently 
received calls outside of normal office hours from Washington or to notify 
them of unexpected visitors and shipments of perishable goods, and 
because they were sometimes stranded in their residences by severe 
blizzards. Here 4 Comp. Gen. 891 was distinguished because the telephone 
in that case was installed in a room equipped and used only as an office and 
was not readily available for personal use. 

The second category of nonstatutory exceptions stems from the 
recognition that the “evil” that 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a)(1) is intended to address 
is not the physical existence of a telephone, but the potential for charging 
the government for personal use. Thus, a series of cases has approved 
exceptions where (1) there is an adequate justification of necessity for a 
telephone in a private residence and (2) there are adequate safeguards to 
prevent abuse. 

Page 4-315 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

This category seems to have first developed in the context of “military 
necessity” and national security justifications. For example, an exception 
was made to permit the installation in the residence of the Pearl Harbor 
Fire Marshal (a civilian employee) of a telephone extension that was 
mechanically limited to emergency fire calls. 32 Comp. Gen. 431 (1953), 
modifying 32 Comp. Gen. 271 (1952). See also 21 Comp. Gen. 905 (1942). In 
B-128144(3), June 29, 1956, GAO approved a proposal to install direct 
telephone lines from an Air Force Command Post switchboard to the 
private residences of certain high-level civilian and military officials to 
ensure communications in the event of a national emergency. Air Force 
regulations prohibited the use of these lines for anything but urgent official 
business in the event of a national emergency and authorized the recording 
of conversations as a safeguard against abuse. 

However, a “necessity” that is little more than a matter of convenience is 
not enough to overcome the prohibition. For example, in A-99355, Jan. 11, 
1939, a telephone could not be maintained at government expense in the 
private quarters of the Officer-in-Charge on a Navy installation because 
several telephones were available in established offices on the station. This 
decision was followed in 21 Comp. Gen. 997 (1942) and 33 Comp. Gen. 530 
(1954). The prohibition applies equally to an intra-base system not 
connected to outside commercial trunk lines. B-61938, Sept. 8, 1950.195 

Relying largely on B128144(3), GAO approved a General Services 
Administration proposal to install Federal Secure Telephone Service 
telephones in the residences of certain high-level civilian and military 
officials certified by their agency heads as having national security 
responsibilities. 61 Comp. Gen. 214 (1982). The system was designed to 
provide a secure communications capability to permit the discussion of 
classified material that could not be discussed over private telephones. As 
in B-128144(3), the proposal included a number of safeguards against 
abuse, which GAO deemed adequate. 

The concept established in the military necessity/national security cases 
would subsequently be applied in other contexts as well. Thus, GAO 
approved exceptions in the following cases: 

195 The Navy now has statutory authority to use its appropriations to pay for the installation 
and use (except for personal long-distance calls) of extension telephones connecting public 
quarters occupied by naval personnel (but not civilian employees) with station 
switchboards. 10 U.S.C. § 7576. 

Page 4-316 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

• Installation of dedicated Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) 
lines to transmit data from computers in the private residences of the 
commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission to the 
agency’s local area network as it permitted data encryption necessary 
to secure confidential communications and the Commission had 
imposed adequate safeguards to prevent private use of the separate 
ISDN lines. In this decision it was also noted that, although section 620 
of Pub. L. No. 104-52, 109 Stat. 468, 501 (Nov. 19, 1995), permitting 
installation of phone lines for employees permitted to work at home, 
did not by its terms address presidentially appointed officers such as 
the Commissioners, “it would be anomalous for us to overlook the 
public policy established in section 620 and apply the section 
1348(a)(1) prohibition in a manner to preclude government officials 
who are on duty 24 hours from the same conveniences as other 
government employees.” B-280698, Jan. 12, 1999. Compare B-262013, 
Apr. 8, 1996, a decision that was issued less than 3 years earlier, in 
which the GAO held that the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention could not install telephone lines in the private residence of 
its Director, in part because the agency had not demonstrated that 
adequate safeguards to prevent misuse of the telephone lines would be 
in place. 

• Installation of telephone equipment by the Internal Revenue Service in 
the homes of customer “assistors” who were intermittent, part-time 
employees. The phones to be installed had no outcall capability and 
could receive calls only from IRS switching equipment. Separate lines 
were essential because the employee’s personal phones could not be 
used with the IRS equipment. B-220148, June 6, 1986. See also 
B-247857, Aug. 25, 1992, in which GAO held when telephone service 
installation in a private residence is of restricted use or when there are 
numerous safeguards and the service is deemed essential, the 
prohibition is inapplicable. The National Mediation Board had 
demonstrated the essential nature of the computer data transmission 
service and would prevent private misuse by installing dedicated 
telephone lines. 

• Installation of telephones in the homes of Internal Revenue Service 
criminal investigators who were authorized to work from their homes, 
to be used for portable computer data transmission. GAO found the 
agency’s justification adequate and approved the expenditure, 
contingent upon the establishment of adequate safeguards, such as 

Page 4-317 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 4 
Availability of Appropriations: Purpose 

those in 61 Comp. Gen. 214, to prevent personal use. 65 Comp. Gen. 835 
(1986). 

• Installation of separate telephone lines in the homes of IRS data 
transcribers authorized to work at home under a “flexiplace” program, 
again subject to the establishment of adequate safeguards. 68 Comp. 
Gen. 502 (1989). 

• Installation of telephones in the homes of certain high level Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission (NRC) officials to ensure immediate 
communication capability in the event of a nuclear accident. The 
phones would be capable of dialing only internal NRC numbers, with 
any other calls to be placed through the NRC operator. B-223837, 
Jan. 23, 1987. 

Some of the cases noted earlier in which the prohibition was applied, such 
as 59 Comp. Gen. 723 and B-262013, also presented strong justifications. 
The primary feature distinguishing these cases from the exceptions 
described above is the existence in the latter group of adequate safeguards 
against abuse. 

Finally, a couple of cases have dealt with payment for telephone services 
during periods of nonoccupancy. In order to ensure continuous service, the 
government secures telephone service for the residence of the Air Deputy 
for the Allied Forces Northern Europe in Norway by long-term lease with 
the Norwegian Telephone Company. Normally, the Air Deputy pays the 
charges. The question presented in 60 Comp. Gen. 490 (1981) was who 
should pay the charges accruing during a vacancy in the position. The 
Comptroller General held that since the quarters were not the private 
residence of either the outgoing or the incoming Air Deputy during the 
period of vacancy, no public official received the benefit of the service 
during that period. Therefore, payment from appropriated funds would not 
thwart the statutory purpose. 

The decision distinguished an earlier case, 11 Comp. Gen. 365 (1932), 
denying payment for telephone service to the residence of the U.S. 
Ambassador to Mexico during a period when the position was vacant. In 
the 1932 case, the service had been retained during the interim period 
mainly through inadvertence. In 60 Comp. Gen. 490, on the other hand, 
retention of the service was necessary to avoid delays in reinstallation 
when the new Air Deputy moved in. The decision did note, however, that 
except in limited situations of public necessity such as the one involved,

b. Long-distance Calls 
c. Mobile or Cellular Phones 
telephone service should ordinarily be canceled during periods of 
nonoccupancy. 

The long-distance telephone call certification requirement which existed at 
former 31 U.S.C. § 1348(b), has been repealed by section 1721 of Pub. L. 
No. 104-201, div. A, title XVII, subtitle B, 110 Stat. 2422, 2758 (Sept. 23, 
1996). Note also that agencies have adopted policies to allow limited 
personal use of office equipment, including telephones. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. 
§ 45.4(2) in which the Department of Justice allows limited personal 
telephone/fax calls to locations within the office’s commuting area, or that 
are charged to nongovernment accounts; and GAO Order No. 0645.1, 

Limited Personal Use of Government-Provided Office and IT Equipment, 
Including Internet, Jan. 16, 2001, at 6(a)(3), which allows employees to 
make occasional brief domestic telephone calls. 

Just as significant statutory exceptions have eroded the once almost 
blanket prohibition against the payment for telephones in residences, 
likewise, technological advancements are eroding the application of 
31 U.S.C. § 1348(a) in a more practical manner as mobile or cellular phones 
become ubiquitous. 

In a 1988 case, B-229406, Dec. 9, 1988, an agency official used his own funds 
to purchase a cellular telephone and have it installed in his personal 
automobile. GAO stated with respect to 31 U.S.C. § 1348(a) that the statute 
addresses residences, not automobiles. Concluding that “section 1348 does 
not apply to cellular phones located in private automobiles,” GAO advised 
that the agency could reimburse business calls as long as there were 
adequate safeguards to prevent abuse. The safeguards existed in this case 
because all calls were individually itemized on a monthly basis. The 
decision cautioned, however, that “agency heads should strictly scrutinize 
automobile telephone calls before certifying them for reimbursement,” to 
ensure that the most economical means of communication are being used. 

Subsequent decisions have approved agencies’ reimbursement, on an 
actual expense basis, for access to and use of an employee’s personal cell 
phone. B-291076, Mar. 6, 2003; B-287524, Oct. 22, 2001. However the 
decisions have held that reimbursement may not be made on a flat rate 
basis. In B-287524 GAO found that flat rate reimbursement was prohibited 
by 5 U.S.C. § 5536 as a flat rate plan raises the risk of improperly 
reimbursing employees for personal use—setting a flat fee tends to result 
in either a gain or a loss to the reimbursed employee. 

Page 4-319 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

In B-291076 GAO stated that an agency may reimburse its employees for 
the actual costs of maintaining personal cell phone services that meet the 
agency’s minimum needs and the additional costs that may arise from any 
official calls actually made or received on the employee’s cell phone. 
Safeguards included in the agency proposal (requiring monthly, itemized 
service provider invoices, limiting claims to the expenses the agency would 
otherwise pay for such services, and adjusting claims to exclude hidden 
costs of “free” services included in the service provider’s plan) provided 
adequate assurance that the reimbursements will be limited to government-
related calls. 

GAO’s most recent decisions have assumed that an agency has the 
authority to purchase and issue government-owned cellular phones, along 
with accessories, to its employees so that the employees may conduct 
government business. B-291076 and B-287524, supra. 

Prior to the latter decisions GAO had considered the purchase of cellular 
telephones for use by Members of the Senate and concluded that the 
expenditure was authorized from the Senate’s contingent fund. B-227763, 
Sept. 17, 1987; B-186877, Aug. 12, 1976. The 1976 opinion had taken a 
negative view of the question from the policy perspective and suggested 
that more specific legislative authority would be appropriate. This was 
done and there is now express statutory authority to use the contingent 
fund of the Senate to provide telecommunications services and equipment. 
2 U.S.C. §§ 58(a)(1) and 58a. 

However, as the later decisions, B-291076 and B-287524, demonstrate, GAO 
did not require the agencies requesting those decisions to show express 
statutory authority for the purchase and issuance of cellular phones to their 
employees. GAO did not object to the agencies purchasing cellular phones 
and issuing them to their employees for the conduct of government 
business. (In B-229406, supra, the purchase price of a cellular phone could 
not be reimbursed but it was clear in that case that the official intended the 
phone to be his own property.)

Availability of Appropriations: Time 

A. General 
Principles— 
Duration of 
Appropriations 
1. Introduction As we have emphasized in several places in this publication, the concept of 
the “legal availability” of appropriations is defined in terms of three 
elements—purpose, time, and amount. Chapter 4 focused on purpose; this 
chapter addresses the second element, time. 
The two basic authorities conferred by an appropriation law are the 
authority to incur obligations and the authority to make expenditures. An 
obligation results from some action that creates a liability or definite 
commitment on the part of the government to make an expenditure. (The 
concept of “obligation” and the criteria for charging obligations against 
appropriations are discussed in detail in Chapter 7.) The expenditure is the 
disbursement of funds to pay the obligation. While an obligation and 
expenditure may occur simultaneously, ordinarily the obligation precedes 
the expenditure in time. This chapter discusses the limitations on the use of 
appropriations relating to time—when they may be obligated and when they 
may be expended. Many of the rules are statutory and will be found in the 
provisions of Title 31, United States Code, cited throughout this chapter. 

Our starting point is the firmly established proposition that— 

“Congress has the right to limit its appropriations to 
particular times as well as to particular objects, and when it 
has clearly done so, its will expressed in the law should be 
implicitly followed.” 

13 Op. Att’y Gen. 288, 292 (1870). The placing of time limits on the 
availability of appropriations is one of the primary means of congressional 
control. By imposing a time limit, Congress reserves to itself the 
prerogative of periodically reviewing a given program or agency’s activities. 

When an appropriation is by its terms made available for a fixed period of 
time or until a specified date, the general rule is that the availability relates 
to the authority to obligate the appropriation, and does not necessarily 

Page 5-3 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

prohibit payments after the expiration date for obligations previously 
incurred, unless the payment is otherwise expressly prohibited by statute. 
37 Comp. Gen. 861, 863 (1958); 23 Comp. Gen. 862 (1944); 18 Comp. 
Gen. 969 (1939); 16 Comp. Gen. 205 (1936). Thus, a time-limited 
appropriation is available to incur an obligation only during the period for 
which it is made. However, it remains available beyond that period, within 
limits, to make adjustments to the amount of such obligations and to make 
payments to liquidate such obligations. In this connection, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1502(a) provides: 

“The balance of an appropriation or fund limited for 
obligation to a definite period is available only for payment 
of expenses properly incurred during the period of 
availability or to complete contracts properly made within 
that period of availability and obligated consistent with 
section 1501 of this title. However, the appropriation or fund 
is not available for expenditure for a period beyond the 
period otherwise authorized by law.” 

In addition, there are situations in which appropriations may be “held over” 
by statute and by judicial decree for obligation beyond their expiration 
date. The concepts summarized in this paragraph will be explored in depth 
elsewhere in this chapter. 

2. Types of Appropriations Classified on the basis of duration, appropriations are of three types: 
annual, multiple year, and no-year appropriations. 
a. Annual Appropriations Annual appropriations (also called fiscal year or 1-year appropriations) are 
made for a specified fiscal year and are available for obligation only during 
the fiscal year for which made. The federal government’s fiscal year begins 
on October 1 and ends on September 30 of the following year. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1102. For example, fiscal year 2005 begins on October 1, 2004, and ends 
on September 30, 2005. 
All appropriations are presumed to be annual appropriations unless the 
appropriation act expressly provides otherwise. There are several reasons 
for this. First, as required by 1 U.S.C. § 105, the title and enacting clause of 
all regular and supplemental appropriation acts specify the making of 
appropriations “for the fiscal year ending September 30, (here insert the 
calendar year).” Thus, everything in an appropriation act is presumed to be 

Page 5-4 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

applicable only to the fiscal year covered unless specified to the contrary. 
Second, 31 U.S.C. § 1301(c) provides that, with specified exceptions: 

“An appropriation in a regular, annual appropriation law 
may be construed to be permanent or available 
continuously only if the appropriation— 

…. 

“(2) expressly provides that it is available after the fiscal 
year covered by the law in which it appears.” 

Third, appropriation acts commonly include a general provision similar to 
the following: 

“No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall 
remain available for obligation beyond the current fiscal 
year unless expressly so provided herein.”1 

Under the plain terms of this provision, the origin of which has previously 
been discussed in Chapter 2, section C.2.d, the availability of an 
appropriation to incur a new obligation may not be extended beyond the 
fiscal year for which it is made absent express indication in the 
appropriation act itself. 71 Comp. Gen. 39 (1991); 58 Comp. Gen. 321 
(1979); B-118638, Nov. 4, 1974. 

A limitation item included in an appropriation (for example, a lump-sum 
appropriation with a proviso that not to exceed a specified sum shall be 
available for a particular object) is subject to the same fiscal year limitation 
attaching to the parent appropriation unless the limitation is specifically 

1 See, e.g., the following fiscal year 2002 appropriation acts: Pub. L. No. 107-76, § 706, 
115 Stat. 704, 732 (Nov. 28, 2001) (Agriculture); Pub. L. No. 107-77, § 602, 115 Stat. 748, 798 
(Nov. 28, 2001) (Commerce, Justice, State); Pub. L. No. 107-117, § 8003, 115 Stat. 2230, 2247 
(Jan. 10, 2002) (Defense); Pub. L. No. 107-96, § 104, 115 Stat. 923, 946 (Nov. 21, 2001) 
(District of Columbia); Pub. L. No. 107-115, § 511, 115 Stat. 2118, 2141 (Jan. 10, 2002) 
(Foreign Operations); Pub. L. No. 107-63, § 303, 115 Stat. 414, 465 (Nov. 5, 2001) (Interior); 
Pub. L. No.107-116, § 502, 115 Stat. 2177, 2217 (Jan. 10, 2002) (Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education); Pub. L. No. 107-68, § 302, 115 Stat. 560, 591 (Nov. 12, 2001) 
(Legislative); Pub. L. No. 107-87, § 306, 115 Stat. 833, 855 (Dec. 18, 2001) (Transportation); 
Pub. L. No. 107-67, § 501, 115 Stat. 514, 543 (Nov. 12, 2001) (Treasury).

exempted from it in the appropriation act. 37 Comp. Gen. 246, 248 (1957); 
B-274576, Jan. 13, 1997. 

Annual appropriations are available only to meet bona fide needs of the 
fiscal year for which they were appropriated. The so-called “bona fide 
needs rule” is covered in detail in this chapter in section B. 

If an agency fails to obligate its annual funds by the end of the fiscal year 
for which they were appropriated, they cease to be available for incurring 
and recording new obligations and are said to have “expired.” This rule— 
that time-limited budget authority ceases to be available for incurring new 
obligations after the last day of the specified time period—has been termed 
an “elementary principle” of federal fiscal law. City of Houston, Texas v. 
Department of Housing & Urban Development, 24 F.3d 1421, 1426 (D.C. 
Cir. 1994); West Virginia Ass’n of Community Health Centers, Inc. v. 
Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1576 (D.C. Cir. 1984). See also 18 Comp. Gen. 969, 
971 (1939). Annual appropriations remain available for an additional five 
fiscal years beyond expiration, however, to adjust and make payments to 
liquidate liabilities arising from obligations made within the fiscal year for 
which the funds were appropriated. 31 U.S.C. § 1553(a), as amended by 
Pub. L. No. 101-510, § 1405(a), 104 Stat. 1676 (Nov. 5, 1990). The principles 
summarized in this paragraph are discussed in this chapter in section D. 

The above principles are illustrated in 56 Comp. Gen. 351 (1977). In that 
case, the Interior Department proposed to obtain and exercise options on 
certain land, obligate the full purchase price, and take immediate title to 
and possession of the property. Payment of the purchase price, however, 
would be disbursed over a period of up to 4 years. The reason being that, in 
view of the capital gains tax, the seller would have insisted on a higher 
purchase price if payment was to be made in a lump sum. The Comptroller 
General concluded that the proposal was not legally objectionable, 
provided that (a) a bona fide need for the property existed in the fiscal year 
in which the option was to be exercised and (b) the full purchase price was 
obligated against appropriations for the fiscal year in which the option was 
exercised. As long as these conditions were met—obligation within the 
period of availability for a legitimate need existing within that period—the 
timing of actual disbursements over a 4-year period was irrelevant. 

Just as Congress can by statute expand the obligational availability of an 
appropriation beyond a fiscal year, it can also reduce the availability to a 
fixed period less than a full fiscal year. To illustrate, a fiscal year 1980 
appropriation for the now defunct Community Services Administration 

Page 5-6 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

included funds for emergency energy assistance grants. Since the program 
was intended to provide assistance for increased heating fuel costs, and 
Congress did not want the funds to be used to buy air conditioners, the 
appropriation specified that awards could not be made after June 30, 1980.2 
Appropriations available for obligation for less than a full fiscal year are, 
however, uncommon. 
Finally, Congress may pass a law to rescind the unobligated balance of a 
fixed (annual or multiple year) appropriation at any time prior to the 
accounts closing.3 The law may be passed at the initiation of the President 
pursuant to the impoundment procedures (see discussion in Chapter 1, 
section D.3) or by Congress as part of its regular legislative process. 
b. Multiple Year 
Appropriations 
Multiple year appropriations are available for obligation for a definite 
period in excess of one fiscal year. 37 Comp. Gen. 861, 863 (1958). For 
example, if a fiscal year 2005 appropriation act includes an appropriation 
account that specifies that it shall remain available until September 30, 
2006, it is a 2-year appropriation. As a more specific illustration, the 
appropriation accounts for military construction are typically 5-year 
appropriations.4 
Apart from the extended period of availability, multiple year appropriations 
are subject to the same principles applicable to annual appropriations and 
do not present any special problems. 
c. No-Year Appropriations A no-year appropriation is available for obligation without fiscal year 
limitation. For an appropriation to be considered a no-year appropriation, 
the appropriating language must expressly so provide. 31 U.S.C. § 1301(c). 
The standard language used to make a no-year appropriation is “to remain 
available until expended.” 40 Comp. Gen. 694, 696 (1961); 3 Comp. 
Dec. 623, 628 (1897); B-279886, Apr. 28, 1998; B-271607, June 3, 1996. 

2 Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1980, Pub. L. 
No. 96-126, 93 Stat. 954, 978 (Nov. 27, 1979). Due to a severe heat wave in the summer of 
1980, the program was expanded to include fans and the appropriation was subsequently 
extended to the full fiscal year Pub. L. No. 96-321, 94 Stat. 1001 (Aug. 4, 1980). 

3 E.g., Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-11, 
117 Stat. 559, 571, 591–593 (Apr. 16, 2003); Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, 
Pub. L. No. 108-7, 117 Stat. 11, 106, 107 (Feb. 20, 2003). 

4 See, e.g., the Military Construction Appropriations Act, 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-64, 115 Stat. 
474 (Nov. 5, 2001).

However, other language will suffice as long as its meaning is 
unmistakable, such as “without fiscal year limitation.” 57 Comp. Gen. 865, 
869 (1978). 

Unless canceled in accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 1555 or rescinded by 
another law, there are no time limits as to when no-year funds may be 
obligated and expended and the funds remain available for their original 
purposes until expended. 43 Comp. Gen. 657 (1964); 40 Comp. Gen. 694 
(1961). This includes earmarks applicable to the use of no-year funds since 
they are coextensive with, and inseparable from, the period of availability 
of the no-year appropriation to which they relate. B-274576, Jan. 13, 1997. 

A small group of decisions involves the effect of subsequent congressional 
action on the availability of a prior years no-year appropriation. In one 
case, Congress had made a no-year appropriation to the Federal Aviation 
Administration for the purchase of aircraft. A question arose as to the 
continued availability of the appropriation because, in the following year, 
Congress explicitly denied a budget request for the same purpose. The 
Comptroller General held that the subsequent denial did not restrict the use 
of the unexpended balance of the prior no-year appropriation. The 
availability of the prior appropriation could not be changed by a later act 
“except in such respects and to such extent as is expressly stated or clearly 
implied by such act.” 40 Comp. Gen. 694, 696 (1961). See also Atlantic Fish 
Spotters Ass’n v. Evans, 321 F.3d 220 (1st Cir. 2003); B-200519, Nov. 28, 
1980. 

In another case, a no-year appropriation for the National Capital Park and 
Planning Commission included a monetary ceiling on noncontract services 
during the fiscal year. Based on the apparent intent of the ceiling, GAO 
concluded that the specific restriction had the effect of suspending the 
“available until expended” provision of prior unrestricted no-year 
appropriations as far as personal services were concerned, for any fiscal 
year in which the restriction was included. Thus, unobligated balances of 
prior unrestricted no-year appropriations could not be used to augment the 
ceiling. 30 Comp. Gen. 500 (1951). A similar issue was considered in 
62 Comp. Gen. 692 (1983). The Nuclear Regulatory Commission received a 
no-year appropriation that included a prohibition on compensating 
intervenors. The decision held that the unobligated balance of a prior 
unrestricted no-year appropriation could be used to pay an Equal Access to 
Justice Act award to an intervenor made in a restricted year, where part of 
the proceeding giving rise to the award was funded by an unrestricted 
appropriation. Unlike the situation in 30 Comp. Gen. 500, the restriction in 

Page 5-8 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

the 1983 case was expressly limited to “proceedings funded in this Act,” 
and thus could have no effect on the availability of prior appropriations. 

Similar issues were considered in the context of multiple year 
appropriations in 31 Comp. Gen. 368 (1952) and 31 Comp. Gen. 543 (1952), 
overruling 31 Comp. Gen. 275 (1952). In both of these cases, based on a 
determination of congressional intent, it was held that the current 
restriction had no effect on the availability of unobligated balances of prior 
unrestricted appropriations. 

No-year appropriations have advantages and disadvantages. The 
advantages to the spending agency are obvious. From the legislative 
perspective, a key disadvantage is a loss of congressional control over 
actual program levels from year to year. GAO has expressed the position 
that no-year appropriations should not be made in the absence of 
compelling programmatic or budgetary reasons. See U.S. General 
Accounting Office, No-Year Appropriations in the Department of 
Agriculture, PAD-78-74 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 19, 1978). 

3. Obligation or 
Expenditure Prior to 
Start of Fiscal Year 
In considering what may and may not be done before the start of a fiscal 
year, it is necessary to keep in mind the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits 
obligations or expenditures in advance of appropriations, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1341(a), and apportionments, 31 U.S.C. § 1517(a).5 By virtue of this law, 
certainly no obligations may be incurred before the appropriation act is 
enacted and amounts apportioned to the agency, unless specifically 
authorized by law.6 

There are some decisions that stand for the proposition that if the 
appropriation act is passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the 
President prior to the start of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is 
being made, contracts may be entered into upon enactment and before the 
start of the fiscal year, provided that no payments or expenditures may be 
made under them until the start of the fiscal year. Any such contract should 
make this limitation clear. 20 Comp. Gen. 868 (1941); 16 Comp. Gen. 1007 
(1937); 4 Comp. Gen. 887 (1925); 2 Comp. Gen. 739 (1923); 11 Comp. 
Dec. 186 (1904); 4 Lawrence, First Comp. Dec. 132 (1883); B-20670, Oct. 18, 

5 See Chapter 6, section C for a discussion of the apportionment process.

Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

1941; A-19524, Aug. 26, 1927. GAO did not view the contract as an 
obligation in violation of the Antideficiency Act since, even though the time 
period covered by the appropriation to be charged had not yet started, the 
appropriation had already been enacted into law. These decisions 
addressed these contracts from an Antideficiency Act perspective, and did 
not address the bona fide needs rule. 

In other decisions, the Comptroller General has expressed the opinion that, 
in the absence of any other statutory authority, the awarding 
o32“conditional contract” prior to the enactment of the appropriation act to 
be charged with the obligation does not raise Antideficiency Act or bona 
fide needs issues when the government’s liability is contingent upon the 
future availability of appropriations. The contract must expressly provide: 

1. that no legal liability on the part of the government arises until the 
appropriation is made available within the agency to fund the 
obligation and 
2. that notice is to be given by the agency to the contractor before the 
contractor may proceed. 
See B-171798(1), Aug. 18, 1971, at 11–12.7 Such express provisions are 
necessary to make explicit what is meant by the term “contingent upon the 
future availability of appropriations” in order to avoid Antideficiency Act 
problems,8 and to permit the agency to maintain effective internal controls 
over the obligating of appropriations. 

Of course, Congress may by statute authorize the actual expenditure of 
appropriations prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, in which event the 
above rule does not apply. 4 Comp. Gen. 918 (1925). This result may also 
follow if an appropriation is made to carry out the provisions of another 
law that clearly by its terms requires immediate action. E.g., 1 Comp. 
Dec. 329 (1895).

B. The Bona Fide 
Needs Rule 
1. Background 
a. Introduction Over a century ago, the Comptroller of the Treasury stated, “An 
appropriation should not be used for the purchase of an article not 
necessary for the use of a fiscal year in which ordered merely in order to 
use up such an appropriation.” 8 Comp. Dec. 346, 348 (1901). The bona fide 
needs rule is one of the fundamental principles of appropriations law: A 
fiscal year appropriation may be obligated only to meet a legitimate, or 
bona fide, need arising in, or in some cases arising prior to but continuing 
to exist in, the fiscal year for which the appropriation was made. Citations 
to this principle are numerous. See, e.g., 33 Comp. Gen. 57, 61 (1953); 
16 Comp. Gen. 37 (1936); B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002; B-282601, Sept. 27, 1999; 
B-235678, July 30, 1990. 
Does the quotation above, from the Comptroller of the Treasury, mean that 
an agency’s obligation of an annual appropriation on the last day of the 
fiscal year can never constitute a bona fide need of that fiscal year? While it 
certainly should raise a question, the answer is, “it depends.” An agency 
may have perfectly valid reasons for year-end spending. For example, some 
programs have predictable 4th quarter surges due to cyclical or seasonal 
requirements. When using time-limited funding, an agency must dissect its 
ongoing business into discrete units of time in order to determine whether 
a particular transaction may be obligated against, or charged to, a specific 
appropriation. The bona fide needs rule provides an analytical framework 
for analyzing an agency’s financial transactions to determine the period of 
time to which a transaction relates. 
Bona fide needs questions arise in many forms. Historically, as the 
discussion that follows will show, bona fide needs issues have arisen most 
frequently in the context of the acquisition of goods or services. An agency 
may enter into a contract in one fiscal year, but the contractor does not 
complete performance until the next fiscal year. Which fiscal year should 
be charged? Or, an agency may modify a contract in the year following the 
fiscal year in which it originally entered into the contract. Sometimes, as a 
result of an audit, the question may be whether an obligation already 
recorded was a proper charge against that fiscal year’s appropriation. Or, 

Page 5-11 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

an agency may have taken certain actions that it should have recorded as 
an obligation but did not; when the time for payment arrives, the question 
again is which fiscal year to charge. These are all facets of the same basic 
question—whether an obligation bears a sufficient relationship to the 
legitimate needs of the time period of availability of the appropriation 
charged or sought to be charged. 

Although the bona fide needs rule remains one of the bedrock principles of 
appropriations law, its application has changed over the years as Congress 
enacted statutes redefining in some instances what constitutes a bona fide 
need of a fiscal year appropriation. During a period of ever increasing 
budget constraints in the 1990s, Congress enacted laws providing civilian 
agencies more flexibility in their use of fiscal year appropriations, and 
expanded already existing authorities of defense agencies. Today, there is 
general authority permitting agencies to use fiscal year funds to acquire 
goods and services via multiyear acquisitions, and to enter into 1-year 
contracts for severable services that cross fiscal years. These laws have 
provided agencies with substantial flexibility to allocate the cost of goods 
and services across fiscal years, or to allocate the costs to the first fiscal 
year of the contract even though the goods or services may be delivered in 
future fiscal years. 

Notwithstanding the increased flexibilities agencies now have, the bona 
fide needs rule remains an important and often complex consideration for 
an agency as it executes its budget. In this section, we discuss the basic 
concept underlying the rule. We then discuss the traditional application of 
the rule in sections B.2 through B.7, followed by a discussion of the recent 
statutory developments in the acquisition of goods and services area in 
sections B.8 and B.9. It is important to know both the traditional 
application as well as recently enacted flexibilities in order to understand 
the contracting options now available to agencies as they decide how to 
use their appropriations. We discuss the application of the rule in the grants 
and cooperative agreements context in section B.10. 

b. The Concept The bona fide needs rule has a statutory basis. As noted in Chapter 1, the 
first general appropriation act in 1789 made appropriations “for the service 
of the present year,” and this concept continues to this time. This “one-year” 
concept is also reflected in 31 U.S.C. § 1502(a), sometimes called the “bona 
fide needs statute.” Originally enacted in 1870 (16 Stat. 251 (July12, 1870)), 
section 1502(a) provides that the balance of a fixed-term appropriation “is 
available only for payment of expenses properly incurred during the period 
of availability or to complete contracts properly made within that  
Page 5-12 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

period….” The key word here is “properly”—expenses “properly incurred” 
or contracts “properly made” within the period of availability. See, e.g., 
37 Comp. Gen. 155, 158 (1957). Additional statutory support for the rule is 
found in the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a), and the so-called 
Adequacy of Appropriations Act, 41 U.S.C. § 11. (Bona fide needs questions 
may involve other statutory restrictions as well. It also should be apparent 
that they are closely related to the subject matter covered in Chapter 7 on 
obligations.) For an early but still relevant and useful discussion, see 
6 Comp. Dec. 815 (1900). 

While the rule itself is universally applicable, determination of what 
constitutes a bona fide need of a particular fiscal year depends largely on 
the facts and circumstances of the particular case. 70 Comp. Gen. 469, 470 
(1991); 44 Comp. Gen. 399, 401 (1965); 37 Comp. Gen. at 159. 

In its most elementary form—where the entire transaction (contract or 
purchase, delivery or other performance, and payment) takes place during 
the same fiscal year—the rule means simply that the appropriation is 
available only for the needs of the current year. A common application of 
the rule in this context is that an appropriation is not available for the 
needs of a future year. For example, suppose that, as the end of a fiscal year 
approaches, an agency purchases a truckload of pencils when it is clear 
that, based on current usage, it already has in stock enough pencils to last 
several years into the future. It would seem apparent that the agency was 
merely trying to use up its appropriation before it expired, and the 
purchase would violate the bona fide needs rule. 

We do not mean to suggest that an agency may purchase only those 
supplies that it will actually use during the fiscal year. Agencies normally 
maintain inventories of common use items. The bona fide needs rule does 
not prevent maintaining a legitimate inventory at reasonable and historical 
levels, the “need” being to maintain the inventory level so as to avoid 
disruption of operations. The problem arises when the inventory crosses 
the line from reasonable to excessive. Future years’ needs and year-end 
spending are covered further in section B.2 of this chapter. Prior years’ 
needs are covered in section B.3 of this chapter. 

Bona fide needs questions also frequently involve transactions that cover 
more than one fiscal year. In the typical situation, a contract is made (or 
attempted to be made) in one fiscal year, with performance and payment to 
extend at least in part into the following fiscal year. The question is which 
fiscal year should be charged with the obligation. In this context, the rule is 

Page 5-13 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

that, in order to obligate a fiscal year appropriation for payments to be 
made in a succeeding fiscal year, the contract imposing the obligation must 
have been made within the fiscal year sought to be charged, and the 
contract must have been made to meet a bona fide need of the fiscal year to 
be charged. E.g., 70 Comp. Gen. 664, 667 (1991); 64 Comp. Gen. 359, 362 
(1985); 35 Comp. Gen. 692 (1956); 20 Comp. Gen. 436 (1941); 16 Comp. 
Gen. 37 (1936); 21 Comp. Dec. 822 (1915); 4 Comp. Dec. 553 (1898); 
B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002; B-257977, Nov. 15, 1995. 

The principle that payment is chargeable to the fiscal year in which the 
obligation is incurred as long as the need arose, or continued to exist in, 
that year applies even though the funds are not to be disbursed and the 
exact amount owed by the government cannot be determined until the 
subsequent fiscal year. E.g., 71 Comp. Gen. 502 (1992); 21 Comp. Gen. 574 
(1941). Thus, in a case where the United States entered into an agreement 
with a state to provide assistance for the procurement of civil defense 
items for the state and to pay a specified percentage of the cost, the 
Comptroller General found that the need arose in the year the agreement 
with the state was made. Therefore, appropriations current at that time 
were to be charged with the cost, notwithstanding the fact that the states or 
the United States may not have negotiated and executed the actual 
procurement contracts with suppliers, including the exact price, until a 
subsequent fiscal year. 31 Comp. Gen. 608 (1952). 

Several sections of this chapter, starting with B.4, explore the application 
of the bona fide needs rule in various aspects of government contracting in 
which transactions cover more than one fiscal year. We have structured 
these sections in large measure on a comprehensive and well-documented 
article by Capt. Dale Gallimore entitled Legal Aspects of Funding 
Department of the Army Procurements, 67 Mil. L. Rev. 85 (1975). 

The bona fide needs rule applies to multiple year as well as fiscal year 
appropriations. 55 Comp. Gen. 768, 773–74 (1976); B-235678, July 30, 1990. 
See also 64 Comp. Gen. 163, 166 (1984). In other words, an agency may use 
a multiple year appropriation for needs arising at any time during the 
period of availability. 

An argument can be made, not wholly without logic, that a multiple year 
appropriation can be obligated at any time during its availability, but only 
to meet a bona fide need of the year in which the funds were appropriated. 
Suppose, for example, that an agency receives a 2-year appropriation every 
year. For fiscal year 1989, it receives an appropriation available through 

Page 5-14 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

fiscal year 1990; for fiscal year 1990, it receives an appropriation available 
through fiscal year 1991, and so on. It is possible to apply the bona fide 
needs rule to require that the fiscal year 1990 appropriation be used only 
for needs arising in fiscal year 1990, although obligation may occur any 
time prior to the end of fiscal year 1991. The Comptroller General 
specifically rejected this approach in 68 Comp. Gen. 170 (1989), holding 
that the Defense Logistics Agency could use its fiscal year 1987 2-year 
Research and Development appropriation for a need arising in fiscal year 
1988. “There is no requirement that 2-year funds be used only for the needs 
of the first year of their availability.” Id. at 172. 

It follows that the bona fide needs rule does not apply to no-year funds. 
43 Comp. Gen. 657, 661 (1964). See also B-279886, Apr. 28, 1998. Without a 
prescribed period of availability, there is no fixed period during which the 
bona fide need must arise, and thus no fixed period in which the funds 
must be obligated and expended. 

2. Future Years’ Needs An appropriation may not be used for the needs of some time period 
subsequent to the expiration of its period of availability. With respect to 
annual appropriations, a more common statement of the rule is that an 
appropriation for a given fiscal year is not available for the needs of a 
future fiscal year.9 Determining the year to which a need relates is not 
always easy. Some illustrative cases are listed below: 
• The balance of an appropriation for salaries remaining unexpended at 
the end of one fiscal year could not be used to pay salaries for services 
rendered in the following fiscal year. 18 Op. Att’y Gen. 412 (1886). 

• The Department of Housing and Urban Development recorded certain 
obligations for public housing subsidies on an estimated basis. At the 
end of the fiscal year, obligations were found to be in excess of actual 
needs. It was held improper to send excess funds to the state agency’s 
operating reserve to offset the subsidy for the following year, since this 
amounted to using the funds for the needs of a subsequent year. The 

9 The topic of obligating for needs of a future year arises in a variety of contexts and is also 
involved in several later sections of this chapter on delivery of materials and services 
beyond the fiscal year (B.4 and B.5), multiyear contracts (B.8 and B.9), and grants and 
cooperative agreements (B.10). 

Page 5-15 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

proper course of action was to deobligate the excess. 64 Comp. 
Gen. 410 (1985). 

• Rent on property leased by the National Park Service from the National 
Park Foundation could be paid in advance, but the lease could not 
cross fiscal year lines. The proposal was for the lease to run from May 1 
through April 30 and for the full annual rent to be paid in advance on 
May 1. However, appropriations available as of May 1 could not be used 
for the period from October 1 through April 30 since rent for these 
months constituted a need of the following fiscal year. B-207215, Mar. 1, 
1983. 

Any discussion of obligating for future years’ needs inevitably leads to the 
question of year-end spending. Federal agencies as a fiscal year draws to a 
close are often likened to sharks on a feeding frenzy, furiously thrashing 
about to gobble up every appropriated dollar in sight before the ability to 
obligate those dollars is lost. The Comptroller of the Treasury stated the 
legal principle very simply in an early decision: 

“An appropriation should not be used for the purchase of an 
article not necessary for the use of a fiscal year in which 
ordered merely in order to use up such appropriation. This 
would be a plain violation of the law.” 

8 Comp. Dec. 346, 348 (1901). 

Thus, where an obligation is made toward the end of a fiscal year and it is 
clear from the facts and circumstances that the need relates to the 
following fiscal year, the bona fide needs rule has been violated. The 
obligation is not a proper charge against the earlier appropriation, but must 
be charged against the following year’s funds. This was the result, for 
example, in 1 Comp. Gen. 115 (1921), in which an order for gasoline had 
been placed 3 days before the end of fiscal year 1921, with the gasoline to 
be delivered in monthly installments in fiscal year 1922. The Comptroller 
General stated: 

“It is not difficult to understand how the need for an article 
of equipment, such as a typewriter, might arise during the 
fiscal year 1921 and its purchase be delayed until the latter 
part of June [the end of the fiscal year in 1921], but as to 
supplies that are consumed as used, such as gasoline, it can 
not be held that they were purchased to supply a need of the 

Page 5-16 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

fiscal year 1921 when the contract is made late in the month 
of June and expressly precludes the possibility of delivery 
before July 1, 1921.” 

Id. at 118 (explanatory information provided). See also 4 Comp. Dec. 553 
(1898) (cement ordered late in one fiscal year to be delivered several 
months into the following fiscal year).10 

Yet, this is only one side of the coin. The other side is illustrated in another 
passage from 8 Comp. Dec. at 348: 

“An appropriation is just as much available to supply the 
needs of the [last day] of a particular year as any other day 
or time in the year.” 

Thus, a year-end obligation perhaps raises the possibility that the agency is 
trying to “dump” its remaining funds and warrants a further look, but the 
timing of the obligation does not, in and of itself, establish anything 
improper. 38 Comp. Gen. 628, 630 (1959); 6 Comp. Dec. 815, 818 (1900). 

GAO has conducted several studies of year-end spending and has 
consistently reported that year-end spending is not inherently more or less 
wasteful than spending at any other time of the year. In one report, GAO 
suggested that year-end spending surges are really symptomatic of a larger 
problem—inadequate management of budget execution—and that the 
apportionment process could be more effectively used to provide the 
desired management. U.S. General Accounting Office, Federal Year-End 

Spending: Symptom of a Larger Problem, GAO/PAD-81-18 (Oct. 23, 1980), 
pp. 7–9.11 

10 “There is no authority in an appropriation made specifically for the service of a particular 
fiscal year to enter into contracts for supplies, etc., for the service of a subsequent fiscal 
year, and therefore as to that appropriation such a contract is not properly made within that 
year.” 4 Comp. Dec. at 556. 

11 Other GAO reports in this area are: U.S. General Accounting Office, Year-End Spending: 
Reforms Underway But Better Reporting and Oversight Needed, GAO/AIMD-98-185 
(Washington, D.C.: July 31, 1998); Federal Year-End Spending Patterns for Fiscal Years 
1982, 1983, and 1984, GAO/AFMD-85-75 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 4, 1985); Limitations on

Unnecessary Year-End Spending, GAO/PSAD-80-67 (Washington, D.C.: July 28, 1980). 

Page 5-17 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

GAO also noted in its October 1980 report that there are several reasons for 
year-end spending, some of which are perfectly valid. For example, some 
programs have predictable 4th quarter surges due to cyclical or seasonal 
fund requirements. If, for example, you are administering a fire suppression 
program, you should expect a 4th quarter surge because the 4th quarter of the 
federal fiscal year is the major fire season in many states. GAO/PAD-81-18 
at 3. In other situations, it may be desirable to delay obligations to have 
funds available for emergencies that may arise during the year. Id. at 4. 

In evaluating a year-end obligation, it is important to determine exactly 
what the need is from the agency’s perspective. In one case, for example, 
the Small Business Administration (SBA) awarded cooperative agreements 
to certain Small Business Development Centers on the last day of a fiscal 
year. The Centers then provided management and technical assistance to 
small businesses, all of which would obviously be done in the following 
year. GAO found no bona fide needs violation because the need, from the 
perspective of implementing SBA’s appropriation, was merely to provide 
assistance to the Centers, and there was no reason this could not be done 
on the last day of the year. B-229873, Nov. 29, 1988. See also B-289801, 
Dec. 30, 2002; section B.5 of this chapter. 

One device Congress has employed to control year-end spending surges is 
legislation limiting the amount of obligations that may be incurred in the 
last month or 2-month period or quarter of the fiscal year. For example, the 
Defense Department’s 1990 appropriation contained a provision limiting 
obligations during the last 2 months of the fiscal year to not more than 
20 percent of the total fiscal year appropriations.12 In comments on 
legislative proposals of this type, GAO has pointed out that they are 
difficult to administer, but has supported them as temporary measures 
pending more fundamental improvements in budget execution 
management and procurement planning.13 In addition, there is the risk that 
limitations of this type may have the effect of simply moving the spending 
surges back a few months, accomplishing nothing. 

3. Prior Years’ Needs There are situations in which it is not only proper but mandatory to use 
currently available appropriations to satisfy a need that arose in a prior 
12 Pub. L. No. 101-165, § 9007, 103 Stat. 1112, 1130 (Nov. 21, 1989). 
13 E.g., B-198666, May 20, 1980. 

Page 5-18 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

year.14 We refer to this as the “continuing need.” If a need arises during a 
particular fiscal year and the agency chooses not to satisfy it during that 
year, perhaps because of insufficient funds or higher priority needs, and the 
need continues to exist in the following year, the obligation to satisfy that 
need is properly chargeable to the later years funds. “An unfulfilled need of 
one period may well be carried forward to the next as a continuing need 
with the next periods appropriation being available for funding.” B-197274, 
Sept. 23, 1983. Thus, an important corollary to the bona fide needs rule is 
that a continuing need is chargeable to funds current for the year in which 
the obligation is made, regardless of the fact that the need may have 
originated in a prior year. 

An illustration is B-207433, Sept. 16, 1983. The Army contracted for a 
specific quantity of thermal viewers. The contract provided for a 
downward adjustment in the contract price in the case of an “underrun,” 
that is, if the contractor was able to perform at less than the contract price. 
After the appropriation charged with the contract had expired, the 
contractor incurred an underrun and proposed to use the excess funds to 
supply an additional quantity of viewers. It was undisputed that the need 
for additional viewers could be attributed to the year in which the contract 
was entered into, and that the need continued to exist. GAO agreed with 
the Army that the proper course of action was to deobligate the excess 
funds and, if the Army still wished to procure them, to charge the obligation 
for the additional quantity to current years appropriations. The fact that the 
need arose in a prior year was immaterial. The decision, at pages 4–5, 
offered the following explanation: 

“Certainly the Army could have used underrun funds to 
procure additional viewers at any time during the period 
those funds remained available for obligation. Also, we are 
of course aware that an unmet need does not somehow 
evaporate merely because the period of availability has 
expired. However, nothing in the bona fide needs rule 
suggests that expired appropriations may be used for an 
item for which a valid obligation was not incurred prior to 
expiration merely because there was a need for that item 
during that period …Once the obligational period has 

14 See also 31 U.S.C. §1553(b), which requires that obligations and adjustments properly 
made to closed accounts may be charged to any current appropriation, and section D.4 of 
this chapter.

expired, the procurement of an increased quantity must be 
charged to new money, and this is not affected by the fact 
that the need for that increased quantity may in effect be a 
‘continuing need’ that arose during the prior period.” 

Another illustration is B-226198, July 21, 1987. In late fiscal year 1986, the 

U.S.Geological Survey ordered certain microcomputer equipment, to be 
delivered in early fiscal year 1987, charging the purchase to fiscal year 1986 
funds. The equipment was delivered and accepted, but was stolen before 
reaching the ordering office. The decision held that a reorder, placed in 
fiscal year 1987, had to be charged to fiscal year 1987 funds. As with the 
thermal viewers in B-207433, the fact that the need for the equipment arose 
in 1986 was immaterial. See also B-286929, Apr. 25, 2001; B-257617, Apr. 18, 
1995. 
In another case, cost overruns caused the Army to delete certain items 
from a fiscal year 1979 procurement. The Army repurchased the canceled 
items in 1981, charging 1981 appropriations. GAO agreed that the 
repurchase was properly chargeable to 1981, rather than 1979 funds. 

B-206283-O.M., Feb. 17, 1983. 

The essential requirements of the “continuing need” corollary are that 

(1) the need, unmet in the year in which it arose, must continue to exist in 
the subsequent obligational period; (2) the incurring of an obligation must 
have been discretionary with the agency to begin with; and (3) no 
obligation was in fact incurred during the prior year. 
If the agency has no discretion as to the timing of an obligation (for 
example, in situations where the obligation arises by operation of law), or, 
even in discretionary situations, if the agency has actually incurred a valid 
obligation in the prior year (whether recorded or unrecorded), then the 
“continuing need” concept has no application and the obligation must be 
charged to the prior year. Absent statutory authority, current 
appropriations are not available to fund an obligation or liability (as 
opposed to an unmet and unobligated-for need) of a prior obligational 
period. If insufficient funds remain in the prior years’ appropriation, the 
agency must seek a supplemental or deficiency appropriation and must 
further consider the possibility that the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1341(a), has been violated. 

In an early case, for example, an agency had contracted for repairs to a 
building toward the end of fiscal year 1904. Since it was clear that the 

Page 5-20 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

repairs were needed at the time they were ordered, they were chargeable to 
fiscal year 1904 appropriations, and the exhaustion of the 1904 
appropriation did not permit use of 1905 funds. 11 Comp. Dec. 454 (1905). 
See also 21 Comp. Dec. 822 (1915). 

In B-226801, Mar. 2, 1988, GAO considered various entitlement programs 
administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Under these 
programs, the obligation arises when VA determines eligibility through its 
adjudication process and must be recorded at that time. If the obligations 
would exceed available funds, it is not proper to defer the recording and 
charge the following year’s appropriation. Since the obligations are 
required by law, overobligation would not violate the Antideficiency Act, 
but they must still be recognized and recorded when they arise. Congress 
subsequently began including an administrative provision in VA’s 
appropriation act permitting the use of appropriations for these programs 
to pay obligations required to be recorded in the last quarter of the 
preceding fiscal year.15 See also B-287619, July 5, 2001. 

For additional cases, see 55 Comp. Gen. 768, 773–74 (1976) (current year’s 
appropriations not available to fund prior year’s Antideficiency Act 
violation); 54 Comp. Gen. 393, 395 (1974) (deficiency appropriation

4. Delivery of Materials 
beyond the Fiscal Year 
When the government purchases goods or materials in one fiscal year and 
delivery occurs in whole or in part in a subsequent fiscal year, the question 
is whether the contract meets a bona fide need of the fiscal year in which it 
was made. This was the central legal issue in our discussion of year-end 
spending in section B.2 of this chapter, but the issue exists regardless of 
when in the fiscal year the contract is made. In this section we will explore 
those contracts where the agency intends to meet the needs of the fiscal 
year in which it entered into the contract. We will discuss multiyear 
contracts, where an agency intends to meet its needs for more than one 
fiscal year, in sections B.8 and B.9. 

An agency may not obligate funds when it is apparent from the outset that 
there will be no requirement until the following fiscal year. For example, it 
was found that annual appropriations obligated to fund an agreement 
between the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Federal Power 
Commission (FPC), whereby GSA agreed to renovate space in a federal 
building incident to relocation of FPC personnel, were not available since 
the relocation was not required to, and would not, take place by the end of 
the fiscal year, and because the space in question would not be made 
“tenantable” until the following fiscal year. B-95136-O.M., Aug. 11, 1972. 

If deliveries are scheduled only for a subsequent fiscal year, or if contract 
timing effectively precludes delivery until the following fiscal year, one 
could question whether the contract was made in the earlier fiscal year 
only to obligate funds from an expiring appropriation and that the goods or 
materials were not intended to meet a bona fide need of that year. See 
38 Comp. Gen. 628, 630 (1959); 35 Comp. Gen. 692 (1956); 33 Comp. 
Gen. 57, 60–61 (1953); 21 Comp. Gen. 1159 (1941); 1 Comp. Gen. 115 (1921); 
27 Comp. Dec. 640 (1921). 

However, the timing of delivery, while obviously a relevant factor, is not 
conclusive. There are perfectly legitimate situations in which an obligation 
may be incurred in one fiscal year with delivery to occur in a subsequent 
year. Thus, where materials cannot be obtained in the same fiscal year in 
which they are needed and contracted for, provisions for delivery in the 
subsequent fiscal year do not violate the bona fide needs rule as long as the 
time intervening between contracting and delivery is not excessive and the 
procurement is not for standard commercial items readily available from 
other sources. 38 Comp. Gen. at 630. 

Similarly, an agency may contract in one fiscal year for delivery in a 
subsequent year if the material contracted for will not be obtainable on the 

Page 5-22 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

open market at the time needed for use, provided the intervening period is 
necessary for production or fabrication of the material. 37 Comp. Gen. 155, 
159 (1957). 

If an obligation is proper when made, unforeseen delays that cause delivery 
or performance to extend into the following fiscal year will not invalidate 
the obligation. In one case, for example, although work under a 
construction contract was performed during the fiscal year following its 
execution, the Comptroller General approved payment to the contractor 
under the original obligation since the agency had awarded the contract as 
expeditiously as possible and had made provision for the work to begin 
within the current fiscal year, but experienced a delay in obtaining certain 
materials the government had agreed to provide. 1 Comp. Gen. 708 (1922). 
See also 23 Comp. Gen. 82 (1943); 20 Comp. Gen. 436 (1941). 

An order or contract for the replacement of stock is viewed as meeting a 
bona fide need of the year in which the contract is made as long as it is 
intended to replace stock used in that year, even though the replacement 
items will not be used until the following year. See 44 Comp. Gen. 695 
(1965). “Stock” in this context refers to “readily available common-use 
standard items.” Id. at 697. See also 73 Comp. Gen. 259 (1994); 32 Comp. 
Gen. 436 (1953). Generally, scheduling delivery for the following year 
would seem irrelevant. There are limits, however. GAO has questioned the 
propriety, from the bona fide needs perspective, of purchases of materials 
carried in stock for more than a year prior to issuance for use. B-134277, 
Dec. 18, 1957. 

5. Services Rendered 
beyond the Fiscal Year 
Services procured by contract are generally viewed as chargeable to the 
appropriation current at the time the services are rendered.16 38 Comp. 
Gen. 316 (1958). However, a need may arise in one fiscal year for services 
that, by their nature, cannot be separated for performance in separate fiscal 
years. The Comptroller General has held that the question of whether to 
charge the appropriation current on the date the contract is made, or to 
charge funds current at the time the services are rendered, depends upon 
whether the services are “severable” or “entire”: 

16 This section does not discuss services rendered by an employee. Services provided by 
employees are chargeable to the fiscal year in which the services are rendered, regardless of 
whether the services are severable or nonseverable. E.g., 38 Comp. Gen. 316 (1958) (salaries 
of government employees). 

Page 5-23 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

“The fact that the contract covers a part of two fiscal years 
does not necessarily mean that payments thereunder are for 
splitting between the two fiscal years involved upon the 
basis of services actually performed during each fiscal year. 
In fact, the general rule is that the fiscal year appropriation 
current at the time the contract is made is chargeable with 
payments under the contract, although performance 
thereunder may extend into the ensuing fiscal year.” 

23 Comp. Gen. 370, 371 (1943). A contract that is viewed as “entire” is 
chargeable to the fiscal year in which it was made, notwithstanding that 
performance may have extended into the following fiscal year. The 
determining factor for whether services are severable or entire is whether 
they represent a single undertaking. Thus, in 23 Comp. Gen. 370, a contract 
for the cultivation and protection of a tract of rubber-bearing plants, 
payable on completion of the services, was chargeable against fiscal year 
funds for the year in which the contract was made. Because the services 
necessarily covered the entire growing period, which extended into the 
following fiscal year, the Comptroller General characterized them as a 
single undertaking, which “although extending over a part of two fiscal 
years, nevertheless was determinable both as to the services needed and 
the price to be paid therefor at the time the contract was entered into.” Id. 
at 371. 

The rationale of 23 Comp. Gen. 370 was applied in 59 Comp. Gen. 386 
(1980) (requisition for printing accompanied by manuscript sufficient for 
Government Printing Office to proceed with job). See, e.g., 65 Comp. 
Gen. 741 (1986) (contract for study and final report on psychological 
problems among Vietnam veterans); B-257977, Nov. 15, 1995 (contract for 
2-year intern training program since interns are required to complete entire 
training program to be eligible for noncompetitive Presidential 
Management Intern appointment). See also 73 Comp. Gen. 77 (1994) 
(subsequent modifications to Fish and Wildlife Service research work 
orders should be charged to the fiscal year current when the work orders 
were issued since the purpose of the research is to provide a final research 
report and the services under the contract are nonseverable). The last 
opinion is noteworthy because it pointed out that a limitation of funds 
clause does not affect the application of the bona fide needs rule and the 
severable test. 73 Comp. Gen. at 80. 

However, where the services are continuing and recurring in nature, the 
contract is severable. Service contracts that are “severable” may not cross 

Page 5-24 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

fiscal year lines unless authorized by statute. 71 Comp. Gen. 428 (1992); 
58 Comp. Gen. 321, 324 (1979); B-192518, Aug. 9, 1979; B-133001, Mar. 9, 
1979; B-187881, Oct. 3, 1977. See also B-287619, July 5, 2001 (TRICARE 
contractors provide on-going services such as enrolling beneficiaries, 
adjudicating claims, etc., that are severable into components that 
independently provide value). Most federal agencies have authority to 
enter into a 1-year severable service contract, beginning at any time during 
the fiscal year and extending into the next fiscal year, and to obligate the 
total amount of the contract to the appropriation current at the time the 
agency entered into the contract.17 10 U.S.C. § 2410a (defense agencies); 
41 U.S.C. § 253l (civilian agencies); 41 U.S.C. § 253l-1 (Comptroller 
General); 41 U.S.C. § 253l-2 (Library of Congress); 41 U.S.C. § 253l-3 (Chief 
Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives); 41 U.S.C. § 253l-4 
(Congressional Budget Office). See also B-259274, May 22, 1996. Otherwise, 
the services must be charged to the fiscal year(s) in which they are 
rendered. 65 Comp. Gen. at 743; 33 Comp. Gen. 90 (1953) (trucking 
services); 10 Comp. Dec. 284 (1903) (contract for services of various 
categories of skilled laborers in such quantities and at such times as may be 
deemed necessary is severable). As stated in 33 Comp. Gen. at 92: 

“The need for current services, such as those covered by the 
contract here under consideration, arises only from day to 
day, or month to month, and the Government cannot, in the 
absence of specific legislative authorization, be obligated 
for such services by any contract running beyond the fiscal 
year.” 

See also 35 Comp. Gen. 319 (1955), amplified by B-125444, Feb. 16, 1956 
(gardening and window cleaning services). 

In addition to the recurring nature of the services, another factor identified 
in some of the decisions is whether the contracted-for services are viewed 
as personal or nonpersonal. Personal services are presumptively severable 
by their nature and are properly chargeable to the fiscal year in which the 
services are rendered. B-174226, Mar. 13, 1972 (performance on an 
evaluation team). Legal services have been viewed as either personal or 

17 For a discussion of contracts for more than 1 year, see later sections in this chapter on 
multiyear contracts (B.8) and specific statutes providing for multiyear and other contracting 
authorities (B.9).

Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

nonpersonal, depending on the nature of the work to be done. B-122596, 
Feb. 18, 1955; B-122228, Dec. 23, 1954. 

The distinction appears to have derived from the distinction inherent in 
5 U.S.C. § 3109, which authorizes agencies to procure services of experts or 
consultants by employment (personal) or contract (nonpersonal). 
B-174226, supra. In the context of applying the bona fide needs rule, 
however, the distinction is not particularly useful since it is still necessary 
to look at the nature of the services involved in the particular case. In other 
words, characterizing services as personal or nonpersonal does not provide 
you with an automatic answer. In fact, some of the more recent cases have 
merely considered the nature of the work without characterizing it as 
personal or nonpersonal, which would have added nothing to the analysis. 
E.g., 50 Comp. Gen. 589 (1971) (fees of attorneys contracted for under 
Criminal Justice Act chargeable to appropriations current at time of 
appointment); B-224702, Aug. 5, 1987 (contract for legal support services 
held severable since it consisted primarily of clerical tasks and required no 
final report or end product). 

A 1981 decision applied the above principles to agreements made by the 
Small Business Administration (SBA) with private organizations to provide 
technical and management assistance to businesses eligible for assistance 
under the Small Business Act. The typical agreement covered one calendar 
year and crossed fiscal year lines. Under the agreement, payment was to be 
made only for completed tasks and SBA was under no obligation to place 
any orders, or to place all orders with any given contractor. The question 
was whether the “contract” was chargeable to the fiscal year in which it 
was executed. The Comptroller General found that the services involved 
were clearly severable and that the agreement was not really a contract 
since it lacked mutuality of obligation. Accordingly, SBA created a contract 
obligation only when it placed a definite order, and could charge each fiscal 
year only with obligations incurred during that fiscal year. 60 Comp. 
Gen. 219 (1981). The principles were reiterated in 61 Comp. Gen. 184 
(1981). 

In another 1981 case, GAO considered the District of Columbia’s recording 
of obligations for social security disability medical examinations. A person 
seeking to establish eligibility for disability benefits is given an 
appointment for a medical examination and a purchase order is issued at 
that time. However, for a number of reasons beyond the District’s control, 
the examination may not take place until the following fiscal year (for 
example, a person makes an application at end of fiscal year or does not 

Page 5-26 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

show up for initial appointment). Nevertheless, the need for the 
examination arises when the applicant presents his or her claim for 
disability benefits. The decision concluded that the obligation occurs when 
the purchase order is issued and is chargeable to that fiscal year. 60 Comp. 
Gen. 452 (1981). 

Training tends to be nonseverable. Thus, where a training obligation is 
incurred in one fiscal year, the entire cost is chargeable to that year, 
regardless of the fact that performance may extend into the following year. 
B-233243, Aug. 3, 1989; B-213141-O.M., Mar. 29, 1984. In 70 Comp. Gen. 296 
(1991), training that began on the first day of fiscal year 1990 was held 
chargeable to 1989 appropriations where the training had been identified as 
a need for 1989, scheduling was beyond the agency’s control, and the time 
between procurement and performance was not excessive. If some 
particular training were severable (it is not entirely clear when this might 
be the case), the contract could not cross fiscal year lines and payment 
would have to be apportioned between the fiscal years in which the 
training is actually conducted. See 34 Comp. Gen. 432 (1955). 

After a confusing start, we have determined that the type of contract does 
not affect the severable versus nonseverable distinction. For example, 
“level-of-effort” contracts may be severable or nonseverable. A level-ofeffort 
contract is a type of cost-reimbursement contract in which the scope 
of work is defined in general terms, with the contractor being obligated to 
provide a specified level of effort (e.g., a specified number of person-hours) 
for a stated time period. Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R. 
§ 16.306(d)(2). The bona fide needs determination is based not on the 
contract type but on the nature of the work being performed and is, in the 
first instance, the responsibility of the contracting agency. B-235678, 
July 30, 1990. A 1985 case, 65 Comp. Gen. 154, had implied that all level-ofeffort 
contracts were severable by definition (id. at 156), and to that extent 
was modified by B-235678. See also B-277165, Jan. 10, 2000 (cost-plus-fixedfee 
contracts are presumptively severable unless the actual nature of the 
work warrants a different conclusion). 

The Comptroller General has noted that to some degree an agency can 
control whether services are severable or nonseverable by selecting the 
type of contract and crafting the statement of work. B-277165, supra (“one 
might reasonably conclude that the initial agency determination whether 
the contract is for funding purposes severable or nonseverable takes place 
roughly contemporaneously with agency selection of contract type”). 

Page 5-27 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

As a final thought, there is a fairly simple test that is often helpful in 
determining whether a given service is severable or nonseverable. Suppose 
that a service contract is to be performed half in one fiscal year and half in 
the next. Suppose further that the contract is terminated at the end of the 
first fiscal year and is not renewed. What do you have? In the case of a 
window-cleaning contract, you have half of your windows clean, a benefit 
that is not diminished by the fact that the other half is still dirty. What you 
paid for the first half has not been wasted. These services are clearly 
severable. Now consider a contract to conduct a study and prepare a final 
report, as in 65 Comp. Gen. 741 (1986). If this contract is terminated 
halfway through, you essentially have nothing. The partial results of an 
incomplete study, while perhaps beneficial in some ethereal sense, do not 
do you very much good when what you needed was the complete study and 
report. Or suppose the contract is to repair a broken frammis.18 If the 
repairs are not completed, certainly some work has been done but you still 
don’t have an operational frammis. The latter two examples are 
nonseverable. 

6. Replacement Contracts In an early decision, the Comptroller of the Treasury was asked whether 
fiscal year 1902 funds, originally obligated under a contract but 
unexpended because of contractor default, could be used in the following 
year to continue the original object of the contract. The Comptroller stated: 
“A contract was properly made within the fiscal year 1902, 
and it would seem that any part of the consideration of that 
contract which failed of use owing to the default of the 
contractor could still be used in carrying out the object of 
the original contract within the meaning of [31 U.S.C. 
§ 1502(a)]. Appropriations are made to be used and not to 
be defeated in their use, and it would be a narrow 
construction to hold that a default on a properly made 
contract would prevent the use of the appropriation for the 

18 According to “Harvey the Pooka,” the word “frammis” denotes “something that, in reality, 
one hasn’t a clue what it does or what it is for …but one wants to give others the impression 
that he does.” The word was coined by The Three Stooges, and, to some, it is a more literate 
form of the word “widget.” (e-mail to “Newsgroups: it.cultura.linguistica.inglese” dated 
January 28, 2003, found at http://groups.google.com/groups?q=frammis+word&hl=en&lr 
=&ie=UTF8&selm=TXrZ9.54710%24YG2.1568240%40twister1.libero.it&rnum=1).

object for which it was made and for carrying out which the 
contract was executed.” 

9 Comp. Dec. 10, 11 (1902). This marked the beginning of the replacement 
contract theory. 

In its traditional form, the rule is well settled that, where it becomes 
necessary to terminate a contract because of the contractor’s default, the 
funds obligated under the original contract are available, beyond their 
original period of obligational availability, for the purpose of engaging 
another contractor to complete the unfinished work. 60 Comp. Gen. 591 
(1981); 55 Comp. Gen. 1351 (1976); 44 Comp. Gen. 623 (1965); 40 Comp. 
Gen. 590 (1961); 32 Comp. Gen. 565 (1953); 2 Comp. Gen. 130 (1922); 
21 Comp. Dec. 107 (1914); B-160834, Apr. 7, 1967; B-105555, Sept. 26, 1951; 
A-22134, Apr. 12, 1928. 

Implicit in the rule is the premise that the original contract validly obligated 
then current funds. See 34 Comp. Gen. 239 (1954). In addition, the rule is 
based on the notion that the default termination does not eliminate the 
bona fide need of the fiscal year in which the original contract was 
executed. 44 Comp. Gen. 399, 401 (1965). In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1502, amounts from the appropriation available at the time the original 
contract was entered would remain available to fund costs properly 
chargeable to that appropriation. See B-242274, Aug. 27, 1991. Accordingly, 
the replacement contract seeks only to meet the agency’s preexisting and 
continuing need relying on the budget authority obligated by the original 
contract. 

In order for funds to remain available beyond expiration for a replacement 
contract, three conditions must be met: 

•A bona fide need for the work, supplies, or services must have existed 
when the original contract was executed, and it must continue to exist 
up to the award of the replacement contract. E.g., 55 Comp. Gen. 1351, 
1353 (1976); 34 Comp. Gen. 239, 240 (1954). If a terminated contract is 
found to have been improperly made to fulfill a need of a fiscal year 
other than the year against which the obligation was recorded, it would 
also be improper to charge that same appropriation for obligations 
incident to a replacement contract. 35 Comp. Gen. 692 (1956). In 
addition, if contracts made in a subsequent fiscal year do not satisfy a 
continuing need for the goods and/or services provided under the 
original contract from a prior fiscal year, then the subsequent fiscal

year contracts are not replacements and those contracts are not 
chargeable to the prior fiscal year appropriation. See B-242274, Aug. 27, 
1991. 

• The replacement contract must not exceed the scope of the original 
contract. If it does, it is a new obligation and must be charged to funds 
currently available for obligation at the time the replacement contract 
is entered into. E.g., 44 Comp. Gen. 399 (1965); B-181176-O.M., June 26, 
1974. 

• The replacement contract must be awarded within a reasonable time 
after termination of the original contract. E.g., 60 Comp. Gen. at 593. 
Excessive delay raises the presumption that the original contract was 
not intended to meet a then existing bona fide need. The same result 
may follow if there is unwarranted delay in terminating the original 
contract. 32 Comp. Gen. 565 (1953). 

At one time, the replacement contract rule was mostly (but not exclusively) 
limited to the default situation. E.g., 24 Comp. Gen. 555 (1945), overruled 
by 55 Comp. Gen. 1351. It has, however, been expanded. In 34 Comp. 
Gen. 239 (1954), a default termination was found to be erroneous and was 
converted to a termination for convenience by agreement of the parties to 
permit settlement of the contractor’s claim for damages. The decision held 
that, in view of the original termination, the funds originally obligated were 
available for the timely execution of a new contract for the performance of 
the unfinished work.19 A further question in that case was whether the 
replacement contract rule was affected by the newly enacted 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1501(a), which requires that contractual obligations be supported by a 
binding agreement in writing executed prior to expiration of the 
appropriations availability. The decision held that the original contract met 
these requirements. 34 Comp. Gen. at 241. 

19 A 1981 case, 60 Comp. Gen. 591, drew a distinction based on whether the awarding of the 
replacement contract preceded or followed the conversion to a termination for 
convenience, suggesting that the original obligation was extinguished when the replacement 
contract followed the conversion to a termination for convenience, the precise sequence 
involved in 34 Comp. Gen. 239. Although 60 Comp. Gen. 591 cites 34 Comp. Gen. 239 several 
times, it does not address this point. In view of later decisions where GAO determined that 
an agency could award a replacement contract following a termination for convenience 
because of an improper award, the distinction regarding when the replacement contract is 
awarded would not appear to be relevant. See 68 Comp. Gen. 158 (1988).

In a later case, a contract for flooring repairs was awarded in fiscal year 
1975, obligating fiscal year 1975 funds, conditioned upon a determination 
from the Small Business Administration (SBA) that the contractor qualified 
as a small business. SBA found the contractor not to be a small business. 
Concluding that the original award was sufficient to support an obligation 
under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a), the Comptroller General applied the 
replacement contract rule and held that the funds obligated for the contract 
in fiscal year 1975 could be used to resolicit in fiscal year 1976. 55 Comp. 
Gen. 1351 (1976). 

In 66 Comp. Gen. 625 (1987), however, the Comptroller General declined to 
extend the rule in a situation involving a voluntary modification that 
reduced the scope of a contract. The Navy had contracted for the 
construction of 12 ships. The contractor encountered financial difficulties 
and filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act under 
which the contractor could, with court approval, reject the contract. See 
11 U.S.C. §§ 365(a) and (d)(2). To avert this possibility, the Navy agreed to a 
contract modification that, among other things, reduced the number of 
ships to be provided from 12 to 10. The question was whether the funds 
originally obligated for the 2 ships deleted by the modification were 
available after expiration to fund a reprocurement. GAO concluded that 
they were not because there had been no default, nor was there an actual 
rejection under the Bankruptcy Code. “[T]he modification was an 
essentially voluntary act on the part of the Navy, and as such is beyond the 
scope of the replacement contract rule.” Id. at 627. Therefore, any 
replacement contract for the 2 deleted ships would have to be charged to 
appropriations current at the time it was made. 

Cases involving the termination of erroneously or improperly awarded 
contracts have been less than consistent, although a clear direction now 
appears evident. The earliest decisions applied the replacement contract 
rule. Thus, 17 Comp. Gen. 1098 (1938) held, without much discussion, that 
funds obligated by an award to a bidder subsequently determined not to 
have been the low bidder could be used for an award to the otherwise low 
bidder in the following fiscal year. In a 1953 case, a contract had to be 
partially canceled because the contractor’s bid had not conformed to the 
advertised specifications. GAO noted that “the obligating instrument was 
legally defective in such a way as to render the contract voidable at the 
election of the Government,” but nevertheless applied the replacement 
contract rule. B-116131, Oct. 19, 1953. See also B-89019, May 31, 1950.

Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

GAO’s position seemed to change with the enactment of 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a) 
in 1954, on the theory that a contract award found to be invalid did not 
constitute a binding agreement so as to support a recordable obligation. 
38 Comp. Gen. 190 (1958); B-118428, Sept. 21, 1954, overruling B-116131 
and B-89019. However, B-116131 was at least arguably “reinstated” by 
B-152033, May 27, 1964, which followed both the “voidable at the election 
of the government” rationale and the result of B-116131, without citing 
either it or the case that presumably overruled it. See also B-173244(2), 
Aug. 10, 1972; B-158261, Mar. 9, 1966. This latter group of cases was in turn 
cited with approval in 55 Comp. Gen. 1351, 1353 (1976). 

The apparent direction indicated by 55 Comp. Gen. 1351 (1976) and the 
cases it cited was called into question by statements in 60 Comp. Gen. 591 
(1981) to the effect that the replacement contract rule does not apply to 
terminations for the convenience of the government, whether initiated by 
the contracting agency or on recommendation of some other body such as 
GAO. Of course, the typical situation in which a replacement contract is 
needed following a termination for convenience is where the original 
contract is found to have been improperly awarded. An important 
clarification occurred in 68 Comp. Gen. 158 (1988), which modified 
60 Comp. Gen. 591 and held the replacement contract rule applicable 
where a contract must be terminated for convenience, without a prior 
default termination, pursuant to a determination by competent 
administrative or judicial authority (court, board of contract appeals, GAO) 
that the contract award was improper. As noted previously, the bona fide 
need of the original contract must continue, and the replacement contract 
must be made without undue delay after the original contract is terminated 
and must be awarded on the same basis as, and be substantially similar in 
scope and size to, the original contract. 

Logically and inevitably, the next question would be why the rule should 
not be the same regardless of whether the defect leading to termination is 
determined by an external reviewing body or by the contracting agency 
itself. It should make no difference, GAO concluded in 70 Comp. Gen. 230 
(1991). The essence of the problem—a legal impropriety in the 
procurement process requiring corrective action—is no different. Thus, the 
replacement contract rule, with its attendant conditions, applies where the 
contracting agency determines that a contract award was improper and 
terminates the contract for the convenience of the government, provided 
there is clear evidence that the award was erroneous and the agency 
documents its determination with appropriate findings of fact and law. Id.

It is worth noting that with regard to agencies that terminate their contracts 
based on improper awards, the 1991 GAO decision added a fourth 
condition to the three articulated earlier in this section that determine 
whether funds remain available in a subsequent fiscal year for replacement 
contracts. In addition to the existence of a continuing bona fide need, a 
replacement contract of the same size and scope as the original, and the 
execution of the replacement without undue delay, the decision added that 
the original contract had to be made in “good faith” before an agency could 
use prior year appropriations to fund a replacement contract after 
terminating the original for convenience due to an improper award; 
70 Comp. Gen. 287, 289 (1991). 

The issue of whether an agency is required to avail itself of the replacement 
contract rule arose in a protest submitted to GAO alleging the improper 
award of a contract. GAO found that the agency properly awarded the 
contract and that, even when available, the replacement contract rule is not 
mandatory on an agency. B-270723, Apr. 15, 1996. The 1996 decision stated 
that since the replacement contract rule “provides a mechanism to allow 
agencies to administer their contract effectively when there is a reason to 
terminate a contract, its use is solely at the government’s discretion.” Id. At 
least one federal district court has adopted the position that the availability 
of funds for a replacement contract does not require the agency to procure 
a replacement contract. LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, L.L.P. v. 
Abraham, 215 F. Supp. 2d 73, 81 (D.D.C. 2002). See, e.g., B-276334.2, 
Oct. 27, 1997. 

7. Contract Modifications 
and Amendments 
Affecting Price 
Contract performance may extend over several years. During this time, the 
contract may be modified or amended for a variety of reasons at the 
instigation of either party. An amendment within the general scope of the 
contract that does not increase the contract price remains an obligation of 
the year in which the contract was executed. B-68707, Aug. 19, 1947. If the 
modification results in an increase in contract price, the question from the 
bona fide needs perspective is which fiscal year to charge with the 
modification. 

If the modification exceeds the general scope of the original contract, for 
example, by increasing the quantity of items to be delivered, the 
modification amounts to a new obligation and is chargeable to funds 
current at the time the modification is made. 37 Comp. Gen. 861 (1958); 
B-207433, Sept. 16, 1983. When the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
benefited from a contractual provision that allowed its contractor to pass 

Page 5-33 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

along cost savings to the agency in a fiscal year subsequent to when it 
entered the contract, IRS could not use those cost savings to increase the 
quantity of items that the contract required the contractor to deliver. 
B-257617, Apr. 18, 1995. Although there was a bona fide need for an 
increased quantity of items that had continued from the fiscal year that IRS 
entered the contract, it was not within the scope of the contract to increase 
the quantity of items delivered. If the contractual provision had stated that 
a cost savings would be passed on to IRS in the form of an increased 
quantity of items delivered, then increasing the quantity would not have 
constituted a contract modification creating a new obligation. Id. 

In the case of a contract for severable services, a modification providing for 
increased services must be charged to the fiscal year or years in which the 
services are rendered, applying the principles discussed in this chapter in 
section B.5.20 61 Comp. Gen. 184 (1981), aff’d upon reconsideration, 
B-202222, Aug. 2, 1983; B-224702, Aug. 5, 1987. See also B-235086, Apr. 24, 
1991. In 61 Comp. Gen. 184, for example, a contract to provide facilities and 
staff to operate a project camp was modified in the last month of fiscal year 
1980. The modification called for work to be performed in fiscal year 1981. 
Regardless of whether the contract was viewed as a service contract or a 
contract to provide facilities, the modification did not meet a bona fide 
need of fiscal year 1980. The modification amounted to a separate contract 
and could be charged only to fiscal year 1981 funds, notwithstanding that it 
purported to modify a contract properly chargeable to fiscal year 1980 
funds. 

For modifications within the general scope of the original contract, the 
situation is a bit more complicated. Most government contracts contain 
provisions which, under certain conditions, render the government liable to 
make equitable adjustments in the contract price. Such liability may arise 
due to changes in specifications, government-caused delay, changed 
conditions, increased overhead rates, etc. These conditions are set out in 
standard contract clauses such as the “Changes” clause, “Government 
Property” clause, or “Negotiated Overhead Rates” clause. 

20 Presumably, if an agency, acting under authority to charge a 12-month severable services 
contract that crosses fiscal years to the appropriation current in the first fiscal year, had 
charged the original obligation to the first fiscal year, the agency should charge the costs of 
the modification to that same appropriation. We discuss this authority for civilian agencies 
and 10 U.S.C. § 2410a for military departments) in section B.9.a of this chapter. We found no 
case law addressing this point, however. See generally B-259274, May 22, 1996 (discussing 
10 U.S.C. § 2410a). 

Page 5-34 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

Because there is no way to know whether the government will actually 
incur liability under these provisions, and if so, the amount of such liability, 
until the occurrence of the specified conditions (cf. 50 Comp. Gen. 589, 591 
(1971)), the appropriations charged with the cost of the contract are not 
firmly obligated to cover future price increases, which arise due to the 
operation of these clauses. Nevertheless, as noted, government contracts 
frequently contemplate that performance will extend into subsequent fiscal 
years. When an upward price adjustment is necessitated in a subsequent 
year, the general approach is to ask whether the adjustment is attributable 
to an “antecedent liability”—that is, whether the government’s liability 
arises and is enforceable under a provision in the original contract. If the 
answer to this question is yes, then a within-scope price adjustment, which 
is requested and approved in a subsequent fiscal year, for example, under 
the “Changes” clause, will—with one important qualification to be noted 
later—be charged against the appropriation current at the time the contract 
was originally executed. Cases supporting this proposition in various 
contexts are 59 Comp. Gen. 518 (1980); 23 Comp. Gen. 943 (1944); 
21 Comp. Gen. 574 (1941); 18 Comp. Gen. 363 (1938); A-15225, Sept. 24, 
1926; B-146285-O.M., Sept. 28, 1976.21 See also B-197344, Aug. 21, 1980, 
where supplemental work was done without issuance of a formal contract 
modification. This principle is occasionally referred to as the doctrine of 
“relation back.” E.g., 37 Comp. Gen. 861, 863 (1958). 

The reasoning is that a change order does not give rise to a new liability, 
but instead only renders fixed and certain the amount of the government’s 
preexisting liability to adjust the contract price. Since that liability arises at 
the time the original contract is executed, the subsequent price adjustment 
is viewed as reflecting a bona fide need of the same year in which funds 
were obligated for payment of the original contract price. The concept was 
stated as follows in 23 Comp. Gen. 943, 945 (1944) (explanatory 
information provided): 

“It is true that at the time the contract was executed it was 
not known that there would, in fact, be any changes ordered 
…for which the contractor would be entitled to be paid an 
amount in addition to amounts otherwise payable under the 
contract. Also, it is true that [the Changes clause] 
contemplates the execution of amendments to the contract 

21 Similarly, costs incurred under a termination for convenience are chargeable to the 
appropriation originally obligated for the contract. B-203074, Aug. 6, 1981. 

Page 5-35 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

from time to time covering such changes. However, the fact 
remains that the obligations and liabilities of the parties 
respecting such changes are fixed by the terms of the 
original contract, and the various amendments merely 
render definite and liquidated the extent of the 
Government’s liability in connection with such changes.” 

In order to avoid overobligating the original appropriation, the contracting 
officer must estimate the expected net additional obligations to insure that 
available appropriations are not committed to other purposes. E.g., 
61 Comp. Gen. 609, 612 (1982); B-192036, Sept. 11, 1978. It is also true, 
however, that estimated liabilities of this type require constant review to 
ensure that appropriations do not remain encumbered in excess of the 
amounts that will actually be needed to meet the total liability under the 
contract. 

For contracts spanning lengthy periods of time, funding of within scope 
modifications involves the use of expired appropriations. As discussed 
later in this chapter, the balances in expired accounts prior to closing are 
available without further congressional action. 

Not all price adjustments arising from contract modifications or 
amendments represent a bona fide need of the year in which the agreement 
was made. If, as noted above, the change or amendment exceeds the 
general scope of the contract, or is not made pursuant to a provision in the 
original contract, then it is not based on any antecedent liability, in which 
event it may obligate only appropriations current at the time it is issued. 
56 Comp. Gen. 414 (1977). See also 25 Comp. Gen. 332 (1945) (purported 
change order issued after completion of contract, covering work the 
contractor was not legally bound to do under the original contract, 
amounted to a new contract). 

As noted above, there is an important exception or qualification to the 
antecedent liability rule. In cost reimbursement contracts, discretionary 
cost increases (i.e., increases that are not enforceable by the contractor), 
which exceed funding ceilings established by the contract, may be charged 
to funds currently available when the discretionary increase is granted by 
the contracting officer. 61 Comp. Gen. 609 (1982). It would be 
unreasonable, the decision pointed out, to require the contracting officer to 
reserve funds in anticipation of increases beyond the contract’s ceiling. Id. 
at 612. Changes that do not exceed the stipulated ceiling continue to be 
chargeable to funds available when the contract was originally made (id. 

Page 5-36 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

at 611), as do amounts for final overhead in excess of the ceiling where the 
contractor has an enforceable right to those amounts (id. at 612). Since 
prior decisions such as 59 Comp. Gen. 518 had not drawn the below-
ceiling/above-ceiling distinction, 61 Comp. Gen. 609 modified them to that 
extent. A more recent case applying 61 Comp. Gen. 609 is 65 Comp. 
Gen. 741 (1986). 

Once an appropriation account has closed (generally five fiscal years after 
the expiration of obligational availability), questions of antecedent liability 
or relation back are no longer relevant for purposes of determining the 
availability of amounts in the closed accounts since, at that time, 
appropriation balances cease to be available for expenditure. However, 
questions of antecedent liability or relation back are used to determine the 
extent to which current funds are available since, once an appropriation 
closes, only current funds may be used, up to specified limits, for such 
obligations. 31 U.S.C. §§ 1552 and 1553. 

8. Multiyear Contracts 
a. Introduction Any discussion of multiyear contracting must inevitably combine the bona 
fide needs rule with material from Chapter 6 on the Antideficiency Act and 
from Chapter 7 on obligations. 
The term “multiyear contract” has been used in a variety of situations to 
describe a variety of contracts touching more than one fiscal year. To 
prevent confusion, we think it is important to start by establishing a 
working definition. A multiyear contract, as we use the term in this 
discussion, is a contract covering the requirements, or needs, of more than 
one fiscal year.22 A contract for the needs of the current year, even though 
performance may extend over several years, is not a multiyear contract. We 
discuss contracts such as these, where performance may extend beyond 
the end of the fiscal year, in sections B.4 and B.5 of this chapter. Thus, a 
contract to construct a ship that will take 3 years to complete is not a 
multiyear contract; a contract to construct one ship a year for the next 
3 years is. 

22 This is essentially the same as the definition in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, “a 
contract for the purchase of supplies or services for more than 1, but not more than 5, 
program years.” 48 C.F.R. § 17.103.

Multiyear contracting, like most things in life, has advantages and 
disadvantages. Some of the potential benefits are:23 

• Multiyear contracting can reduce costs by permitting the contractor to 
amortize nonrecurring “start up” costs over the life of the contract. 
Without multiyear authority, the contractor may insist on recovering 
these costs under the 1-year contract (since there is no guarantee of 
getting future contracts), thus resulting in increased unit prices. 

• Multiyear contracting may enhance quality by reducing the uncertainty 
of continued government business and enabling the contractor to 
maintain a stable workforce. 

• Multiyear contracting may increase competition by enabling small 
businesses to compete in situations where nonrecurring start-up costs 
would otherwise limit competition to larger concerns. 

However, the situation is not one-sided. Multiyear contracting authority 
also has potential disadvantages:24 

• Competition may decrease because there will be fewer opportunities to 
bid. 

• A contractor who is able to amortize start-up costs in a multiyear 
contract has, in effect, a government-funded competitive price 
advantage over new contractors in subsequent solicitations. This could 
evolve into a sole-source posture. 

• Being locked into a contract for several years is not always desirable, 
particularly where the alternative is to incur cancellation charges that 
could offset initial savings. 

23 S. Rep. No. 98-417, at 4–8 (1984). This is a report by the Senate Committee on 
Governmental Affairs on a bill (S. 2300) designed to extend limited multiyear contracting 
authority to civilian agencies. That legislation was not enacted. Ten years later, in 1994, 
Congress enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, permitting civilian agencies to 
use fiscal year appropriations to enter into contracts for as many as 5 years. Pub. L. No. 103355, 
§ 1072, 108 Stat. 3243, 3270 (Oct. 13, 1994), codified at 41 U.S.C. § 254c. We discuss the 
Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act in section B.9.b of this chapter. 

24 H.R. Rep. No. 97-71, pt. 3, at 21 (1981) (report of the House Committee on Government 
Operations on the 1982 Defense Department authorization bill).

b. Multiple Year and No-Year 
Appropriations 
An agency may engage in multiyear contracting only if it has (1) no-year 
funds or multiple year funds covering the entire term of the contract or 

(2) specific statutory authority. Cray Research, Inc. v. United States, 
44 Fed. Cl. 327, 332 (1999); 67 Comp. Gen. 190, 192 (1988); B-171277, Apr. 2, 
1971 (multiyear contract permissible under no-year trust fund). An agency 
may enter into a multiyear contract with fiscal year appropriations (or for a 
term exceeding the period of availability of a multiple year appropriation) 
only if it has specific statutory authority to do so. See 71 Comp. Gen. 428, 
430 (1992); B-259274, May 22, 1996. Most agencies now have some form of 
multiyear contracting authority, as we will describe in the next section. 
If an agency does not have specific multiyear contracting authority but 
enters into a multiyear contract solely under authority of a multiple year or 
no-year appropriation, the full contract amount must be obligated at the 
time of contract award.25 B-195260, July 11, 1979. This is also true for 
revolving funds, which authorize expenditures without fiscal year 
limitation. Revolving funds must have sufficient budget authority against 
which to record the entire amount of long-term contracts at the time of the 
obligation. 72 Comp. Gen. 59, 61 (1992). A revolving fund may not count 
anticipated receipts from future customer orders as budget authority. 
B-288142, Sept. 6, 2001. See also U.S. General Accounting Office, The Air 
Force Has Incurred Numerous Overobligations In Its Industrial Fund, 

AFMD-81-53 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 14, 1981). 

However, there have been some circumstances under which GAO approved 
the incremental funding of a multiyear contract using no-year funds. For 
example, 43 Comp. Gen. 657 (1964) involved a scheme in which funds 
would be made available, and obligated, on a year-by-year basis, together 
with a “commitment” to cover maximum cancellation costs. The 
cancellation costs represented amortized start-up costs, which would be 
adjusted downward each year. Thus, funds would be available to cover the 
government’s maximum potential liability in each year. See also 62 Comp. 
Gen. 143 (1983) (similar approach for long-term vessel charters under the 
Navy Industrial Fund); 51 Comp. Gen. 598, 604 (1972) (same); 48 Comp. 
Gen. 497, 502 (1969) (either obligational approach acceptable under 

25 When an agency uses multiyear or other contracting authorities, such as the Federal 
Acquisition Streamlining Act, that authority may permit the agency to obligate its 
appropriations differently. We discuss the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and other 
examples of multiyear contracting authorities in section B.9 of this chapter.

revolving fund).26 (As we will see later, this type of arrangement under a 
fiscal year appropriation presents problems.) 

If an agency has neither multiple year or no-year funds, nor uses multiyear 
contracting authority, a multiyear contract violates statutory funding 
restrictions, including the Antideficiency Act (prohibiting obligations in 
advance of an appropriation for that fiscal year, 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a))27 and 
the bona fide needs statute (prohibiting the obligation of an appropriation 
in advance of need, 31 U.S.C. § 1502(a)). See Cray Research, Inc. v. United 
States, 44 Fed. Cl. 327,332 (1999). E.g., 67 Comp. Gen. 190 (1988); 66 Comp. 
Gen. 556 (1987); 64 Comp. Gen. 359 (1985); 48 Comp. Gen. 497 (1969); 
42 Comp. Gen. 272 (1962); 27 Op. Att’y Gen. 584 (1909). Multiyear 
commitments were found illegal in various contexts in each of these cases, 
although each case does not necessarily discuss each funding statute. 

In 42 Comp. Gen. 272, for example, the Air Force, using fiscal year 
appropriations, awarded a 3-year contract for aircraft maintenance, troop 
billeting, and base management services on Wake Island. Because an 
agency typically incurs an obligation at the time it enters into a contract, 
and must charge that obligation to an appropriation current at that time,28 
the Air Force contract raised two issues: (1) whether the services to be 
provided in the second and third years of the contract constituted a bona 
fide need of the Air Force’s fiscal year appropriation, and (2) if not, 
whether the Air Force had incurred an obligation in the first fiscal year for 
the needs of the second and third years in advance of appropriations for 
those 2 years. The Air Force contended that no funds were obligated at 
time of contract award; instead, the Air Force argued that it had a 
“requirements” contract, and that it incurred no obligation unless and until 
it issued requisitions, thereby exempting the contract from the statutory 
funding restrictions. However, the Comptroller General refused to adopt 
this characterization of the contract. Although the contractor had expressly 
agreed to perform only services for which he had received the contracting 
officer’s order, GAO found that there was no need for an administrative 
determination that requirements existed since the contract services were 
“automatic incidents of the use of the air field.” Id. at 277. Only a decision 

26 While 43 Comp. Gen. 657 had used the somewhat cryptic term “commitment,” the three 
subsequent decisions require the actual obligation of the cancellation costs.

to close the base would eliminate the requirements. Consequently, the 
contract was found to be an unauthorized multiyear contract—the Air 
Force, using fiscal year appropriations, had entered into a contract for its 
needs of subsequent fiscal years in advance of appropriations for those 
years. 

c. Fiscal Year Appropriations If an agency is contracting with fiscal year appropriations and does not 
have multiyear contracting authority, the only authorized course of action, 
apart from a series of separate fiscal year contracts, is a fiscal year contract 
with renewal options, with each renewal option (1) contingent on the 
availability of future appropriations and (2) to be exercised only by 
affirmative action on the part of the government (as opposed to automatic 
renewal unless the government refuses). Leiter v. United States, 271 U.S. 
204 (1926); 66 Comp. Gen. 556 (1987); 36 Comp. Gen. 683 (1957); 33 Comp. 
Gen. 90 (1953); 29 Comp. Gen. 91 (1949); 28 Comp. Gen. 553 (1949); 
B-88974, Nov. 10, 1949. The inclusion of a renewal option is key; with a 
renewal option, the government incurs a financial obligation only for the 
fiscal year, and incurs no financial obligation for subsequent years unless 
and until it exercises its right to renew. The government records the 
amount of its obligation for the first fiscal year against the appropriation 
current at the time it awards the contract. The government also records 
amounts of obligations for future fiscal years against appropriations 
current at the time it exercises its renewal options. The mere inclusion of a 
contract provision conditioning the government’s obligation on future 
appropriations without also subjecting the multiyear contract to the 
government’s renewal option each year would be insufficient. Cray 
Research, Inc. v. United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 327, 332 (1999). Thus, in 
42 Comp. Gen. 272 (1962), the Comptroller General, while advising the Air 
Force that under the circumstances it could complete that particular 
contract, also advised that the proper course of action would be either to 
use an annual contract with renewal options or to obtain specific multiyear 
authority from Congress. Id. at 278. 
In a 1-year contract with renewal options, the contractor can never be sure 
whether the renewal options will be exercised, thereby preventing the 
contractor from amortizing initial investment costs. To protect against this 
possibility, contractors occasionally seek a contract termination penalty 
equal to the unamortized balance of initial investment costs if the 
government fails to renew the contract for any fiscal year. However, the 
Comptroller General has held that these provisions contravene the bona 
fide needs rule: 

Page 5-41 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

“The theory behind such obligations (covering amortized 
facility costs unrecovered at time of termination) has been 
that a need existed during the fiscal year the contracts were 
made for the productive plant capacity represented by the 
new facilities which were to be built by the contractor to 
enable him to furnish the supplies called for by the 
contracts. After thorough consideration of the matter, we 
believe that such obligations cannot be justified on the 
theory of a present need for productive capacity. 

“ …The real effect of the termination liability is to obligate 
the Commission to purchase a certain quantity of 
magnesium during each of five successive years or to pay 
damages for its failure to do so. In other words, the 
termination charges represent a part of the price of future, 
as distinguished from current, deliveries and needs under 
the contract, and for that reason such charges are not based 
on a current fiscal year need.” 

36 Comp. Gen. 683, 685 (1957). See also 37 Comp. Gen. 155 (1957). 

Attempts to impose penalty charges for early termination (sometimes 
called “separate charges”) have occurred in a number of cases involving 
automated data processing (ADP) procurements. In one case, a competitor 
for a contract to acquire use of an ADP system for a 65-month period 
proposed to include a provision under which the government would be 
assessed a penalty if it failed to exercise its annual renewal options. The 
Comptroller General noted that the penalty was clearly intended to 
recapitalize the contractor for its investment based on the full life of the 
system in the event the government did not continue using the equipment. 
Accordingly, the Comptroller General concluded that the penalty did not 
reasonably relate to the value of the equipment’s use during the fiscal year 
in which it would be levied. The penalty charges would, therefore, not be 
based on a bona fide need of the current fiscal year and their payment 
would violate statutory funding restrictions. 56 Comp. Gen. 142 (1976), 
aff’d in part, 56 Comp. Gen. 505 (1977). See also 56 Comp. Gen. 167 (1976); 
B-190659, Oct. 23, 1978. 

One scheme, however, has been found to be legally sufficient to permit the 
government to realize the cost savings that may accrue through multiyear 
contracting. The plan approved by the Comptroller General in 48 Comp. 
Gen. 497, 501–02 (1969) provided for a 1-year rental contract with an  


Page 5-42 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

d. Contracts with No Financial 
Obligation 
option to renew each subsequent year. If the government completed the full 
rental period by continuing the contract on a year-by-year basis, it would be 
entitled to have monthly rental credits applied during the final months of 
the rental period. The Comptroller General noted that: 

“Under this arrangement the Government would not be 
obligated to continue the rental beyond the fiscal year in 
which made, or beyond any succeeding fiscal year, unless or 
until a purchase order is issued expressly continuing such 
rental during the following fiscal year. In effect, the 
company is proposing a 1 year rental contract with option to 
renew. Also, under this proposal rental for any contract year 
would not exceed the lowest rental otherwise obtainable 
from [the contractor] for one fiscal year. We have no legal 
objection to this type of rental plan for ADP equipment.” 

Multiyear arrangements may be permissible, even without specific 
statutory authority, if they are structured in such a way that the agency, at 
time of contract award, incurs no financial obligation. Without a financial 
obligation, the agency does not violate the Antideficiency Act or the bona 
fide needs rule. In 63 Comp. Gen. 129 (1983), the Comptroller General 
considered the General Services Administration proposal to use 3-year 
“Multiple Award Schedule” (MAS) contracts for Federal Supply Schedule 
items. There was no commitment to order any specific quantity of items. 
Rather, the commitment was for an agency with a requirement for a 
scheduled item to order it from the contractor if the contractor has offered 
the lowest price. If an agency found the item elsewhere for less than the 
contract price, it was free to procure the item from that other source 
without violating the contract. Since entering into the MAS contracts did 
not require the obligation of funds, there was no violation of statutory 
funding restrictions. Obligations would occur only when agencies placed 
specific orders, presumably using funds currently available to them at the 
time. Another example is a 1935 decision, A-60589, July 12, 1935, which 
concerned a requirements contract for supplies in which no definite 
quantity was required to be purchased and under which no financial 
obligation would be imposed on the government until an order was placed. 
In order to retain the availability of the vendor and a fixed price, the 
government agreed not to purchase the items elsewhere. See also B-259274, 
May 22, 1996. 

Also, contracts that do not require the expenditure of appropriated funds 
are not subject to the same fiscal year strictures. E.g., 10 Comp. Gen. 407 

Page 5-43 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

(1931) (no legal objection to multiyear leases or contracts for the operation 
of concessions on federal property). 

9. Specific Statutes 
Providing for Multiyear 
and Other Contracting 
Authorities 
a. Severable Services 
Contracts 
As we noted at the beginning of our discussion of the bona fide needs rule, 
a fixed-term appropriation is available only “to complete contracts properly 
made within that period of availability.” See 31 U.S.C. § 1502(a). For 
multiyear contracts, “properly made” means that the bona fide needs rule is 
satisfied if an agency has statutory authority to obligate its fiscal year funds 
for a contract that crosses fiscal years or is for multiple years. While these 
statutes are sometimes referred to as exceptions to the bona fide needs 
statute, it is clear that by using the phrase “contracts properly made,” the 
bona fide needs statute anticipates that Congress may authorize agencies 
to obligate funds across fiscal years, either generally or for a particular 
agency or program. In so doing, Congress defines the bona fide need in the 
particular statute. 

There are several general authorities to contract across a fiscal year or to 
enter into multiyear contracts. For example, 41 U.S.C. § 253l authorizes the 
heads of executive agencies to enter into procurement contracts for 
severable services for periods beginning in one fiscal year and ending in the 
next fiscal year as long as the contracts do not exceed 1 year. It permits 
agencies to obligate the total amount of the contract to appropriations of 
the first fiscal year. Without specific statutory authority such as this, such 
action would violate the bona fide needs rule (see section B.5 of this 
chapter). Section 253l, in effect, redefines for an agency that elects to 
contract under authority of section 253l its bona fide need for the severable 
services for which it is contracting. Related statutes extend this authority 
to various legislative branch entities.29 Similarly, 10 U.S.C. § 2410a 
authorizes the military departments to use current fiscal year 
appropriations to finance severable service contracts into the next fiscal 
year for a total period not to exceed 1 year. GAO states in B-259274, May 22, 
1996, that “[t]he purpose of 10 U.S.C. § 2410a is to overcome the bona fide 
needs rule,” which is another way of saying that Congress has provided the 
military departments with authority to properly enter into a contract not to 
exceed 1 year that crosses fiscal years. The statute specifically authorizes 
the departments to obligate “[f]unds made available  


29 For example, the Comptroller General (41 U.S.C. § 253l-1), Library of Congress (41 U.S.C. 
§ 253l-2), Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives (41 U.S.C. § 253l-3), 
and Congressional Budget Office (41 U.S.C. § 253l-4).

for a fiscal year …for the total amount of a contract entered into” under 
section 2410a(a). 

In B-259274, May 22, 1996, the Air Force took full advantage of this 
authority to maximize efficient use of fiscal year appropriations. The Air 
Force had intended to award a 12-month severable services contract for 
vehicle maintenance beginning on September 1, 1994 (fiscal year 1994), and 
running until August 31, 1995 (fiscal year 1995). Using 10 U.S.C. § 2410a, the 
Air Force had planned to obligate the contract against its fiscal year 1994 
appropriation, until it learned that it did not have sufficient unobligated 
amounts to cover the contract. To avoid Antideficiency Act problems, but 
taking advantage of section 2410a, the Air Force entered into a 4-month 
contract, beginning September 1, 1994, and running until December 31, 
1994, and included an option to renew the contract at that time. The option, 
as in the Leiter decision we discussed in section B.8, could be exercised 
only by the Air Force, not the contractor, by affirmative written notification 
to the contractor. GAO concluded that the Air Force’s obligation was only 
for 4 months, and under authority of section 2410a, it constituted a bona 
fide need of fiscal year 1994 and was properly chargeable to fiscal year 
1994. Also, GAO found no Antideficiency Act violation. GAO said that with 
the option to renew for 8 months, the Air Force had incurred “a naked 
contractual obligation that carries with it no financial exposure to the 
government.” 

(1) 10 U.S.C. §§ 2306b, 2306c 

In addition to the severable services contracting authority, Congress has 
provided executive, legislative, and judicial entities substantial authority 
for multiyear contracting for goods and services using annual funds. The 
military departments are authorized by 10 U.S.C. §§ 2306b and 2306c to 
enter into multiyear contracts for goods and services, respectively, for 
periods of not more than 5 years if certain administrative determinations 
are made. Section 2306b applies not only to routine supplies, but also to the 
military departments acquisition of weapon systems and items and services 
associated with such systems. Section 2306c, enacted in response to the 
Wake Island decision (see 67 Comp. Gen. 190, 193 (1988)), applies to such 
services as installation maintenance and support, maintenance or 
modification of aircraft and other complex military equipment, specialized 
training, and base services. Sections 2306b and 2306c permit the military 
departments to obligate the entire amount of the 5-year contract to the 
fiscal year appropriation current at the time of contract award, even though 
the goods or services procured for the final 4 years of the contract  


Page 5-45 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

do not constitute needs of that fiscal year. Alternatively, sections 2306b and 
2306c permit the military departments to obligate the amount for each of 
the 5 years against appropriations enacted for each of those years. If funds 
are not made available for continuation in a subsequent fiscal year, 
cancellation or termination costs may be paid from appropriations 
originally available for the contract, appropriations currently available for 
the same general purpose, or appropriations made specifically for those 
payments. 10 U.S.C. §§ 2306b(f) and 2306c(e). The authority contained in 
sections 2306b and 2306c is also available to the Coast Guard and the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 10 U.S.C. § 2303. 

A multiyear contract entered into under authority of 10 U.S.C. §§ 2306b or 
2306c is binding on both parties for the full term of the contract unless 
terminated as provided in the statute. See Beta Systems, Inc. v. United 
States, 838 F.2d 1179, 1183 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1988); Beta Systems, Division of 
Velcon Filters, Inc. v. United States, 16 Cl. Ct. 219, 228 (1989). 

A contract under sections 2306b or 2306c must relate to the bona fide 
needs of the contract period as opposed to the need only of the first fiscal 
year of the contract period. The statute does not authorize the advance 
procurement of materials not needed during the 5-year term of the 
contract. See 64 Comp. Gen. 163 (1984); B-215825-O.M., Nov. 7, 1984. See 
also 35 Comp. Gen. 220 (1955). 

(2) 41 U.S.C. § 254c 

The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA) and related 
statutes extended multiyear contracting authority with annual funds to 
nonmilitary departments.30 FASA authorizes an executive agency to enter 
into a multiyear contract for the acquisition of property or services for 
more than 1, but not more than 5 years, if the agency makes certain 
administrative determinations. 41 U.S.C. § 254c. Related laws extend this 
authority to various legislative branch agencies.31 Through FASA and the 
related laws, Congress has relaxed the constraints of the bona fide needs 
rule by giving agencies the flexibility to structure contracts to fund the 
obligations up front, incrementally, or by using the standard bona fide 

30Pub. L. No. 103-355, § 1072, 108 Stat. 3243, 3270 (Oct. 13, 1994). 

31 For example, the General Accounting Office (41 U.S.C. § 253l-1), Library of Congress 
(41 U.S.C. § 253l-2), Chief Administrative Office of the House of Representatives (41 U.S.C. 
§ 253l-3, and Congressional Budget Office (41 U.S.C. § 253l-4).

c. Examples of Agency-
Specific Multiyear 
Contracting Authorities 
needs rule approach. B-277165, Jan. 10, 2000. To the extent an agency elects 
to obligate a 5-year contract incrementally, it must also obligate 
termination costs. 

The enactment of FASA satisfied the GAO recommendation for the 
enactment of legislation to authorize all federal agencies to engage in 
limited multiyear procurement. See U.S. General Accounting Office, 
Federal Agencies Should Be Given General Multiyear Contracting 
Authority For Supplies and Services, PSAD-78-54 (Washington, D.C.: 
Jan. 10, 1978). See also B-214545, Aug. 7, 1985 (comments on proposed 
legislation). 

An example of a specific authority is 41 U.S.C. § 11a, which authorizes the 
Secretary of the Army “to incur obligations for fuel in sufficient quantities 
to meet the requirements for one year without regard to the current fiscal 
year,” and to pay from appropriations either for the fiscal year in which the 
obligation is incurred or for the ensuing fiscal year. See 28 Comp. Gen. 614 
(1949) (construing the term “fuel” in that statute to include gasoline and 
other petroleum fuel products). 

Another example is 31 U.S.C. § 1308, which permits charges for telephone 
and other utility services for a time period beginning in one fiscal year and 
ending in another to be charged against appropriations current at the end 
of the covered time period. In addition, 42 U.S.C. § 2459a authorizes the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to enter into contracts for 
certain “services provided during the fiscal year following the fiscal year in 
which funds are appropriated.” 

A further example of statutory authority for multiyear contracting is 
40 U.S.C. § 481(a)(3), which authorizes contracts for public utility services 
for periods not exceeding 10 years. The purpose of the statute is to enable 
the government to take advantage of discounts offered under long-term 
contracts. 62 Comp. Gen. 569, 572 (1983); 35 Comp. Gen. 220, 222–3 (1955). 
For purposes of applying this statute, the nature of the product or service 
and not the nature of the provider is the governing factor. 70 Comp. 
Gen. 44, 49 (1990). Thus, the statute applies to obtaining utility services 
from other than a “traditional” form of public utility. 62 Comp. Gen. 569. 
When entering into a contract under 40 U.S.C. § 481(a)(3), the contracting 
agency needs to have sufficient budget authority only to obligate the first 
years costs. 62 Comp. Gen. at 572; 44 Comp. Gen. 683, 687–88 (1965). 

Page 5-47 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

Other examples of specific multiyear authority are 40 U.S.C. § 490(h), 
which authorizes the General Services Administration (GSA) to enter into 
leases for periods of up to 20 years; 40 U.S.C. § 757(c), which authorizes 
GSA to use the Information Technology Fund for contracts up to 5 years for 
information technology hardware, software, or services; and 10 U.S.C. 
§ 2828(d), under which the military departments may lease family housing 
united in foreign countries for periods up to 10 years, to be paid from 
annual appropriations. 

10. Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements 
The bona fide needs rule applies to all federal government activities carried 
out with appropriated funds, not just contracts, including grants and 
cooperative agreements. B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002; 73 Comp. Gen. 77, 78–79 
(1994). Because of the fundamentally different purposes of contracts and 
grants, a bona fide needs analysis in the context of grants and cooperative 
agreements is different from an analysis in a contract context. The purpose 
of a contract is to acquire goods or services; the purpose of a grant is to 
provide financial assistance. It is for that reason that we do not import into 
a grant analysis the contract concepts of supplies and services, particularly 
severable and nonseverable services. In the world of contracts, the analysis 
focuses, necessarily, on the agency’s need for the goods or services for 
which it has contracted. In that context, these concepts have particular 
relevance. The agency’s “need” in the grant context, however, is to make a 
grant in furtherance of the goals Congress hoped to achieve when it 
enacted the grant-making authority. In this context, the agency’s “need” is 
to make a grant, and the grantee’s use of grant funds has no relevance in the 
assessment of agency needs. 

For that reason, a bona fide needs analysis in the grant context focuses on 
whether the grant was made during the period of availability of the 
appropriation charged and furthers the authorized purpose of program 
legislation. B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002. Thus, where a statute authorizes grants 
to be made for up to 5 years to support childhood education, an award of a 
5-year grant fulfills a bona fide need in the year that the grant is awarded 
even though the 5-year grant is funded with a fiscal year appropriation. Id. 
However, where the “School Improvement Programs” appropriation for 
fiscal year 2002 authorizes grants only for “academic year 2002–2003,” only 
grants providing funding for the 2002–03 academic year are a bona fide 
need of the fiscal year 2002 appropriation, notwithstanding that the 
program statute authorizes grants for up to 4 years. Id. 

Page 5-48 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

The application of contract concepts to grants has not been without doubt. 
Prior to our 2002 decision, the application of the severability concept to 
grants and cooperative agreements had evolved over the years. In cases 
where agencies did not have explicit multiyear award authority, GAO used 
to treat grants and cooperative agreements in much the same way that it 
treated service contracts with regard to severability. In 64 Comp. Gen. 359 
(1985), GAO held that since the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant 
program did not contemplate a required outcome or product but, instead, 
sought to stimulate research that would be needed year after year, NIH was 
required to use appropriations available in the year that services were 
rendered to fund the grants. 

However, GAO significantly departed from that reasoning in a 1988 
decision involving Small Business Administration (SBA) grants. In that 
decision, GAO stated that when reviewing grants or cooperative 
agreements in the context of the bona fide needs rule, the principle of 
severability is irrelevant. B-229873, Nov. 29, 1988. GAO held that SBA did 
not violate the bona fide needs rule when it used its current appropriation 
on September 30, the last day of the fiscal year, to award cooperative 
agreements to Small Business Development Centers that would use the 
money in the next fiscal year. GAO concluded that, unlike a contract, a 
cooperative agreement satisfies the bona fide need of the agency—to 
financially assist the awardee—at the time SBA makes the award to the 
Small Business Development Centers. Id. Thus, the dates on which the 
Centers actually used the financial assistance are irrelevant for purposes of 
assessing SBA’s bona fide need. Id. 

Building on the SBA decision, GAO held that the Department of Education 
could use 1-year appropriations to award multiyear grants where the 
legislation creating the grant program explicitly stated that the grants could 
last multiple years and even in instances where the legislation did not 
address the duration of the grants. B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002. The 
determining factor is that the grants, at the time of award, further the 
objective of the grant legislation. Thus, GAO held that Education could use 
its fiscal year appropriations to fund a 4-year grant when the statute 
directed the agency to award grants “for periods of not more than 4 years.” 
See 20 U.S.C. § 6651(e)(2)(B)(i). Furthermore, GAO determined that 
Education could use its fiscal year appropriation to provide 5- and 2-year 
grants even though the statutes creating the grants were silent with regard 
to grant duration. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1070a-21 et seq. and Pub. L. No. 106-554, 
app. A, 114 Stat. 2763A-33–34 (Dec. 21, 2000). GAO reasoned that, in 
addition to authorizing awards, the grant statutes conferred broad 

Page 5-49 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

discretion on Education to help ensure the accomplishment of grant 
objectives; and it was within that discretion for Education to determine 
whether the grant objectives would best be accomplished through the use 
of multiyear grant awards. B-289801, Dec. 30, 2002. 

C. Advance Payments 
1. The Statutory 
Prohibition 
Advance payments in general are prohibited by 31 U.S.C. § 3324, which 
provides in part: 

“(a) Except as provided in this section, a payment under a 
contract to provide a service or deliver an article for the 
United States Government may not be more than the value 
of the service already provided or the article already 
delivered. 

“(b) An advance of public money may be made only if it is 
authorized by— 

“(1) a specific appropriation or other law ….” 

The quoted portion of 31 U.S.C. § 3324 is derived from legislation originally 
enacted in 1823 (3 Stat. 723). 

The primary purpose of 31 U.S.C. § 3324 is to protect the government 
against the risk of nonperformance—“to preclude the possibility of loss to 
the Government in the event a contractor—after receipt of payment— 
should fail to perform his contract or refuse or fail to refund moneys 
advanced.” 25 Comp. Gen. 834, 835 (1946). See also 65 Comp. Gen. 806, 809 
(1986); B-256692, June 22, 1995; B-249006, Apr. 6, 1993; B-180713, Apr. 10, 
1974. Thus, in its simplest terms, the statute prohibits the government from 
paying for goods before they have been received or for services before they 
have been rendered. The Floyd Acceptances, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 666, 682 
(1868); 10 Op. Att’y Gen. 288, 301 (1862). The statute has been described as 
“so plain that construction of it is unnecessary.” 27 Comp. Dec. 885, 886 
(1921). While that may be true if section 3324 is viewed in isolation, the 
situation today is nowhere near that simple. Advance payments are now 
permissible in a number of situations. What we now have is a basic

statutory prohibition with a network of exceptions, both statutory and 
nonstatutory, some of which are of major importance. 

Exceptions to the advance payment prohibition may be found in 
appropriation acts or in “other law.” Examples of specific exceptions are: 
10 U.S.C. § 2396 (for compliance with foreign laws, rent in foreign 
countries, tuition, pay, and supplies of armed forces of friendly countries); 
31 U.S.C. §§ 3324(b)(2) and (d)(2) (pay and allowances of members of the 
armed forces at distant stations and publications); and 19 U.S.C. §§ 2076– 
2077 and 2080 (Customs Service payments). Numerous other statutory 
exceptions exist in various contexts. A major exception, discussed in this 
chapter, section C.2, permits advance and progress payments under 
procurement contracts in certain situations. 

Payments to or on behalf of federal civilian employees and members of the 
uniformed service constitute another area in which exceptions exist. 
Advances of travel and transportation allowances for federal civilian 
employees are authorized by, e.g., 5 U.S.C. §§ 5705 and 5724(f). In addition, 
advances of allowances for basic housing, travel, and transportation, to 
members of the uniformed services (for themselves and in specified 
situations their dependents) are authorized by several statutes, e.g., 
37 U.S.C. §§ 403(a), 404(b)(1)(A), 404a(b), 405(a), 405a(a), 406(a)(3), and 
409(b). 

Prior to late 1990, the advance payment of salary, as opposed to the 
various allowances discussed in the preceding paragraph, remained 
prohibited, with a limited exception in 5 U.S.C. § 5522 for certain 
emergency or “national interest” evacuations. This situation caused 
occasional hardship for new employees resulting from delay in receiving 
their first regular paycheck. In 58 Comp. Gen. 646 (1979), GAO had 
concurred in a proposal to minimize this hardship by using imprest funds to 
make partial salary payments to new federal employees early in the week 
following the first week of employment, but cautioned that, in view of 
31 U.S.C. § 3324, no payments could be made before the work had been 
performed. Section 107 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 
199032 added a new 5 U.S.C. § 5524a, authorizing agencies to make advance 

32 The Act is contained in section 529 of the fiscal year 1991 Treasury, Postal Service, and 
General Government Appropriation Act, Pub. L. No. 101-509, 104 Stat. 1427, 1449 (Nov. 5, 
1990).

payments of up to two pay periods of basic pay to new employees.33 

Advance payment of salary remains prohibited in situations not covered by 
statutory exceptions. Thus, GAO has advised that partial or emergency 
salary payments can be made if a salary check is lost in the mail or an 
electronic deposit goes astray, but must be subject to “advance payment” 
safeguards similar to those discussed in 58 Comp. Gen. 646. B-193867.2, 
Jan. 12, 1990 (nondecision letter). Similarly, GAO concluded that the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission could reschedule its commissioners’ pay 
days that fall on weekends or holidays to the preceding workday, provided 
that payments made prior to the end of a pay period did not include salary 
applicable to days remaining in the pay period. B-237963, June 28, 1990. 

Tuition payments may be paid in advance. The Government Employees 
Training Act, 5 U.S.C. § 4109, provides general authority for advance tuition 
payments for civilian employees. Also, 10 U.S.C. § 2396(a)(3) authorizes 
advance tuition payments for military personnel. Prior to the enactment of 
these provisions, the Comptroller General held that certain tuition 
payments could be made in advance. For example, legislation authorizing 
the Coast Guard to provide training for its personnel at private or state 
colleges and universities and to pay certain expenses, including tuition, 
was viewed as authorization by “other law” within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3324. Tuition could therefore be paid at the time of enrollment if required 
by the educational institution. 41 Comp. Gen. 626 (1962). See also B-70395, 
Oct. 30, 1947 (tuition payments by Public Health Service in connection with 
research fellowships); B-56585, May 1, 1946 (tuition payments by the 
former Veterans Administration in connection with schooling of veterans). 

Exceptions to the advance payment prohibition may appear in 
appropriation acts as well as other legislation. The extent of the authority 
conferred and its duration will of course be determined in accordance with 
rules applicable to construing appropriations language. Some may be 
limited by duration and some may be limited to a particular agency. Also, 
the bona fide needs rule applies. In one case, a fiscal year 1955 
appropriation for an Indian education program included authority for the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs to make certain payments in advance. The 
Comptroller General held that the funds could be obligated only for the  
 


33 Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the authority is effective only to the extent 
provided for in advance in appropriation acts. See Pub. L. No. 101-509, § 301.

bona fide needs of the period for which appropriated. Therefore, the 
advance payment authority was limited to the portion of the program to be 
furnished during fiscal year 1955 and could not operate to extend the 
period of availability of the appropriation, that is, could not be used to pay 
for portions of the program extending into fiscal year 1956. 34 Comp. 
Gen. 432 (1955).34 This principle would be equally applicable to advance 
payment authority contained in permanent legislation. 

If a given situation does not fall within any existing exception, the statutory 
prohibition will apply. E.g., 65 Comp. Gen. 806 (1986) (advance payment 
for published advertisement); 64 Comp. Gen. 710 (1985) (advance 
payments under contract for office equipment maintenance found to 
violate statute notwithstanding Federal Supply Schedule contract language 
to the contrary). 

The statutory prohibition on the advance payment of public funds, 
31 U.S.C. § 3324, does not apply to grants. Since assistance awards are 
made to assist authorized recipients and are not primarily for the purpose 
of obtaining goods or services for the government, the policy behind the 
advance payment prohibition has less force in the case of assistance 
awards than in the case of procurement contracts. Accordingly, it has been 
held that 31 U.S.C. § 3324 does not preclude advance funding in authorized 
grant relationships. Unless restricted by the program legislation of the 
applicable appropriation, the authority to make grants is sufficient to 
satisfy the requirements of 31 U.S.C. § 3324. 60 Comp. Gen. 208 (1981); 
59 Comp. Gen. 424 (1980); 41 Comp. Gen. 394 (1961). As stated in 60 Comp. 
Gen. 209, “[t]he policy of payment upon receipt of goods or services is 
simply inconsistent with assistance relationships where the government 
does not receive anything in the usual sense.” These concepts are further 
explored in Chapter 10.35 

In 70 Comp. Gen. 701 (1991), the Comptroller General held that payments 
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for McDonald’s gift certificates and movie 

34 This case is cited for the limited purpose of illustrating that advance payment authority 
does not negate application of the bona fide needs rule. It does not illustrate the general 
application of the bona fide needs rule to training obligations. On the contrary, as noted 
earlier in this chapter, most training tends to be nonseverable. 

35 Although grantees are not subject to the prohibition against advance payments, under the 
Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990, they may not draw money out of the treasury 
in advance of need. Pub. L. No. 101-453, 104 Stat. 1058, (Oct. 24, 1990).

tickets, which would be redeemed at a later date for their full value, would 
not violate 31 U.S.C. § 3324, provided that adequate administrative 
safeguards for the control of the certificates and tickets were maintained, 
the purchase of the certificates was in the government’s interest, and the 
certificates and tickets were readily redeemable for cash. 

2. Government 
Procurement Contracts 
a. Background First, it is important to define a few terms. We take our definitions from the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R. § 32.102. In the context of 
government contracting, “advance payments” are payments to a prime 
contractor “before, in anticipation of, and for the purpose of complete 
performance under one or more contracts.” Advance payments are not 
measured by performance. “Progress payments” are payments made to the 
contractor as work progresses on the contract. They may be based on costs 
incurred by the contractor or a percentage or stage of completion. “Partial 
payments” are payments “for accepted supplies and services that are only a 
part of the contract requirements.” Advance payments and progress 
payments based on costs incurred are regarded as forms of “contract 
financing.” Partial payments and progress payments based on a percentage 
or stage of completion are viewed simply as payment methods. 
The extent to which various forms of contract financing are permissible 
under the advance payment statute was the subject of many early 
decisions. In one early case, the advance payment statute was applied to a 
question regarding the legality of government partial (progress) payments 
for materials that had not been delivered. The Comptroller General held 
that the statute does not necessarily require withholding of payment under 
a contract until it has been entirely completed and all deliverables have 
been provided to the government. The statute “was not intended to prevent 
a partial payment in any case in which the amount of such payment had 
been actually earned by the contractor and the United States had received 
an equivalent therefor.” 1 Comp. Gen. 143, 145 (1921). The partial payments 
proposed in that case were not in excess of the amount actually expended 
by the contractor in performance of the contract, and because the contract 
provided that title to all property on which payment was made vested in the 
government, the government would receive the corresponding benefit. 
Partial payments in advance of complete delivery were therefore 
permissible. 

Page 5-54 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

In 20 Comp. Gen. 917 (1941), the Comptroller General approved a proposed 
contract amendment to provide for partial payment of the contract price 
prior to delivery to the government on the condition that title to the 
materials would pass to the government at the time of payment. 

From these and similar cases, a rule evolved, applied both by the 
accounting officers and by the Attorney General, that partial payments for 
equipment or land made in advance of their delivery into the actual 
possession of the United States would not violate the advance payment 
statute if title therein had vested in the government at the time of payment, 
or if the equipment or land was impressed with a valid lien in favor of the 
United States in an amount at least equal to the payment. 28 Comp. 
Gen. 468 (1949); 20 Comp. Gen. 917 (1941).36 

Applying this rule, GAO has approved the payment of “earnest money” 
under a contract for the sale of real estate to the government. The 
arrangement was found sufficient to protect the government’s interests 
because the contract (a) vested equitable title in the government prior to 
the vesting of legal title, which remained in the seller only to secure 
payment of the purchase price, and (b) obligated the seller to deliver title 
insurance commitment. 34 Comp. Gen. 659 (1955). 

b. Contract Financing “Contract financing payment” is defined by the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) as an authorized government disbursement of moneys to 
a contractor prior to acceptance of supplies or services by the government. 
Such payments include: advance payments; performance-based payments; 
commercial advance and interim payments; certain cost-based progress 
payments; certain percentage- or stage-of-completion-based progress 
payments; and interim payments under certain cost reimbursement 
contracts. 48 C.F.R. § 32.001. “Advance payments” are payments made to a 
prime contractor before, in anticipation of, and for the purpose of complete 
performance under one or more contracts. Such payments are not 
measured by performance. 48 C.F.R. § 32.102(a). “Progress payments based 
on costs” are made on the basis of costs incurred by the contractor as work 
progresses under the contract. 48 C.F.R. § 32.102(b). Progress payments 
based on percentage or stage of completion are to be made under agency 
procedures that ensure that payments are commensurate with the work 
36 Some other cases in this evolution are: 17 Comp. Dec. 894 (1911); 17 Comp. Dec. 231 
(1910); 29 Op. Att’y Gen. 46 (1911); 20 Op. Att’y Gen. 746 (1894); 18 Op. Att’y Gen. 105 
(1885).

accomplished that meets the quality standards established under the 
contract. 48 C.F.R. § 32.102(e). 

The major laws governing acquisition by most agencies of the executive 
branch of government have for over a half century included provisions 
relating to agencies making advance and progress payments under 
contracts for supplies or services. See 10 U.S.C. § 2307 (Department of 
Defense) and 41 U.S.C. § 255 (most civilian agencies). Both provisions 
permit agencies to make advance, partial, progress, or other payments 
under contracts for property or services that do not exceed the unpaid 
contract price. Within their discretion, the agencies may include in bid 
solicitations a provision limiting advance or progress payments to small 
business concerns. 10 U.S.C. § 2307(a)(c); 41 U.S.C. § 255(a)(c). The 
Comptroller General views the authority conferred by both these 
provisions to apply to both advertised and negotiated procurements. 
B-158487, Apr. 4, 1966. 

Both provisions provide that whenever practicable, payments are to be 
made based on (1) performance, using quantifiable methods such as 
delivery of acceptable items, work measurement, or statistical process 
controls; (2) accomplishment of events defined in a program management 
plan; or (3) other quantifiable measures of results. 10 U.S.C. § 2307(b); 
41 U.S.C. § 255(b). Both provisions establish conditions for progress 
payments for work in process and limit such payments to 80 percent of the 
contract price for contracts over $25,000. 10 U.S.C. § 2307(e); 41 U.S.C. 
§ 255(e). 

Both provisions provide that advance payments may be made only upon 
adequate security and a determination by the agency head that such would 
be in the public interest. Such security interest may be in the form of a lien 
in favor of the government on the property contracted for, on the balance in 
an account in which such payments are deposited, and such of the property 
acquired for performance of the contract as agreed to by the parties. The 
lien is to be paramount to all other liens and effective immediately upon the 
first advance of funds without filing, notice, or any other action by the 
government. 10 U.S.C. § 2307(d); 41 U.S.C. § 255(d). Advance payments for 
commercial items may not exceed 15 percent of the contract price in 
advance of any performance of work under the contract. 10 U.S.C. 
§ 2307(f)(2); 41 U.S.C. § 255(f)(2). Section 2307(h) provides that if a 
contract calls for advance, partial, progress, or other payments and 
provides for title to property to vest in the United States, the title vests in 
accordance with the terms of the contract, regardless of any security

interest in the property that is asserted before or after entering into the 
contract. 

Section 2307(g) of title 10 of the United States Code contains special 
provisions relating to Navy contracts, for example, that progress payments 
under contracts for repair, maintenance, or overhaul of a naval vessel may 
not be less than 95 percent for small businesses and 90 percent for any 
other business. 

Generally speaking, the government’s preference is that the contractor be 
able to perform using private financing, that is, the contractor’s own 
resources or financing obtained in the private market. 48 C.F.R. § 32.106. 
The advance payment authority of 10 U.S.C. § 2307 and 41 U.S.C. § 255 is a 
financing tool to be used sparingly. It is considered the least preferred 
method of contract financing. 48 C.F.R. §§ 32.106 and 32.402(b); 57 Comp. 
Gen. 89, 94 (1977). However, the need for government assistance in various 
situations has long been recognized. In this context, government 
contracting, while primarily intended to serve the government’s needs, is 
also designed to foster a variety of social and economic objectives. 

The FAR prescribes policies and procedures for agencies to apply in using 
contract financing. 48 C.F.R. pt. 32. For example, subparts 32.1 and 32.2 
provide guidance on the use of such authority when purchasing 
noncommercial and commercial items, respectively. Subpart 32.4 provides 
guidance on the use of advance payment authority when contracting for 
noncommercial items. Subpart 32.5 provides guidance on the use of 
progress payments based on cost, and subpart 32.10 provides guidance on 
the use of performance-based payments for noncommercial items. Various 
provisions of the FAR elaborate further on the statutory requirements with 
respect to adequate security for advance payments. See, e.g., 48 C.F.R. 
§§ 32.202-4, 32.409-3. Application for advance payments under contracts to 
acquire noncommercial items may be made before or after the award of the 
contract under 48 C.F.R. § 32.408.37 

Security requirements may vary to fit the circumstances of the particular 
case. 48 C.F.R. § 32.409-3(d). In B-214446, Oct. 29, 1984, GAO considered a 
proposal to certify payment before the services were rendered. The check 

37 Short of following these procedures, a bid conditioned on receipt of advance payments at 
variance with the terms of the solicitation may be rejected as nonresponsive. 57 Comp. 
Gen. 89 (1977); B-205088, Oct. 28, 1981; B-197471.2, Aug. 14, 1981.

would be held in escrow under the government’s control until contract 
obligations were met, at which time it would be released to the contractor. 
This arrangement was deemed adequate for purposes of 41 U.S.C. § 255. In 
an earlier case, GAO declined approval of a “purchase order draft” 
procedure, which called for the government to send a blank check to the 
supplier upon placing an order. The supplier was to fill in the check for the 
actual amount due, not to exceed a sum specified on the check, thereby 
effecting immediate payment and eliminating the need for the supplier to 
bill the government. GAO concluded that an agency head could not 
reasonably find that this plan would provide adequate security for the 
government. B-158873, Apr. 27, 1966. In B-288013, Dec. 11, 2001, a case 
involving whether the Department of Defense could make payment of 
membership fees to a private fitness center at the beginning of each option 
year, GAO found that permitting membership transfers did not provide 
adequate security to the government to justify an advance payment. 

Advance payments are also authorized under Public Law 85-804,38 50 U.S.C. 
§§ 1431–1435. This law permits agencies designated by the President to 
enter into contracts, or to modify or amend existing contracts, and to make 
advance payments on those contracts, “without regard to other provisions 
of law relating to the making, performance, amendment, or modification of 
contracts, whenever [the President] deems that such action would 
facilitate the national defense.” 50 U.S.C. § 1431. Agencies authorized to 
utilize Public Law 85-804 are listed in Executive Order No. 10789, Nov. 14, 
1958, as amended (reprinted as note following 50 U.S.C. § 1431). The FAR 
subpart on advance payments includes provisions addressing Public 
Law 85-804, which applies only during a declared national emergency. 
50 U.S.C. § 1435.39 

Progress payments, where authorized, are made periodically based on costs 
incurred, with the total not to exceed 80 percent of the total contract price. 
48 C.F.R. §§ 32.5011 and 52.232-16 (required contract clause for fixed-price 

38 Pub. L. No. 85-804, 72 Stat. 972 (Aug. 28, 1958). 

39 The National Emergencies Act, enacted in 1976, provided that powers and authorities 
resulting from the existence of any national emergency still in effect on September 14, 1976, 
were to terminate 2 years from that date. 50 U.S.C. § 1601. Specifically, the national 
emergency declared by President Truman in 1950 for the Korean conflict had never been 
revoked. However, 50 U.S.C. § 1651 makes the termination inapplicable with respect to 
certain provisions of law, one of which is Public Law 85-804. Thus, for purposes of Public 
Law 85-804, the Korean War has never ended. This is discussed in more detail in B-193687, 
Aug. 22, 1979.

contracts). In an incrementally funded fixed-price contract, GAO has 
construed “total contract price” as the price for complete performance 
rather than the amount already allotted to the contract, provided that 
payment may not exceed the total amount allotted. 59 Comp. Gen. 526 
(1980). See also 48 C.F.R. § 32.5013. 

A key condition where cost-based progress payments are authorized is the 
vesting in the government of title to work in process and certain other 
property allocable to the contract. 48 C.F.R. §§ 32.503-14 and 52.232-16. 
These title provisions are an outgrowth of the case law noted earlier in this 
section. 

The nature of the government’s interest under this title-vesting provision 
has produced disagreement among the courts. One view is that title means 
full, absolute title, which cannot be defeated by subsequent liens. In re 
Reynolds Manufacturing Co., 68 B.R. 219 (Bankr. W.D. Penn. 1986); In re 
Denalco Corp., 51 B.R. 77 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1985); In re Economy Cab and 
Tool Co., 47 B.R. 708 (Bankr. D. Minn. 1985); In re American Pouch Foods, 
Inc., 30 B.R. 1015 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1983), aff’d, 769 F.2d 1190 (7th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 475 U.S. 1082 (1985); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Director of 
Revenue, 945 S.W.2d 437 (Mo. 1997). See also In re Wincom Corp., 76 B.R. 1 
(Bankr. D. Mass. 1987), reaching the same result. Another view is that the 
title-vesting provision gives the government a security interest in the form 
of a lien relative to progress payments identified with specific property, 
paramount to the liens of general creditors. United States v. Dominicci, 
899 F. Supp. 42 (D.P.R. 1995); United States v. Hartec Enterprises, Inc., 
967 F.2d 130 (5th Cir. 1992); Fairchild Industries, Inc. v. United States, 
71 F.3d 868 (Fed. Cir. 1995); Marine Midland Bank v. United States, 
687 F.2d 395 (Ct. Cl. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1037 (1983); Welco 
Industries, Inc. v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 303 (1985), aff’d mem., 790 F.2d 
90 (Fed. Cir. 1986).40 The American Pouch and Marine Midland decisions, 
while reaching different conclusions, contain detailed discussions of the 
evolution of contract financing in relation to the advance payment statute. 

40 Under the lien theory, however, it has also been held that the government’s interest under 
the title-vesting provision will not be paramount to perfected security interests of other 
creditors where the government’s progress payments have not been used to put value in the 
specific property involved. First National Bank of Geneva v. United States, 13 Cl. Ct. 385 
(1987).

c. Payment Under a strict interpretation of 31 U.S.C. § 3324 standing alone, payment 
could not be made until property being acquired was actually received and 
accepted by the government. Thus, in one early case, a supply contract 
provided for payment “for articles delivered and accepted” and for the 
contractor to retain responsibility for the supplies or materials until they 
were actually in the possession of a government representative at their 
destination. The Comptroller General held that payments on the basis of 
vouchers or invoices supported by evidence of shipment only, without 
evidence of arrival of the supplies at the destination and without assurance 
of receipt or acceptance by the government, would be unauthorized. 
20 Comp. Gen. 230 (1940). 

As with the forms of contract financing discussed above, the enactment of 
10 U.S.C. § 2307 and 41 U.S.C. § 255 permitted more latitude in payment 
procedures. In view of this statutory authority, the Comptroller General, in 
B-158487, Apr. 4, 1966, approved an advance payment procedure under 
which the General Services Administration (GSA) would make payments 
on direct delivery vouchers prior to the receipt of “receiving reports” from 
the consignees. The proposal was designed to effect savings to the 
government by enabling GSA to take advantage of prompt payment 
discounts.41 GAO’s approval was conditioned on compliance with the 
conditions specified in 41 U.S.C. § 255 that advance payment be in the 
public interest and that adequate security be provided. 

GAO has since approved similar accelerated payment or “fast pay” 
procedures for other agencies in B-155253, Mar. 20, 1968 (Defense 
Department) and B-155253, Aug. 20, 1969 (Federal Aviation 
Administration), and reaffirmed them for GSA in 60 Comp. Gen. 602 (1981). 
See also B-279620, Mar. 31, 1998, for an extensive discussion of the 
background of, and adequate controls required for, fast pay. 

The Federal Acquisition Regulation provides guidance in using fast 
payment procedures in 48 C.F.R. subpt. 13.4. An agency may pay for 
supplies based on the contractor’s submission of an invoice under, among 
others, the following conditions:

• The individual order does not exceed $25,000. Agencies have 
discretionary authority to set higher limits for specified items or 
activities. 

• Geographical separation and lack of adequate communications 
facilities between receiving and disbursing activities make it 
impractical to make timely payment based on evidence of acceptance. 

• Title vests in the government upon delivery to a post office or common 
carrier or, if shipment is by means other than Postal Service or common 
carrier, upon receipt by the government. 

• The contractor agrees to repair, replace, or otherwise correct any items 
not received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to 
purchase requirements. 

The invoice is the contractor’s representation that the goods have been 
delivered to a post office, common carrier, or point of first receipt by the 
government. 

Accelerated payment procedures should have adequate internal controls. 
GAO’s recommended controls are outlined in 60 Comp. Gen. 602 (1981) and 
B-205868, June 14, 1982. Fast pay procedures should be subject to 
monetary ceilings (now required by the FAR), limited to contractors which 
have an ongoing relationship with the agency, and reviewed periodically to 
ensure that benefits outweigh costs. The agency must keep records 
adequate to determine that the agency is getting what it pays for. The 
system should permit the timely discovery of discrepancies and require 
prompt follow-up action. GAO has also recommended that an agency test 
the procedure before agencywide implementation. B-205868, supra at 3. 

It has also been held that the use of imprest or petty cash funds to purchase 
supplies under C.O.D. [cash on delivery] procedures does not violate 
31 U.S.C. § 3324, even where payment is made prior to examination of the 
shipment. 32 Comp. Gen. 563 (1953).42 

42 The decision refers to something called “Joint Regulations for Small Purchases Utilizing 
Imprest Funds.” This was a regulation, issued jointly by GAO, GSA, and the Treasury 
Department, and published at 31 Comp. Gen. 768 (1952). It was rescinded in 1959.

Another fast pay issue was discussed in B-203993-O.M., July 12, 1982, in 
which GAO’s General Counsel advised the GAO finance office that it could 
pay the invoice amount, without the need for further verification, if goods 
are shipped “f.o.b. [freight on board] origin” and the difference between the 
estimated price in the purchase order and the amount shown on the invoice 
is based solely on transportation costs. Any discrepancy regarding the 
transportation costs could be determined and adjusted through post-audit 
procedures under 31 U.S.C. § 3726. This would not apply to goods shipped 
“f.o.b. destination” because transportation charges are included as part of 
the purchase price. 

As a general proposition, since fast pay procedures permit the agency to 
dispense with prepayment voucher audits, GAO’s approval of fast pay 
procedures has been based on the assumption that the agency would 
conduct 100 percent post-payment audits. In 67 Comp. Gen. 194 (1988), 
GAO approved in concept a GSA proposal to combine fast pay procedures 
with the use of statistical sampling in post-audit for utility invoices. “We see 
no reason why these two techniques cannot be combined in appropriate 
circumstances if they result in economies and adequately protect the 
interests of the government.” Id. at 199. However, GAO found that the 
specific proposal did not provide adequate controls. GSA modified its 
proposal, and the Comptroller General approved it in 68 Comp. Gen. 618 
(1989). 

3. Lease and Rental 
Agreements 
The advance payment statute has been consistently construed as 
applicable to lease or rental agreements as well as purchases, and applies 
with respect to both real and personal property. 18 Comp. Gen. 839 (1939); 
3 Comp. Gen. 542 (1924); B-188166, June 3, 1977. Thus, when the 
government acquires land by leasing, payments must be made “in arrears” 
unless the applicable appropriation act or other law provides an exemption 
from 31 U.S.C. § 3324. 19 Comp. Gen. 758, 760 (1940). The Federal 
Acquisition Regulation advance payment provisions do not apply to rent. 
48 C.F.R. § 32.404(a)(1). 

In 57 Comp. Gen. 89 (1977), the Comptroller General held that a leasing 
arrangement of telephone equipment called “tier pricing,” under which the 
government would be obligated to pay the contractor’s entire capital cost at 
the outset of the lease, would violate 31 U.S.C. § 3324. See also 58 Comp. 
Gen. 29 (1978).

The advance payment of annual rent on property leased from the National 
Park Foundation, a statutorily created charitable nonprofit organization, 
was found permissible in B-207215, Mar. 1, 1983, based on the “unique 
status” of the lessor. 

Certain long-term lease/rental agreements may present more complicated 
problems in that they may involve not only 31 U.S.C. § 3324 but also the 
Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341. Since appropriations are made only 
for the bona fide needs of a particular fiscal year, and since a lease 
purporting to bind the government for more than one fiscal year would 
necessarily include the needs of future years, such a lease would be 
contrary to the Antideficiency Act prohibition against contracting for any 
purpose in advance of appropriations made for such purpose. Thus, a lease 
agreement for the rental of nitrogen gas cylinders for a 25-year period, the 
full rental price to be paid in the first year, would violate both statutes. 
37 Comp. Gen. 60 (1957). A contractual arrangement on an annual basis 
with an option in the government to renew from year to year was seen as 
the only way to accomplish the desired objective. Id. at 62. See also 

19 Comp. Gen. 758 (1940). 

4. Publications Advance payment is authorized for “charges for a publication printed or 
recorded in any way for the auditory or visual use of the agency.” 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3324(d)(2). 
The original exemption for publications was enacted in 1930 (46 Stat. 580 
(June 12, 1930)) and amended in 1961 (Pub. L. No. 87-91, 75 Stat. 211 
(July 20, 1961)). It authorized advance payments for “subscriptions or other 
charges for newspapers, magazines, periodicals, and other publications for 
official use.” Prior to 1974, a seemingly endless stream of cases arose over 
the meaning of the terms “publications” or “other publications” as used 

Page 5-63 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

either in the general exemption or in specific appropriation acts.43 Based on 
judicial precedent, GAO construed the terms to mean publications in the 
customary and commonly understood sense of the word, that is, books, 
pamphlets, newspapers, periodicals, or prints. B-125979, June 14, 1957. The 
exemption was also held to include other types of “visual” material such as 
microfilm products, (41 Comp. Gen. 211 (1961)); 35-millimeter slides 
(48 Comp. Gen. 784 (1969)); CD-Rom technical databases, online databases 
that include technical articles updated daily, and a newsletter (B-256692, 
June 22, 1995). However, the term “publications” was held not to include 
items made to be heard rather than read, such as phonograph records 
(21 Comp. Gen. 524 (1941); B-125979, June 14, 1957) or tape-recorded 
material (46 Comp. Gen. 394 (1966); B-137516, Oct. 28, 1958). In 35 Comp. 
Gen. 404 (1956), the use of advance payments for the procurement of 
books through “book club” facilities was held permissible.44 

In 1974, Congress resolved the problems over the interpretation of “other 
publications” by enacting legislation to codify some of the GAO decisions 
and modify others, by defining “other publications” as including “any 
publication printed, microfilmed, photocopied, or magnetically or 
otherwise recorded for auditory or visual usage” (Pub. L. No. 93-534, 
88 Stat. 1731 (Dec. 22, 1974)). This was condensed into the present version 
of 31 U.S.C. § 3324(d)(2) when Title 31 was recodified in 1982. 

A 1978 decision considered the question of whether a microfilm library 
could be acquired under a lease/rental arrangement or whether the 
advance payments were authorized only where the government actually 
purchased the library. The Comptroller General concluded that in the 

43 The 1930 version of the exemption authorized advance payment only for “newspapers, 
magazines, and other periodicals,” although a few agencies had broader authority under 
agency-specific legislation. For agencies subject to the quoted language, the sole issue in 
several decisions was whether a given publication could also be regarded as a “periodical” 
and thus within the statute. E.g., 37 Comp. Gen. 720 (1958); 17 Comp. Gen. 455 (1937); 
A-90102, Sept. 3, 1938. The 1961 amendment expanded the authority to include “other 
publications,” rendering these decisions obsolete. In addition, the 1974 legislation discussed 
in the text further expanded the definition of “publication.” Thus, most pre-1974 decisions in 
this area are wholly or partly obsolete; their continuing validity must be assessed in light of 
the present statutory language. 

44 This decision originally applied only to the former Veterans Administration, which had 
specific authority. It did not apply to agencies subject to the then-existing version of the 
general exemption since the books were not “periodicals.” This part of the decision should 
now be disregarded (see prior footnote), and the holding in 35 Comp. Gen. 404 would now 
apply to any agency which can justify the need.

absence of statutory language or evidence of legislative intent to the 
contrary, there is no meaningful difference between the purchase and 
rental of publications needed by the government, and that the rental or 
leasing of a microfilm library for official government use fell within the 
purview of the publications exemption. 57 Comp. Gen. 583 (1978). 
However, advance payments for items of equipment necessary for use in 
conjunction with a microfilm library are still prohibited. B-188166, June 3, 
1977. (The cited decision, although not clear from the text itself, dealt with 
reader/printers.) 

More recent decisions have construed the publications exemption found in 
31 U.S.C. § 3324(d)(2) as permitting advance payment for coupons to be 
used for the purchase of articles from medical journals and redeemable for 
cash if unused (67 Comp. Gen. 491 (1988)); verification reports of 
physicians’ board certifications (B-231673, Aug. 8, 1988); and hospital 
evaluation reports based on data submitted by participating government 
hospitals and including, as part of the subscription price, a laboratory kit 
for use in obtaining the data required for the reports, the kit being regarded 
as “a part of the publication process” (B-210719, Dec. 23, 1983). 

In B-256692, June 22, 1995, the Comptroller General held that the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not, under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3324(d)(2), make an advance payment for telephonic support services 
offered as part of a technical support package for computer software 
products. The telephonic support did not constitute a publication under 
section 3324(d)(2), and because it had significant value to the CDC 
independent of the package, it could not be classified as so necessary to the 
other publications in the package that advance payment authority would be 
available. 

The Federal Acquisition Regulation advance payment provisions do not 
apply to subscriptions to publications. 48 C.F.R. § 32.404(a)(6). 

5. Other Governmental 
Entities 
The Comptroller General has not applied the advance payment prohibition 
to payments to other federal agencies. As noted previously, the primary 
purpose of the prohibition is to preclude the possibility of loss in the event 
a contractor, after receipt of payment, should fail to perform and fail or 
refuse to refund the money to the United States. The danger of such a loss 
is minimized when the contractor is another government agency. Thus, 
31 U.S.C. § 3324 does not prohibit advance payment of post office box 

Page 5-65 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

rentals. 25 Comp. Gen. 834 (1946). Also, the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535, 
expressly authorizes advance payments for transactions within its scope. 

GAO has applied the same rationale to exempt state and local governments 
from the advance payment prohibition. E.g., 57 Comp. Gen. 399 (1978) (no 
objection to advance payment of rent under lease of land from state of 
Idaho). This exception, however, applies only where the state is furnishing 
noncommercial services reasonably available only from the state. 39 Comp. 
Gen. 285 (1959); B-250935, Oct. 12, 1993 (sewer service charge); B-118846, 
Mar. 29, 1954 (expenses of state water commissioner administering Indian 
irrigation project pursuant to court order); B-109485, July 22, 1952 (repair, 
operation, and maintenance of roads in conjunction with permanent 
transfer of federal roads to county); B-65821, May 29, 1947, and B-34946, 
June 9, 1943 (state court fees and other items of expense required to litigate 
in state courts in compliance with the requirements of state law); B-36099, 
Aug. 14, 1943 (lease of state lands); B-35670, July 19, 1943 (state forest fire 
prevention and suppression services). 

Conversely, where a state provides the federal government with services 
that are freely and readily available in the commercial market, the statutory 
advance payment restrictions applicable to private contractors govern. 
58 Comp. Gen. 29 (1978) (telephone services). 

In B-207215, Mar. 1, 1983, GAO advised the National Park Service that it 
could make advance payments of annual rent on property leased from the 
National Park Foundation. The National Park Foundation is a charitable 
nonprofit organization created by statute to accept and administer gifts to 
the National Park Service, and its board of directors includes the Secretary 
of the Interior and the Director of the Park Service. GAO concluded that 
the Foundation’s “unique status virtually assures that there is no threat of 
loss to the Government.” Even though technically the Foundation is neither 
a state nor a federal agency, it is, in effect, tantamount to one for advance 
payment purposes. 

The exception recognized in the case of state and local governments has 
not been extended to public utilities. 42 Comp. Gen. 659 (1963) (telephone 
services). See also 27 Comp. Dec. 885 (1921). Thus, a government agency 
cannot use a utility “budget plan” which would provide for level monthly 
payments in a predetermined amount throughout the year. B-237127, 
Dec. 12, 1989 (nondecision letter). In subscribing to a cable service, the 
National Park Service could only make payment after the service has been 
rendered. B-254295, Nov. 24, 1993. Similarly, monthly charges under a 

Page 5-66 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

utility service contract for cable television service to a Naval hospital may 
not be paid in advance. B-237789, Dec. 10, 1990. The Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) violated 31 U.S.C. § 3324 by making an advance 
payment to Pacific Gas and Electric Company for connecting electrical 
utility service to a remote FAA facility because it failed to obtain “adequate 
security” as required by 41 U.S.C. § 255 or to follow Federal Acquisition 
Regulation advance payment requirements. B-260063, June 30, 1995. 

D. Disposition of 
Appropriation 
Balances45 
1. Terminology Annual appropriations that are unobligated at the end of the fiscal year for 
which they were appropriated are said to “expire” for obligational 
purposes.46 In other words, they cease to be available for the purposes of 
incurring and recording new obligations. The same principle applies to 
multiple year appropriations as of the end of the last fiscal year for which 
they were provided. For purposes of this discussion, annual and multiple 
year appropriations are referred to cumulatively as “fixed appropriations.” 
31 U.S.C. § 1551(a)(3). 
The portion of an appropriation that has not actually been spent at the end 
of the fiscal year (or other definite period of availability) is called the 

45 While the discussion in this section includes the time period preceding 1990, except as 
otherwise specified, references to 31 U.S.C. §§ 1551 through 1558 are to the procedures first 
established in 1990 by Pub. L. No. 101-510, 104 Stat. 1485, 1675 (Nov. 5, 1990), and include 
any subsequent amendments thereto. 

46 The term “lapse” was sometimes mistakenly used in this context although there was an 
important distinction. Generally, under prior law an appropriation “lapsed” when it ceased 
to be available to the agency to pay obligations that were in the first instance incurred and 
properly charged against the appropriation prior to its lapse. Today we refer to this as a 
“closed” appropriation account. 

Page 5-67 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

“unexpended balance.”47 It consists of two components—the obligated 
balance and the unobligated balance. 

The obligated balance is defined as “the amount of unliquidated obligations 
applicable to the appropriation less amounts collectible as repayments to 
the appropriation.” 31 U.S.C. § 551(a)(1). Restated, obligated balance 
means the amount of undisbursed funds remaining in an appropriation 
against which definite obligations have been recorded. 

The unobligated balance is “the difference between the obligated balance 
and the total unexpended balance.” Id. at § 1551(a)(2). It represents that 
portion of the unexpended balance unencumbered by obligations recorded 
under 31 U.S.C. § 1501. 

2. Evolution of the Law Congressional treatment of unexpended balances has changed a number of 
times over the years, most recently in November 1990. Some knowledge of 
the past is useful in understanding the pre-1991 decisions and in 
determining which portions of them remain applicable. 
Prior to 1949, unexpended balances of annual appropriations retained their 
fiscal year identity for two full fiscal years following expiration, after which 
time the remaining undisbursed balance had to be covered into the surplus 
fund of the Treasury. The agency involved no longer had access to the 
balance for any purpose, and subsequent claims against the appropriation 
had to be settled by GAO. E.g., B-24565, Apr. 2, 1942; B-18740, July 23, 1941. 
The appropriation was said to “lapse” when it was covered into the surplus 
fund of the Treasury. See 24 Comp. Gen. 942, 945 (1945); 21 Comp. Gen. 46 
(1941). 

The problem with this arrangement was that, in view of article I, section 9 
of the United States Constitution, once the money was covered into the 
Treasury, another appropriation was needed to get it back out. E.g., 
23 Comp. Gen. 689, 694 (1944). This was true even for simple, undisputed 
claims. Congress tried various devices to pay claims against lapsed 
appropriations—reappropriation of lapsed funds, definite and indefinite 

47 Depending on the specific context in which the term is used, “unexpended balance” may 
refer to the entire undisbursed balance or to the unobligated balance only. 22 Comp. Gen. 59 
(1942). We use it here in the broader sense.

Chapter 5

appropriations for the payment of claims under $500, and appropriations 
for specific claims—but none proved entirely satisfactory. 

In 1949, Congress enacted the Surplus Fund-Certified Claims Act (ch. 299, 
63 Stat. 407 (July 6, 1949)), intended to permit payment of claims against 
lapsed appropriations without the need for specific appropriations or 
reappropriations. The statute provided for the transfer of unexpended 
balances remaining after 2 years to a Treasury account designated 
“Payment of Certified Claims.” Funds in this account remained available 
until expended for the payment of claims certified by the Comptroller 
General to be lawfully due and chargeable to the respective balances in the 
account. See B-61937, Sept. 17, 1952. Like the pre-1949 system, this 
arrangement too proved unsatisfactory in that all claims payable from the 
certified claims account, undisputed invoices included, still had to come 
through GAO. 

The system changed again in 1956 (Pub. L. No. 84-798, 70 Stat. 647 (July 25, 
1956)), on the recommendation of the second Hoover Commission.48 One 
of the significant changes made by the 1956 law was to pass the direct 
responsibility for making payments from lapsed appropriations from GAO 
to the cognizant agencies. For the first time, agencies could dispose of 
clearly valid claims against prior year appropriations without the need for 
any action by either Congress or GAO. The statutory evolution is discussed 
in more detail in B-179708, Nov. 20, 1973. 

The 1956 law, which was to remain in effect until late 1990, prescribed 
different procedures for obligated and unobligated balances. The obligated 
balance retained its fiscal year identity for two full fiscal years following 
the expiration date, at which time any remaining obligated but unexpended 
balance was transferred to a consolidated successor account, where it was 
merged with the obligated balances of all other appropriation accounts of 
that department or agency for the same general purpose. These successor 
accounts were known as “M” accounts. Funds in an “M” account were 
available indefinitely to liquidate obligations properly incurred against any 
of the appropriations from which the account was derived. Upon merger in 
the “M” account, the obligated but unexpended balances of all annual and 
multiple year appropriations of the agency lost their fiscal year identity for 
expenditure purposes. 

48 Second Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, created 
by Pub. L. No. 83-108, ch. 184, 67 Stat. 142 (July 10, 1953). 

Page 5-69 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

With fiscal year identity no longer a concern, there was no need to relate a 
payment from the “M” account to the specific balance that had been 
transferred from the particular year in which the obligation had occurred. 
Thus, as a practical matter, once an appropriation balance reached the “M” 
account, the potential for violations of the Antideficiency Act became 
highly remote. B-179708, June 24, 1975. An Antideficiency Act violation 
could occur only if identifiable obligations exceeded the entire “M” account 
balance plus the aggregate of all funds potentially restorable from 
withdrawn unobligated balances. 

The unobligated balances of fixed-year appropriations were “withdrawn” 
upon expiration of the period of obligational availability and were returned 
to the general fund of the Treasury. A withdrawn unobligated balance 
retained its fiscal year identity on the books of the Treasury for two fiscal 
years, during which time it was called “surplus authority.” At the end of the 
2-year period, the balances were transferred to “merged surplus” accounts, 
at which point they lost their fiscal year identity. 

Withdrawn unobligated balances could be restored to adjust previously 
recorded obligations where the amount originally recorded proved to be 
less than the actual obligation, or to liquidate obligations that arose but 
were not formally recorded prior to the appropriations expiration, 
provided that the obligations met one of the criteria specified in 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1501(a) and were otherwise valid. Some cases discussing this restoration 
authority are 68 Comp. Gen. 600 (1989); 63 Comp. Gen. 525 (1984); 
B-236940, Oct. 17, 1989; B-232010, Mar. 23, 1989; B-164031(3).150, Sept. 5, 
1979. 

From the perspective of congressional control, one weakness of the system 
described above was that it permitted the accumulation of large amounts in 
“M” accounts. While agencies were supposed to review their “M” accounts 
annually and return any excess to the Treasury, this was not always done. 
This situation, in conjunction with the previously discussed rules on the 
funding of contract modifications, created the potential for large 
transactions with minimal congressional oversight. For example, a 1989 
GAO report discussed an Air Force proposal, completely legal under 
existing legislation, to use over $1 billion from expired accounts to fund 
B-1B contract modifications. U.S. General Accounting Office, Strategic 
Bombers: B-1B Programs Use of Expired Appropriations, GAO/NSIAD-89209 
(Washington, D.C.: Oct. 5, 1989).

Congressional concern mounted during 1990, and the treatment of expired 
appropriations was changed once again by section 1405 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, Pub. L. No. 101-510, 
104 Stat. 1485, 1675 (Nov. 5, 1990). Section 1405 applies to both military and 
civilian agencies, and includes transition provisions that dealt with the 
then-existing merged surplus and “M” accounts. Unrestored merged 
surplus authority was canceled as of December 5, 1990, with no further 
restorations authorized after that date. The “M” accounts were phased out 
over a 3-year period, with any remaining “M” account balances canceled on 
September 30, 1993. 

3. Expired Appropriation 
Accounts 
The current account closing procedures are set forth in 31 U.S.C. §§ 1551– 
1558. 49 Two of the key provisions provide: 

“On September 30th of the 5th fiscal year after the period of 
availability for obligation of a fixed appropriation account 
ends, the account shall be closed and any remaining balance 
(whether obligated or unobligated) in the account shall be 
canceled and thereafter shall not be available for obligation 
or expenditure for any purpose.” 

31 U.S.C. § 1552(a). 

“After the end of the period of availability for obligation of a 
fixed appropriation account and before the closing of that 
account under section 1552(a) of this title, the account shall 
retain its fiscal-year identity and remain available for 
recording, adjusting, and liquidating obligations properly 
chargeable to that account.” 

31 U.S.C. § 1553(a). 

Just as under the prior system, a 1-year or multiple year appropriation 
expires on the last day of its period of availability and is no longer available 

49 Guidance relating to account closing is also set forth in OMB Cir. No. A-11, Preparation, 
Submission and Execution of the Budget, §§ 20.4(c), 130.3–130.11 (July 25, 2003). See also

to incur and record new obligations. However, the unobligated balance no 
longer reverts immediately to the general fund of the Treasury. 

Upon expiration of a fixed appropriation, the obligated and unobligated 
balances retain their fiscal year identity in an “expired account” for that 
appropriation for an additional five fiscal years. As a practical matter, 
agencies must maintain separate obligated and unobligated balances within 
the expired account as part of their internal financial management systems 
in order to insure compliance with the Antideficiency Act. Also relevant in 
this connection is 31 U.S.C. §1554(a), under which applicable audit 
requirements, limitations on obligations, and reporting requirements 
remain applicable to the expired account. 

During the 5-year period, the expired account balance may be used to 
liquidate obligations properly chargeable to the account prior to its 
expiration.50 The expired account balance also remains available to make 
legitimate obligation adjustments, that is, to record previously unrecorded 
obligations and to make upward adjustments in previously under recorded 
obligations. For example, Congress appropriated funds to provide 
education benefits to veterans under the so-called “GI bill,” codified at 
38 U.S.C. § 1662. Prior to the expiration of the appropriation, the Veterans 
Administration (VA) denied the benefits to certain Vietnam era veterans. 
The denial was appealed to the courts. The court determined that certain 
veterans may have been improperly denied benefits and ordered VA to 
entertain new applications and reconsider the eligibility of veterans to 
benefits. VA appealed the court order. Prior to a final resolution of the 
issue, the appropriation expired. GAO determined that, consistent with 
31 U.S.C. § 1502(b),51 the unobligated balance of VA’s expired appropriation 
was available to pay benefits to veterans who filed applications prior to the 
expiration of the appropriation or who VA determined were improperly 
denied education benefits. 70 Comp. Gen. 225 (1991). See also B-265901, 
Oct. 14, 1997. 

Unobligated balances in the expired account cannot be used to satisfy an 
obligation properly chargeable to current appropriations (50 Comp. 

50 This is similar to the treatment of the balances during the first two post-expiration fiscal 
years under the 1956 legislation. 

51 31 U.S.C. § 1502(b) provides that the expirations of a fixed period appropriation does not 
“affect the status of lawsuits or rights of action involving the right to an amount payable 
from the balance” of such appropriation that are instituted prior to its expiration.

Gen. 863 (1971)), or to any other expired account.52 The authority of 
31 U.S.C. § 1553(a) is intended to permit agencies to adjust their accounts 
to more accurately reflect obligations and liabilities actually incurred 
during the period of availability. 63 Comp. Gen. 525, 528 (1984). However, 
arbitrary deobligation in reliance upon the authority to make subsequent 
adjustments is not consistent with the statutory purpose. B-179708, July 10, 
1975. 

During the 5-year period, the potential for an Antideficiency Act violation 
exists if the amount of adjustments to obligations chargeable to the expired 
account during a year exceeds the adjusted balance available in the expired 
account against which to charge such adjustments. Should this happen, the 
excess can be liquidated only pursuant to a supplemental or deficiency 
appropriation or other congressional action. 73 Comp. Gen. 338, 342 
(1994); 71 Comp. Gen. 502 (1992).53 

4. Closed Appropriation 
Accounts 
At the end of the 5-year period, the account is closed. Any remaining 
unexpended balances, both obligated and unobligated, are canceled, 
returned to the general fund of the Treasury,54 and are thereafter no longer 
available for any purpose. 

Once an account has been closed: 

“[O]bligations and adjustments to obligations that would 
have been properly chargeable to that account, both as to 
purpose and in amount, before closing and that are not 
otherwise chargeable to any current appropriation account 

52 This authority to make obligation adjustments is analogous to the restoration authority of 
the law prior to 1990, with the exception that there is no longer a point at which balances 
merge and lose their fiscal year identity. 

53 Compare B-179708, June 24, 1975 (applying same principle during first two post-
expiration years under prior law). 

54 We commonly talk about “returning” appropriation balances to the Treasury. In point of 
fact, for the most part, they never leave the Treasury to begin with. An appropriation does 
not represent cash actually set aside in the Treasury. Government obligations are liquidated 
as needed through revenues and borrowing. Thus, the reversion of funds to the Treasury is 
not a movement of actual cash, but a bookkeeping adjustment that in the various ways 
discussed in the text, affects the government’s legal authority to incur obligations and make 
expenditures.

of the agency may be charged to any current appropriation 
account of the agency available for the same purpose.” 

31 U.S.C. § 1553(b)(1). 

This is a major exception to the rule previously discussed that current 
appropriations are not available to satisfy obligations properly chargeable 
to a prior year. For example, the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) entered 
into an Economy Act agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE) for 
services that DOE provided through a contractor. DOE funded the service 
from no-year accounts. The final audit of the contractor that was 
performed after the OSM account obligated by the Economy Act agreement 
closed revealed that DOE owed the contractor an additional amount for 
performing services for OSM. DOE asked whether OSM was liable to 
reimburse it for the additional amount under the Economy Act. GAO 
replied that the account closing law required OSM to reimburse DOE the 
additional amounts using current appropriations available for the same 
general purpose as the closed account. B-260993, June 26, 1996. Compare 
B-257825, Mar. 15, 1995 (Treasury properly refused to restore amount of 
canceled “M” account to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
appropriation in order for FAA to reimburse the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) for services provided that were properly 
chargeable to the canceled account. This was true notwithstanding the fact 
that FHWA inadvertently neglected to bill for the services at the time they 
were rendered. GAO pointed out that the law provided that FAA 
reimbursement to FHWA was chargeable to current appropriations). 

The authority to use current year appropriations to pay obligations 
chargeable to closed accounts is not unlimited, however. The cumulative 
total of old obligations payable from current appropriations may not 
exceed the lesser of 1 percent of the current appropriation or the remaining 
balance (whether obligated or unobligated) canceled when the 
appropriation account is closed. 31 U.S.C. § 1553(b). In view of the 
limitations on the amount of current appropriations that may be used to 
pay obligations properly charged to closed accounts, agencies must 
maintain records of the appropriation balances canceled beyond the end of 
the 5-year period and adjust these balances as subsequently presented 
obligations are liquidated. 73 Comp. Gen. 338, 341–342 (1994). Otherwise, 
there is no way for agencies to ensure that payments do not exceed the 
original appropriation.

Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

Because of the need to keep accurate records, agencies may, in limited 
circumstances, adjust their records pertaining to closed appropriation 
accounts. For example, if an agency determines that the balances reflected 
in the records of a closed account are erroneous because of reporting and 
clerical errors, it may adjust its records if it discovers that a disbursement 
actually made before the appropriation account closed and properly 
chargeable to an obligation incurred during the appropriations period of 
availability was either not recorded at all or was charged to the wrong 
appropriation. 

Neither of these types of adjustments constitutes charging obligations 
against or disbursing funds from closed appropriation accounts. They 
represent corrections of the accounting records. Since the appropriations, 
in effect, no longer exist, these adjustments affect only the agency’s 
records. They have no effect on the availability or use of obligated or 
unobligated balances formerly contained in those appropriation accounts. 

U.S.General Accounting Office, Canceled DOD Appropriations: $615 
Million of Illegal or Otherwise Improper Adjustments, GAO-01-697 
(Washington, D.C.: July 26, 2001) at 7. However, adjustments may not be 
made to the records of the balances of closed accounts when the initial 
disbursements: 
1. occurred after the appropriation being charged has already been 
closed, 
2. occurred before the appropriation being charged was enacted, or 
3. were charged to the correct appropriation in the first place and no 
adjustment is necessary. 
Id. at 9–13. 

5. Exemptions from the 
Account Closing 
Procedures 
Congress may, by specific legislation, exempt an appropriation from the 
above rules and may otherwise fix the period of its availability for 
expenditure. 31 U.S.C. §§ 1551(b), 1557. An agency should consider seeking 
an exemption if it administers a program that by its nature requires 
disbursements beyond the 5-year period. One form of exemption simply 
preserves the availability for disbursement of obligated funds. For example, 
section 511 of the Foreign Operations Appropriation Act, 2001, authorized 
that the 2-year appropriation made for “Assistance for Eastern Europe and 
the Baltic States” would remain available until expended if properly 

Page 5-75 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I

obligated before the appropriation would otherwise have expired on 
September 30, 2002.55 

Section 1558(a) of Title 31 of the United States Code provides an automatic 
stay to the closing of an appropriation account under section 1552 when a 
protest is filed against the solicitation for, proposed award of, or award of a 
contract. The appropriation that would have funded the contract remains 
available for obligation for 100 days after a final ruling on the protest. 

To the extent of its applicability, the statutory scheme found at 31 U.S.C. 
§§ 1551–1558 provides the exclusive method for the payment of obligations 
chargeable to expired appropriations. B-101860, Dec. 5, 1963. Thus, there is 
generally no authority to transfer appropriations to some form of trust fund 
or working fund for the purpose of preserving their availability. Id. See also 
31 U.S.C. §1532, which prohibits the transfer of appropriations to a working 
fund without statutory authority. In B-288142, Sept. 6, 2001, customer 
agencies made advances from their fixed period appropriations to the 
Library of Congress for deposit to the credit of the no-year FEDLINK 
revolving fund. The advances were used by the Library of Congress to pay 
the cost of service provided to the agencies by Library of Congress 
contractors. Once the service was provided and the cost determined, the 
Library discovered that some agencies had advanced amounts in excess of 
the cost of the service ordered. We determined that the Library of Congress 
lacked authority to apply the excess amount to pay for orders for service 
placed after the expiration of the fixed period appropriation charged with 
the advance. 

The rules for certain legislative branch appropriations are a bit different. 
The provisions of 31 U.S.C. §§ 1551–1558 do not apply to appropriations to 
be disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives, and the District of Columbia. 31 U.S.C. § 1551(c). For 
appropriations of the House and Senate, unobligated balances more than 
2 years old cannot be used short of an act of Congress. Instead, obligations 
chargeable to appropriations that have been expired for more than 2 years 
“shall be liquidated from any appropriations for the same general purpose, 
which, at the time of payment, are available for disbursement.” 2 U.S.C. 

55 Pub. L. 106-429, app. A, 114 Stat. 1900A-3, 1900A-11 and 1900A-24 (Nov.6, 2001). See also 
Pub. L. No.107-115, § 511, 115 Stat. 2118, 2141 (Jan. 10, 2002). This type of exemption does 
not create new budget authority. B-243744, Apr. 24, 1991. See also U.S. General Accounting 
Office, Foreign Assistance: Funds Obligated Remain Unspent for Years, GAO/NSIAD-91123 
(Washington, D.C.: Apr. 9, 1991), at 21.

§ 102a. See B-213771.3, Sept. 17, 1986. There is no comparable account 
closing procedure currently in effect for the appropriations made to the 
District of Columbia from its local revenues. 

6. No-Year Appropriations There is one important statutory restriction on the availability of no-year 
funds. Under 31 U.S.C. § 1555, a no-year account is to be closed if (a) the 
agency head or the President determines that the purposes for which 
theappropriation was made have been fulfilled and (b) no disbursement has 
been made against the appropriation for two consecutive fiscal years.56 The 
purpose of section 1555 is to permit the closing of inactive appropriations. 
39 Comp. Gen. 244 (1959); B-271607, June 3, 1996; B-182101, Oct. 16, 1974. 

Any attempt by an agency to close a no-year account that does not satisfy 
the requirements of section 1555 is without legal effect and the funds 
remain available for obligation. B-256765, Jan. 19, 1995. An interesting 
example of a misplaced attempt to close a permanent appropriation 
involved the check forgery insurance fund. The check forgery insurance 
fund was established in 1941 to authorize the Treasury to issue and pay a 
replacement check to payees whose original check was lost or stolen 
through no fault of their own and paid on a forged endorsement. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3343 (1994). In the absence of the fund, the payee would have had to wait 
for the government to recover the amount paid on the forged endorsement 
in order to issue a replacement check to the payee. The fund was financed 
by appropriations made to the fund and recoveries of amounts paid on 
forged endorsements (reclamations). 31 U.S.C. §§ 3343(a) and (d) (1994). 
In 1992, the Treasury’s Financial Management Service (FMS) closed the 
fund asserting that it was authorized to do so by 31 U.S.C. § 1555. FMS 
claimed that the fund was inadequate and obsolete and had been impliedly 
repealed by the Competitive Equality Banking Act. 

In response to a request for an advance decision from the Department of 
the Navy, GAO determined that Treasury lacked the authority to close the 

56 Prior to the 1990 amendment to section 1555, no-year appropriations were closed when 
the head of the agency determined that the purpose of the appropriation had been carried 
out or when no disbursement had been made against the appropriation for two consecutive 
fiscal years. Thus the law in effect prior to 1990 prevented no-year appropriations from 
remaining available indefinitely in some circumstances even in the absence of a 
determination that the purpose of the appropriation had been carried out. B-159687, Oct. 25, 
1979.

Availability of Appropriations: Time 

fund. 72 Comp. Gen. 295 (1993). First, GAO determined that nothing in the 
language of the Competitive Equality Banking Act or its legislative history 
reflected the intent by Congress to eliminate the fund. Next, GAO 
determined that the fund was the only appropriation available to pay forged 
check claims. While the volume of forged check claims may have become 
large and exceeded the amount recovered by reclamation that was 
available to cover issuance of the replacement check, the remedy was for 
Treasury to request increased funding, not to cancel the only appropriation 
that was available to make such payments. Finally, GAO determined that 
the purpose for which the fund was established continued to exist and that 
Treasury lacked sufficient justification to close the fund under 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1555. Thus, GAO determined that Treasury should restore the balance to 
the fund and charge all check forgery claims to the fund. Once the fund 
balance was restored GAO recommended that Treasury request sufficient 
appropriations or a permanent indefinite appropriation to pay claims. The 
law was amended in 1995 to make a permanent indefinite appropriation to 
the fund of amounts necessary to issue and pay replacement checks to 
payees whose original check was paid on a forged endorsement. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 3343(a). 

As with fixed appropriations, obligations attributable to the canceled 
balance of a no-year account may be paid from current appropriations for 
the same purpose, and subject to the same 1 percent limitation. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1553(b). 

Like a no-year appropriation, a permanent indefinite appropriation (e.g., 
31 U.S.C. §1304) is not subject to fiscal year limitations. However, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1555 does not apply to permanent indefinite appropriations since the 
“remaining balance” by definition is the general fund of the Treasury. Cf. 
11 Comp. Dec. 400 (1905) (applying a prior version of the account closing 
law to a permanent indefinite appropriation). 

7. Repayments and 
Deobligations 
a. Repayments To prevent the overstatement of obligated balances, the term “obligated 
balance” is defined in 31 U.S.C. § 1551(a)(1), for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 
§§ 1551–1557, as the amount of unliquidated obligations applicable to the 
appropriation, “less amounts collectible as repayments to the 
appropriation.” Once an account has been closed pursuant to either 

Page 5-78 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

31 U.S.C. § 1552(a) or 31 U.S.C. § 1555, collections received after closing, 
which could have been credited to the appropriation account if received 
prior to closing, must be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts. 31 U.S.C. § 1552(b). 

The term “repayment” is a general term referring to moneys received by a 
federal agency that are authorized to be credited to the receiving agency’s 
appropriation and are not required to be deposited in the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts. Treasury Department-General Accounting Office 
Joint Regulation No. 1, Sept. 22, 1950, reprinted at 30 Comp. Gen. 595 
(1950). Section 2 of Joint Regulation No. 1 divides repayments into two 
subcategories: (1) reimbursements for services or items provided outside 
parties that the agency is authorized by independent statutory authority to 
retain and disburse for an authorized purpose57 and (2) refunds of 
overpayments and erroneous payments that the agency is authorized to 
retain and use even in the absence of independent statutory authority.58 

Generally, in the absence of some other authority, when the appropriation 
to be credited has expired, reimbursements must be credited to the expired 
account and not to the current account. For example, reimbursements for 
items or services provided another agency under the Economy Act59 are 
credited to the fiscal year appropriation that earned them regardless of 
when the reimbursements are collected. If the appropriation that earned 
the reimbursement remains available for obligation at the time of 
collection, there is no distinction between a credit to the year earned or to 
the year collected. If, however, the appropriation that earned the 
reimbursement has expired for obligation purposes at the time of 
collection, then reimbursement can be credited only to the expired 
account. B-194711, June 23, 1980; B-179708, Dec. 1, 1975. After closing, the 
reimbursement would have to go to miscellaneous receipts. 

The same treatment is accorded to refunds.60 For example, recoveries of 
amounts paid under a fraudulent contract constitute refunds that may be 

57 These are referred to as “offsetting collections.” OMB Cir. No. A-11, Preparation, 
Submission and Execution of the Budget, §§ 20.3, 20.7(c) (July 25, 2003). 
58 See Chapter 6, section E. 

59 31 U.S.C. §§ 1535, 1536. 
60 OMB Cir. No. A-11, §§ 20.10, 20.12(c) provides additional guidance on the availability of, 
and accounting for, refunds.

deposited to the credit of the appropriations charged with the payments 
until the appropriation account is closed. Once the account is closed, 
recoveries should be deposited to the general fund of the Treasury to the 
credit of the appropriate receipt account. B-257905, Dec. 26, 1995; 
B-217913.2, Feb. 19, 1993. Certain exceptions to these rules have been 
recognized in the treatment of de minimis amounts. For example, we did 
not object to an agency accepting a credit of less than $100 from a vendor 
against the amount owed on a current year obligation to offset an 
overpayment made to the vendor on a prior year obligation without 
adjusting the accounts. 72 Comp. Gen. 63 (1992). See also B-217913.3, 
June 24, 1994. 

b. Deobligations The amount of an obligation that is recorded against appropriations in 
excess of the amount necessary to pay the obligation is accounted for as 
follows: If the agency deobligated the appropriation before the expiration 
of the period of availability, the deobligated amount is available to incur 
new obligations. If an agency deobligates the appropriation after the 
expiration of the period of availability, the deobligated amount is not 
available to incur a new obligation, but is available to cover appropriate 
adjustments to obligations in the expired account. B-286929, Apr. 25, 2001. 
See also 52 Comp. Gen. 179 (1972). 
Deobligated no-year funds, as well as no-year funds recovered as a result of 
cost reductions, are available for obligation on the same basis as if they had 
never been obligated, subject to the restrictions of 31 U.S.C. § 1555. 
40 Comp. Gen. 694, 697 (1961); B-211323, Jan. 3, 1984; B-200519, Nov. 28, 
1980. One early decision concerned the disposition of liquidated damage 
penalties deducted from payments made to a contractor. The Comptroller 
General concluded that, if the contractor had not objected to the deduction 
within 2 years, the funds could be treated as unobligated balances available 
for expenditure in the same manner as other funds in the account, 
assuming the no-year account contained a sufficient balance for the 
discharge of unanticipated claims. 23 Comp. Gen. 365 (1943). There was 
nothing magic about the suggested 2-year period. It was simply GAO’s 
estimate of a point beyond which the likelihood of a claim by the 
contractor would be sufficiently remote. Id. at 367. 

Legislation on rare occasion has authorized an agency to reobligate 
amounts that are deobligated after the appropriation has expired. This 
has been referred to as deobligation-reobligation (“deob-reob”) authority. 
We mention this only to emphasize that deob-reob authority should not be 
confused with the general authority conferred on agencies by the account 

Page 5-80 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

closing law to use amounts freed up as a result of the downward 
adjustment of obligations occurring prior to closing that are now generally 
referred to as deobligated amounts.61 

E. Effect of Litigation 
on Period of 
Availability 
If the entitlement to unobligated funds is tied up in litigation, the statutory 
expiration and closing procedures could come into conflict with a 
claimants right to pursue a claim with the courts. 

Suppose, for example, Congress made an appropriation directing the 
Comptroller General to pay a huge bonus to the editors of this manual. 
Suppose further that the agency refused to make payment because it 
thought the idea economically unsound or just plain ridiculous. Maybe the 
agency would rather use the money for other purposes or simply let it 
revert to the Treasury. The editors of course could sue and would 
presumably be entitled to pursue the suit through the appellate process if 
necessary. But this could take years. If the obligational availability of the 
appropriation were to expire at the end of the fiscal year, the suit might 
very well have to be dismissed as moot. See, e.g., Township of River Vale v. 
Harris, 444 F. Supp. 90, 93 (D.D.C. 1978). What, then, can be done to 
prevent what one court has termed (presumably with tongue in judicial 
cheek) “the nightmare of reversion to the federal treasury”?62 

The answer is two-fold: the equitable power of the federal judiciary and a 
statute, 31 U.S.C. § 1502(b). While the cases discussed in this section 
predate the 1990 revision of 31 U.S.C. §§ 1551–1557 and thus use language 
that is in some respects obsolete, the concepts would appear applicable 
either directly or by analogy to the new procedures. For example, if a court 
could enjoin reversion to the Treasury under the old law, it can presumably 
equally enjoin expiration under the new law. 

The cases establishing the equitable power of the courts involve two 
distinct situations—the normal expiration of annual appropriations at the 
end of the fiscal year and the expiration of budget authority in accordance 
with the terms of the applicable authorizing legislation. For purposes of the 
principles to be discussed, the distinction is not material. See B-115398.48, 

61 See, e.g., B-218762, Sept. 18, 1985 and B-200519, Nov. 28, 1980, for discussions of examples 
of “deob-reob” authority. 

62 Burton v. Thornburgh, 541 F. Supp. 168, 174 (E.D. Pa. 1982).

Availability of Appropriations: Time 

Dec. 29, 1975 (nondecision letter). Thus, we have generally not specified 
which of the two each case involves. 

The concept of applying the courts’ equity powers to stave off the 
expiration of budget authority seems to have first arisen, at least to any 
significant extent, in a group of impoundment cases in the early 1970s. A 
number of potential recipients under various grant and entitlement 
programs filed suits to challenge the legality of executive branch 
impoundments. The device the courts commonly used was a preliminary 
injunction for the express purpose of preventing expiration of the funds. 
For example, in National Council of Community Mental Health Centers, 
Inc.v. Weinberger, 361 F. Supp. 897 (D.D.C. 1973), plaintiffs challenged the 
impoundment of grant funds under the Community Mental Health Centers 
Act. Pending the ultimate resolution on the merits, the court issued a 
preliminary injunction to prevent expiration of unobligated funds for the 
grant programs in question. Id. at 900. 

Other cases employing similar devices to preserve the availability of funds 
are: Maine v. Fri, 486 F.2d 713 (1st Cir. 1973); Bennettv. Butz, 386 F. Supp. 
1059 (D. Minn. 1974); Guadamuz v. Ash, 368 F. Supp. 1233 (D.D.C. 1973); 
Community Action Programs Executive Directors Ass’n of New Jersey, 
Inc. v. Ash, 365 F. Supp. 1355 (D.N.J. 1973); Oklahoma v. Weinberger, 
360 F. Supp. 724 (W.D. Okla. 1973). 

In several of the cases (e.g., National Council of Community Mental 
Health Centers v. Weinberger, Community Action Programs Executive 
Directors Ass’n v. Ash, Bennett v. Butz), the court not only enjoined 
expiration of the funds but directed the agency to record an obligation 
under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a). One of these cases, Bennett v. Butz, spawned a 
decision of the Comptroller General, 54 Comp. Gen. 962 (1975), in which 
GAO confirmed that such an order would constitute a valid obligation 
under 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(6), which says that no amount shall be recorded 
as an obligation unless it is supported by documentary evidence of a 
liability that may result from pending litigation. 

The concept has also been applied in nonimpoundment cases. An example 
is City of Los Angeles v. Adams, 556 F.2d 40 (D.C. Cir. 1977). The Airport 
and Airway Development Act of 1970 established a formula for the 
apportionment of airport development grant funds. The statute also 
established minimum aggregate amounts for the grants, but subsequent 
appropriation acts imposed monetary ceilings lower than the authorized 
amounts. The court held that the appropriation ceilings controlled, but that

the money still had to be apportioned in accordance with the formula in the 
enabling legislation. To preserve the availability of the additional grant 
funds the plaintiff was seeking, the district court had ordered the Federal 
Aviation Administration to obligate the amount in question prior to the 
statutory deadline, and the court of appeals confirmed this as proper. 
Id. at 51.63 

Thus, what we may view as the “first wave” of cases firmly established the 
proposition that a federal court can enjoin the statutory expiration of 
budget authority. Inevitably, the next group of cases to arise would involve 
the power of the courts to act after the funds have expired for obligational 
purposes—in other words, the power of the courts to “revive” expired 
budget authority. 

The “leading case” in this area appears to be National Ass’n of Regional 
Councils v. Costle, 564 F.2d 583 (D.C. Cir. 1977). The plaintiff sued to force 
the Environmental Protection Agency to make available unobligated 
contract authority under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
Amendments of 1972. The court first noted that contract authority is a form 
of budget authority, and when made available for a definite period, 
terminates at the end of that period the same as direct appropriations.64 
The court then reaffirmed the proposition that courts may “order that funds 
be held available beyond their statutory lapse date if equity so requires.” Id. 
at 588. However, the court found the rule inapplicable because the suit had 
not been filed prior to the relevant expiration date, and the court therefore 
did not acquire jurisdiction of the case prior to expiration. The essence of 
the Costle decision is the following excerpt: 

“Decisions that a court may act to prevent the expiration of 
budget authority which has not terminated at the time suit 
is filed are completely consistent with the accepted 
principle that the equity powers of the courts allow them to 
take action to preserve the status quo of a dispute and to 
protect their ability to decide a case properly before them. 
In such situations, the courts simply suspend the operation 

63 The court also noted that the district court could “obtain assistance from the Comptroller 
Generals expertise in matters of expenditures, reductions by appropriations, and 
impoundments.” City of Los Angeles, 556 F.2d at 51. 

64 GAO had previously expressed the same view. 32 Comp. Gen. 29, 31 (1952), cited in Costle, 
564 F.2d at 587 n.10.

of a lapse provision and extend the term of already existing 
budget authority. If, however, budget authority has lapsed 
before suit is brought, there is no underlying congressional 
authorization for the court to preserve. It has vanished, and 
any order of the court to obligate public money conflicts 
with the constitutional provision vesting sole power to 
make such authorizations in the Congress. [Footnote 
omitted.] Equity empowers the courts to prevent the 
termination of budget authority which exists, but if it does 
not exist, either because it was never provided or because it 
has terminated, the Constitution prohibits the courts from 
creating it no matter how compelling the equities.” 

Id. at 588–89. 

Costle is also significant in that it explained and clarified several prior cases 
that had purported to establish a similar, and in one instance even broader, 
principle. Specifically: 

• National Ass’n of Neighborhood Health Centers, Inc. v. Mathews, 
551 F.2d 321 (D.C. Cir. 1976). This was a suit challenging the 
administration of the Hill-Burton Act. The court found that certain 
funds had been improperly used, and directed their recovery and 
reallocation. The court further noted that the district court could order 
that the funds be held available if necessary to prevent their expiration 
upon recovery. However, the Costle court pointed out that the funds in 
Mathews had already been obligated and thus had not expired before 
suit was filed. Costle, 564 F.2d at 588. 

• Jacksonville Port Authority v. Adams, 556 F.2d 52 (D.C. Cir. 1977). The 
plaintiff, in a suit to obtain additional funds under the Airport and 
Airway Development Program, had sought a temporary restraining 
order (TRO) to prevent expiration of the funds, which the district court 
denied. The court of appeals found denial of the TRO to be an abuse of 
discretion and held that, in the words of the Costle court, “relief was 
still available because it would have been available if the district court 
had initially done what should have been done,” that is, grant the 
preservation remedy. Costle, 564 F.2d at 588. A similar case is Wilson v. 
Watt, 703 F.2d 395 (9th Cir. 1983) (reversing the district court’s denial of 
preliminary injunction and directing preservation of funds as 
necessary).

• Pennsylvania v. Weinberger, 367 F. Supp. 1378 (D.D.C. 1973). This was 
an impoundment suit involving the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-10, 79 Stat. 27 (Apr. 11, 1965). 
Noting the then-existing authority of agencies to restore expired 
unobligated balances, the court concluded that it had even broader 
equitable power to order the restoration of expired appropriations. The 
Costle court expressly rejected the broad view that “once it is shown 
that Congress has authorized the restoration of lapsed authority under 
some circumstances then the courts may order the restoration and 
obligation of lapsed authority whenever they deem it appropriate.” 
Costle, 564 F.2d at 589. The Pennsylvania decision was nevertheless 
correct, however, in that a separate statutory provision had extended 
the availability of the funds in question. Costle, 564 F.2d at 589 n.12. A 
case similar to Pennsylvania is Louisiana v. Weinberger, 369 F. Supp. 
856 (E.D. La. 1973). The analog under current legislation would be 
obligation adjustments under 31 U.S.C. § 1553(a). 

Thus, under Costle, the crucial test is not whether the court actually acted 
before the budget authority expired, but whether it had jurisdiction to act. 
As long as the suit is filed prior to the expiration date, the court acquires 
the necessary jurisdiction and has the equitable power to “revive” expired 
budget authority, even where preservation is first directed at the appellate 
level. 

The principles set forth in Costle have been followed and applied in several 
later cases. Connecticut v. Schweiker, 684 F.2d 979 (D.C. Cir. 1982), cert. 
denied, 459 U.S. 1207 (1983); United States v. Michigan, 781 F. Supp. 492 

(E.D. Mich. 1991); Burton v. Thornburgh, 541 F. Supp. 168 (E.D. Pa. 1982); 
Grueschow v. Harris, 492 F. Supp. 419 (D.S.D.), aff’d, 633 F.2d 1264 (8th Cir. 
1980); Sodus Central School District v. Kreps, 468 F. Supp. 884 (W.D. N.Y. 
1978); Township of River Vale v. Harris, 444 F. Supp. 90 (D.D.C. 1978). See 
also Dotson v. Department of Housing& Urban Development, 731 F.2d 
313, 317 n.2 (6th Cir. 1984). 
The application of the Costle doctrine “assumes that funds remain after the 
statutory lapse date.” West Virginia Ass’n of Community Health Centers, 
Inc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1577 (D.C. Cir. 1984). See Heleba v. Allbee, 
628 A.2d 1237, 1240 (Vt. 1992). Consequently, where all funds have 
properly been disbursed (the key word here is “properly”), the Costle 
doctrine no longer applies. Id. To an extent, this gives agencies the 
potential to circumvent the Costle doctrine simply by spending the money, 
as long as the obligations and disbursements are “proper.” Recognizing this, 

Page 5-85 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

the West Virginia Association court cautioned that “we do not mean to 
suggest our approval, in every case, of government decisions to expend 
funds over which a legal controversy exists.” 734 F.2d at 1577 n.8. In 
addition, to prevent this potential loophole from swallowing up the rule, 
there is a logical corollary to the Costle doctrine to the effect that courts 
may enjoin the obligation of funds or even the disbursement of funds 
already obligated where disbursement would have the effect of precluding 
effective relief and thereby rendering the case moot. See City of Houston v. 
Department of Housing & Urban Development, 24 F.3d 1421, 1426–27 

(D.C. Cir. 1994); Population Institute v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062 (D.C. 
Cir. 1986).65 Similarly, the district court’s injunction in Bennett v. Butz, 
quoted in 54 Comp. Gen. 962, supra, included a provision mandating 
retention of the obligated balances until further order of the court. 
When Congress acts to rescind an appropriation, those amounts are no 
longer available to the court for award. City of Houston, 24 F.3d at 1426. It 
does not matter that the court has issued a temporary restraining order 
requiring the agency to set aside funds pending the resolution of the 
plaintiff’s timely filed claim. Rochester Pure Waters District v. EPA, 
960 F.2d 180, 183–84 (D.C. Cir. 1992). A temporary restraining order is not 
binding on Congress, which has “absolute control of the moneys of the 
United States.” Id. at 185. See Harrington v. Bush, 553 F.2d 190, 194 n.7 

(D.C. Cir. 1977). Thus, after Congress has rescinded an appropriation, a 
court may not order a permanent injunction awarding the rescinded funds 
to the plaintiff, as the court cannot order the obligation of funds for which 
there is no appropriation. Rochester, 960 F.2d at 184. 
In addition to the judicial authority in Costle and the cases that follow, 
there is a statute that seems to point in the same direction, 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1502(b), which provides: 

“A provision of law requiring that the balance of an 
appropriation or fund be returned to the general fund of the 
Treasury at the end of a definite period does not affect the 
status of lawsuits or rights of action involving the right to an 
amount payable from the balance.” 

65 The premise underlying all of these cases is that any monetary relief ultimately granted to 
the plaintiff is payable only from, and to the extent of, the preserved balances. See 
Chapter 14 of Volume III of the second edition of Principles of Federal Appropriations 
Law, section entitled “Impoundment/Assistance Funds” for case citations. 

Page 5-86 GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I 


Chapter 5 
Availability of Appropriations: Time 

The statute was enacted as part of a continuing resolution in 1973. Pub. L. 
No. 93-52, § 111, 87 Stat. 134 (July 1, 1973). Its legislative history, which is 
extremely scant, is found at 119 Cong. Rec. 22326 (June 29, 1973), and 
indicates that it was generated by certain impoundment litigation then in 
process. 

For the most part, the courts have relied on their equitable powers and 
have made little use of 31 U.S.C. § 1502(b). Connecticut v. Schweiker cited 
the statute in passing in a footnote. 684 F.2d 979, at 996 n.29. The court in 
Township of River Vale v. Harris, 444 F. Supp. at 94, noted the statute but 
found it inapplicable because the funds in that case would have reverted to 
a revolving fund rather than to the general fund of the Treasury. In 
Population Institute v. McPherson, 797 F.2d at 1081, and International 
Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers 
of America v. Donovan, 570 F. Supp. 210,220 (D.D.C. 1983), the court cited 
section 1502(b) essentially as additional support for the rule that courts 
have the equitable power to prevent the expiration of budget authority in 
appropriate cases. 

Note that the statute uses the words “lawsuits or rights of action.” One 
court has relied on this language to reach a result perhaps one step beyond 
Costle. In Missouri v. Heckler, 579 F. Supp. 1452 (W.D. Mo. 1984), the 
plaintiff state sued the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
for reimbursement of expenditures under the Medicaid program. Based on 
Connecticut v. Schweiker, supra, the court concluded that the plaintiff was 
clearly entitled to be paid. The court then reviewed a provision of the 
Department’s fiscal year 1983 continuing resolution and directed that the 
claims be paid in fiscal years 1984 through 1986. Alternatively, the court 
applied 31 U.S.C. § 1502(b) and held that the claims were payable from and 
to the extent of the unobligated balance of fiscal year 1981 funds. Although 
Missouri had not filed its lawsuit prior to the end of fiscal year 1981, it had 
filed its claims for reimbursement with HHS before then. The court found 
that “Missouri’s right to reimbursement arose when it filed its claims in a 
timely fashion …and otherwise complied with the law and regulations then 
in effect. With this right to reimbursement came the concomitant right of 
action to enforce the claim for reimbursement.” Missouri, 579 F. Supp. 
at 1456. 

The Missouri court further noted that if section 1502(b) is to meaningfully 
preserve the “status” of rights of action, it should also be construed as 
preserving the availability of funds. Id. at 1456 n.4.

The Comptroller General followed a similar approach in 62 Comp. Gen. 527 
(1983). A labor union had filed an unfair labor practice charge with the 
statutorily created Foreign Service Labor Relations Board, based on a 
refusal by the United States Information Agency to implement a decision of 
the Foreign Service Impasse Disputes Panel. The dispute concerned fiscal 
year 1982 performance pay awards for members of the Senior Foreign 
Service. The question presented to GAO was the availability of fiscal year 
1982 funds to pay the awards after the end of the fiscal year. GAO first 
found 31 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(6) (which provides that an obligation may be 
recorded when supported by documentary evidence of a liability that may 
result from pending litigation) inapplicable, then concluded that, by virtue 
of 31 U.S.C. § 1502(b), the unobligated balance of fiscal year 1982 funds 
remained available for the awards. The unfair labor practice proceeding 
was a “right of action,” and the statute therefore operated to preserve the 
availability of the funds. 

Under 31 U.S.C. §§ 1551–1557, funds are “returned to the general fund of 
the Treasury” only when the account is closed, raising the question whether 
section 1502(b) continues to apply to expiration in addition to closing. If 
section 1502(b) is to be construed in light of its purpose, then the answer is 
that expired appropriations will continue to be available to liquidate 
obligations that arise from injunctive relief ordered by a court or agreed to 
by an agency in settlement of a legal dispute. See 70 Comp. Gen. 225, 229– 
30 (1991). In general, section 1553(a) “provides that an expired account 
retains its fiscal year identity and remains available for recording, 
adjusting, and liquidating obligations properly chargeable to that account.” 
(Emphasis in original.) 71 Comp. Gen. 502, 505 (1992). 

However, pursuant to section 1552(a), an appropriation may only be used 
to pay properly chargeable obligations during the period of the 
appropriation’s availability and during the five fiscal years immediately 
following the period of availability. After that, the appropriation account is 
closed and the remaining balance is canceled. 73 Comp. Gen. 338, 342 
(1994). If a valid obligation arises after the appropriation account is closed, 
section 1553(b) authorizes payment of the obligation from current 
appropriations if account records show that sufficient funds remained 
available to cover the obligation when the account was closed by operation 
of law. Id.; 71 Comp. Gen. at 505–506. 

Similar problems exist in the case of bid protests. If a protest is filed near 
the end of a fiscal year and the contract cannot be awarded until the protest 
is resolved, the contracting agency risks expiration of the funds.

Congress addressed this situation in late 1989 by enacting a new 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1558(a),66 which currently reads as follows: 

“(a) …[F]unds available to an agency for obligation for a 
contract at the time a protest …is filed in connection with a 
solicitation for, proposed award of, or award of such 
contract shall remain available for obligation for 100 days 
after the date on which the final ruling is made on the 
protest…. A ruling is considered final on the date on which 
the time allowed for filing an appeal or request for 
reconsideration has expired, or the date on which a decision 
is rendered on such an appeal or request, whichever is 
later.” 

This provision applies to protests filed with GAO, the contracting agency, 
or a court under 31 U.S.C. §§ 3552 and 3556, and to protests filed with the 
General Services Board of Contract Appeals, the contracting agency, or a 
court under 40 U.S.C. § 759(f). 31 U.S.C. § 1558(b). 

66 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, Pub. L. No. 101-189, 
§ 813, 103 Stat. 1352, 1494 (Nov. 29, 1989). The provision applies governmentwide.
