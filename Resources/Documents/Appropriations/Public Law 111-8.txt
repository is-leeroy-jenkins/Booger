without adequate disclaimers regarding the limitations of the data.

    (b) The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shall 
include in all such data releases, language similar to the following 
that would make clear that trace data cannot be used to draw broad 
conclusions about firearms-related crime:

[[Page 123 STAT. 597]]

            (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement 
        authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale 
        and possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies 
        may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons 
        are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not all 
        firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced 
        are used in crime.
            (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for 
        purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of 
        firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected do 
        not constitute a random sample and should not be considered 
        representative of the larger universe of all firearms used by 
        criminals, or any subset of that universe. Firearms are normally 
        traced to the first retail seller, and sources reported for 
        firearms traced do not necessarily represent the sources or 
        methods by which firearms in general are acquired for use in 
        crime.

    Sec. 517. <<NOTE: Audits. Reports. Deadlines.>>  (a) The Inspectors 
General of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science 
Foundation, and the Legal Services Corporation shall conduct audits, 
pursuant to the Inspector General Act (5 U.S.C. App.), of grants or 
contracts for which funds are appropriated by this Act, and shall submit 
reports to Congress on the progress of such audits, which may include 
preliminary findings and a description of areas of particular interest, 
within 180 days after initiating such an audit and every 180 days 
thereafter until any such audit is completed.

    (b) Within <<NOTE: Deadline. Public information. Web posting.>>  60 
days after the date on which an audit described in subsection (a) by an 
Inspector General is completed, the Secretary, Attorney General, 
Administrator, Director, or President, as appropriate, shall make the 
results of the audit available to the public on the Internet website 
maintained by the Department, Administration, Foundation, or 
Corporation, respectively. The results shall be made available in 
redacted form to exclude--
            (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, 
        United States Code; and
            (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the 
        public access to which could be used to commit identity theft or 
        for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.

    (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by this Act 
may not be used for the purpose of defraying the costs of a banquet or 
conference that is not directly and programmatically related to the 
purpose for which the grant or contract was awarded, such as a banquet 
or conference held in connection with planning, training, assessment, 
review, or other routine purposes related to a project funded by the 
grant or contract.
    (d) Any <<NOTE: Certification.>>  person awarded a grant or contract 
funded by amounts appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to 
the Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the Administrator, 
Director, or President, as appropriate, certifying that no funds derived 
from the grant or contract will be made available through a subcontract 
or in any other manner to another person who has a financial interest in 
the person awarded the grant or contract.

    (e) The <<NOTE: Effective date.>>  provisions of the preceding 
subsections of this section shall take effect 30 days after the date on 
which the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in 
consultation with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, 
determines that a uniform set of rules and requirements, substantially 
similar to

[[Page 123 STAT. 598]]

the requirements in such subsections, consistently apply under the 
executive branch ethics program to all Federal departments, agencies, 
and entities.

    Sec. 518. <<NOTE: Human organism.>>  None of the funds appropriated 
or otherwise made available under this Act may be used to issue patents 
on claims directed to or encompassing a human organism.

    Sec. 519. <<NOTE: Torture.>>  None of the funds made available in 
this Act shall be used in any way whatsoever to support or justify the 
use of torture by any official or contract employee of the United States 
Government.

    Sec. 520. <<NOTE: Exports and imports. Firearms. Canada.>>  (a) 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law or treaty, none of the funds 
appropriated or otherwise made available under this Act or any other Act 
may be expended or obligated by a department, agency, or instrumentality 
of the United States to pay administrative expenses or to compensate an 
officer or employee of the United States in connection with requiring an 
export license for the export to Canada of components, parts, 
accessories or attachments for firearms listed in Category I, section 
121.1 of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations (International 
Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR), part 121, as it existed on April 
1, 2005) with a total value not exceeding $500 wholesale in any 
transaction, provided that the conditions of subsection (b) of this 
section are met by the exporting party for such articles.

    (b) The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export license--
            (1) does not exempt an exporter from filing any Shipper's 
        Export Declaration or notification letter required by law, or 
        from being otherwise eligible under the laws of the United 
        States to possess, ship, transport, or export the articles 
        enumerated in subsection (a); and
            (2) does not permit the export without a license of--
                    (A) fully automatic firearms and components and 
                parts for such firearms, other than for end use by the 
                Federal Government, or a Provincial or Municipal 
                Government of Canada;
                    (B) barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or 
                complete breech mechanisms for any firearm listed in 
                Category I, other than for end use by the Federal 
                Government, or a Provincial or Municipal Government of 
                Canada; or

                that United States assistance is not subject to 
                taxation.
            (2) The Secretary of State shall consult with the Committees

        describes the privileges and immunities applicable to United 
        States foreign assistance for such country generally, or an 
        individual agreement between the Government of the United States 
        and such government that describes, among other things, the 
        treatment for tax purposes that will be accorded the United 
        States assistance provided under that agreement.

availability: Provided, That such designated funds that continue to be 
available for an additional fiscal year shall be obligated only for the 
purpose of such designation.

    (c) Ceilings and specifically designated funding levels contained in

Corporation for mortgage foreclosure mitigation activities, under the 
following terms and conditions:
            (1) The <<NOTE: Grants. Waiver authority.>>  Neighborhood 
        Reinvestment Corporation (``NRC''), shall make grants to 
        counseling intermediaries approved by the Department of Housing 
        and Urban Development (HUD) (with match to be determined by the 
        NRC based on affordability and the economic conditions of an 
        area; a match also may be waived by the NRC based on the 
        aforementioned conditions) to provide mortgage foreclosure 
        mitigation assistance primarily to States and areas with high 
        rates of defaults and foreclosures primarily in the subprime 
        housing market to help eliminate the default and foreclosure of 
        mortgages of owner-occupied single-family homes that are at risk 
        of such foreclosure. Other than areas with high rates of 
        defaults and foreclosures, grants may also be provided to 
        approved counseling intermediaries based on a geographic 
        analysis of the Nation by the NRC which determines where there 
        is a prevalence of subprime mortgages that are risky and likely 
        to fail, including any trends for mortgages that are likely to 
        default and face foreclosure. A State Housing Finance Agency may 
        also be eligible where the State Housing Finance Agency meets 
        all the requirements under this 
        paragraph. <<NOTE: Requirements.>>  A HUD-approved counseling 
        intermediary shall meet certain mortgage foreclosure mitigation 
        assistance counseling requirements, as determined by the NRC, 
        and shall be approved by HUD or the NRC as meeting these 
        requirements.
            (2) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance shall only be 
        made available to homeowners of owner-occupied homes with 
        mortgages in default or in danger of default. These mortgages 
        shall likely be subject to a foreclosure action and homeowners 
        will be provided such assistance that shall consist of 
        activities that are likely to prevent foreclosures and result in 
        the long-term affordability of the mortgage retained pursuant to 
        such activity or another positive outcome for the homeowner. No 
        funds made available under this paragraph may be provided 
        directly to lenders or homeowners to discharge outstanding 
        mortgage balances or for any other direct debt reduction 
        payments.
            (3) The use of Mortgage Foreclosure Mitigation Assistance by 
        approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing Finance 
        Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the borrower's 
        financial situation, an evaluation of the current value of the 
        property that is subject to the mortgage, counseling regarding 
        the assumption of the mortgage by another non-Federal party, 
        counseling regarding the possible purchase of the mortgage by a 
        non-Federal third party, counseling and

[[Page 123 STAT. 984]]

        advice of all likely restructuring and refinancing strategies or 
        the approval of a work-out strategy by all interested parties.
            (4) NRC <<NOTE: Certification.>>  may provide up to 15 
        percent of the total funds under this paragraph to its own 
        charter members with expertise in foreclosure prevention 
        counseling, subject to a certification by the NRC that the 
        procedures for selection do not consist of any procedures or 
        activities that could be construed as an unacceptable conflict 
        of interest or have the appearance of impropriety.
            (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing 
        Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall have 
        demonstrated experience in successfully working with financial 
        institutions as well as borrowers facing default, delinquency 
        and foreclosure as well as documented counseling capacity, 
        outreach capacity, past successful performance and positive 
        outcomes with documented counseling plans (including post 
        mortgage foreclosure mitigation counseling), loan workout 
        agreements and loan modification agreements. NRC may use other 
        criteria to demonstrate capacity in underserved areas.
            (6) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to $5,000,000 may be made available to build the mortgage 
        foreclosure and default mitigation counseling capacity of 
        counseling intermediaries through NRC training courses with HUD-
        approved counseling intermediaries and their partners, except 
        that private financial institutions that participate in NRC 
        training shall pay market rates for such training.
            (7) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, 
        up to 4 percent may be used for associated administrative 
        expenses for the NRC to carry out activities provided under this 
        section.
            (8) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance grants may 
        include a budget for outreach and advertising, and training, as 
        determined by the NRC.
            (9) The <<NOTE: Reports. Deadlines.>>  NRC shall report bi-
        annually to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations as 
        well as the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial 
        Services Committee on its efforts to mitigate mortgage default. 
        Such reports shall identify successful strategies and methods 
        for preserving homeownership and the long-term affordability of 
        at-risk mortgages and shall include recommended efforts that 
        will or likely can assist in the success of this program as well 
        as an analysis of any policy and procedures that failed to 
        result in successful mortgage foreclosure mitigation. The report 
        shall include an analysis of the details and use of any post 
        mitigation counseling of assisted borrowers designed to ensure 
        the continued long-term affordability of the mortgages which 
        were the subject of the mortgage foreclosure mitigation 
        assistance.
