    Sec. 772. (a) <<NOTE: Time period. Determinations.>>  The Secretary 
of Agriculture (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall 
carry out a pilot program during fiscal year 2017 with respect to the 
2016 crop year for county-level agriculture risk coverage payments under 
section 1117(b)(1) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 
9017(b)(1)), that provides all or some of the State Farm Service Agency 
offices in each State the opportunity to provide agricultural producers 
in the State a supplemental payment described in subsection (c) based on 
the alternate calculation method described in subsection (b) for 1 or 
more counties in a State if the office for that State determines that 
the alternate calculation method is necessary to ensure that, to the 
maximum extent practicable, there are not significant yield calculation 
disparities between comparable counties in the State.

    (b) The alternate calculation method referred to in subsection (a) 
is a method of calculating the actual yield for the 2016 crop year for 
county-level agriculture risk coverage payments under section 1117(b)(1) 
of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017(b)(1)), under which--
            (1) county data of the National Agricultural Statistics 
        Service (referred to in this section as ``NASS data'') is used 
        for the calculations;
            (2) if there is insufficient NASS data for a county (as 
        determined under standards of the Secretary in effect as of the 
        date of enactment of this Act) or the available NASS data 
        produces a substantially disparate result, the calculation of 
        the county yield is determined using comparable contiguous 
        county NASS data as determined by the Farm Service Agency office 
        in the applicable State; and
            (3) if there is insufficient NASS data for a comparable 
        contiguous county (as determined under standards of the 
        Secretary in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act), 
        the calculation of the county yield is determined using reliable 
        yield data from other sources, such as Risk Management Agency 
        data, National Agricultural Statistics Service district data, 
        National Agricultural Statistics Service State yield data, or 
        other data as determined by the Farm Service Agency office in 
        the applicable State.

    (c)(1) A supplemental payment made under the pilot program 
established under this section may be made to an agricultural producer 
who is subject to the alternate calculation method described in 
subsection (b) if that agricultural producer would otherwise receive a 
county-level agriculture risk coverage payment for the 2016 crop year in 
an amount that is less than the payment that the agricultural producer 
would receive under the alternate calculation method.
    (2) The amount of a supplemental payment to an agricultural producer 
under this section may not exceed the difference between--
            (A) the payment that the agricultural producer would have 
        received without the alternate calculation method described in 
        subsection (b); and
            (B) the payment that the agricultural producer would receive 
        using the alternate calculation method.

    (d)(1) There is appropriated to the Secretary, out of funds of the 
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000, to remain

[[Page 131 STAT. 182]]

available until September 30, 2018, to carry out the pilot program 
described in this section.
    (2) Of the funds appropriated, the Secretary shall use not more than 
$5,000,000 to carry out the pilot program described in this section.
    (e)(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall select 
States to participate in the pilot program under this section so the 
cost of the pilot program equals the amount provided under subsection 
(d).
    (2) To the extent that the cost of the pilot program exceeds the 
amount made available, the Secretary shall reduce all payments under the 
pilot program on a pro rata basis.
    (f) Nothing in this section affects the calculation of actual yield 
for purposes of county-level agriculture risk coverage payments under 
section 1117(b)(1) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017(b)(1)) 
other than payments made in accordance with the pilot program under this 
section.
    (g) A calculation of actual yield made using the alternate 
calculation method described in subsection (b) shall not be used as a 
basis for any agriculture risk coverage payment determinations under 
section 1117 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9017) other than 
for purposes of the pilot program under this section.
    Sec. 773.  None of the funds made available by this Act or any other 
Act may be used--
            (1) in contravention of section 7606 of the Agricultural Act 
        of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 5940); or
            (2) to prohibit the transportation, processing, sale, or use 
        of industrial hemp that is grown or cultivated in accordance 
        with section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014, within or 
        outside the State in which the industrial hemp is grown or 
        cultivated.

    Sec. 774.  Notwithstanding <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  any other 
provision of law, for purposes of applying the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), the acceptable market name of 
Lithodes aequispinus is ``golden king crab.''

that continue to be available for an additional fiscal year shall be 
obligated only for the purpose of such designation.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Suffrage 
Centennial Commission Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) From 1919 to 1920, the Sixty-Sixth United States 
        Congress debated, and State legislatures considered, an 
        amendment to the Constitution of the United States to provide 
        suffrage for women.
            (2) A proposed women's suffrage amendment was first 
        introduced in the United States Senate in 1878 and was brought 
        to a vote, unsuccessfully, in 1887, 1914, 1918, and 1919. 
        Finally, on May 21, 1919, the House of Representatives approved 
        a proposed amendment, followed by the Senate a few weeks later 
        on June 4. Within days, the legislatures of Wisconsin, Illinois, 
        and Michigan had voted to ratify the amendment.
            (3) On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th State to 
        ratify the amendment, providing the support of three-fourths of 
        States necessary under article V of the Constitution of the 
        United States.
            (4) The introduction, passage, and ultimate ratification of 
        the 19th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States were 
        the culmination of decades of work and struggle by advocates for 
        the rights of women across the United States and worldwide.
            (5) Ratification of the 19th Amendment ensured women could 
        more fully participate in their democracy and fundamentally 
        changed the role of women in the civic life of our Nation.
            (6) The centennial offers an opportunity for people in the 
        United States to learn about and commemorate the efforts of the 
        women's suffrage movement and the role of women in our 
        democracy.
            (7) Commemorative programs, activities, and sites allow 
        people in the United States to learn about the women's suffrage

[[Page 131 STAT. 842A-18]]

        movement and to commemorate and honor the role of the 
        ratification of the 19th Amendment in further fulfilling the 
        promise of the Constitution of the United States and promoting 
        the core values of our democracy.
