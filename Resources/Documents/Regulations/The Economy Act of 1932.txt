ECONOMY ACT AGREEMENTS 
FOR 
PURCHASING GOODS OR SERVICES 

1. Description and Requirements. 
The Economy Act of 1932, as amended, 31 U.S.C. § 1535, permits Federal Government agencies 
to purchase goods or services from other Federal Government agencies or other major 
organizational units within the same agency. An Economy Act purchase is permitted only if: (1) 
amounts for the purchase are actually available, (2) the purchase is in the best interest of the 
Government, (3) the ordered goods or services cannot be provided by contract from a 
commercial enterprise, i.e., the private sector, as conveniently or cheaply as could be by the 
Government, and (4) the agency or unit to fill the order is able to provide or get by contract the 
ordered goods or services. 

The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 CFR 17.5 provides further requirements for 
Economy Act agreements. The FAR provides that an order cannot be placed under the Economy 
Act if a more specific statutory authority exists. Purchases pursuant to the Economy Act are not 
exempt from the requirements of 48 CFR 7.3, “Contractor Versus Government Performance.” 
Thus, OMB Circular A-76 applies to Economy Act agreements. 

Economy Act agreement must achieve full cost recovery, and there is no law permits a waiver of 
this full cost recovery requirement. Full cost recovery includes direct and indirect costs. 
Further, the Economy Act does not allow a Federal agency or unit to receive a profit when 
providing goods or services. 

The FAR states that Economy Act orders must include (1) a description of the supplies or 
services required; (2) delivery requirements; (3) a funds citation; (4) a payment provision ; and 

(5) acquisition authority as may be appropriate. 
Further, each Economy Act order shall be supported by a Determination and Finding (D&F). 
The D&F shall state that: (1) Use of an interagency acquisition is in the best interest of the 
Government; and (2) the supplies or services cannot be obtained as conveniently or 
economically by contracting directly with a private source. If the Economy Act order requires 
contracting action by the servicing agency, the D&F shall also include a statement that at least 
one of the following circumstances is applicable: (1) The acquisition will appropriately be made 
under an existing contract of the servicing agency, entered into before placement of the order, to 
meet the requirements of the servicing agency for the same or similar supplies or services; (2) 
the servicing agency has capabilities or expertise to enter into a contract for such supplies or 
services which is not available within the requesting agency; or (3) The servicing agency is 
specifically authorized by law or regulation to purchase such supplies or services on behalf of 
other agencies. 

The D&F must be approved by a contracting officer of the requesting agency with authority to 
contract for the supplies or services to be ordered, or by another official designated by the 
agency head, except that, if the servicing agency is not covered by the FAR, approval of the 
D&F may not be delegated below the senior procurement executive of the requesting agency 


OMB Rules for Intragovernmental Transactions; Economy Act Agreements 

In November, 2006, OMB issued rules on what needs to be in agreements involving the transfer 
of funds between agencies. These rules require that certain financial info be included, as well as 
special provisions addressing termination costs and dispute resolution. 

All Economy Act agreements must now include the following financial data for both agencies in 
an intragovernmental transaction: 

Treasury Account Symbol (TAS), also referred to as the appropriation code 

Business Partner Network (BPN) No. (DUNS# should be used. The DUNS # is necessary in 
order to register the BPN.) 

Business Event Type Code - (BETC) - Generally the codes used will be DISB (for gross 
disbursement) or COLL (for offsetting collection) depending on whether you are the requesting 
or servicing agency. This link contains information on the BETC: 
http://www.fms.treas.gov/gwa/factsheet_betc.html 

In addition, OMB is requiring new cancellation and dispute resolution provisions, which must be 
incorporated into the agreement; see sections 8 and 9.
